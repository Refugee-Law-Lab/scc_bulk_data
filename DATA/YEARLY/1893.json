Decision of the Court of Appeal following that case overruled, but the judgment sustained on the ground that it was proved that no part of the consideration was bon\u00e2 fide. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Chancellor in the first case and affirming his judgment in the second case.\nThe following statement of facts is taken from the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Gwynne:\u2014\n\u201cOn the 28th of January, 1890, the plaintiff, S.F. McKinnon, in the name of S.F. McKinnon & Co., commenced an action by a writ issued from the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario against Danford Roche and the above appellant, Bradford Patterson.\n\u201cOn the 3rd February following the said Danford Roche, at the pressing instance and request of the plaintiff Campbell acting on his own behalf as a creditor of the said Roche, and also on behalf of the plaintiffs McKinnon & Co., other creditors of the said Roche, executed a deed of assignment of all the real and personal estate, effects and choses in action of him the said Roche, for the benefit of his creditors. Upon the 20th of the said month of February the said S.F. McKinnon & Co. filed their statement of claim in the said action, whereby they claimed, on behalf of themselves and of all other creditors of the said Danford Roche, the right to have avoided and declared null a chattel mortgage on a stock of goods of the said Roche in a store of his at Barrie executed by the said Roche to the appellant Patterson, bearing date the 24th of December, 1889, for securing payment to the said Patterson of the sum of $5,000 with interest as therein mentioned, which chattel mortgage was duly registered as required by the statute in that behalf. Such right was claimed upon the allegation and charge that the said chattel mortgage was voluntary and that it was made by the said Roche when in insolvent circumstances and unable to pay his debts in full, with intent to defeat, delay and prejudice his creditors or to give to one or more of them a preference over his other creditors or over one or more of them, and that the said chattel mortgage had the effect of defeating, delaying and prejudicing the creditors of the said Roche.\nTo this statement of claim the defendants Roche and Patterson pleaded separately but substantially to the same tenor and effect. The appellant in his statement of defence averred that the said chattel mortgage was given for a present actual, bon\u00e2 fide advance of money, namely, $5,000, paid by the said Patterson to the said Roche for the purpose of helping and assisting the said Roche in his business and not for the purpose or with intent to defeat, delay or defraud the creditors of the said Roche, and that since the action was commenced, to wit on or about the 5th day of February, 1890, the said Roche had executed an assignment for the general benefit of creditors under ch. 124 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, and thereupon the said Patterson submitted that the said plaintiff McKinnon had no right of action in the matter.\nIssues were joined on these pleadings and afterwards the above statement of claim was amended by the said Campbell being added as a co-plaintiff with the said McKinnon & Co.\nIn other respects the pleadings remained as before, and the case was brought down for trial before the Chancellor of Ontario, together with another action similarly framed between the same parties as plaintiffs and the said Danford Roche and one William Mader as defendants, for the purpose of setting aside another chattel mortgage upon other property executed by the said Roche to the said William Mader. The learned Chancellor in the case of Campbell and McKinnon v. Roche and Patterson pronounced judgment as follows: \u201cThis court doth declare that the chattel mortgage given by the defendant Roche to the defendant Patterson is fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly, and it appearing that pending the trial of this action the goods covered by the said mortgage had been sold with the consent of all parties and $2,500, portion of the proceeds of such sale, had been paid to the defendant Patterson to abide the result of this action, this court doth order and adjudge that the said defendant Patterson do forthwith pay to the said Paul Campbell the said sum of two thousand five hundred dollars with interest from the 14th day of March, 1890, to be dealt with by him as part of the estate of the said Danford Roche, and it appearing that a further sum of $2,500, portion of the said proceeds of said sale, has been deposited to the joint credit of the plaintiff Campbell and said defendant Patterson, this court doth order that the said defendant Patterson do join in all necessary cheques to obtain payment of the same to the plaintiff Campbell, to be dealt with by him in like manner and that the said Campbell do forthwith after receiving the same pay the said several sums of money and interest as aforesaid into court to the credit of this action to abide further order. And this court doth further order and adjudge that the defendants do pay to the plaintiffs their costs of this action forthwith after taxation thereof.\u201d\nFrom that judgment the defendant Patterson appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which court, by the unanimous judgment of all the judges, allowed the said appeal with costs, and adjudged that the action against the appellant, Patterson, should be dis- missed with costs. From that judgment appeal is taken.\nIn the case of McKinnon v. Roche (Mader v. McKinnon in this court) the Chancellor found as a fact that for part of the consideration given by Mader for his chattel mortgage the same could not be upheld against creditors and that the mortgage was, therefore, void as a whole. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Chancellor following Commercial Bank v. Wilson[2]. The defendant Mader appealed.\nMcCarthy Q.C., and McDonald Q.C., for the appellants in Campbell v. Patterson.\nIn determining the validity of a chattel mortgage under the Ontario Act only the statutory definition of preference can be considered and not preference generally.

London and Westminster Discount Co.[7]; In re Johnson[8]; and as to the expression \u201cbon\u00e2 fide,\u201d see Tomkins v. Saffery[9].\nThe learned counsel referred also to Ex parte Taylor[10], following Ex parte Stubbins[11], and Atterbury v. Wallis[12].\nMoss Q.C., and Thomson Q.C. for the respondents.

Whittemore[19].\nMcCarthy Q.C., and McDonald Q C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario I entirely concur, and for the reasons given by Justices Burton and Osler. There was no evidence which would justify the imputation to Patterson of knowledge that \u201cRoche entertained, if he did entertain, any intent, by means of the transaction entered into with Patterson, to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors. There was no evidence sufficient to impute to Patterson knowledge of the insolvency of Roche when the mortgage which is impeached was executed. The imputation of his having had such knowledge seems to rest upon the fact that he was married to a sister of Roche\u2019s mother. There is no evidence that Patterson knew that Roche entertained any intent to apply the money advanced by Patterson in any way that would be a fraud upon or prejudicial to his creditors, or by way of preference of one or more over others, if Patterson\u2019s knowledge of such intent could avoid the mortgage. In Ex parte Stubbins[20], it was held by the Court of Appeal that even under the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, a sale of goods made for money actually paid could not be impeached as a fraud against creditors, upon the ground that the vendees knew that the motive and intent of the vendor in making the sale was to use the purchase money in making a payment to a preferred creditor. Johnson v. Hope[21] is to the like effect in the case of a chattel mortgage executed to secure an actual present loan.\nIn short, there is no evidence, in so far as Patterson can be affected, that the mortgage was executed for any other purpose or with any other intent than that it should operate bon\u00e2 fide by way of security for a present actual, bon\u00e2 fide advance of money made by Patterson, Such a transaction never was avoided under the law as it stood prior to the passing of ch. 124 R.S.O. (1887) the second section of which, under which the chattel mortgage in the present case is assailed, is almost a transcript of the law as it then was; however, ex majori cautel\u00e2 as it would seem, the third section of the same ch. 124 declares such a transaction to be one to which the preceding section, number two, has no application, and which therefore could not be impeached by reason of anything contained in that section.\nWhat Roche\u2019s intent was in entering into the transaction with Patterson appears from the use made by him of the money advanced by Patterson, and the evidence admits of no doubt that the whole of that money was applied by Roche in payment, pro tanto, of the claims of creditors, and four-fifths of the amount in payment of claims of S.F. McKinnon & Co. themselves. Money so paid to creditors, although paid before the date at which the claims became exigible at law, could be assailed, if assailable at all, only as preferential payments to one or more of Roche\u2019s creditors over others, but this section three of the same ch. 124 enacts that nothing in section number two shall apply to \u201cany payment of money to a creditor.\u201d\nNow, whether this provision in the act did or did not, in point of law, authorize a debtor in insolvent circumstances to mortgage his chattel property to raise money for the purpose of enabling him to pay one or more of his creditors in preference to others, the evidence, I think, shows that Roche believed that it did. He does not appear to have concealed anything from the plaintiff Campbell when, upon the 6th of January, 1890, he was urging Roche to make an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. He told Campbell all about the chattel mortgage already executed, and the purpose for which it had been executed, and of the manner in which the money raised upon the security of it had been applied, and that he was endeavouring to effect another loan upon a mortgage of other chattels for the purpose of paying his mother money which he owed her for a loan made by her to him; but whatever may have been his belief as to the construction of the act, and whether that belief was well or ill-founded, and whatever may have been his intent, and whatever the character attached by the law to such intent, none of these considerations can operate to deprive the appellant of a security given to him for an actual present advance of money bon\u00e2 fide made by him, which the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and in my opinion correctly, have found the money received by the mortgage which is impeached to have been.\nMader v. McKinnon.\nIf this case must necessarily turn upon the question whether, where a chattel mortgage is given as security for a sum of money a part of which only was an actual present advance made bon\u00e2 fide by the mortgagee, and \u2022 the balance was in respect of a transaction for which the mortgage could not be sustained against creditors impeaching it, such mortgage could or could not be sustained as good for this bon\u00e2 fide advance, I should be obliged to say that, in my opinion, such a case was not governed by the judgment in the Commercial Bank v. Wilson[22]. That was the case of a judgment by de- fault recovered under the Common Law Procedure Act for an amount exceeding the sum of $2,800, of which sum $2,000 was the amount of a promissory note long previously made, and the balance was in respect of matters for which the judgment could not be maintained, and it was held, under the statute of Elizabeth, that as the judgment could not be sustained for a portion of the amount for which it was recovered it must be held to be wholly void as against the plaintiffs who were judgment creditors impeaching it as a fraud against them. But the statute of Elizabeth upon which that case was decided contains no such exception as that contained in the 3rd sec. of ch. 124, R.S.O., which enacts that nothing in sec. no. 2 of the act shall apply to \u201cany assignment, &c., &c., of any goods or property\u201d &c., &c., of any kind made by way of security for \u201cany present actual, bon\u00e2 fide advance of money.\u201d This language appears to me to be sufficient to validate an assignment, &c., &c., to the extent of any present actual, bon\u00e2 fide advance to secure which the assignment, &c., &c., was given, although as to the residue of the amount covered by the security it could not be maintained. If, then, any portion of the amount to secure which the chattel mortgage in the present case was given could be held to have been a present actual, bona fide advance of money made by the mortgagee, William Mader, I should be of opinion that to such extent the mortgage would be good and valid, although as to the residue it could not be sustained, and that such a case was quite distinguishable from the Commercial Bank v. Wilson22; but I can see no sufficient ground for holding that the transaction involved any actual, bon\u00e2 fide advance made by the mortgagee William Mader, who appears to have placed himself wholly as a puppet in the hands of his brother to be dealt with as the latter pleased, for the purpose of effecting a matter in which William Mader in reality had not and was not intended to have any bon\u00e2 fide interest and in respect of which he was not intended to be subject to any real obligation but to be simply a tool in the hands of his brother, as the learned Chancellor has, and not without sufficient reason, found him to have been. In truth the money obtained from the bank on Pierson\u2019s endorsement of the note which Julien Mader procured his brother William to sign as maker was obtained wholly upon the security of Pierson. It was not the money of William Mader. He never had nor did his brother ever intend that he should have any actual possession and control of the money. It is impossible to hold that William Mader ever did, in truth, make any actual bon\u00e2 fide advance upon the security of the mortgage. In so far as his name was used in the transaction it is all a sham.\nI have arrived at this conclusion apart from all consideration of the question whether Mrs. Roche was or was not a bon\u00e2 fide creditor of her son Danford; that is a question which I do not think it at all necessary to be decided in the present case, and which, therefore, cannot be concluded by the judgment herein.\nThe appeals in both cases must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nNo question was raised in the present cases, and for that reason none has been considered by me in the judgment which I have formed, as to whether the provisions of ch. 124 R.S.O., which profess to vest in an assignee under a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors made by a person unable to pay his debts in full, and so in insolvent circumstances, the power of maintaining an action to avoid, and of avoiding, as fraudulent against creditors a deed which the debtor had previously executed and which he himself could not avoid, are or are not provisions relating to \u201cBankruptcy and Insolvency.\u201d\nAnd whether such legislation by the legislature of the province of Ontario does or does not constitute an encroachment upon the exclusive legislative authority in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency which by the constitution of the Dominion is vested in the Dominion Parliament.\nAnd whether, therefore, such provisions in the said ch. 124 are or are not ultra vires of the provincial legislature. The judgment in the present cases must not be considered as affecting in any way such questions if they should be raised in any future cases.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants and respondents respectively: Bain, Laidlaw & Kappele.\nSolicitors for respondents and appellants respectively: Thomson, Henderson Bell.\n[1] 18 Ont.

In 1891 the report of the referees was brought before the court and judgment was given against the crown for the amount thereby found due. The crown appealed to the Supreme Court, having obtained from the Exchequer Court an extension of the time for appeal limited by statute, and sought to impugn on such appeal the judgment pronounced in 1887.\nHeld, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that the appeal must be restricted to the final judgment pronounced in 1891; that an appeal from the judgment given in 1887 could only be brought within thirty days thereafter unless the time was extended as provided by the statute and the extension of time granted by the Exchequer Court on its face only refers to an appeal from the judgment pronounced in 1891.\nHeld, per Gwynne and Patterson JJ. that the judgment given in 1891 was the only judgment in the suit in respect to the matters put in issue by the pleadings and on appeal therefrom all matters in issue are necessarily open.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada awarding to the suppliants damages to the amount reported by referees under order of the court.\nThe facts of the case, which are fully stated in the judgments of the court, may be summarized as follows:\u2014 The petition of right was filed to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract for the supply of paper to the crown required for use by the various departments at Ottawa. On the trial in 1887 the crown offered no defence and the case was sent to referees to ascertain the damages. A question as to the scope of the inquiry before the referees was raised and decided against the suppliants and an interim report was made to the court, an appeal against which resulted in the ruling of the referees being reversed[1]. In 1891 the referees reported to the court the amount of damages found by them, which report was confirmed and judgment entered against the crown for the said amount.\nThe crown wishing to appeal to the Supreme Court but not having taken the necessary steps within the time limited by statute, an order was made by the Exchequer Court extending the time[2] and the appeal was duly brought. On this appeal the crown claimed the right to impugn, not only the ultimate judgment pronounced in 1891, but also the judgment given on the trial in 1887, and the court directed the question as to the scope of the appeal to be first argued.\nRobinson Q.C. and Hogg Q.C. for the appellant. There was no right of appeal from the original judgment when it was given. Rule 347 of Exchequer Court rules; Danjou v. Marquis[3]; and on appeal from the final judgment the whole case must be open.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and McDonald Q.C. for the respondents referred to Wilson v. Metcalfe[4]; Shaw v. St. Louis[5].\nJudgment was reserved on this question and argument on the merits postponed until it was decided.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by: THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was a petition of right by which Jacob P. Clarke, executor of James Barber, deceased, and John R. Barber, the suppliants, the present respondents, sought to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract entered into by James Barber with the crown for the supply of paper for various purposes to the officers of the Dominion Government at Ottawa. Various defences were pleaded on behalf of the crown. Upon the cause coming on for hearing before the judge of the Exchequer Court on the 14th of November, 1887, the contracts as set forth in the petition of right were admitted by counsel for the crown, and no evidence in support of the defence being offered a judgment was pronounced in accordance with the practice of the Exchequer Court, as prescribed by the 26th sec. of 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, and by the 128th general rule of the Exchequer Court. By this judgment it was ordered and adjudged that it be referred to Robert Cassels, Esq., Q.C., and Brown Chamberlin, Esq., to ascertain and report to the court the items and the particulars of the paper required for departmental and other reports, forms and documents of the civil service departments of the Government of Canada during the periods embraced under the contracts already referred to, furnished or supplied by any person or persons, corporation or corporations, other than the respondents. And, further, to report the profit, if any, which was lost to the respondents by not being permitted or allowed to furnish or supply such paper. And further consideration and costs were reserved.\nAn objection having been made on behalf of the crown to the reception of evidence tendered by the respondents in the course of the reference, and this objection having been sustained by the referees, who thereupon made an interim report dated 18th June, 1888, an appeal was taken by the respondents to the Exchequer Court against that report, whereupon and upon the 20th June, 1890, this appeal was allowed, the decision of the referees was overruled and reversed and the referees were ordered to receive the evidence objected to.\nThe reference then proceeded upon the merits and the evidence objected to having been received the referees made their report bearing date the 8th day of May, 1891. This last report having been appealed against by the crown that appeal was set down to be heard at the same time as the cause on further directions, and both the appeal and the cause on further directions came on to be heard before the Exchequer Court on the 16th of December, 1891, when the court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the report of the referees, and ordered and adjudged that the suppliants were entitled to recover from the crown the sum of $37,990.77 being the amount found by the referees as and by way of damages for the breach of the contracts in the petition of right mentioned.\nThe crown has now appealed to this court and seeks to impugn not the judgment of the 16th December, 1891, but the original judgment of the 14th of November, 1887. This, I am clearly of opinion, it is not open for the crown to do, and that for the reason that the time for appealing against that judgment had long passed before this appeal was instituted.\nThe time for appealing against the judgment of November, 1887, was by the statute limited to thirty days from the day on which the judge had given his decision, and this appeal not having been instituted until the 23rd March, 1892, was, therefore, manifestly too late. The enlargement of time ordered by the judge of the Exchequer Court by his order of the 18th of March, 1892, manifestly and on its face only refers to an appeal from the final judgment of the Exchequer Court pronounced on the 16th December, 1891, whereby the appeal against the referees' final report was dismissed and damages as before mentioned were awarded against the crown.\nIt is quite open to the crown now to proceed with their appeal but it must be restricted to an appeal against the last mentioned judgment. Upon such an appeal it will, of course, be open to the crown to impugn the correctness of the finding of the referees as to the amount of damages, but if they fail on this they must fail altogether since, if the report stands unvaried, the final order of the Exchequer Court declaring that the amount awarded by the referees ought to be paid was of course, and cannot be successfully impeached. I understood the counsel for the crown upon the argument before us to say that they had no objections to offer to the report of the referees, but that they desired to attack the original judgment which, for the reason mentioned, it is, I think, clear they have no right to do.\nIf the crown do not desire now to proceed with the appeal, confining it to an attack upon the report, the appeal may be at once dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal by Her Majesty the Queen, as representing the Government of the Dominion of Canada, against a judgment of the Court of Exchequer pronounced on the 16th December, 1891, in a petition of right instituted at the suit of the respondents as suppliants therein, and the sole question now before us is as to what is open upon such appeal, for until that be decided the hearing of the appeal on the merits has been deferred. The contention upon behalf of the appellant is that everything which was in issue on the petition of right is open upon the appeal, while the contention of the respondents is that there were two other decisions of the Court of Exchequer in the cause embodied in orders of the court of the respective dates of the 14th November, 1887, and the 20th January, 1890, and that there were matters decided by those orders respectively, and among such matters the liability of the appellant to the respondents in respect of the allegations contained in the petition of right which, as those orders were not appealed from, cannot be entertained and inquired into on the present appeal.\nThe suppliants, in their petition of right, alleged that tenders for printing and the supply of printing paper were called for by the Government of Canada in the months of April, 1874, and September, 1879, respectively, and that one James Barber, in reply thereto, made tenders for such work at such respective times, which tenders were accepted by the Government, and that in pursuance thereof the said James Barber in the months of October, 1874, and December, 1879, respectively, entered into two several contracts with the Dominion Government whereby he covenanted with Her Majesty that he should and would well, truly and faithfully and from time to time and when and so often as application or order might be given to him for the same and during the term of five years from the date of the said respective contracts, supply and deliver to the person or persons appointed to take change thereof at Ottawa such quantity or quantities of paper and of such qualities or varieties as might be required or desired from time to time for the printing and publishing of the Canada Gazette, of the statutes of Canada, and of such official and other reports, forms, documents and other papers as might at any time be required to be printed and published, or as might be ordered from time to time by the proper authority therefor according to the requirements of Her Majesty in that behalf. The petition then alleged that on the 19th May, 1880, the said James Barber departed this life whereby he made the suppliant, Jacob P. Clark, to be executor of his last will and testament, and that the suppliant, John R. Barber, a son of the said James Barber, has since the death of his father, the said James Barber, continued the business of paper manufacturer carried on by his father in his life time, and that he, the said John R. Barber, at the request of and on behalf of the said Jacob P. Clark and with the assent of the Government, furnished, supplied and delivered all paper applied for, ordered or required under the last mentioned of the said two contracts. The suppliants then in the 15th and subsequent paragraphs of their petition of right alleged:\n15. Shortly after the said James Barber had entered upon the performance of the said first mentioned contract and during the year 1874, and from time to time during each of the ten years thereafter covered by the said two contracts hereinbefore particularly mentioned, large quantities of paper required during said years for the purposes aforesaid were ordered and obtained from certain individuals and companies other than the said James Barber or your suppliants, without the knowledge or consent of the said James Barber or your suppliants, and without any public notice of tenders therefor and without any order in council authorizing the same and contrary to and in violation of the act respecting the office of Queen's Printer and the public printing, 32 & 33 Vic. ch. 7, to the great and serious loss of the said James Barber and your suppliants.\n16. The said James Barber, and your suppliants after his decease, were at all times ready and willing to furnish, supply and deliver the paper supplied, ordered and obtained as in the last preceding paragraph mentioned.\n17. That profits would have been made and realized by the said James Barber and your suppliants, had they been allowed to furnish, supply and deliver the last mentioned paper. The petition of right then sets forth particulars of some of the paper alleged to have been purchased from other persons which the suppliants claimed should, under the contracts, have been obtained from the said James Barber in his life time and from the suppliants since his decease, and by the 19th paragraph of the petition of right the suppliants\nsubmit that the paper aforesaid should have been ordered from the said James Barber in his life time or from your suppliant Jacob P. Clark, as his executor, after his death, and that by reason of the default in ordering the same the said James Barber in his life time and your suppliant Jacob P. Clark as his executor after his decease, and your suppliant, John R. Barber, as the beneficiary under the said will, have been unlawfully and unjustly deprived of the profits which would have been derived from furnishing and supplying said paper.\nAnd thereupon they prayed for relief.\nTo this petition of right the Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada, by way of defence thereto, in the 4th and 5th paragraphs of his statement of defence alleges as follows:\n4th. Her Majesty's Attorney-General denies that Her Majesty committed any breach of the contracts or agreements for supplying and delivering of the paper for the printing of the Canada Gazette, statutes and orders in council and for pamphlets and other work required by the several departments of the Government of Canada, as in the 15th paragraph of the petition of right is alleged. And Her Majesty's Attorney-General denies that large quantities, of paper required during the said period of the said contracts for the purposes aforesaid were ordered and obtained from certain individuals and companies other than the said James Barber and the suppliants, without the knowledge and consent of the said James Barber or the suppliants and without any public notice of tender therefor, and Her Majesty's Attorney-General states that no persons or companies other than the said James Barber and the suppliants did supply, furnish and deliver any portion of the said paper which by the tenders set out in the first and seventh paragraphs of the said petition and the contracts set out in the fourth and ninth paragraphs of the said petition were to be furnished, supplied and delivered by the said James Barber and the suppliants.\n5th. Her Majesty's Attorney-General alleges, and the fact is, that the said James Barber and the suppliants were not under the said tenders and contracts in the said petition of right set out, entitled to supply, deliver and furnish all the paper required for the printing of the Canada Gazette, the statutes and the orders in council and for pamphlets and other work required by the several departments of the Government of Canada, and it is denied that the said James Barber, in his life time, and the suppliants have been unlawfully and unjustly deprived of the profits which would have been derived from furnishing and supplying the said paper by reason of the said paper having been furnished, supplied and delivered by persons and companies other than the said James Barber and the suppliants.\nBefore it could be adjudged by the court that any breach of the contracts set out in the petition of right had been committed by the Dominion Government, and before, therefore, any judgment could be rendered against Her Majesty upon the issues joined in these pleadings, it is obvious that the issue upon matters of fact must be first determined by evidence in the cause, namely, whether any, and if any what, paper had been, and under what circumstances, purchased by the Government from other persons than the said James Barber and the suppliants during the periods mentioned. Upon this fact being ascertained then would arise the question of law raised, namely, whether such paper was paper the procuring of which from other persons than the said James Barber and the suppliants constituted a breach by the Government of the contracts set out in the petition of right. Now, before any evidence was taken in the cause the order of the 14th November, 1887, was made by the court, whereby it was ordered:\nThat it be referred to. Robert Cassels and Brown Chamberlin to ascertain and report to this court, giving items and particulars, what, if any, paper for the printing and publishing of the Canada Gazette, of the statutes of Canada and of such official, departmental and other reports, forms, documents and other papers as have been required by the several Departments of the Government of Canada were, during the periods embraced by the contracts in the fourth and ninth paragraphs of the petition of right herein set forth, furnished or supplied by any person or persons, corporation or corporations other than James Barber in the said contracts mentioned, or the above named suppliants\u2014to ascertain and report what profit, if any, was lost to the said James Barber, in his life time, or to the said suppliants since his decease, by not being permitted or allowed to furnish or supply the said paper, if any, furnished or supplied by any person or persons, corporation or corporations, other than said James Barber or said suppliants; and to report any special circumstances that may be deemed necessary. And that the further consideration of this cause and the costs do stand over until the referees shall have made their report with liberty to either party to apply.\nWhatever may have been intended by this order we can judge of it only by the terms in which it is expressed, and to my mind it is very clear that it contains no adjudication whatever upon any of the issues raised by the pleadings in the cause. It treats as a matter of fact, yet unascertained, whether any, and if any what, quantity of paper and of what value had been, during the periods named, procured by the Dominion Government from any person or persons other than James Barber and the suppliants. Until that matter of fact should be ascertained no judgment could be rendered in the cause, and if it should be found in the negative judgment must have been rendered for the respondent in the petition of right dismissing the petition. The reference, therefore, would seem to have been made under section 26 of 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, for the purpose of enabling the referees to take the evidence in the cause with a view to their reporting to the court their finding upon the matters of fact upon which the suppliants rested their claim to have a judgment rendered in their favour, and as that was a point necessary to be determined preliminary to the rendering of judgment upon the issues joined the respondent in the petition of right had no occasion to appeal against an order which adjudicated nothing to the respondent's prejudice in the suit.\nThe referees having proceeded to take evidence under that order the suppliants tendered certain evidence to the reception of which the now appellant objected upon the contention that it did not relate to paper which was covered by the contracts. In this view the referees concurred and they made their certificate to that effect. Upon the matter being brought before the court an order was made by the court whereby it was ordered that the said certificate be remitted back to the referees to report to the court their reasons for their ruling and any evidence on which the same was founded or which might tend to explain the contract. With this order the referees complied and thereupon the order of the 20th January, 1890, was made by the court whereby the certificate of the referees was set aside and it was ordered by the court:\nThat the said referees do, upon the reference made to them by the order of this honourable court on the 14th day of November, 1887, admit without any such limitation as is in such certificate mentioned all evidence that may be tendered by the suppliants of the purchase by the crown, from parties other than the contractor, of paper for the printing and publishing of such official, departmental and other reports, forms, documents and other papers as have been required by the several departments of the Government of Canada during the period embraced by the contracts in the fourth and ninth paragraphs of the petition of right, and that the costs of and incidental to the said appeal be costs in the cause to the successful party.\nNow, this order does not, any more than did that of the 14th November, 1887, adjudicate anything upon any matter upon which issue was joined between the parties in the suit. It did not in its terms conclude or decide anything as to the liability of the respondent to the suppliant in respect of the matters in issue. It simply referred back the matter to the referees under the order of the 14th November, 1887, with directions to them to take all the evidence which should be tendered by the suppliants under that order. It decided nothing whatever as to what the result should be upon the evidence being taken and the report thereof being made to the court. That nothing further was intended to be decided by the order of the 20th January, 1890, appears from the fact that the costs of it were reserved as costs in the cause and to the successful party therein, a point which could only be determined when, upon all the evidence being taken and considered by the court, the whole question as to the liability of the respondent upon the law and the evidence bearing upon the issues raised should be decided by the court.\nThe referees accordingly proceeded under this order and took all the evidence tendered by the suppliants and made their report as directed by the order of the 14th November, 1887. Upon this report coming up before the court the judgment now appealed from was rendered and thereby the court ordered and adjudged that the suppliants are entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $37,990.77 with costs. This is the first and only judgment in the suit in respect of the matters put in issue by the pleadings or which adjudges the now appellant to be liable in any respect to the suppliants; and as it is the only decision in the suit which fixes the now appellant with any liability to the suppliants it is the only decision in the suit the now appellant had any occasion to appeal against.\nThe provision of law as to appeals from judgments of the Exchequer Court is contained in sections 51 and 53 of 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, namely:\nAny party to a suit in the Exchequer Court who is dissatisfied with the decision therein may appeal, etc.\nNow, while I am of opinion that these words \"the decision therein\" can mean nothing but the final judgment therein, I am also of opinion that, however that may be, as there is no decision in the suit here which adjudicates upon and decides the matters put in issue by the pleadings in the suit other than the judgment and decision embodied in the order of 16th December, 1891, upon an appeal from that judgment all the matters which were put in issue by the pleadings in the cause are necessarily open.\nIt may be that these matters are concluded by authority; whether they are or are not is one of the questions to be raised by the appeal and it cannot be determined until the appeal is heard upon the merits.\nPATTERSON J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nAppeal dismissed with costs unless the crown signified its intention to proceed with it as restricted.\nSolicitors for appellant: O' Connor, Hogg & Balderson.\nSolicitors for respondents: MacLaren, MacDonald, Merritt & Shepley.\n[1] 2 Ex.

[1887] c. 184) requires, by sec. 293, that before the final passing of a by-law requiring the assent of the ratepayers a copy thereof shall be published in a public newspaper either within the municipality or in the county town or published in an adjoining local municipality. A by-law of the township of South Norwich was published in the village of Norwich, in the county of Oxford, which does not touch the boundaries of South Norwich, but is completely surrounded by North Norwich which does touch said boundaries.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that as the village of Norwich was geographically within the adjoining municipality the statute was sufficiently complied with by the said publication.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Galt C.J., who quashed a by-law of the township of South Norwich as being ultra vires.\nThe by-law in question was passed under the Ontario act 53 Vic. ch. 56 known as the Local Option Act, sec. 18 of which enacts that:\n2. \u201cThe council of every township, city, town and incorporated village, may pass by-laws for prohibiting the sale by retail of spirituous, fermented or other manu- factured liquors, in any tavern, inn or other house or place of public entertainment, and for prohibiting altogether the sale thereof in shops and places other than houses of public entertainment: Provided that the by-law, before the final passing thereof, has been duly approved of by the electors of the municipality in the manner provided by the sections in that behalf of the municipal act; Provided, further, that nothing in this section contained shall be construed into an exercise of jurisdiction by the legislature of the province of Ontario beyond the revival of provisions of law which were in force at the date of the passing of the British North America Act, and which the subsequent legislation of this province purported to repeal.\u201d\nThe provision of the Municipal Act R.S.O. (1887) ch. 184, relating to the passing of by-laws by a municipality is sec. 293 which provides that:\n\u201cThe council shall, before the final passing of the proposed by-law, publish a copy thereof in some public newspaper, published either within the municipality, or in the county town, or in a public newspaper published in an adjoining local municipality.\u201d\nThe by-law in question was published in the Norwich \u201cGazette,\u201d a newspaper published in the village of Norwich, an incorporated village which is not within the municipality of South Norwich but in the county of Oxford which does not adjoin South Norwich, there being another municipality intervening. The plaintiff Huson moved to quash the by-law on the grounds that it was really a prohibitory measure which only the Dominion Parliament could enact and that it was void for irregularity in not being published as the act requires. The motion was heard before Galt C.J. who quashed the by-law on the first ground, namely, that it was ultra vires. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment holding the by-law intra vires and refusing to give effect to the technical objection. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court.\nThe court directed the question as to the validity of the by-law in view of the manner in which it was published to be first argued and the constitutional question to stand over until the other was decided.\nRobinson Q.C. and Du Vernet for the appellant. The statute is imperative in requiring publication in a certain manner which must be strictly followed. Simpson v. Corporation of Lincoln[2]; Fenton v. Corporation of Simcoe[3]; Gibson v. United Counties of Huron and Bruce[4]; In re Armstrong and City of Toronto[5]; Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. City of Ottawa[6].\nMcLaren Q.C. and Titus for the respondents. The non-publication under the act has not been affirmatively shown and cannot be urged. In re Lake and Prince Edward[7]; In re White and Corporation of Sandwich East[8]; Lafferty v. Stock[9].\nIt is in the discretion of the court to quash or not and they will not quash for irregularity if it appears that all the votes were polled and the object of publication secured. See In re Revell and Corporation of Oxford[10]; In re Gallerno and Township of Rochester[11]; Boulton and Town Council of Peterboro\u2019[12].\nThe court only proceeds under the statutes and does not exercise a common law power. Re Boulton and Peterboro\u201912; Sutherland v. Municipal Council of East Nissouri[13].\nRobinson Q.C. in reply. That the common law power can still be exercised in quashing by\u2011laws, see Hill v. Walsingham[14]. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Upon the point as to the validity of the by-law, which was fully argued and upon which judgment was reserved, I am of opinion that the respondents are entitled to our judgment. The publication of the advertisement in the Norwich \u201cGazette,\u201d a newspaper published in the village of Norwich, was in my opinion, as the Court of Appeal have held, a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the statute. The enactment requiring publication is as follows[15]:\u2014\nThe Council shall, before the final passing of the proposed by-law, publish a copy thereof in some public newspaper either within the municipality or in the county town, or in a public newspaper published in an adjoining local municipality.\nI am of opinion that we may safely hold the village of Norwich to be in an adjoining local municipality. It is what may be called an enclave in the township municipality of North Norwich, which latter township is in the strictest sense within the municipality adjoining that of South Norwich. Now, what the legislature had in view in requiring publication in a newspaper published in an adjoining municipality was to ensure the insertion of the advertisement in a paper published in the near neighbourhood of the municipality whose ratepayers were to be called on to vote, a purpose with which the contiguity of municipal jurisdictions had nothing whatever to do, and inasmuch as in a geographical sense the Norwich \u201cGazette\u201d was published within the limits of the adjoining township of North Norwich, I think the statute was sufficiently complied with.\nThe word \u201cadjoining\u201d although in some criminal cases it has been very strictly construed, has yet in other cases received a wider and more liberal construction.\nI refer to the cases of London & South Western Railway Co. v. Blackmore[16]; Hobbs v. Midland Ry. Co.[17]; Coventry v. London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co.[18]; Hooper v. Bourne[19]; Harrison v. Good[20], and Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dict.[21]\nThe objection to the by-law must, therefore, be overruled, and the argument of the appeal must proceed upon the constitutional question which the appellants raised.\nObjections to validity of by-law over-ruled and argument ordered to proceed upon the constitutional question.\nSolicitors for appellant: Du Vernet & Jones.\nSolicitors for respondents: O\u2019Donohoe, Titus & Co.\n[1] 19 Ont.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nAssessment and taxes\u2014Insurance co.\u2014Net profits\u2014Reserve fund\u2014Deposit with Government for protection of policy-holders.\nThe amount deposited by an insurance company with the Dominion Government for protection of policy-holders may properly be deducted from the gross income of the company in ascertaining the net profits liable to taxation under the assessment law of the city of St. John (53 V. c. 27 s. 125 [N.B.])\nThe act requires the agent or manager of such company to furnish the assessors each year with a statement under oath, in a prescribed form, showing the gross income for the year preceding and the amount of certain specified deductions, the difference to be the net income, and if such statement is not furnished the assessors may assess according to their best judgment. W. furnished a statement in which, in place of the deductions of one class specified, he inserted, \"an amount, equal to 75 per cent of the premiums received, as deposited with the Dominion Government for security to policy-holders,\" The assessors disregarded this statement and assessed the company in an amount fixed by themselves, and on application for certiorari to quash such assessment it was shown by affidavit that the deposit of the company was equal to about 75 per cent of the premiums.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the court below, Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting, that the agent was justified in departing from the form prescribed to show the true state of the company's business; that the deposit was properly deducted; and that the assessors had no right to disregard the statement and arbitrarily assess the company as they saw fit. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing a writ of certiorari to quash the assessment upon the net profits of the Standard Life Assurance Company.\nThe appellant is agent at the city of St. John for the said company, and was assessed as such under 52 Vic. c. 27, s. 126, upon the net profits made by him as such agent during the year 1891. By the act the agent was required to furnish the assessors with a statement, in a prescribed form, showing the total receipts and specified deductions therefrom for payment of reinsurance, matured claims, &c., the difference to be the net profits. The appellant furnished a statement, in which he substituted for payment of matured claims an amount equal to 75 per cent of the premiums received, as deposited with the Dominion Government as security to policy-holders, as required by the Insurance Act[1]. The assessors classed this amount with the net profits and assessed the appellant accordingly, and a writ of certiorari to quash the assessment was refused on the authority of Ex parte Fairweather when the same question was before the court and decided in favour of the assessment.\nThe present appeal is from the refusal to grant a certiorari, and the only question to be decided is: Is the amount deposited by an insurance company for the protection of policy-holders, as required by the Insurance Act, a part of the profits of the company?\nWeldon Q.C., and Bruce Q.C., for the appellant. As to what are to be considered net profits see Caine v. Horsfall[2].\nThe latest case is New York Life Assurance Co. v. Styles[3], in which the case relied upon by the respondent. Last v. London Assurance Co.[4], is distinguished. See also Gresham Life Assurance Soc. v. Styles[5]; Kingston v. Canada Life[6].\nJack Q.C. for the respondent. The agent in his statement departed so widely from the prescribed form as to entitle the assessors to disregard it. See Ex parte Stanford[7].\nThe form shows that the deductions were to consist only of moneys paid out by the company over which they entirely ceased to have any control.\nAs to whether or not this money is net profits see Last v. London Assurance Co. (1); Russell v. Town and County Bank[8]; Forder v. Handyside[9]; Imperial Continental Gas Association v. Nicholson[10]; Coltness Iron Co. v. Black[11].\nBruce Q.C. in reply. As to variation from form see Thomas v. Kelly[12]; Kelly v. Kellond[13]; C. S. N. B. c. 118 s. 1 s.s. 16.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have read the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Patterson, and for the reasons stated by him I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I think the assessors took the proper course.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I also dissent, and adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice King in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal involves the construction of a statute of the Province of New Brnswick, 52 Vic. ch. 27. Reading it as applying to Life Insurance Companies, with which alone we are at present concerned, it enacts as follows:\u2014\nSec. 126. The agent or manager of any Life or Accident Insurance Company, whether incorporated or not, doing business abroad or out of the limits of this Province, who shall carry on any such insurance business within the city of St. John or who shall have an office or place of business in the city of St. John for any such company or corporation, shall be rated and assessed upon the amount of net profits made by him as such agent or manager from premiums received on all insurances effected by him at the office or agency.\nThe subjects thus proposed to be assessed are the net profits realized by the company from the business transacted at their St. John office. The Standard Life Insurance Company, the one affected, is a company established in Scotland, having its head office in Edinburgh, and its chief office for the Dominion of Canada in Montreal. By the Canada Insurance Act, ch. 124, R.S.C., the company was obliged, as are all Life Insurance Companies formed or incorporated out of Canada and doing business in Canada, to take out a license from the Dominion Government to carry on such business, renewable from year to year, for which upon its first being issued the company was required by the statute to deposit and did deposit with the Government the sum of $100,000 in securities of the character mentioned in the statute, by way of security to the holders of policies issued in Canada. It is enacted by the statute that such securities are to be estimated at their market value at the time of their being deposited, and that if any should fall below such market value the company may be required to make a further deposit so that the market value of all the securities shall always be equal to the sum of $100,000.\nThe statute further enacts that every such company shall make annual statements under the oath of its chief agent of the condition of its Canada business in forms to be furnished to the company by a Government officer called the Superintendent of Insurances, and that the company shall also make annual statements in a separate schedule of its general business in such form as such company is required by law to furnish to the Government of the country in which its head office is. Towards defraying the expenses of the office of the superintendent the company is further required to pay annually a sum in proportion to the gross premiums received by it in Canada during the previous year, for the purpose of realizing from all the companies together a sum not exceeding $8,000. The statute then declares that the assets within Canada of a company formed or incorporated elsewhere than within Canada shall be taken to consist of all deposits which the company has made with the Government under the provisions of the statute and of such assets as have been vested in trust for the company for the purposes of the statute in two or more persons resident in Canada, appointed by the company and approved by the Government. Then the statute provides that if it should appear from the annual statements, or from an examination by the superintendent, which he was authorized to make, of the affairs and condition of the company, that its liability to policy-holders in Canada, including matured claims and the full reserve or reinsurance value for outstanding policies after deducting any claim the company may have against such policies, exceeds its assets in Canada, including the deposit in the hands of the Government, the company shall be required to make good the deficiency. Then once in every year, or oftener in the discretion of the Government, the superintendent is required to value, or to procure to be valued under his supervision, the Canadian policies of all Life Insurance Companies licensed to transact business in Canada, and that such valuation shall be based on the mortality table of the Institute of Actuaries of Great Britain and on a rate of interest at per cent per annum, and that if the reserve necessary to be held by the company in order to cover its liability to policy-holders in Canada, as calculated by the company, should fall materially below that as calculated on the above basis by the superintendent then the amount as calculated by the superintendent shall be substituted in the annual statements of the assets and liabilities of the company.\nNow, it has been testified upon oath in the present case, and not disputed and, therefore, I take it as admitted or established as a fact, that to meet the requirements of the above Dominion statute and to create the reserve fund necessary to be held to cover the company's liability to its policyholders in Canada 75 per cent of all the premiums received in any year upon all the policies issued in Canada is necessary to be appropriated to the creation and maintenance of such reserve fund. This being so it is obvious that no part of the premiums so required to be appropriated to the maintenance of such reserve fund can constitute net profits of the company and there is nothing to the contrary in Last v. London Assurance Corporation[14], or in any of the cases cited. We must, therefore, as it appears to me, proceed upon this basis as an incontrovertible proposition and as a first principle to be adopted in any calculation made for the purposes of the New Brunswick statute under consideration of the net profits, if there be any realized by the company from the premiums received at its St. John office in any year, that such 75 per cent of such premiums must of necessity be treated as appropriated and set apart for such reserve fund before the amount under the name of net profits the New Brunswick act subjects to taxation can by possibility be arrived at. To assist the assessors in arriving at this amount so made liable to assessment the statute enacts that:\u2014\nThe better to enable the assessors to rate such company under this section the agent or manager shall, on or before the first day of May in each year, furnish to the assessors a true and correct statement in writing under oath in form in the schedule E as appended to this Act setting forth the whole amount of gross income and the particulars of the deductions and losses claimed therefrom and showing the ratable net profits made by such company within said city during the fiscal year last preceding.\nThe form given under schedule E is as follows:\u2014\nWhole amount of gross income received in cash for premiums for life or accident policies (including all life, short term endowment or tontine) issued or renewed during the fiscal year of the company next preceding the first day of April at the agency of the company at the city of St. John ............................................................................\nAmount of bills and notes taken for premiums for life or accident policies (including all life, short term endowment or tontine) issued or renewed during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April at the agency in St. John ............................................................................\nDEDUCTIONS.\nReinsurance, rebate, return premiums, surrender values and bonuses actually paid during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April, on all life or accident policies issued at the agency of the company in the city of St. John..................\nAmount paid during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April on matured claims whether by death or otherwise (deducting reinsurance if any), on life and accident policies issued at the agency of the company in the city of St. John............................................................................\nAgency commission on net premiums received during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April, at the agency of the company in the city of St. John.....................................................\nFees of medical officers, salaries of canvassing agents and travelling expenses actually paid during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April, on business connected with the agency of the company in the city of St. John..............................\nOffice expenses of the agency at the city of St. John, for the fiscal year preceding the first day of April................................\nAmount of net profits................................................ The agent of the company at St. John made a statement in the above form with an additional item inserted by him for appropriation of premiums for reserve fund for the protection of policy-holders.\nFor total income received from premiums during the year he inserted the total sum of $20,183.23.\nOpposite the first of the above items of deductions, without saying how much for any and which of the particular subjects therein mentioned, he inserted the sum of $11,606.79.\nOpposite the second item he inserted nothing but substituted therefor underneath the item the additional item of\u2014\n75 per cent of premiums deposited with the Government, for the protection of policy-holder\n$15,146.57\nOpposite the third of the above items he inserted the sum of\n$1,171.23\nOpposite the fourth of the above items he inserted the sum of\n1,009.16\nAnd opposite the words \"amount of net profits,\" he inserted \"none.\"\nThis statement he verified under oath, in form in schedule E as required by the statute, to be full, true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.\nThis statement under oath made by the agent setting forth the whole amount of gross income received by him for premiums within the year and the particulars of deductions therefrom claimed by the company was required, as appears by the express terms of the statute, for the purpose of enabling the assessors to discharge their duty of arriving as accurately as possible at the true amount of net profits, if any, realized within the year from the premiums received at the St. John office. The statute further required the agent to answer under oath such inquiries as the assessors might deem it to be necessary to make to him relating to the said statement made by him, for the like purpose of assisting them in making their assessment for the just and true amount of such net profits. They did not avail themselves of this power of making any inquiries of the agent relating to his statement, but having before them his statement upon oath they utterly disregarded the item inserted by him for 75 per cent of the premiums as an appropriation for the maintenance of the reserve fund and assessed the company, through their agent, for the sum of $6,300 as the amount of net profits realized by the company from the premiums received at their St. John office during the fiscal year terminating the 1st April, 1891.\nHow precisely they arrived at this amount we are not informed further than that they expunged and disregarded altogether the item of 75 per cent of the premiums for the reserve fund for the protection of policy-holders; and, in as far as we can see, what they did was to add together the three items of $11,606.79 and $1,171.23 and $1,009.16 amounting to the sum of $13,787.18 which they deducted from the sum of $20,183.23 whereby they found a balance of $6,396.05 from which they arbitrarily struck off the odd $96.05 and in this manner they arrived at the sum of $6,300 which they treated as net profits realized by the company out of their St. John business and as such rated them therefor through their agent.\nNow the material questions which arise are:\u2014\n1st. Was it or was it not competent for the agent of the company, in the statement made by him for the purpose of setting forth the amount of deductions claimed by the company to be made from the total amount received during the year at their St. John office, and of thus showing the amount, if any there was, of \"net profits made by the company within said city during the fiscal year last preceding\" (in the words of the statute), to insert the claim which he did for the proportion of premiums as absolutely necessary to be appropriated to the purpose of maintaining in perfect efficiency, as required by the Dominion Statute, the reserve fund to be held and maintained by the company to cover its liability to policy-holders in Canada?\n2nd. Was it proper or competent for the assessors, when estimating the net profits made by the company during the year at their St. John office, to expunge wholly from their consideration an item so necessary to be taken into account for the purpose of arriving, with any degree of accuracy, at the true amount of net profits, if any, made at said office during the year?\nIn my opinion the former of these questions must be answered in the affirmative and the latter in the negative.\nThe form in schedule E must, I think, be regarded as intended to be merely a specimen or sample of the mode in which the agent should set forth the deductions claimed by the company, and as best calculated to show with accuracy whether in truth any net profits were made at this office in the fiscal year preceding, and the amount, if any, of such net profits. If the items in respect of which the deductions were provided for in the form given in the schedule E did not comprehend an item in respect of which the company claimed a deduction, and which was necessary to be considered in an inquiry whether there were or not any net profits made, and if any to what amount, such item, as it appears, must of necessity be supplied in order to enable the assessors to discharge their duty of arriving at the truth in such inquiry and to prevent their falling into manifest error.\nSo if there was any item mentioned in the form in schedule E, in respect of which money had been paid by the company, but which should not properly be, and for that reason was not claimed by the company to be, deducted from the annual premiums received, upon an inquiry whether there were any, and if any, what amount of net profits realized within the year from such premiums, the statute cannot, I think, be construed as not permitting the agent of the company so to frame his statement as to omit any claim in respect of such item, and to substitute for such item another not mentioned in the form in schedule E, in respect of which the company did make a claim and which was absolutely necessary to be taken into consideration upon the inquiry into the amount of net profits, if any were made within the year from the premiums received. What the agent of the company did was to decline to make any claim for \"amount paid during the fiscal year on matured claims,\" and to insert, instead of a claim upon that item, a claim of 75 per cent of the premiums received as a necessary appropriation to a reserve fund for the protection of policy-holders. For this action he had, in my opinion, a most sufficient reason, even assuming that a large sum may have been paid within the year on matured claims, namely, that for the purpose of determining with truth whether any net profits were made within the year from the premiums received by him within the year the company did not claim, nor was it proper that they should claim, any deduction from such premiums in respect of payments made by the company for matured claims, because matured claims were payable and paid out of the reserve fund then already realized from the premiums received in previous years and the investment thereof; but, in lieu of such item of deduction, the agent claimed for the company, as a proper deduction, the proportion of the annual premiums absolutely necessary to be appropriated for the purpose of maintaining in efficiency that reserve fund for the payment of claims, as they should mature. This alteration in, and deviation from, the form given in schedule E was calculated to assist the assessors in arriving at the truth and to prevent their falling into error upon their inquiry as to the net profits which they had in hand, instead of to mislead them; and in chap. 118 of the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick it is expressly enacted that, \"forms when prescribed\" (in an act of the legislature), \"shall admit of deviations not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead.\" In the light of this enactment it seems to be impossible to construe the 126th sec. of 52 Vic. c. 27 as enacting, by implication or otherwise, that no claim of deduction, however calculated and indeed necessary to enable the assessors to arrive with accuracy at the true amount of net profits made within the year, should be entertained or taken into consideration by the assessors unless they came under one or other of the items mentioned in the form in schedule E.\nSuch a construction, which world, in effect, be that a conclusion which, in point of fact, must necessarily be false shall be accepted as true, and as such be binding upon the company, cannot, in my opinion, be entertained.\nIt was competent for the assessors to make such inquiries as they should think necessary of the agent as to the particulars of the several items comprising the $11,606.79 set opposite to the first paragraph of deductions claimed in his statement, for the purpose of enabling them to determine whether any of them were covered by the item of 75 per cent of the annual premiums for maintenance of the reserve fund. Such inquiries would have been very reasonable and proper but none appear to have been made. As the case now stands we do not know whether or not any, and if any what, part of the above amount consisted of sums claimed in respect of each of the several subjects mentioned in such first paragraph, or for some only, and which of them. It would no doubt be a matter of importance for the assessors to show whether any sums claimed in respect of such items were covered by the 75 per cent deduction, or should be charged against the remaining 25 per cent of the annual premiums; for example as to \"reinsurance,\" we do not know whether any deduction was claimed for that item. If any was claimed it would have been, I apprehend, for premiums paid by the company upon the reinsurance by them of the lives or life of some persons or person insured by some or one of the policies which had been issued by the company through their St. John office. Now it seems to be, to say the least, questionable that such reinsurance premiums should be charged against, or deemed to be covered by, the 75 per cent of premiums received every year which is appropriated to the maintenance of the reserve fund because any reinsurance effected by the company was for their own indemnity only and might prove utterly valueless to them, as in the case of the insolvency of the party issuing the reinsurance policy, and reinsurance does not in any respect diminish the responsibility of the company upon the policy issued by them to the person originally insured and cannot, therefore, relieve them from the responsibility of maintaining in efficiency the reserve fund necessary to be held in order to cover the company's liability to policy-holders. So as to the item of \"rebate;\" if any claim for such item was made it would be necessary to be informed as to the transaction in respect of which the loss was suffered before it could be held to be justly entitled to be compensated at the costs or prejudice of the 75 per cent for the maintenance of the reserve fund for the protection of policyholders. As to the item of claim, if any there was, \"for bonuses actually paid during the fiscal year\" there could be no pretense whatever for treating this as covered by the 75 per cent of premiums received appropriated to the reserve fund, nor indeed can there, as it appears to me, be any reason or propriety in charging anything paid on such item as a deduction at all in the inquiry as to whether there was any, and if any what, amount of net profits made within the year.\n\"Bonuses actually paid\" within any year\u2014are not in any sense a charge upon the premiums in such year. They come into existence only as profits already realized from the successful investment of the premiums received by the company over a series of years in excess of the fund required to meet the estimate of liabilities for policies maturing. They are payable and paid out of such realized profits and are in no sense a charge upon the annual premiums received within the year in which they are paid, and should not be deducted from the premiums received in any year upon an inquiry as to the net profits, if any, made in that year. They are, however, enumerated in schedule E of the statute as if they constituted an item of deduction upon such inquiry.\nUpon the whole, then, the proper conclusion appears to me to be that the assessors erred in expunging from the statement of deductions claimed by the company and from their consideration the item claimed by the company as for appropriation to the maintenance of the reserve fund and that, therefore, the conclusion at which they arrived of there having been net profits realized to the amount of $6,300, or to any amount, was erroneous. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed with costs, and that the rule in the court below be ordered to be made absolute with costs. PATTERSON J.\u2014The taxation of personal property, and more particularly the taxation of income, for local municipal purposes has never struck me as defensible on any principle which is at once sound and intelligible. I have often had occasion to express this opinion. Nearly all the inequalities, some of them sufficiently glaring, incident to our system of municipal taxation are connected with the assessment of personal property; and when one looks at the gross assessment of any of our cities the amount which comes from personal property seems much out of proportion to the inequalities, the injustice and the litigation arising from making property of that description the subject of municipal assessment.\nWe have in the present case one phase of the ever-recurring difficulty.\nThe local agent or manager in St. John of a life insurance company is to be\nRated and assessed upon the amount of net profits made by him as such agent or manager from premiums received from all insurances effected by him.\nIt is to use words without meaning to talk of net profits made by a local agent from premiums received from insurances effected by him. The agent makes no such profits.\nThe agent is to furnish a statement to the assessors setting out certain particulars. He is to specify the amount of cash and notes received for premiums during the year, and is to make deductions for outlays according to a form prescribed by the statute.\nNow I could understand a law which said that the gross amount received for premiums should be taxable as the personal property of the company or the agent. Such an enactment would be open to obvious objections but it would be intelligible. I could also understand a declaration that the gross amount of premiums, less certain specified deductions, should be the taxable amount. That would be an arbitrary mode of imposing the burden but it would also be intelligible. That is what the respondents in effect contend has been done here, and it is the view acted on by the court below.\nIf the enactment had been simply to the effect of what I have stated it might appear arbitrary and open to objections more proper for consideration by the legislature than by the court, but being a plain enactment there would be no choice as to our duty to enforce it.\nBut the statute does not profess to fix, arbitrarily, the balance of the items it specifies as the figure at which the net profits are to be assessed. It professes to tax only net profits, and we must read the law which imposes a tax with reasonable strictness.\nMy brother Gwynne has discussed the question of the deduction of 75 per cent from the premiums received and I need not follow or repeat that discussion. I do not think that by making that deduction, as made by the agent in his return to the assessors, the statement becomes a true profit and loss account, nor do I think that such an account could be made without going farther afield than this statute contemplates, and perhaps farther than the local legislation could demand. Still, the 75 per cent having to be set apart before profits can be declared by the company as payable to its shareholders it is proper to bring it into the account.\nAll that we have at present to decide is that the agent is not necessarily confined to the items detailed in the schedule but may properly include in his return any receipts or outlays which bear on the question of what are net profits of his agency.\nWe must give effect to the expressed object of the statute\u2014the governing object\u2014which is to tax net profits only, and not an amount arbitrarily ascertained by the manipulation of the items specified in the schedule form. If the intention should be to fix the amount by that line and rule method the legislature can say so and drop or modify the reference to net profits.\nThe result cannot be considered satisfactory or quite in accord with one's ideas of logic and precision, but it is an outcome of the attempt, which has always seemed to me to be a hopeless attempt, to frame a symmetrical system of local municipal assessment which includes as subjects for taxation intangible personal property and incomes.\nI agree that we should allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondent: I.

P. R. has an office for the company in St. John and was furnished by the assessors with a printed form to be filled in of the statement required by the act; the form required him to state the gross and total income received for his company during the preceding year as to which he stated that no such income had been received, and he erased the clause \"this amount has not been reduced or offset by any losses\" etc; the other items were not filled in. This was handed to the assessors as the statement required and they treated it as neglect to furnish any statement and rated the supt. on a large amount as income received. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick refused to quash the assessment on certiorari.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the court below, Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting, that it was sufficiently shown that the company had no income from its business in St. John liable to assessment; that the supt. was justified in departing from the prescribed form in order to show the true state of the company's business; and that the assessors had no authority to disregard the statement furnished and arbitrarily assess the supt. in any sum they chose without making inquiry into the business of the company as the statute authorizes.\nHeld, further, that the provision that there shall be no appeal from an assessment where no statement is furnished only applies to an appeal against over-valuation under C. S. N. B. c. 100 s. 60 and not to an appeal against the right to assess at all.\nHeld, per Gwynne J., that s. 125 of 52 V. c. 27 does not apply to railway companies.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick discharging a rule nisi for a certiorari to quash an assessment on the appellant Timmerman as general supt. of the Atlantic division of the C.

By 33 Vic. ch. 46 (N.B.) the road in New Brunswick now leased to appellants is exempt from taxation and that act is not repealed. Thorpe v. Adams[1]; Taylor v. Oldham[2].\nThe appellants are not brought within the letter of the law. Partington v. Attorney General[3].\nJack Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have read the judgment of my brother Gwynne and for the reason first assigned by him, namely, that the assessors acted illegally, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed;. on the second point, as to whether or not the act applies to railway companies, I express no opinion.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. GWYNNE J.\u2014The questions raised by this appeal are the construction of the 125th section of the New Brunswick statute 52 Vic. ch. 27 and its applicability to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The section enacts that:\nSec. 125.\u2014The agent or manager of any joint stock company or corporation established abroad or out of the limits of this province, or of any person or persons, whether incorporated or not, doing business abroad or out of the limits of this province who shall carry on business within the city of St. John for, or who shall have an office or place of business in the city of St. John for, any such company, corporation, person or persons, shall be rated and assessed in respect of real estate owned by any such company, corporation, person or persons, in like manner as any inhabitant and in addition thereto shall be rated and assessed upon the gross and total income received for such company, person or persons, deducting only therefrom the reasonable costs of management of the business, such as office rent, salaries and wages paid, and contingent expenses of such agent or manager, and the whole amount of income after such reasonable deduction shall be ratable and shall be capitalized for assessment as personal estate in the manner following that is to say: Every dollar of such ratable income shall be held to represent and shall be valued at five dollars of capital, and the amount so capitalized shall be assessed at its full value as personal estate of the agent or manager for the purposes of assessment; and the better to enable the assessors to rate such company or corporation, person or persons, the agent or manager shall, on or before the first day of May in each year, furnish to the assessors a true and correct statement in writing under oath, setting forth the gross amount of income and the particulars of deduction claimed therefrom for cost of management and showing the ratable amount received for such company, corporation, person or persons, during the fiscal year last preceding according to schedule B appended to this Act. In the event of any such agent or manager neglecting to furnish such statement on or before the first day of May as hereinbefore mentioned, or to answer under oath any inquiries of the assessors relating to such statement if furnished, the assessors shall proceed to rate and assess such agent or manager according to their best judgment and there shall be no appeal from such rate or assessment. For the purposes of this section the agent or manager shall be deemed to be the owner of the real estate and of the ratable income capitalized as personal estate and shall be dealt with accordingly, but he may recover from the company or corporation, person or persons he represents any assessment which he may be called upon to pay as aforesaid; such assessment shall be made separately from any other assessment to which such agent or manager shall be liable. The provisions of this section shall not extend or apply to fire, marine, life, accident or other insurance companies or their agents or managers but they shall be rated as in the next following section, is provided.\nThe schedule B referred to in the above section, and inserted in appendix to the act, is as follows:\u2014\nStatement of the real estate and income for taxable year 18 , of as agent or manager of Gross and total income and amount received for during the fiscal year of , next preceding the first day of April. This amount has not been reduced or offset by any losses, debts or other liabilities, or by charges of any kind or other deductions whatever. In case of banking institutions add, with the exception of interest paid or dues upon deposits held by.............................\nDEDUCTIONS.\nAmount actually paid during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April for office rent of the agency of , in the city of St. John or, if the premises are owned by the company, the rental value of the part occupied for the business of the agency.......................................\nAmount actually paid during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April for salaries of agents, clerks and other employees of the agency in the city of St. John..................................\nAmount actually paid during the fiscal year preceding the first day of April for light, fuel, stationery, printing and other contingent expenses (in the rotation enumerated of the agency in the city of St. John).......................................\nRatable income.\nReal estate within the city of St. John on the first day of April, making no deduction whatever from the full and fair value, by reason of any mortgage or other liability.................................\nDetailed description of real estate............................................................................. ......................................................................................................................\nAt the foot is inserted a form of oath to be taken, and instructions for filling the blanks in the form, opposite the figure 4 of which is the following:\u2014\n\"At this point insert the word 'none' if no income, deductions or property are returnable.\" The assessors of the city handed one of these printed forms to H. P. Timmerman, the agent and superintendent of the Atlantic division of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, for the purpose of his showing therein a statement of the ratable amount of income, if any there was, received by him for the company in the fiscal year 1891. This he did by inserting the word \"no\" before the words \"gross and total,\" and the words \"has been\" after the word \"amount\" in the first line; and by drawing a line across and so erasing all after the words \"first day of April,\" and by inserting an additional paragraph and the word \"none\" in the column for amount of income, if any, to indicate, as directed by the instructions at the foot of the form, that there was no income received by the agent. Opposite the items of deductions in the form he did not insert anything, and opposite the item for real estate he inserted, as directed by the instructions, the word \"none,\" with the following explanation:\u2014\nThe said company has no real estate in the city of St. John, nor any personal estate beyond office furniture; the cars of the said company run through and into the city the same as cars of other companies.\nThe statement as to income, so returned, read as follows: \u2014\nNo gross and total income and amount has been received for this company during the fiscal year of the company next preceding the first day of April. In St. John the income of the company is derived from its railway from Fairville to Vancouver, and no statement of income or revenue is kept in St. John beyond the returns made to the head office of the company in Montreal of moneys collected on the Atlantic division, extending from Fairville to Megantic, in Quebec.\nThis statement was sworn to by Mr. Timmerman as being full, true and correct according to the best of his knowledge and belief.\nThe statute gave authority to the assessors, in all cases coming within the contemplation of the sec. 125, to make any inquiries they might think necessary of every agent furnishing any statement, the better to enable them to make the assessment authorized by the section, which inquiries the agents of all companies or coporations liable to assessment were required to answer under oath. In the present case the assessors made no such inquiries of Mr. Timmerman, but treating his statement to be absolutely null by reason of the alterations made therein and its deviation from the precise letter of the form in the schedule B, they proceeded to assess the agent as in the case of neglect to furnish any statement, and what they did (as alleged in the factum of the respondent filed upon this appeal which is the only statement offered upon the subject), was to \"make their assessment upon their estimate of actual profits, after deducting expenses at the city of St. John,\" of neither of which particulars had they before them any information whatever from which to make their estimate. In point of fact they arbitrarily, that is to say, without any apparent data to go upon, assessed the company in the name of their agent for $140,000 income for the year, which amount, if capitalized in the manner mentioned in sec. 125, would have represented, and have been equivalent to, $700,000 of personal estate of the company in the city of St. John assessable for municipal purposes.\nUpon a rule to quash this assessment it has been maintained by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick upon the ground that the deviation in Mr. Timmerman's statement from the precise form given in schedule B constituted, within the meaning of section 125, \"neglect to furnish\" a statement as required by the section; and that, therefore, the company and their agent were deprived of all right to object to the assessment, and that the court had no jurisdiction to interfere wih it. Mr. Justice King in his judgment expressed the opinion that the striking out of the words in the form namely\u2014\nThis amount has not been reduced or offset by any losses or other liabilities or by charges of any kind or any deductions whatever prevented Mr. Timmerman's statement from being a statement made under the terms of the act He adds:\nIf Mr. Timmerman's statement had been in all respects substantially according to the statute I am not prepared to say that it would not have been conclusive upon the assessors who chose not to require further answer upon oath respecting the statement furnished, but for want of the distinct and positive allegation that the gross income as given viz., \"none\" had not been reduced or brought into that state by offsets or losses or liabilities or by charges of any kind whatever, it is impossible to treat the statement that there was no gross or total income as one that binds the assessors.\nMr. Justice Palmer was of opinion that the deviations from the form given in the schedule B left the assessors no alternative but to proceed independently and to make their assessment according to the best of their judgment from which there could be no appeal, and that the court had no jurisdiction to interfere. Then as to the point that the statute, as the appellants contend, did not apply to railway companies at all, or to the Canadian Pacific Railway in particular because no part of their line is within the city of St. John, Mr. Justice King said:\nEvery corporation established abroad is liable to be rated in the city of St. John if it carries on business in the city through an agent or manager or if through its agent or manager it has an office or place of business in the city. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has an office of management in St. John and does business in the city. It does a railway and transportation business in St. John inwards and outwards for goods and passengers. It does this over the road of the St. John Bridge and Railway Company and also over the Intercolonial Railway. Its cars continually pass in, through and out of the city under its own management and control as filly as if the company owned the road.\nAgain he says:\u2014 It is true that the receipts at St. John for passengers and freight represent, in large part, compensation for services performed or to be performed outside of the province and either upon the company's road outside of the province or upon other roads; but still there is a gross income received for or earned by the company and the share apportionahle to the company is readily ascertainable by the methods known to the railway companies in settlement of their traffic accounts. In the same way it may be possible to approximate to the value of the business of the Canada Pacific Railway in the province. Certain it is, however, that the provisions of sec. 125 of 53 V. ch. 27 are very inadequate to the exact determination of this. The three heads of deductions particularized in the schedule are too narrow.\nAgain he says:\u2014\nIn Russell v. Town & County Bank[4], Lord Herschell defines the profits of a trade or business to be the surplus by which the receipts from the trade or business exceed the expenditure necessary for the purpose of earning the receipts.\nThen he adds:\u2014\nThis would indicate the line of inquiry, but in the case of a railway company whose line extends across the continent with connections over Canada and the United States the determination of it is a matter of difficulty, towards the solution of which the legislature has not furnished much help.\nAgain he says: \u2014\nIn this province, by 33 Vic. ch. 46, the railway rolling stock, station houses and grounds and other property used in the running of trains of railway companies are exempt, but the actual profits derived from the running of the railway after deducting expenses are left ratable. It is in the dealing with actual profits in the case of long line of railway that it seems pretty obvious that the intervention of the legislature is needed if any uniformity is to be arrived at in local rating of income derived from the running of railways. The income derived by the Canadian Pacific Railway at St. John might (he adds) perhaps be roughly determined by first deducting from the gross or total receipts derived from its running the total amount of expenditure incurred in the earning of such receipts, and then by taking such proportion of the excess of receipts over expenditure as the gross receipts from freight and passengers at St. John bear to the gross receipts from freight and passengers over the entire line; this would not do more than give an approximate result but exact results cannot be expected.\nHowever, (he says) in this state of difficulty as to getting at results the legislature having enacted that every foreign corporation doing business in St. John shall be rated in a certain way, and the agent or manager of the company not having made the statement such as he was required to make, in case he made any, the assessors had to do their best to arrive at a correct result.\nAnd after observing that counsel for the railway company withdrew any objection to the fact that in the assessment roll the amount assessed was placed under the column headed \"income,\" instead of \"personal estate,\" he concludes thus:\u2014\nAlthough the income, when capitalized, as it is styled, is to be placed in a column headed \"personal estate,\" the rating is still in respect of income, and not of personal property. By 33 Vic. ch. 46, already alluded to, railway companies are not ratable in respect of personal property used in the running of trains. The only doubt shown is whether by this mode of taxing income it is not in effect a taxing of personal property, which by the above Act is exempt from taxation in the case of railway companies, supposing the Act 33 Vic. ch. 46 extends to the case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nMr Justice Palmer was of opinion that 33 Vic. c. 46 applied only to railway companies incorporated within the province, and so did not apply to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, but he says that act does not exempt actual profits derived from the railway after deducting expenses. \"This,\" he says, \"would appear to be what the legislature has authorized to be taxed,\" and having regard to the condition of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as proprietors of a railway of great length, extending across the continent and having connections with divers other railways extending over the United States and all Canada, he says that, in his opinion,\nthe just and equitable principle by which the property of such a corporation should be taxed would be by dividing it up in such a way as that each province should tax only the portion of the corporation property that was substantially used within it, and if the basis of assessment was such proportion then the proportion that the number of miles over which its cars ran within each province bore to the whole number of miles of the railway over which its cars ran, it appears to me, would be a just and equitable method of assessment, and if adopted by all the provinces through which the company's cars run, it would be assessed upon the whole value of the personal property, and no more.\nThen he states what he considers to be what sec. 125 authorized to be assessed as regards the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, namely:\u2014\nThe amount of money earned by the portion of the road controlled by the office and officers at St. John, from which should be deducted the cost of management.\nAnd he adds:\u2014\nIn my opinion the duty of the agent of this company was to make up the earnings of that portion of the road that was run under the management of the officers whose offices are at the city of St. John, without reference to where the money is collected, and deduct therefrom the cost of management, not of the operation but of the management, which practically would include the salary of the agent at St. John, the wages and the office expenses.\nHe would thus exclude all cost of the operation or working of the road and trains, that is to say, of the most material part of the expenditure necessary for the purpose of earning receipts. And he adds:\nAs in this case the agent has not furnished the statement according to schedule B appended to the Act there is no appeal from the rate or assessment;\nand he arrives at the conclusion that the assessors had no alternative but to do as they did and that if the company desire to escape from such a state of things\u2014\nthey must take care to comply with the law by keeping a statement of the amount of money earned by that portion of the railway under the management in St. John no matter where collected and deducting therefrom the reasonable cost of the management of the business such as for office rent, salaries and wages paid and contingent expenses as such agent or manager. It may be doubtful (he says) whether the Act does not direct the assessors to assess the gross total income of the company no matter where earned but as such a construction would lead to the whole income of the company being taxed upon its property in every province through which it ran it would be so manifestly unjust that I would not like to be compelled to put such a construction upon it, and if that is the fair meaning of the words used by the legislature I am not at present prepared to give an opinion either one way or the other as to their power to make such a law.\nI have extracted thus largely from the judgment of the learned judges in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for the purpose of showing the difficulty which the court entertained in determining what the section in question (assuming it to apply to railway companies) authorized to be assessed as the income of such companies, and of showing also the unanimity of opinion of the learned judges as to the utter inadequacy of the mode provided by the section for arriving with any degree of accuracy or justice at whatever it was as regards railway companies which, if anything, the section authorized to be assessed: and for the purpose also of showing that in this state of difficulty and doubt what the judgment of the court rests upon is, that the deviations from the form in schedule B in the statement furnished by the company's agent nullified that statement wholly and left the assessors no alternative but to act independently of it, as if none at all had been made, as they did, from whose assessment there is no redress, however monstrously extravagant the assessment may be, or whatever may have been the principle upon which it was made, although it is not suggested that they had, but on the contrary it is apparent that they had not and could not have had, any clear conception as to how they should proceed' nor any data whatever to govern them in the exercise of their judgment in determining the amount for which, if any, the section authorized the company or its agent to be assessed.\nI am unable to concur in this view. The New Brunswick statute for the construction of acts of the legislature and the interpretation of terms used therein, viz. ch. 118 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick, enacts that \"forms\" when prescribed in acts of the legislature \"shall admit of deviations not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead.\"\nNow the words in the form in schedule B which Mr. Timmerman erased, namely \"this amount has not been reduced, &c., &c.\" plainly, as it appears to me, apply to a case in which some amount of income is inserted in the column for that purpose as having been received, and have no application, but on the contrary are meaningless and unnecessary, in a case where the statement is that no income has been received. The form points to the possibility of there being no income at all returnable as having been received for the directions at the foot of the form under the head \"instructions for filling the above return\" expressly direct the party making the return to insert the word \"none\" in the column for that purpose if there were no income or real property returnable. With this direction Mr. Timmerman complied, and his statement as made could not have failed to convey to the assessors what it was intended to convey and what it, in point of fact, expressed, namely, that there was no income or property returnable; the erasion of the words \"this amount\" &c., &c., when in point of fact the agent denied that any amount had been received, tended in truth to make the return conformable to the actual state of things as represented in the return and could not by possibility mislead the assessors. The deviation, therefore, from the form which was caused by the erasion was authorized by the above provision in ch. 118 of the Consolidated Statutes. It might have required explanation if the assessors had asked for any, and upon inquiries being made by them of Mr. Timmerman it might have proved to be incorrect, but that the assessors should be at liberty because of such deviation from the form to treat the statement as an at solute nullity, and to abstain from making any inquiries of the agent in explanation of the statement, and arbitrarily to assess the company and their agent at any rate they pleased without showing upon what data they proceeded, which is what they have done, and that the party so assessed should have no remedy whatever or means of redress, however monstrous and extravagant the assessment may be is a construction which I do not think can be put upon the statute; the provision of the section that there shall be no appeal from a rate or assessment made by the assessors \"according to their best judgment\" in the case of an agent of a company neglecting to furnish a statement as required by the section has relation, as it appears to me, to the appeal for over-valuation given by sec. 60 of ch. 100 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick as to rates and taxes, and does not in any respect abridge the power of the court to do justice if the assessors appear to have proceeded in an arbitrary manner without any exercise of judgment, or to have made the assessment upon a wrong principle, or upon no principle, or for an amount so extravagant under the circumstances as to shock the sense of justice, under sec. 112 and the subsequent sections of the ch. 100 upon a motion for a certiorari to bring up an assessment with a view to its being quashed.\nWhen we consider that the only business carried on by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company within the city of St. John is that so much of the freight and passenger traffic, carried over its 6,000 miles of railway, as to reach their destination must necessarily pass through the city does so for the distance only of about three miles over railways over which the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has running powers, it is inconceivable that the assessors, in assessing $140,000 for a year's net income as being received from such business, equivalent to $280,000,000 net income on the whole 6,000 miles, could have proceeded upon any principle or upon any data, or in the exercise of any judgment. I am of opinion, therefore, that even if the section under consideration can be construed as applying to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company the assessment in the present case, which appears to have been made at the arbitrary will of the assessors, upon no principle whatever and without any data upon which to base their judgment, and in utter disregard, upon insufficient grounds, of the statement under oath made by the company's agent, cannot be maintained.\nBut the material question, namely, whether the section has any application to a railway company, still remains to be considered.\nThe utter inadequacy of the method provided by the statute for arriving at the net income of a railway company, for the purpose of subjecting it to assessment by a municipal corporation, affords in itself, without more, a strong argument that the legislature never could have contemplated railway companies as being within the purview of the section, and in my opinion, upon a sound construction of the statute, they are not. It may be laid down as a sound principle that the power conferred upon a municipal corporation to levy a tax upon any particular occupation, business or industry must be expressed in clear, unmistakable terms.\nIn the United States it is held that the general rule that the powers of municipal corporations are to be construed with strictness is peculiarly applicable to the case of taxes on occupations, industries, &c., and the authorities concur in holding that if it is not manifest that there has been a purpose by the legislature to give authority for collecting revenue by taxes on specified occupations any exaction for that purpose will be illegal. See Cooley on taxation.[5]\nNow the plain intention of the legislature in enacting the sec. 125 as to foreign corporations was, as it appears to me, to subject to municipal assessment only the net annual amount received by the agent of a foreign corporation who carries on, within the city of St. John, for the corporation, the business for the purpose of carrying on which the corporation was established, such net amount being ascertained by deducting from the gross amount received by the agent from such business so carried on by him his reasonable costs and charges attending his carrying on such business, as office rent, salaries and wages paid, and contingent expenses. The language of the section seems designed to cover the business of banking and all business of such a nature that, being carried on by the agent, is capable of being regarded as an independent business complete in itself as carried on within the city, and by deducting from the agent's gross receipts from which business the particular deductions specified will truly show the net annual amount of the receipts which is authorized to be assessed, and which when ascertained is to be assessed as the personal estate of the agent who carries on the business; but the language is wholly inappropriate to the business of a railway company. The business of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, for example, which is carried on within the city of St. John, consists wholly of the freight and passenger traffic which is carried on the trains of the company across the fractional part of the system of the company consisting of the three miles or thereabouts of railway within the city over which the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has running powers. That traffic consists of freight and passengers conveyed, it may be from the city of Victoria in British Columbia or from some points on the Canadian Pacific Railway between Fairville in the province of New Brunswick and Vancouver in British Columbia, or from some places in the United States with which the Canadian Pacific Railway has connections, it may be, from San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, Boston, &c., to some place or places in the province of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or Canada east or north of St. John, or vice vers\u00e2, or received at St. John to be conveyed to places outside of the city and of the province of New Brunswick to places along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway and of its connections in the United States; or received at such places for delivery in St. John. Such being the nature of the Canadian Pacific Railway business carried on within the city of St. John it would be impossible to say how much of the gross receipts of the company received within the city, or whether received within the city or at other stations along its entire line, could be attributed to the transit over the short piece of railway within the city over which the Canadian Pacific Railway Company conveys such traffic. So, likewise, the deductions specified in the section, which are limited to expenditures within the city, have no application to the nature of the business of a railway company whose operations extend over the entire continent, and the proportion of whose annual income as attributable to being realized at each particular station along the entire system of the company is incapable of being determined by the method specified in the act, or indeed by any method unless, perhaps, upon the basis of a calculation of the proportion which the distance run over in any particular municipality bears to the whole mileage of the entire undertaking from which the net income, if any there be, is earned. The legislature of New Brunswick, by 33 Vic. ch. 46, has exempted from taxation in the several counties in the province through which railways shall pass the railway, rolling stock, station houses, grounds and other property used in the running of trains of all railway companies in the province. That this enactment extends to the railway companies running trains in the province whether incorporated by the provincial legislature or by the Dominion Parliament, and so to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt, but whether it does or not is of little importance for none of the things above exempted is professed to be affected by the sec. 125 under consideration. But the statute 35 Vic. ch. 46 also enacted that the exemption provided by the act should not extend to actual profits. Now a railway being a great commercial artery, and as such one entire indivisible undertaking, the actual profits of such an undertaking can only be ascertained by taking an account of the whole of the business carried on throughout its entire length; and for this reason it is held in the United States that although railroads may be taxed for state revenue they are not subject to coercive severance or dislocation and cannot, therefore, be a fit subject for local taxation by the separate counties through which they run[6].\nThe question in the present case, however, is not whether the actual profits of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company realized from its undertaking can be so severed into parts as to define what proportion can be attributed to having been realized from the three miles or thereabouts of railway within the city of St. John over which some of the traffic of the company is conveyed in such a manner as to enable the provincial legislature to subject such proportion to municipal taxation by the city, but whether the sec. 125 of 52 Vic. ch. 27 purports to invest the municipal council of the city of St. John with power to tax the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as for actual profits realized by it within the city of St. John from the business carried on therein, and that it does authorize an assessment of such profits is the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick as I understand it. I am of opinion, however, that it is impossible to attribute to the legislature by such language an intention to authorize for the purpose of municipal taxation a subdivision of the actual profits of the railway company, if any there were, into parts and the appropriation of one of such parts to the city of St. John as realized within the city. If that had been the intention of the legislature, assuming it to have the power, the process enacted for ascertaining the amount so realized within the city would have been appropriate to the purpose instead of being so utterly inappropriate for such a purpose as that provided by the act is. The legislature, by 33 Vic. ch. 46, has shown that it deals with railway companies in an especial manner and by name, and by that act has impliedly exempted all property of railroads from taxation except actual profit. In any legislation, therefore, intended to affect railway companies the legislature would naturally be expected to mention them, eo nomine, and to make such provision for attaining the purpose expressed to be contemplated by the act as would be suitable to the nature of railway business so as plainly to convey the intention of affecting the companies, and to prescribe a mode of doing so suitable to the nature of railway business and the purpose expressed in the act.\nThe language of sec. 125 is so utterly inappropriate to railway business that I am of opinion that the section cannot be construed as applying to railway companies and that this appeal must be allowed with costs and a rule absolute be ordered to be issued from the court below quashing the assessment with costs. PATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in allowing this appeal on the grounds discussed by my brother Gwynne.\nOn the first ground, viz., that the assessors were not justified in treating the statement made by the appellant as a nullity and proceeding arbitrarily to fix an amount as the income of the office without data on which to form a judgment, I cannot say that I feel any doubt.\nThere was a statement furnished in writing and under oath. It was, according to sec. 125, to set forth the gross amount of income and the particulars of the deduction claimed therefrom for cost of management. It set forth that there was no gross income. That may have been true or it may not. The explanation added may or may not have seemed satisfactory. Take either way of it. If it was true that there was no gross income attributable to the office in St. John there was a substantial compliance with the requirements of section 125. The answer might have been the bald statement \"none\" according to the form, but the substance of it is the information that there was no income. The added information by the agent of his reason for saying there was no income, although moneys were passing through his hands, cannot relieve the assessors of the duty which obviously would have existed if the answer had simply been the one word \"none,\" and if that answer had been supposed to be untrue, of making the \"inquiries relating to such statement\" which section 125 speaks of, and then, if that course properly resulted from their inquiries, proceeding \"to rate and assess such agent according to their best judgment.\"\nThe functions of the assessors are to some extent judicial, and the statute does not countenance the idea of a discretion so unrestrained as to be liable to abuse from caprice or prejudice or temper or other unjudicial influences. They cannot rate or assess according to their best judgment, without exercising their judgment upon some basis of facts. The expression \"according to their best judgment,\" though plain enough in itself, may be treated as the common phrase \"to the best of his knowledge and belief\" was treated in the Court of Exchequer in Roe v. Bradshaw[7]. Speaking of an affidavit in which those words occurred Pollock C.B. said:\nBut then it is objected that this is only an affidavit to the best of the belief of the maker. I think, however, that the man who makes such a statement imports that he is entitled to entertain the belief that he expresses, and that we must not take him to mean that the \"best\" of his belief is no belief at all.\nAnd Bramwell B. said:\nA man who swears to the \"best\" of his belief swears that he has a belief.\nAs to the very important point made by my brother Gwynne, that section 125 does not apply to railway companies, I agree with him in the reasoning on which he founds his opinion. This appeal may be disposed of on the other ground, so that this latter question need not be finally decided. I should prefer leaving it open for further discussion if it should again arise. We discuss it now without as full information as may possibly be supplied in some other case as to railway matters, and further discussion may possibly bring out considerations not now fully before us, tending on the one hand to support the view of the present respondents, or on the other hand to supply stronger reasons for holding that the section does not apply to railway companies, or at all events not to those companies which are under the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nOne point that will perhaps bear further discussion is the meaning of \"income,\" as used in the section. Does it mean all money received by the agent as agent for the company, not merely as the money belonging to the company, still less as the earnings of the company, but simply all money that passes through the agent's hands? That would seem to be what he is intended to set down in his return, deducting from it only what may be generally called office expenses. If this is what the section means by gross income we shall probably find that arguments will suggest themselves against the power of the provincial legislature thus to deal with a Dominion railway. The discussion of that question would follow some of the lines of the discussion in the Ontario Court of Appeal in Leprohon v. Ottawa[8]. The Parliament of Canada authorizes a company to construct its line, or to use the line of another railway, in one of the cities and thereupon to conduct its traffic. Can the provincial legislature, in addition to asserting its right to tax all the property of the company which benefits by municipal expenditure, impose another burden on the company in the name of assessment for income, and thereby impair the value of the franchise granted by the Dominion? Whatever may be the correct answer to this question it is as well to leave it open for discussion.\nThere are manifest difficulties in the way of reading section 125 as intended to tax profits only\u2014one being the fact that when profits, or net profits, are meant, as in the case of insurance companies under section 126, they are called net profits, although there is room to argue, by reading the statute in connection with 33 Vic. ch. 46 (N.B.), that it is not intended to tax any income except \"actual profits derived from the running of any railway, after deducting expenses.\" But understanding profits only as being the property or income meant to be taxed under section 125, we should have the same difficulty as in Peters v. St. John, created by the certainty that the taxable amount indicated by the form in schedule B is not profits, and we should again encounter the Railway Act[9], several provisions of which would have to be considered, as e.g. s. 120, which deals with dividends payable out of clear profits; s. 107, which declares what is meant in that statute by \"working expenditure;\" various forms of returns given in schedules to the act, and some other provisions, all demonstrating the fatuity of talking of the profits of an isolated agency, and strengthening the conclusion that section 125 cannot be intended to apply to railway companies.\nI concur in allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondent: I.

The trial of the A.V. petition was by an order of a judge in chambers dated the 22nd September 1892, fixed for the 26th October 1892 On the 24th October the appellant petitioned the judge in chambers to join the two petitions and have another date fixed for the trial of both petitions This motion was referred to the trial judges who on the 26th October, before proceeding with the trial, dismissed the motion to have both petitions joined and proceeded to try the A.V. petition. thereupon the appellant objected to the petition being tried then as no notice had been given that the A.C. petition had been fixed for trial and, subject to such objection, filed an admission that sufficient bribery by the appellant s agent without his knowledge bad been committed to avoid the election. The trial judges then delivered judgment setting aside the election. On an appeal to the Supreme Court,\nHeld 1st. That under sec. 30 of ch. 9 R.S.C. the trial judges had a perfect right to try the A.V. petition separately.\n2nd. That the ruling of the court below on the objection relied on in the present appeal, viz.: That the trial judges could not proceed with the petition in this case, because the two petitions filed had not been bracketed by the prothonotary as directed by sec. 30 of ch. 9 R.S.C., was not an appealable judgment or decision. R.S.C. ch. 9 s. 50. (Sedgewick J. doubting.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Pagnuelo and. Doherty J J. who tried the election petition in this case and avoided the election upon the admission of the sitting member that he had been guilty of bribery by his agents without his knowledge.\nTwo petitions were presented and filed against the appellant; one by Alphonse Charlebois and one by Antoine Valois the respondent. The former was filed on the fourth day of April, 1892, and served the same day on the appellant. The other was filed on the sixth day of April, 1892, and served on the ninth day of the same month.\nPreliminary objections were filed in both petitions and dismissed. General answers were also filed, and on the 22nd September, 1892, by an order of a judge in chambers the trial of the Valois petition vas fixed for the 26th October, 1892, and proper notice given.\nOn the 24nd October 1892, the respondent moved a judge in chambers to have the order of the judge fixing the trial for the 26th October enlarged to a later date in order that the two petitions should be bracketed together, and that proper notices of the trial of both petitions together be given. This motion was referred to the trial judges and on the 26th. October they having heard the counsel on the motion dis- VA missed it and ordered the trial to the Valois petition to be proceeded with. Thereupon the petitioner examined one witness and the appellant filed a written declaration admitting that corrupt practices sufficient to annul his election had been committed by his agents at the said election and on the evidence adduced and on the appellant's admissions judgment was rendered maintaining' the election petition and voiding the appellant's election.\nBisailon Q C for appellant relied on sec. 30 ch. 9 R.S.C. and cited Cunningham on Elections ([1]).\nChoquette Q.C. for respondent contended that the case was not appealable, citing sec. 50 ch. 9 it S.C, and the L: Assomption Case ([2]); and if appealable the judges at the trial had a perfect right to try the Valois petition separately. Moreover, on the 22nd of September when the respondent applied to the judge to fix a day for the trial of the case the appellant should have asked to join both cases for the trial and the judge would have probably granted his request, but he did nothing of the kind; and the judge having fixed the trial to take place on the 26th of October the trial judges were bound to be guided by the order of the judge who had fixed the trial in one case only and to proceed with it.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014This appeal must be dismissed. The provision of the statute relied upon as showing that the petition filed by Chareebois ought to have been tried at the same time as the present petition is section 30 of the Dominion Controverter Elections Act I think the last words of the section u unless the court otherwise orders had precisely the effect which, my brother Patterson has in the course of the argument suggested, namely, that it makes it a matter of judicial discretion whether the petitions shall be ordered to be tried together or not, and that here we must\" assume that the judges thought fit, in their discretion riot to order them to be tried together.\nMoreover the Chareebois petition was out of court by reason of the lapse of time, according to the decision of this court in the Glengarry Case ([3]).\nBut I do not think we have any jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. It is not an appeal from a judgment on any question of Jaw or fact of the judges who tried the election. In order to give jurisdiction to this court there must be some question of law or fact decided by the judge at the trial to be appealed against. This position is incontrovertible. If it should happen that another judge than the one who tries the petition makes an incidental order in the case that order is not appealable\nThis has been decided here more than once. No appeal lies except where expressly given by the statute, and the statute only confers a right of appeal in two case one from judgments on preliminary objections, the allowance of which puts an end to the petition; the other from a judgment on some question of law or fact of the judge who has tried the petition, which means from the decision of a matter of law or fact arising on the trial of the petition.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOUKNIER J. concurred,\nGWYNNE J\u2014I entirely concur. It appears to me there is no appeal at all.\nThe appeal is not against the judgment of the trial judges but against an alleged irregularity m the procedure antecedent to and leading up to the trial Patterson J.\u2014I agree also that we must dismiss the appeal if not quash it either one or the other. Our jurisdiction under sec. 50, ch. 9 R.S.C. is to hear appeals in two classes of cases, one from decisions on preliminary objections, and not from all preliminary objections but only from such as put an end to the petition. There is nothing here of that kind. The other from final decisions on any question of law or of fact by the judge who has tried the petition. The objection which is raised here is one entirely on a matter of practice. It is a mistake to read the direction contained in sec. 30 as having such a stringent effect as is contended for by the appellant. It is of a purely directory character. The direction that the two petitions shall be bracketed together and tried at the same time. is expressly made subject to this \" unless the court otherwise orders.\" Suppose, if we can imagine such a case, that by oversight the prothonotary does not have the two petitions bracketed together and one is tried it surely cannot be argued that the other could not afterwards be tried. Even if the last words in the clause, \"unless the court otherwise orders had been left out, still the provision itself would be directory in its character. One test is: Suppose the application had been made in this case for an order to bracket the petitions to a judge in chambers and it had been refused, would his decision have been appealable? The appeal now taken is made after the whole case has been tried, but suppose, without waiting for the trial, they had appealed from the decision, we would not have had jurisdiction to entertain it.\nThe appeal should be either dismissed or quashed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed but I am not satisfied that an appeal does not lie in a case of this kind. No order was made in this case directing the two petitions to be tried separarely, and therefore both should have been bracketed and tried together under sec. 30. The doubt which arsis in my mind is, that assuming it was the case, was it not a point raised at the trial whether both petitions should be tried together or separately, and therefore appealable under sec. 50 c. 9 R.S.C. ? But on the whole and on the merits I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Bisaillon, Brosseou & Lajoie.\nSolicitor for respondent : F. X.

F. F., who, in partnership with his brother J. F., carried on business as manufacturers of boots and shoes in Montreal, by his last will left all his property and estate to be equally divided between his two brothers, M. W. F., the appellant, and J. f., the respondent. The will contained also the following provision\nBut it is my express will and desire that nothing herein contained shall have the effect of disturbing the business now carried on by my said brother Jeremiah and myself, in co-partnership under the name and firm of Fogarty & Brother, should a division be re quested between the said Jeremiah Fogarty and Michael William Fogarty, should the latter not be a member of the firm, for a period of five years, computed from the day of my death, in order that my brother, they said Jeremiah Fogarty, may have ample time to settle his business and make the division contemplated between them and the said Michael William Fogarty, and in the event of the death of either of them, then the whole to go to the survivor.\nT. F. F. died on the 29th April, 1889.\nOn the 30th April, 1889, a statement of the affairs of the firm was made up by the book-keeper, and J. W, and M. W. F., having agreed upon such statement, the balance shown was equally divided between the parties, viz., $24,146.34. being carried to the credit of M. W. F., in trust, and $24,146.34 being carried to J. F. 's genera account in the boos of the firm At the foot of the statement a memo, dated 12th June, 1889, was signed by both parties, declaring that the said amount had that day been distributed to them.\nOn the 6th March, 1890, M. W. F. brought an action against J. F., claiming that he was entitled to $24,146.34, with interest, from the date of the division and distribution viz., 30th April, 1889. J. F. pleaded that under the will he was entitled to postpone payment until five years from the testator's death, and that the action was premature. Held, affirming the judgment of the court below, that J. F. was en titled under the will to five years. to make the division contemplated, and that he had not renounced such right by signing the statement showing the amount due on the 30th April, 1889.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming unanimously the judgment rendered in the respondent's favour by the Superior Court.\nIn March, 1890, the plaintiff, by his action, claimed from the defendant $24,146.34, which he alleged to be his share in the boot and shoe manufactory of Fogarty & Brother, of Montreal, under the last will and testament of Timothy Francis Fogarty, in his lifetime a member of the said firm of Fogarty & Brother, and who, by his said will dated the 28th October, 1887 bequeathed all his rights and interest in the said manufactory to the plaintiff and to the defendant, his brothers, share and share alike, the said plaintiff alleging that there had been a division made between him and defendant of the respective shares and right in the said business, and that the defendant, who was previously a partner with the deceased in the said firm, and who has remained in possession of the whole property ever since, was now bound to pay plaintiff his said share.\nTo this action the defendant pleaded that under a special clause of the will he had a right to remain in possession of the whole business of the said boot and shoe manufactory during five years to reckon from the death of the testator, which took place in April, 1889.\nThe following are the material clauses of the will:\nFifthly. As to the rest, residue and remainder of all my property, whether real or personal, movable or immovable, moneys, stocks, funds, securities for money and effects generally, that I may die possessed of, wherever the same may be found and to whatever the same may amount, I give, devise and bequeath the same to my brothers, Jeremiah Fogarty and Michael William Fogarty, both of the said city of Montreal, manufacturers, in equal proportions, share and share alike, hereby constituting the said Jeremiah Fogarty and Michael William Fogarty my residuary legatees and devisees.\nBut it is my express will and desire that nothing herein contained shall have the effect of disturbing the business now carried on by my said brother Jeremiah and myself in co-partnership under the name and firm of Fogarty and Brother, should a division be requested between the said Jeremiah Fogarty and Michael William Fogarty, should the latter not be a member of the firm, for a period of five years computed from the day of my death, in order that my brother, the said Jeremiah Fogarty, may have ample time to settle his business and make the division contemplated between them and the said Michael William Fogarty, and in the event of the death of either of them then the whole to go to the survivor.\nAt the time of the testator's death the appellant was still an employee of the firm.\nNo difference of opinion appeared to have existed between the appellant and respondent as to the meaning of the clause qquoted from the will until after the pre parathion of a statement in duplicate showing the condition of the affairs of the firm of \" Fogarty & Brother,\" on the 30th April, 1889, at the time of the testator's death. This statement was prepared by Mr. Lindsay the book-keeper of the firm of Fogarty & Brother, and it showed the testator's interest in the business of Fogarty & Brother taking everything into account, to amount to $48,292.99.\nAfter appellant and respondent had opportunity to examine and verify it, they found it correct, and each signed the following entry thereon:\u2014\nWe approve of and accept the foregoing statement as correct. Montreal, 18th June.\n(Signed)\nC. Cushing, N.P.\n(Signed) J. FOGARTY.\nM. W. FOGARTY. The book-keeper also made the following entry at ' the bottom of the first sheet of the statement:\nIn accordance with the provisions of the will of the late Timothy Francis Fosrarty, his interest in the business of the firm of Fogarty & Bro., amounting to $48,292.69 (say forty-eight thousand two hundred and ninety-two dollars and sixty-nine cents), as per balance at credit of his capital account on the 30th April, 1889, has this day been distributed as follows:-\nJeremiah Fogarty\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..$24, 466 35\nMichael W. Fogarty\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.24,146 34\nMONTREAL, 12th June, 1889.\nThe principal question which arose on the present appeal was whether the respondent had not waived his right to the postponement of the payment of the bequest by acquiescence in the division and distribution of the estate at once.\nG Carter Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for appellant, con tended that the division which took place between the parties was a waiver of the delay given to the respondent by the will and the appellant would not have agreed to the division unless it was to be paid over to him at once.\nMacmaster Q.C. and Greenshieids Q.U. for respondent. The delay of five years for payment of the bequest, given by the testator to his partner, in order to give him \" ample time to settle the business and make the division contemplated \" is an ordinary and prudent provision to make and the courts have properly held that there is nothing on the face of the statement re lied on by the appellant to show that, either expressly or impliedly, the respondent waived his right to the period allowed for making the division.\nPer Curiam. The judgment appealed from must be affirmed with costs for the reasons given by the courts below.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court which was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) held that by the will the respondent was entitled to a period of five years to make the division contemplated and that the state ment filed of the affairs of the firm as they stood at the demise of the testator, had not the effect of depriving the defendant of the benefit of the said clause, and therefore that the action was premature, but reserved to the plaintiff \" all his rights under the will,\" and specially as to the question of knowing whether during the five years the plaintiff would be entitled to any share in the revenues of the business, and whether he should profit by the increase likely to take place in the value of the real estate engaged in the said business.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Carter & Goldslein.\nSolicitors for respondent : Greenshields, Greenshields & Mallette.\n",

The statute 54 & 55 Vie. ch. 29 was passed on the 30thSeptember, 1891, hut the plaintiff's action had been instituted on the 22nd November, 1890, and was standing for judgment before the Superior Court in the month of June, 1891 prior to the passing of 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25. On an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court in Review to the Supreme Court of Canada, the respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld, per Strong C.J., and Founder and Sedgewick JJ., that the right of appeal given by 54 & 55 Vie. ch. 25, does not extend to cases standing for judgment in the Superior Court prior to the passing of the said act.

MOTION to quash the appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada (sitting in Review) rendered on the 29th day of February, 1892.\nThis was an action brought by the respondent to recover from the appellant the sum of $5,191200 for royalty alleged to be due upon asbestos under a deed of sale of mining rights.\nThe action was brought in November, 1890, the case was heard on the merits and taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 in June, 1891. On the 17th November 1891 judgment was delivered by the Superior Court in favour of the respondent for the sum of $2,520, and this judgment was confirmed by the Superior Court (sitting in Review) on the 29th February, 1892.\nThe Dominion statute 54-55 Vic. ch. 25, giving the Supreme Court of Canada the right to hear appeals from the judgments of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec (sitting in Review) was passed on the 30th September, 1891.\nMr. St. Jean, for respondent, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that 54-55 Vic. ch. 25 was not applicable to cases standing for judgment in the Superior Court when the act was passed.\nH.

Apr\u00e8s une contestation r\u00e9uli\u00e8re le jugement fut rendu le 17 novembre 1891 par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure et continue le 29 f\u00e9vrier 1892 par la cour de Revision. C'est de ce der nier jugement dont il y a appel a cette cour, en vertu de la 54-55 Vict., ch. 25, amendant la juridiction de cette cour de mani\u00e8re a permettre l'appel des jugements de la cour de Revision en certains cas. Cette loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9e le 30 septembre 1891, l'action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e le 22 novembre 1890 et raise en d\u00e9li bCr\u00e9 devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans le mois de juin 1891, plus de trois mois avant l'adoption de cette nouvelle loi. Alors l'action du demandeur n'etait soumise a la juridiction de la cour Supreme que dans le cas ou le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9ricure n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour de Revision. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la cause dans le mois de juin 1891 par la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 avant la passation de la loi d'amendement, le demandeur, intim\u00e9, a droit a son jugement conform\u00e9ment a la loi telle qu'elle existait alors, bien que le jugement n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu que le 17 novembre 1891, apr\u00e8s la passation de cette loi.\nLa loi qui doit servir a la d\u00e9cision d'une cause est celle qui est en force au moment o\u00f9 l'action est r)rise et non celle qui pent \u00eatre pass\u00e9e apr\u0141s; car c'est de la loi alors en existence que le demandeur tient son droit d'action, ou du titre qu'il peut avoir a ce moment. La loi pass\u00e9e depuis ne pourrait s'y appliquer sans lui donner un effet r\u00e9troactif ce qui serait contraire aux principes, a moins que la loi ne contient une disposi tion bien sp\u00e9ciale lui donnant cet effet et la rendant applicable aux causes pendantes lors de son adoption.\nLe jugement rendu par la cour de Revision \u00e9tant final, l'intim\u00e9 a un droit acquis a son jugement qui ne peut pas \u00eatre soumis a un droit d'appel qui n'existait pas lorsque la justice a et\u00e9 saisie de la cause.\nSi l'appelant avait un droit d'appel, d'apr\u00eas la loi alors en force, c'\u00eatait au Conseil Priv\u00e9 de Sa Maiest\u00ea et lion a la cour Supreme.\nCette question au sujet de l'application de la 54 et 55 Vict., ch. 25, est d\u00e9j\u00e0 venue plusieurs fois devant cette cour, et chaque fois il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle ne s'appliquait point aux causes dont la cour Sup\u00e0rieure ou de Revision \u00e9taient saisies, par la mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 avant la passation de la loi. Dans la cause de Couture v. Bouchard ([1]) cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9\nthat the respondent's right could not be prejudiced by the delay of the court in rendering judgment which should be treated as having been given on the 30th September, when, the case was taken en d\u00e9lib\u00e9v\u00e9 and therefore the case was not appealable.\nLa meme chose avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans la cause de Hurtubise v. Desmarleau ([2]).\nCes decisions sont conformes au principe du droit francais qui veut que le ressort soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la loi de 1 \u00e9poque o\u00f9 1 instance est introduite.\nBioche, de l'appel des jugements iendus en premier et dernier ressort, dit .\nN\u00b0 49.

L'instance s'introduit par l'assignation et non par la citation en conciliation.\nConform\u00e9ment a cette autorit\u00e9 ce serait d'apr\u00e8s la loi en force lors de la date de la signification de l'action que devrait se decider la question du droitd'appel en cette cause. En ce cas la loi en force a cette \u00e9poque ne donnait pas encore l'appel a la cour Supreme et cons\u00e8quemment cette cour est sans juridiction pour decider cette cause. TASCHEREAU J \u2014I would have been of opinion that we had jurisdiction\u2014I do not take part in the judgment.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The effect of the Dominion act 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25 is to amend sec. 29 of ch. 135 of the Revised Statues of Canada so as to enable this court to entertain appeals from all judgments of the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec in affirmance of a judgment of the Superior Court. Prior to the passing of the said act such judgments were by the law of the province of Quebec appealable to the judicial committee of the Privy Council in England. Now the judgment appealed from in the present case is a judgment of the Court of Review rendered subsequently to the passing of said act and is in affirmance of a judgment of the Superior Court. This court therefore has clearly in my opinion, jurisdiction to entertain and determine the appeal from that judgment, and neither the judgment of this court in the Queen v. Taylor ([3]) nor that of the Exchequer Chamber or of the House of Lords in Attorney \"General v. Sillem ([4]) nor that rendered in any of the cases cited in these cases is, in my opinion, at variance with this conclusion. In the Queen v. Taylor (1) the point adjudged was, that the act constituting this court which did not come into operation until the expiration of three months after the recovery of the judgment which in that case was sought to be appealed from, did not give to this court any jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from such judgment; that the act only gave to this court jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from\u2014judgments which should be rendered subsequently to the coming into operation of the act constituting the court. The Attorney-General v. SilIem (2) decided that the right of appeal where no such right previously existed was a new right which could only be given by legislative authority and that the Imperial Act 22 & 23 Vic. ch. 21 gave no authority to the Barons of the Exchequer to give by rules of court an appeal in revenue cases what was done having been the granting of an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Exchequer to the Exchequer Chamber in a revenue case in virtue of certain rules of the Exchequer Court which were relied upon as being sufficient to authorize the appeal. The Exchequer Chamber and the House of Lords held that no such power was conferred on the Barons of the Exchequer by the above statute which authorized them to apply and adopt the provisions of the common law procedure act to revenue cases. Now in the present case as already pointed out the judgment appealed from was rendered subsequently to the passing of the Dominion Act 54 & 55 Vic. and it comes precisely within the description of the judgments, appeals from which may after the passing of that act be entertained and adjudicated upon by this court, viz., a judgment of the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec affirming a judgment of the superior Court in a case in which by the laws of the Province of Quebec there was already an appeal to the judicial committee of the Privy Council. The statute merely extends the jurisdiction of this court by enabling it to entertain and determine appeals from such judgments of the Court of Review which by the existing law were already appealable to the judicial committee of the Privy Council without depriving a suitor of any acquired right whatever. Such being the plain language of the statute I can see no reason why the jurisdiction of this court should he limited to cases in which not mere]v the judgment appealed from, but that also which had been rendered in the Superior Court and affirmed in Review should be rendered subsequently to the passing of the Act 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 25. That act, construed as I construe it, instead of working any prejudice to existing suitors, may be said rather to confer a benefit upon them by enabling a domestic court to entertain appeals from all judgments of the Court of Review of the particular character specified which should be rendered subsequently to the passing of the act and to adjudicate upon such appeals at less expense to the parties than that attending appeals to the judicial committee of the Privy Council.\nThe case as to its merits turns wholly upon the proper answer to be given to the question: What were the rights of Arthur H. Murphy to the royalty secured by the deed of the 25th March, 1888, between him and the defendants at the time of the execution of the deed of transfer of the 12th April, 1890, by Murphy to the plaintiff, of all his, Murphy's, right, title and interest in and to the royalty stipulated in his favour by the deed of the 26th March, 1888 ? And that question raises simply a question as to the construction of the latter deed.\nBy that deed Murphy sold to the defendants two undivided fifth shares of lot No. 32, in range letter B, of the Township of Colerain, in the County of Megan-tic the said lot containing one hundred and twenty-three acres in all, subject to the following conditions, to the fulfillment whereof the defendants bound and obliged themselves, namely:\u2014\n1. That the defendants would furnish all the plant, machinery, tools and labour necessary to open up and work the asbestos mines upon the said \"property in a thorough and efficient manner and for the best advantage of the said property, and would begin the said operations as early as possible in the spring of 1888, and carry on the same durians the term of this contract.\n2. That they will pay the vendor a royalty of nine dollars upon each and every ton of asbestos of the qualities one, two and three, mined and shipped from the said mine, payable on the fifteenth of each month following the mining and shipment of the said asbestos, for and during the term of three years, to be accounted from the 31st day of December last, that is to say, 1887.\n3. That during each year of this contract, with the exception of the first year, they should mine at least four hundred tons of asbestos.\n4. Each of the said parties shall give to the other the option of purchase of their respective interests in the said property, at the amount offered by any bond fide purchaser, which option must be accepted or refused within ten days after it is received by the other party.\nThe said deed contained also a clause to the effect that the said sale of two-fifth shares was made for and in consideration of the price and Sum of six thousand dollars, which the said purchasers bound and obliged themselves to pay in and by four even and equal consecutive annual payments of fifteen hundred dollars each, the first whereof should become due and payable on the 31st day of December, 1888 and yearly thereafter, and until payment to pay interest thereon or on the part thereof at any time unpaid, at the rate of 6 per centum per annum, payable yearly with the said installments, and it was thereby specially agreed between the said parties\nThat as the conditions of this sale, as hereinabove set forth are part of the consideration thereof that should the said purchasers fail to carry out the same in any essential the said vendor shall have the right upon giving to the said purchasers twenty-four hours notice, by registered letter, to cancel and annul the present sale, to sue for any portion of the price which may be then due, and to claim such damages as he may have suffered, directly or indirectly, in consequence of such default.\nNow can that instrument be construed as containing a covenant by the defendants to pay Murphy, the vendor, a royalty, not only upon every ton of asbestos of the qualities one, two and three which should be mined from the land in each of the three years named but that such royalty should not be less than $3,600.00 in each of such years but the first ? Did the defendants in effect guarantee the richness of the mine and covenant that the royalty to be paid in each year, except the first should not be less than $3,600.00 ? In my opinion, the answer must be that the contract is open to no such construction, and that nothing could be further from the intention of the parties than that the defendants who were the purchasers only of two-fifth shares in the property, should so guarantee to the proprietor of the whole property the richness of the asbestos therein. It is obvious that the parties contemplated that asbestos might be produced from the property of a quality inferior to the qualities named as subject to the royalty. Upon such inferior quality no royalty whatever was payable. It might be that the defendants might take one thousand tons of asbestos from the property without succeeding in getting any of the qualities subject to royalty. It might be that after producing for a time asbestos of the qualities upon which the royalty was payable, the property should cease to produce any more asbestos at all. The asbestos might wholly fail. It is impossible, in my opinion, to construe the contract as containing a covenant by the defendants that they should pay a royalty of nine dollars per ton upon not less than 400 tons in each year except the first, whether such quantity of the qualities subject to the royalty could or could not be extracted from the land. The covenant of the defendants is, in my opinion, simply that they would pay the royalty named upon the three qualities of asbestos named if such qualities should be produced from the property, and that they would take out 400 tons of asbestos of such quality as the land should produce in each year except the first, but without any guarantee or covenant that the asbestos so taken out should be of any of the qualities subject to the royalty. If not of those qualities it is clear that no royalty would become payable, although one thousand tons should be taken out. And if the defendants should cease to work the mine they could be made liable only for such damages\nAs the vendor could prove lie had sustained by the default of the defendants to fulfill their special covenant to take out at least 400 tons in each year except the first.\nNow the contention of the defendants is that they did not mine on the property subsequently to the year 1888, because that upon a thorough and most expensive test of the property by sinking shafts, &c, in that year,1888, they found that the land ceased to produce any asbestos or at least any of a quality subject to royalty. and that such the defendants' discontinuance to mine on the property was for the reason stated, concurred in by Murphy, and that thereupon and for the above reason the parties interested agreed to endeavour to sell the entire property, and that in fact, in the early part of the year 1889 Murphy requested the defendants to remove their plant to another property of his which the defendants declined doing, only for the reason, that by so doing they might injuriously affect the contemplated sale of the lot 32. Now if this contention of the defendants should prove to be true, it would clearly be a good defence to any action if any had been brought by Murphy to recover damages from the defendants, for the injury sustained by Murphy by reason of the defendants' default in failing to take out 400 tons in the year 1889, for Murphy could have sustained no damage by reason of such default if the land ceased to produce asbestos of the qualities for which a royalty was payable. But the question is not now whether the defendants would have had a good defence to such an action for none such is brought, but whether when Murphy transferred to the plaintiff the deed of the 12th April 1890, all his, Murphy's, right, title and interest, in and to the royalty of nine dollars per ton stipulated for by that deed he had become entitled to such royalty upon 400 tons of either of the qualities one, two and three for the year 1889 ? And as no asbestos was taken from the property in that year, Murphy's claim, if any he had for that year, was not for royalty at all, but was reduced to a c claim for such damages as he could prove he had suffered directly or indirectly,\" in the words of the defendants' covenant \"for their default\" in not working the property and endeavouring to extract asbestos therefrom in the year 1889, and the defendants consequently were, in my opinion, entitled to have had judgment rendered in their favour in the present action.\nThe evidence adduced was, as it appears to me, irrelevant to the only question in the case which turned wholly upon the construction of the deed of the 26th March, 1888. It was argued that the agreement of the 15th October, 1859, upon the occasion of the execution of the power of attorney to Martin to sell the property, namely, that, in the event of a sale being effected for $36,000 net, Murphy should deduct from the defendant's share the unpaid balance of purchase money and accrued interest, and also royalty for present year of $3,600, constituted an acknowledgment then made by the defendants that such an amount was then due for royalty for the year 1889. When that agreement was made the defendants may have, although erroneously, thought themselves to be liable for royalty for the year 1889, or knowing themselves not to be so liable they may nevertheless have entered into that agreement in their anxiety to get rid of the property by a sale for such a sum as $36,000; or in order not to prejudice the contemplated sale, which might be prejudiced if by any means the sale of the property as a mining property should appear not to be of a going concern after mining operations had been entered upon and its value tested but whatever may have been the motive of the defendants in entering into that agreement of the 15th October, 1889, that agreement cannot be referred to for any assistance in construing the covenant of the defendants in the deed of the 26th March 1888. That deed must be construed upon the terms which are contained within itself and which are clear and unequivocal and, in my opinion, to the effect I have above stated. This appeal therefore, should in my opinion be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the action with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed upon the authority of the case of Couture v. Bouchard ([5]) decided by this Court in December 1892.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitors for respondent : Pr\u00e9fontaine & St. Jean.\n[1] 21 Can.

The agreement contained certain restrictions as to buildings to be erected on the property purchased which fronted on the two streets north and west of it respectively and the vendors agreed to make similar stipulations in any sale of land on the south side of Wellesley street produced.\nA deed was afterwards executed of said land pursuant to the agreement which contained the following covenant: \u201cAnd the grantors * * covenant with the grantees * * that in case they make sale of any lots fronting on Wellesley street or Sumach street on that part of lot 1, in the city of Toronto, situate on the south side of Wellesley street and east of Sumach street now owned by them that they will convey the same subject to the same building agreements or conditions\u201d (as in the agreement). The vendors afterwards sold a portion of the remaining land fronting on Amelia street and one hundred feet east of Sumach street and the purchaser being about to erect thereon a building forbidden by the restrictive covenant in the deed, B. brought an action against his vendors for breach of said covenant, claiming that it extended to the whole block.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the covenant included all the property south of Wellesley street; that the land not being divided into lots any part of it was a portion of a lot of land fronting on Wellesley and Sumach streets and so within the purview of the deed; and that the vendors could not by dividing the property as they saw fit narrow the operation and benefit of their own deed.\nHeld, per Gwynne J.\u2014The piece of land in question did not front nor abut on either Wellesley or Sumach streets, but on Amelia street alone and was not, therefore, literally within the covenant of the vendors.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe following statement of the facts on which the appeal was decided is taken from the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nOn the 1st of February, 1889, the appellants, the Rector and Church Wardens of St. James Cathedral, Toronto, were the owners of a block of land on the west side of the River Don in the city of Toronto. It was of the following shape: At this time there were neither buildings nor streets on the land, although at the time it was proposed (and a city by-law had been passed for the purpose) to construct a street along the southern boundary westward from Sumach street, to be called Amelia street. Neither had the property been subdivided into lots, although a firm of surveyors had been employed to survey and had surveyed and made a plan of it at the instance of the appellants.\nOn the date mentioned the appellant corporation entered into an agreement with George Leaver and George Burfoot, whereby the latter agreed to purchase \u201cthree hundred feet frontage on the northerly side of Wellesley street produced, commencing at the intersection of the west limit of Sumach street produced with the northerly limit of Wellesley street and of the depth to the edge of the plateau as marked on the plan\u201d above referred to. The agreement contained among other conditions, provision that all buildings to be erected upon the property purchased were to be \u201cdetached or semi-detached two story neat and respectable houses, brick front, brick, brick-cased or stone * * of, actual cost not less than $1,200 each house * * without out-buildings, the vendor agreeing to make similar stipulations in any sale of land on the south side of Wellesley street produced.\u201d\nSubsequently a plan of the property was made and registered upon which Wellesley street extended was laid off as well as lots and a street to the north, but there was no division into lots south of Wellesley street.\nThe Corporation then by a deed dated 23rd April, 1889, conveyed to Leaver & Burfoot the lands referred to in the agreement or schedule substantially containing the conditions as set out in the agreement and the instrument contained this covenant:\u2014\n\u201cAnd the grantors * * covenant with the grantees * * that in case they make sale of any lots fronting on Wellesley street or Sumach street on that part of lot 1 in the city of Toronto, situate on the south side of Wellesley street and east of Sumach street now owned by them, that they will convey the same subject to the building agreements or conditions as are set out in the schedule to these presents.\u201d\nOn the 22nd of November following, Leaver conveyed his interest in the property to Burfoot.\nOn the 1st of May, 1890, the appellant corporation conveyed to one Wallace Finch a portion of the property immediately south of Wellesley street described as follows: \u201cCommencing at a point on the south limit of Wellesley street where the said south limit of Wellesley street is intersected by the east limit of Sumach street, thence easterly along the south side of Wellesley street 240 feet, thence southerly parallel to Sumach street aforesaid 100 feet, thence westerly parallel to Wellesley street aforesaid 240 feet to the easterly limit of Sumach street aforesaid, thence northerly along the easterly limit of Sumach street 100 feet to the place of beginning.\u201d\nThis deed contained the restrictive covenant as to buildings stipulated for in the deed to Leaver & Burfoot. But the property to the south between the lands just described and Amelia street still remained. But on the day before the conveyance last referred to, the corporation entered into an agreement with one James A. McIlwain for the purchase of this property. The land although rectangular in shape (175 feet x 198 feet) was described as two lots, as follows:\u2014\n\u201cAll and singular those certain parcels or tract of land and premises being composed of part of the St. James Cathedral Cemetery property in the city of Toronto, and being part of Park lot number one, Toronto, having a frontage of ninety-seven feet nine inches, more or less, on the northerly side of Amelia street, commencing one hundred feet easterly from the intersection of the northerly limit of Amelia street with the easterly limit of Sumach street, and extending easterly along the northerly limit of Amelia street to the westerly limit of the property owned by the Lamb estate, and being of the depth of one hundred and seventy-three feet, more or less, to the rear of the lots of one hundred feet deep facing on Wellesley street. Also, all that parcel of land situated on the easterly side of Sumach street, having a frontage of one hundred and seventy-three feet, more or less, and extending northerly from the intersection of the easterly limit of Sumach street with the northerly limit of Amelia street, to the rear of the lots of one hundred feet deep facing on Wellesley street, and being the depth of one hundred feet.\u201d\nThe property might with equal accuracy have been more shortly described as \u201cthat portion of Park lot No. 1, in the city of Toronto, owned by the Corporation fronting on and east of Sumach street and on the south side of Wellesley street, commencing at a point on Sumach street 100 feet south of the corner of Wellesley and Sumach streets, thence southerly along Sumach street to Amelia street, 173 feet to Amelia street, thence easterly along Amelia street 198 feet, thence northerly parallel to Sumach street 173 feet, thence westerly 198 feet parallel to Amelia street to the place of beginning.\u201d\nThis agreement did not contain the restrictive building conditions, stipulated for in the original deed from the Corporation to Leaver & Burfoot.\nSubsequently the Corporation with the concurrence of Mr. Mcllwain conveyed to divers parties the land north of Amelia street 100 feet east of Sumach street without inserting in the conveyances these restrictive conditions.\nThe only question in controversy is whether the restrictive covenants described in the agreement between the Corporation and Leaver & Burfoot, as well as in the deed between the same parties, apply to that portion of the land the Corporation agreed to sell to Mcllwain, which is 100 feet east of Sumach street.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Street decided in favour of the plaintiffs holding that the defendant Corporation had broken their covenant in omitting to insert the restrictive stipulations in the agreements and conveyances of the lots north of Amelia street above referred to.\nUpon an appeal to the Divisional Court Mr. Justice Ferguson and Mr. Justice Robertson reversed the judgment of the trial judge and dismissed the action. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of the trial judge was by an unanimous judgment restored.\nArnoldi Q.C. and Bristol for the appellants contended that the covenant did not apply to this land, and cited, Bowes v. Law[1]; Hall v. Ewin[2].\nAs to notice they referred to Clayton v. Leech[3]; Muttlebury v. King[4]; and as to damages, Beatty v. Oille[5].\nNesbitt and Percy Galt for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE, and FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice SEDGEWICK.\nGWYNNE, J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed upon the single ground that the piece of land in question which is known and designated as lot B, fronting on Amelia street, in the city of Toronto, neither fronts nor abuts in any way on either Wellesley or Sumach streets but on Amelia street alone, and is not therefore, literally within the covenant of the appellant contained in their deed of 23rd April, 1889, upon which covenant the action is based, and I can see no reason for giving to that covenant any other than its plain literal construction.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the trial judge is the correct one.\nIn my view the stipulation in regard to the restrictive covenants whether in the deed itself which is the foundation of this suit, or in the agreement which preceded, it had reference to all the church property south of Wellesley street produced. In the agreement there is clearly no ground for the appellants\u2019 contention. There, the vendors agreed to make the restrictive stipulation in any sale of land on the south side of this street. The land in question comes without doubt within this description. But the question is: Is the deed from the appellants any narrower? Now it does not appear from the evidence that the parties contemplated any change in the terms or conditions of purchase in this regard between the dates of the execution of the agreement and the execution of the deed. It must, I suppose, be admitted that at law the deed must govern. But, admitting that, does not the locus come within the description in the deed \u201clots fronting on Wellesley street or Sumach street * * situate on the south side of Wellesley street and east of Sumach street\u201d? I think it does. When the deed was executed there was no division into lots (so called) south of Wellesley street. It was all, as I understand, vacant wild land. Subsequently several methods of subdivision were contemplated, and the evidence does not even now indicate exactly the precise areas of the different holdings, but in my view the land in question, until the sale to Finch, was a portion of a lot of land fronting on Wellesley street and Sumach street, situate on the south side of Wellesley street and east of Sumach street and therefore within the purview of the deed. And even after the sale to Finch of the street immediately to the south of Wellesley (although that makes no difference) it was still within the description as part of a lot \u201cfronting on Sumach street on the south side of Wellesley street and east of Sumach street\u201d and therefore still within the purview of the deed.\nI cannot appreciate the force of the other contentions. Some special meaning is given to the word \u201clot\u201d that I do not understand. Has a \u201clot\u201d any specific area or any definite shape recognized by law? When the defendant Corporation gave this deed to the plaintiff and imposed as they did, upon some area south of Wellesley street, the burden of the restrictive stipulation, upon what ground can it be argued that excepted from that burden was this particular parcel 198 feet by 173 feet in extent? Why that parcel and not another? Why that shape and not another? Was it within the contemplation of the parties that the vendors might without reference to the purchasers, and in spite of them, cut up and divide the property according to their pleasure or caprice so as to widen or narrow as they might think fit the operation and benefit of their own deed?\nWhen the sale to Finch was made there remained a \u201clot\u201d 198 by 173 feet \u201cfronting on Sumach street,\u201d \u201con that part of lot one, in the city of Toronto, situate on the south side of Wellesley street and east of Sumach street,\u201d owned by the appellants. By what authority, supported by what argument, can it be contended that they can cut off a block of 98 feet from the rear of this lot and say \u201cthe front part of this lot is subject to the burden of our covenant, but this is not\u201d? The defendants admittedly violated their agreement, when they agreed to sell to McIlwain the property just referred to. There was no restrictive stipu- lation in this agreement, and I am inclined to think it was left out inadvertently, and that the contention that the locus was not within the description set out in the deed to the plaintiff was an after thought.\nThere is no sufficient evidence to justify the rectification of the deed whether as claimed by the respondent or the appellants. In the view I take the deed sufficiently expresses the true agreement, and the appellants have failed to show any case warranting rectification in their favour.\nOur attention has been called to clause 5 of the formal judgment of Mr. Justice Street. That clause should, I think, be varied by directing a reference to ascertain the damages occasioned the plaintiff, not by the erection of the buildings complained of but by the breach on the part of the appellants of the covenant in their deed respecting the restrictive building stipulation.\nIn my opinion Mr. Justice Street\u2019s judgment should be varied as stated and that subject to such variation the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Howland, Arnoldi &.

In May, 1891, it was served on defendants, who thereupon applied to the master to have the service and last renewal set aside, which application was granted and the order setting aside said service and renewal was affirmed on appeal by a judge in chambers and by the Divisional Court. Special leave to appeal from the decision of the Divisional Court was granted by the Court of Appeal, which also affirmed the order of the master, Mr. Justice Osler, who delivered the principal judgment, holding that the master had jurisdiction to review his own order; that plaintiffs had not shown good reasons, under rule 238 (a), for extending the time for service; and the ruling of the master having been approved by a judge in chambers and a Divisional Court, the Court of Appeal could not say that all the tribunals below were wrong in so holding. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, that for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal the appeal to this court must fail and be dismissed with costs.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court, by which the order of a master setting aside a former order for renewal of the writ in the case, which had been affirmed by a judge in chambers, was upheld.\nThe writ was first issued in June, 1887, and was renewed, by order of a master in chambers, three times, the last order being made in May, 1890. In May, 1891, it was served on the defendants, the Dominion Bank, and by order of the master the service was allowed. The defendant then moved, before the master in chambers, to have the service and order allowing the same, and all renewals since June, 1889, set aside, on the ground that the same were contrary to the statute, and that no sufficient cause for granting the same had been shown. The master granted the application, and set aside the renewals and order for service, with costs against the plaintiffs, who appealed to a judge in chambers, to the Divisional Court and to the Court of Appeal, all of which appeals were unsuccessful, and the master\u2019s order was sustained. The plaintiffs then appealed to this court.\nArnoldi Q.C., for the appellants.\nDr. McMichael Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appeal in this case relates to a question of practice only. The writ of summons had been renewed three times by the master in chambers, at Toronto, and was not served until nearly four years from the date of its issue had elapsed. The order for the third renewal was set aside by the master, whose order was affirmed by Mr. Justice Street, at chambers, by the Divisional Court and by the Court of Appeal. The effect of the master\u2019s order was, it is contended, to enable the defendant bank to set up the statute of limitation as a defence to the action, should it be begun de novo, hence the necessity on the plaintiff\u2019s part to maintain alive the writ itself, as well as its several renewals.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must fail for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal, to whose judgment no observations of mine can usefully be added.\nThe appeal should, I think, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Howland, Arnoldi & Bristol.\nSolicitors for respondents: McMichael, Mills & McMichael.\n[1] 15 Ont.

On the question submitted the jury disagreed. Defendant then moved in the Divisional Court for judgment, but pending such motion the plaintiffs applied for and obtained an order of the court amending the statement of claim, and charging other grounds of negligence. The defendants submitted to such order and pleaded to such amendments, and new and material issues were thereby raised for determination. The action as so amended was entered for trial but was not tried before the Divisional Court pronounced judgment on the motion, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action. On appeal to the court of appeal from this judgment of the Divisional Court it was reversed. On appeal to the Supreme Court:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court of appeal, that the action having been disposed of before the issues involved in the case, whether under the original or amended pleadings, had ever been passed upon or considered by the trial judge or the jury, a new trial should be ordered, and that this was not a case for invoking the power of the court, under rule 799, to finally put an end to the action.\nHeld, also, that the judgment of the court of appeal ordering a new trial in this case was not a final judgment nor did it come within any of the provisions of the Supreme Court Act authorizing an appeal from judgments not final. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court which dismissed the respondents\u2019 action.\nThis was an action brought by the respondent company, claiming $1,487.17 damages from the appellant company as the value of three cases of plate glass delivered to the appellants in Montreal for carriage to Toronto, alleging the same to have been so negligently loaded upon the appellants\u2019 cars, and the cars so negligently managed during transit, that the glass was thrown from the cars and destroyed.\nThe respondents\u2019 defence was denial of negligence and setting up a special contract exempting the carriers from liability in consideration of their accepting a reduced freight rate.\nThe facts and procedings are fully stated in the head note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick hereinafter given.\nNesbitt for appellants.\nJ. Osler Q.C. and Holden for respondents.\nThe case was not disposed of on the merits and consequently the cases and authorities relied on need not be referred to.\nThe rules of the judicature act referred to by counsel on the question of procedure were rules 219, 655 and 799.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an action brought by the plaintiff company against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to recover damages by reason of the loss of a quantity of plate glass, while being carried from Montreal to Toronto on the defendant company\u2019s line of railway. The allegation in the statement of claim was that the loss was occasioned by the negligent loading of the glass, as well as by the careless and negligent management of the cars while the goods were in transit. The defendants\u2019 defence was the denial of negligence and the setting up of a special contract whereby, in consideration of obtaining a reduced freight rate, the plaintiff company agreed that the railway should not be responsible for loss even if caused by the negligence of its servants.\nThe case was brought on for trial at the Toronto Spring Assizes of 1891, before Mr. Justice Street and a jury. The only question left to the jury was that of negligence, upon which they failed to agree, the learned judge stating that if there were any other questions to be decided he would decide them himself. During the trial counsel for the defence made a motion for non\u2011suit which was informally dismissed, but there was a general understanding before the jury returned that the other questions in the case, as for instance the effect of the release set up by the defence, were to be argued before the trial judge at a subsequent time.\nIt would seem, however, that no further argument took place nor were any of the questions involved ever again brought before the trial judge.\nOn the 8th of May following, the defendants gave notice that a motion would be made before the Divisional Court by way of appeal from Mr. Justice Street\u2019s decision refusing a non-suit, and for an order that the action be dismissed on the grounds (principally) that there was no evidence of negligence, and that the release pleaded was of itself a complete bar to the action.\nSubsequently, and before the hearing of the appeal, an order was made in chambers allowing the plaintiffs to amend their statement of claim, and thereupon it was amended, the defendants filing an amended statement of defence. The appeal then came on to be heard, and the Divisional Court gave judgment ordering the action to be dismissed, upon the sole ground that there was no evidence of negligence to go to the jury. No reference was made in the judgment to the fact that the pleadings had been amended since the abortive trial, although a new cause of action, or at least a different species of negligence, was therein set up, and questions were there raised that had not been and could not be dealt with at the trial.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiff company appealed to the Court of Appeal.\nThat court allowed the appeal, upon the ground that the Divisional Court went too far in disposing of the case as they did before the issues involved in the case, whether under the original or amended pleadings, had ever been passed upon or considered by the trial judge or the jury.\nI entirely concur in this view.\nThis case has never been tried; although standing for trial by a jury no jury has yet passed upon the issues of fact involved, nor has the judge who heard the evidence given a decision upon the remaining questions. The appeal court was, as well as this court, entitled to the aid of the judge and jury before whom the case previously came in their respective functions and should not have been asked to come to a judgment upon the merits of the case without it. In other words the case was not ripe for determination, and the Court of Appeal was right in so declaring.\nWhen and under what circumstances resort may be had to the powers conferred upon the court by rule 799 of the Ontario rules need not now be determined. The facts in this case do not, I think, justify the exercise of those powers.\nThis appeal should be dismissed upon the ground stated. I may add that I have doubts as to the jurisdiction of this court. The judgment of the Appeal Court was clearly not a final judgment, nor does it, as I think, come under the other clauses of the statute defining our jurisdiction.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Wells & Macmurchy.\nSolicitors for respondents: Thomson, Henderson & Bell.\n",

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nPartnership moneys-Sequestration of\u2014Contre-lettre.\nIn November, 1886, G. B. by means of a contre lettre became interested in certain real estate transactions in the city of Montreal, effected by one P. S. M. In December, 1886, G. B. brought an action against P. S. M. to have a sale made by the latter to one Barsalou declared fraudulent, and the new purchaser restrained from paying the balance due to the parties named in the deed of sale. A plea of compensation was fyled and pending the action a sequestrator was appointed to whom Barsalou paid over the money. In September, 1887, another action was instituted by G. B. against P. S. M. asking for an account of the different real estate transactions they had conformably to the terms of the contre-lettre. To this action a plea of compensation was also fyled. The Superior Court dismissed the first action on the ground that G. B. had no right of action, but maintained the second action ordering an account to be taken. The Court of Queen's Bench affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the first action and P. S. M, acquiesced in the judgment of the Superior Court on the second action. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench dismissing the first action:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the plea of compensation was unfounded, G. B. having the right to put an end to P. S. M's. mandate by a direct action and therefore until the account which had been ordered in the second action had been rendered the moneys should remain in the hands of the sequestrator appointed with the consent of the parties.\nAPPEAL from the judgment rendered on the 26th. November, 1892, by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) which confirmed a judgment rendered on the 8th September, 1890, by the Superior Court sitting in and for the District of Montreal, whereby one of two actions brought by the appellant against the respondent was dismissed.\nThe general circumstances connected with the institution by the appellant against the respondent of the two actions m question the second of which (no. 1043) was maintained, while the first (no. 1894), with which alone the present appeal is directly concerned, was dismissed, are as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant on the 18th of November, 1882, by deed passed before Mr. H. P. Pepin, notary, sold to the respondent the north-west portion of lot no. 615 of the cadastre of St. Mary's Ward of the city of Montreal. By a counter-letter under private signature of the same date, it was declared that they had a common interest in the said property and it was agreed that if the respondent should sell the same for a price exceeding $10,470 the surplus should be divided equally between them and the price to the said amount be applied as follows: 1st. $3,699 Or about that sum to Selkirk Cross; 2nd. $1,200 to the plaintiff for the purpose of paying the Muldoon estate; 3rd. $2,642 to the defendant, Peter S. Murphy; and 4th. $2,629 to the plaintiff; and that if the price should be less, than said amount of $10470 the 3rd and 4th items should be shared between them pro rata.\nThe property was sold to one Barsalou for $13,322.65 and the deed to Barsalou showed that the whole $13,382.60 was payable to respondent and others, there being nothing whatever mentioned in it as coming to the appellant.\nAppellant then brought an action against the respondent and while reserving his recourse upon an action of account against respondent prayed that by a judgment of the court the deed should be rectified in accordance with the termes of the contre-lettre and that the miss en cause Maurice Barsalou, be ordered to retain in his hands or to deposit with the treasurer of the Province, the balance of the price due by him, until the amount coming to the plaintiff should have been determined upon a settlement of account between him and the defendant, Peter S. Murphy.\nThe action of account was subsequently taken.\nTo the first action the respondent denied the right of action and the alleged fraud, and also pleaded compensation; and to the second suit he pleaded that the suit, although well founded in the abstract, had become unnecessary on account of the pleas by him produced in the first action in which he had incorporated the account now sought to be obtained and renewed his account and prayed for a judicial declaration of its correctness as well as for a dismissal of this second suit\nBoth suits were conducted pari passu in the court of original jurisdiction, the proof adduced being common to both, and were finally decided on the same day by Mr. Justice Wurtele. The first action was dismissed and an account ordered to be taken in the second action. The respondent acquiesced in the judgment of the second action, but the appellant appealed from the judgment in the first suit and the Court of Queen's Bench affirmed Mr. Justice Wurtele's judgment.\nBarnard Q.C. for appellant, contended that George Bury had never lost his proprietary rights in the property sold, and if so the action had been wrongfully dismissed, citing and relying on Pothier, Mandat ([1]); Laurent ([2]); Guyot vo. Acte Conservatoire ([3]); Ferri\u00e8re Dict., vo. Acle Conservatoire ([4]); Pigeau, Proc. ([5]); Thurber v. Holland, ([6]); Wyatt v. Senecal ([7]); Henderson v. Tremblay ([8]); Prince v. Jones & Laurin ([9]); Cryan v. Cryan ([10]); White v. Murphy ([11]); Barnard v. Maison ([12]); Taylor v. Wallbridge ([13]); Faulds v. Harper ([14]); Bar\/on v. Muir ([15]).\nF. D. Monck Q.C. for respondent contended that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada should be affirmed.\n1st Because by the terms of the memorandum in writing of the 10th November, 1882, and the sale of the same date, the appellant had a personal recourse only against the respondent and no jus in re entitling him to follow the property into the hands of third parties and sequestrate its price.\n2nd. Because, even if the fraudulent acts alleged by appellant had existed, he could not obtain relief in the manner he has sought to do by the present proceedings, but should have conformed to Title I of Book II of the Code of Civil Procedure of Lower Canada.\n3rd. Because appellant has totally failed to prove the acts of fraud by him alleged.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fournier.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Cet appel est d'un jugement rendu le 26 novembre 1892, par la cour du Banc de la Reine, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, en appel, confirmant un jugement rendu par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, renvoyant l'action en cette cause.\nLe demandeur, appelant, all\u00e9guait dans son action, que le 18 novembre 1882, par acte pass\u00e9 devant Mtre Pepin notaire, il avait vendu au d\u00e9fendeur la partie nord-ouest du lot n\u00b0 615 du cadastre du quartier Sainte-Marie de la ville de Montr\u00e9al, mais que la dite vente \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'une contre-lettre contenant la transaction r\u00e9ellement intervenue entre les parties, laquelle est comme suit:\nCONTRE-LETTRE.\nMONTREAL, 18th Nov., 1892.\nWe, the undersigned, having a common interest in the property-being the North-west part of lot 615 in St. Mary's Ward.\nDo agree as follows:\nIt is understood that should Mr. Murphy sell said property for an amount exceeding $10,400.00 (ten thousand four hundred and seventy dollars) the surplus shall be divided between us by equal shares, the price of sale to such extent to be applied as follows: 1st, $3,699.00 or about that sum to S. Cross; 2nd, $1,200.00 to Mr. Bury, for the purpose of paying Muldoon's estate; 3rd, $2,642.00 to P. S. Murphy; 4th, $2,929.00 to G. Bury. And should the price of sale be less than said amount of $10.470, the 3rd and 4th items shall be shared between the parties at pro rata.\n(Signed) GEORGE BURY,\nP. S. MURPHY.\nComme on le voit cette contre-lettre d\u00e9clare que malgr\u00e9 la dite vente les parties, appelant et intim\u00e9, out un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun dansa dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elles d\u00e9clarent de plus que dans le cas o\u00f9 I\u2019 intim\u00e9 trouverait un acqu\u00e9reur, le prix serait distribu\u00e9 entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e dans la dite lettre.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fut vendue \u00e0 Barsalou pour $13,3826.00, mais au lieu des $5,000 au moins qui d'apr\u00e8s la base de la contre-lettre aurait d\u00fb revenir \u00e0 l'appelant, la vente faite \u00e0 Barsalou fait voir que tout le prix de $13382600 \u00e9tait attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et \u00e0- d'autres personnes y d\u00e9nomm\u00e9es, et qu'aucune somme quelconque n'\u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9e comme revenant \u00e0 l'appelant.\nLa transaction fut effectu\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante: Perry, un pr\u00eate-nom auquel l'intim\u00e9 avait d'abord vendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour un prix nominal, la revendit ensuite \u00e0 Barsalou et en re\u00e7ut en apparence la somme de $1,382.60, comptant, taudis que en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le montant fut pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. La balance de $12,000 payable par Barsalou en cinq ans devait aller comme suit: $8,500 \u00e0 Rea un autre pr\u00eate-nom dont la r\u00e9clamation n'\u00e9tait tout au plus de $4,206.68 et $564 \u00e0 Elizabeth Lane, et la balance $2,936, \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame qui n'avait droit en vertu de la contre-lettre qu'\u00e0 la somme de $2,642 Il ne restait rien du prix de vente pour l'appelant.\nCelui-ci ayant r\u00e9clame sa part du prix de vente que l'intim\u00e9 lui refusa il intenta sa pr\u00e9sente action all\u00e9guant qu'il avait un jus in r\u00e9 dans le prix de vente, et que la v\u00e9ritable position de Perry et de Rea \u00e9tait telle que ci-dessus all\u00e9gu\u00e9, et ayant mis en cause toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, il concluait \u00e0 ce que son droit \u00e0 une partie du prix de vente fut reconnu, qu'il fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Rea n'avait droit qu'\u00e0 $4,206.68, et de plus qu'il fut ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 Barsalou de retenir le prix de vente entre ses mains jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le montant pr\u00e9cis lui revenant d'apr\u00e8s la contre-lettre fut d\u00e9termin\u00e9 sur un compte rendu l\u00e9galement.\nL'intim\u00e9 plaida \u00e0 cette action que l'appelant n'avait aucune r\u00e9clamation. Qu'ainsi qu'il apparaissait par le compte offert par l'intim\u00e9, le plus qu'il pouvait r\u00e9clamer en vertu de la contre-lettre \u00e9tait $3727.40 tandis que l'intim\u00e9 avait contre lui une r\u00e9clamation de $15,593 qu'il offrait en compensation. Ce plaidoyer n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9. Un semblable plaidoyer fut oppose \u00e0 l'action en reddition de compte et renvoy\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9 acquies\u00e7ant au jugement.\nDans ce plaidoyer l'intim\u00e9 admet que Perry n'est qu'un pr\u00eate-nom, et qu'afin de ne laisser aucune balance comme lui revenant, il a stipul\u00e9 que le prix de vente .serait payable partie pour les taxes, partie au dit sieur Rea, et partie \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame; qu'il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat et l'est encore \u00e0 rendre compte du dit prix de vente aux termes de la contre-lettre. Le plaidoyer all\u00e8gue aussi que la r\u00e9clamation originaire de l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teinte par les diverses transactions cit\u00e9es dans son plaidoyer, lesquelles ont eu l'effet de le constituer d\u00e9biteur de l'intim\u00e9 pour un montant beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui qui pouvait lui revenir, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ii n'\u00e9tait plus cr\u00e9ancier, et n'a pas droit de demander le s\u00e9questre du prix de vente. C'est alors que l'appelant a porte contre l'intim\u00e9 une action en reddition de compte qui est encore pendante. L'intim\u00e9 a contest\u00e9 cette action sur le principe quo cette action \u00e9tait inutile puisqu'il avait d\u00e9dia rendu compte sur la premi\u00e8re action, le plaidoyer de compensation produit contre cette action fut offert de nouveau contre la seconde action.\nLe jugement dont se plaint l'appelant a renvoy\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re action; celle dont il s'agit sur le pr\u00e9sent appel l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 sur le principe que l'appelant en s'en rapportant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 pour la vente de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en le constituant son pr\u00eate-nom, a perdu ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le prix de vente et n'a plus maintenant qu'un recours personnel contre l'intim\u00e9,\u2014qu'en cons\u00e9quence il n'a pas droit de prendre contre Barsalou, mis en cause des conclusions de la nature d'une saisie-conservatoire. Qu'ayant perdu ses droits dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du prix il a aussi perdu ses droits \u00e0 l'exercice d'un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 conservatoire.\nMais est-il vrai que par la vente qu'il a faite \u00e0 Murphy l'appelant ait perdu ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur le prix de vente ? L'acte de vente intervenu entre eux n'est que la convention apparente la convention secr\u00e8te contenue dans la contre-lettre est la convention v\u00e9ritable entre eux, qui est la contre-lettre. A l'\u00e9gard de l'appelant Murphy l'acqu\u00e9reur apparent n'est qu'un mandataire dont les droits et obligations sont r\u00e9gis par la loi du mandat. Comme mandataire ii n'a aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre de l'appelant ([16]). Il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 par la contre-lettre que 16 vendeurs et l'acqu\u00e9reur ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat commun dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. Le jugement de l'honorable juge W\u00fcrselen sur l'action en reddition de compte reconna\u00eet les droits de l'appelant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en d\u00e9clarant qu'il consid\u00e8re l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 comme des associes anonymes dans cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL'intim\u00e9 Murphy a vendu \u00e0 Perry comme pr\u00eate-nom, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 commune des deux parties, et Perry l'a ensuite revendue \u00e0 Barsalou; mais l'intim\u00e9 a admis et reconnu que cette vente est simul\u00e9e et faite par lui par l'interm\u00e9diaire de Perry et comme on l'a vu plus haut par les d\u00e9tails de cet acte de vente au lieu de $5,000 au moins qui aurait d\u00fb revenir \u00e0 l'appelant d'apr\u00e8s la contre-lettre le montant entier du prix de vente $13 882.60 fut enti\u00e8rement attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et \u00e0 d'autres personnes ne laissant absolument rien pour l'appelant Cette distribution du prix de vente est en violation directe des termes de la contre-lettre et donne un droit d'action \u00e0 l'appelant pour faire d\u00e9clarer qu'elle sera faite suivant les termes de la contre-lettre qui contient la v\u00e9ritable convention entre l'appelant et l'intime.\nMais comme \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, les contre-lettres n'ont point d'effet et que c'est la convention apparente ici, l'acte de. vente par Perry \u00e0 Barsalou qui r\u00e8gle leurs droits, ce dernier aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 justifiable de payer le prix de vente suivant la distribution qui en est faite par son acte d'acquisition, si l'appelant n'avait, en le mettant en cause inform\u00e9 le dit Barsalou, de ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans une partie du prix de vente et demand\u00e9 la suspension du paiement jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la cour ait d\u00e9finitivement prononc\u00e9 sur les droits respectifs des parties dans le dit prix de vente. Mais les parties ayant de consentement r\u00e9gl\u00e9 cet incident il ne reste alors \u00e0 la cour qu'\u00e0 leur donner la sanction judiciaire. En cons\u00e9quence, l'appelant a droit aux conclusions qu'il a prises contre Barsalou au sujet du paiement du prix de vente.\nJe suis d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondent's plea of compensation was under the circumstances totally unfounded in law. If he had been paid by Barsalou and was sued by the appellant for his share of the price then he might have pleaded compensation. But such is not the appellant's action, and could not have been for the good reason that the price of sale was yet unpaid and still remained in Barsalou's hands when it was instituted. The appellant had a perfect right, it seems to me, to say to Barsalou, putting Murphy, respondent, en cause, \" a part of that price of sale belongs to me and I ask the court to so declare and order that you pay it to me.\" He asks less than that, that is to say, he merely concludes by a prayer that Barsalou pay the money in to court or in to the Treasurer's hands till it has been ascertained what, as between him and the respondent, is his precise share of the price of sale. To this the respondent says: True it is that a part of that price of sale belongs to you, but you owe me a great deal more, and I ask that Barsalou pay me the whole amount so that I get paid for what you owe me. It is thus clear in my opinion that it is the respondent who tries to get in a side way a seizure of what Barsalou has in his hands belonging to the appellant. The appellant merely rededicates his property. The respondent wants to be paid upon that property, but he has no lien nor privilege upon it, and he cannot, having admitted that it was for part appellant's property, prevent Barsalou from paying it or handing it over to the appellant upon the mere pretence that appellant owes him a debt totally unconnected with it. The court below rightly dismissed that plea but upon what ground they also dismiss the action I cannot understand. Of the two actions it is the second it seems to me that was the least necessary the court under the circumstances should have ordered it to be joined to the first to be proceeded upon as a separate issue between the appellant and the respondent, the first remaining in abeyance till it was determined what amount, if any, is due to the appellant by the respondent.\nHad the appellant chosen he certainly might have allowed Barsalou to pay the respondent and then taken a personal action against respondent. But he was not obliged to let Barsalou so pay to respondent his share of the price. He had the right to put an end to respondent's mandate by a direct action as he has virtually done. There is no saisie conservatoire in this.\nBy a consent order these moneys are now in the hands of the cashier of the Bank Jacques Cartier. The appellant thus got from the court below all he asked for plus the dismissal of his action. Of this last part he, in my opinion, has reason to complain, and I think that the appeal should be allowed with costs in the three courts against Murphy.\nThe parties will probably agree as to the form in which the judgment is to be entered. As the moneys are now in de Martigny's hands the judgment will have to be I presume that they remain there till final judgment on the other action.\nGWYNNE and SEDGEWICK JJ. concurred in allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Barnard & Barnard.\nSolicitor for respondent : F.

Shortly after a blast went off and stones thrown by the explosion fell on the roof of a shed in which C. was standing and frightened the horses which began to run. C. at once ran out in front of them and endeavoured to stop them but could not and in trying to get away he was injured. He brought an action against the Municipality conducting the blasting operations to recover damages for such injury.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the negligent manner in which the blast was set off was the proximate and direct cause of the injury to C.; that such negligent act immediately produced in him the state of mind which instinctively impelled him to attempt to stop the horses; and that he did no more than any reasonable man would have done under the circumstances.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nMeredith Q.C. for the appellants. The rule of law as to proximate cause of injury is stated in Addison on Torts[2]; Pollock on Torts[3]; and Cooley on Torts[4]. The following cases note the distinction between efforts to save life and those to save property. Anderson v. Northern Railway Co.[5]; Eckert v. Long Island Railroad Co.[6]\nThe learned counsel cited also Cook v. Johnston[7]; Marble v. City of Worcester[8]; Hay v. Great Western Railway Co.[9]; Cox v. Burbidge[10] and Lee v. Riley[11].\nHutcheson for the respondent referred to Sword v. Cameron[12].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question which arises in this case is not (as it appears to me to have been treated) whether the plaintiff has been, by any contributory negligence of his own, deprived of a right of action for an injury which, apart from any such contributory negligence, the evidence sufficiently shows to have been caused by some negligence of the defendants, but whether the plaintiff\u2019s own statement of the manner in which he sustained the injury of which he complains, and the evidence in support of such statement, do sufficiently show that the negligence with which the defendants are charged was the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff. The question whether a plaintiff has been, by his own contributory negligence, deprived of his right of action for an injury charged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendants can never arise until the liability of the defendants has been sufficiently established by evidence apart from the question of contributory negligence; that is to say, until it is sufficiently shown in evidence that the negligence of the defendants was the proximate cause of the injury complained of. If it was not the defendants are not liable, and no question of contributory negligence arises. Now in the present case the sole question, as it appears to me, is: Whether the act which is charged as negligence upon the part of the defendants, assuming it to have been proved, can upon the evidence be said in law to have been the proximate cause of the injury which the plaintiff has sustained. It is no doubt a matter of considerable difficulty in many cases to draw a precise line between the proximate and the remote causes of anything, but in the present case I must say that, in my opinion, the act charged as the defendants\u2019 negligence, regarding it as proved, cannot be said to be in law the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff. We have been referred to several cases, chiefly in the American courts, and almost all arising upon a question as to contributory negligence, and none of which can, I think, be said to be conclusive in favour of the maintenance of the present action. In Liming v. Illinois Central Railway Company[13] the case arose upon demurrer and upon an article of the Code of Iowa which enacted that:\nAny corporation operating a railway shall be liable for all damages by fire that is set out or caused by operating any such railway.\nThe petition of claim alleged that a fire, caused by defendants\u2019 engines, set fire to a barn of plaintiff\u2019s neighbour, and that while the plaintiff was assisting his neighbour in getting his horses out of the stable in which they were the fire seized the stable, and that the plaintiff in escaping therefrom was injured by the fire, through which, in order to escape, he had to pass. Now in that case, upon the pleadings which, by the demurrer, were admitted, it could not be doubted that the injury sustained by the plaintiff was directly caused by the fire which was caused by the defendants, and for all damages arising from which they were made liable by statute, so that the fire was clearly alleged to have been the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury, and it was decided that the plaintiff, having been injured by such fire, it could not be said as a proposition of law that his voluntarily assisting his neighbour deprived him of his right of action which sufficiently appeared upon the pleadings. The authority of the case seems to be limited to this, that a question of contributory negligence cannot be raised by demurrer.\nIn Twomley v. Central Park Railroad Co.[14] the question was also one of contributory negligence. The jury found that, and there was no doubt that, the negligent and reckless conduct of the defendant\u2019s servants had placed the plaintiff in such a position of imminent peril for his life between two hazards viz., a dangerous leap from the moving car or to remain in the car at certain peril. The jury found that the plaintiff upon the instant jumping from the car whereby he was injured acted as a person of ordinary prudence naturally would do in such circumstances, and that he had not therefore been guilty of contributory negligence. In Wasmer v. Delaware and Lackawanna Railway Co.[15], the train which killed the intestate was the undoubted proximate cause of death; that train was running at a speed much in excess of the rate prescribed by statute in towns (the accident having occurred in a town). So that, apart from contributory negligence, there was quite sufficient to constitute the defendant\u2019s negligence the proximate cause of the death, and the question left to the jury was whether the deceased having crossed the track in front of the approaching engine after his horse which frightened by the engine had got on the track was or was not under the circumstances in evidence contributory negligence so as to deprive his administratrix of her right of action. Whether the decision upon the question as one of contributory negligence is one of which we can approve I do not express an opinion; for my purpose it is sufficient that the question was one of contributory negligence and not of proximate cause. So in Rexter v. Starin[16] the question was one of contributory negligence also. There was no doubt that the collision between the canal boat of the plaintiff and the barge of the defendant by which collision the plaintiff was injured was the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury; there was no question or doubt that the collision was caused by the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants; but the contention and question was as to whether the plaintiff had lost his right of action for the injury which he had received from the collision by reason of contributory negligence of his own; what he had done was, being in another boat, when he saw the collision about to take place he ran to his own boat to try and prevent the collision and this was held and beyond all question rightly not to have been contributory negligence. It seems to me difficult to conceive how such a question could in such a case be raised for the contributory negligence related to the cause of the injury which the plaintiff had sustained, namely, the collision, and not to the consequences resulting from the collision which beyond all question was caused by the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants. In Donahoe v. Wabash St. Louis and Pacific Railway Co.[17] the law as to a person voluntarily exposing himself to danger in order to rescue another person whose life is exposed to danger from an approaching railway train is thus stated\u2014 It is only when a railroad company by its own negligence creates danger to, or through its negligence is about to strike a person in danger that a third person can voluntarily expose himself to peril in an effort to rescue such person and recover for an injury he may sustain in that attempt. For instance, if a man is lying on the track of a railway intoxicated or asleep but in such a position that he could not be seen by the men managing an approaching train and they had no warning of his situation, and another seeing his danger should go upon the track to save his life and be injured by the train he could not recover unless the trainmen were guilty of negligence with respect to the rescuer occurring after the beginning of his attempt. If the railroad company is not chargeable with negligence with respect to the person in danger the case of the person who attempted to rescue him and was injured must be determined with reference to the negligence of the company in its conduct towards him in his making the attempt. In other words the negligence of the company as to the person in danger is imputed to the company with respect to him who attempts the rescue and if not liable for negligence as to such person then it is only liable for negligence occurring with regard to the rescuer after his efforts to rescue the person in danger commenced.\nAssuming this to be a sound exposition of the law I fail to see what support it can afford to the plaintiff\u2019s action in the present case. If a person, attempting to rescue another from danger impending from an approaching train, can only have an action against the railroad company for an injury received by him in his attempt in the case where the person attempted to be rescued, if injured by the impending danger, would have had an action against the company, or in case of negligent injury committed to himself personally after the commencement of the attempt to rescue, the principle involved in that case cannot, I think, govern a case where a person voluntarily rushes into danger in the manner the plaintiff did, not to save a person, nor even his horses, from any danger impending from any approaching act of the defendants, but to prevent his horses running away, even though their starting to run was attributable to fright occasioned by some past negligent act of the defendants. The question whether the past negligence can in law be said to be the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff in the present case still remains, and must, I think, be determined upon other considerations than those involved in the above case, assuming the judgment therein to be sound.\nIn Linnehan v. Sampson[18] all that was determined was that the question in that case, viz., whether the injured man exercised due care, was a question for the jury\u2014that also was a question of contributory negligence. For in the absence of such negligence, it is clear the owner of the bull would be liable for all injuries committed by it when being led in a public place, without the use of means sufficient to prevent its doing injury to persons. In Woods v. Caledonian Ry. Co.[19], a young woman was killed by a railway train as she was crossing a railway where it crossed a highway, and it was held that as she had gotten upon the railway through the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants in not keeping gates across the highway shut, as they were obliged by statute to do, that negligence was sufficient proximate cause of the accident. Sufficient proximate cause is there defined to be, \u201ca cause, of which the accident was a sufficiently natural and to be looked for consequence.\u201d In Harris v. Mobbs[20], the wrongful leaving of the van and plough in the highway, which caused the mare which the deceased was driving to kick, whereby deceased was killed, was held by the court, though not without considerable hesitation, to be, within the meaning of the law, the proximate cause of the accident, that is to say, that the kicking which caused the death was the natural and necessary consequence of the act complained of, and that as the driver of the mare was not aware she was a kicker, and was not shown by his driving to have been guilty of contributory negligence, his executors were entitled to recover. In Rigby v. Hewitt[21] the plaintiff was a passenger on the top of an omnibus which was struck by an omnibus of the defendants, which was driven with such violence and in such a manner that the omnibus on which the plaintiff was was forced against a lamp post, by which means the plaintiff was thrown off with considerable violence and injured. The jury was directed to ascertain whether the accident arose from the negligence of the driver of the defendant\u2019s omnibus, and they found that it was. Upon a new trial being moved for on the ground that the learned judge who tried the case refused to charge the jury that if the accident was in part occasioned by the misconduct of the person driving the omnibus on which the plaintiff was the plaintiff could not recover, the facts being that both omnibusses were being driven at a great and excessive rate, the court refused a new trial, saying that while, generally speaking, where an injury occurs from the misconduct of another the party injured has a right to recover from the injuring company all the consequences of that injury, there could be no doubt that every person who does a wrong is at least responsible for all the mischevous consequences that may reasonably be expected to result, under ordinary circumstances, from such misconduct.\nIn Firth v. Bowling Iron Co.[22] the plaintiff\u2019s cow was killed by swallowing with the grass some shreds of wire rope which the defendants used for fencing their premises from the plaintiff\u2019s fields, and which from long use had decayed and broken off and fallen into the plaintiff\u2019s grass. That was a clear case of injury the direct proximate cause of which was the neglect of the defendants to maintain the wire fence in a good and safe condition.\nIn McMahon v. Field[23] the question arose upon contract which involves some elements of inquiry different from those involved in cases where negligence on the part of the defendant is charged as being the cause, that is to say, the proximate cause of the injury complained of; and in that case, following Hadley v. Baxendale[24], it was held that it was for the court to determine whether, upon the evidence and finding of the jury upon the points of fact properly determinable by them, the breach of contract established was in law the proximate cause of the injury. Woods v. Caledonia Ry. Co.[25] and Harris v. Mobbs[26] were cases of injury charged to have been caused by negligence of the defendants, and there also the court assumed the duty of determining whether the acts of negligence established could in law be held to be the proximate cause of the injuries complained of. In the former of these two cases it was held as already shown that the killing of the girl by the train on the railway on which she had gotten by the wrongful and negligent conduct of the defendant\u2019s servants in not keeping the gate across the highway closed, as by statute they were required to do, was a sufficiently natural and to be looked for consequence of the neglect as to make such neglect the proximate cause of the accident. So in Harris v. Mobbs26 the conclusion at which the court although not without considerable hesitation and doubt arrived, was that the kicking by the mare of the person driving it was the continuous, natural and necessary consequence of the van and plough being in the highway, so as to make the negligence of the person who left them the proximate cause of the kicking by which the driver was killed. The circumstances of those cases were very different from those of the present case. So likewise was the case of Twomley v. Central Park Railroad Co.[27], if that case should be regarded as a decision upon the question of proximate cause and not upon that of contributing negligence. The person who jumped from the train there did so for the purpose of endeavouring thereby to escape from a more imminent and certain peril to his life if he had remained where he was, while in the present case the plaintiff was injured by his exposing himself when in perfect safety to the peril of suffering the injury which he did suffer. The jury have found that the defendants\u2019 servants were guilty of negligence in not properly covering their blast when blasting in the street, and that the plaintiff exposed himself in trying to save his property, but that they considered such his action justifiable. What they meant by saying they considered his action in trying to save his property justifiable does not appear to be quite clear. What the plaintiff was trying to do was to stop his horses which were starting to run away. What the jury meant may possibly have been that they thought that the plaintiff may justifiably have expected that he might succeed in stopping the horses without suffering any injury, but what the jury may have meant does not appear to me to be important. The question to which this latter answer was given and the answer itself relate to the question of contributory negligence which no doubt would have been a question for the jury if the act of negligence of which the defendants were guilty as found by the jury could in law be said to be the proximate cause of the injury, but whether it can or not is a question for the court upon the evidence, and is as it appears to me the sole question in the present case. Now as to the evidence upon which that question turns there is no dispute, assuming as I do that the negligence found by the jury in the blast not being properly covered caused the plaintiff\u2019s horses to start to run. His horses and another team of horses of another man were in a lumber yard near which the blast took place, standing in a narrow space between a shed and the piles of lumber in the yard. The plaintiff was in the yard or shed conversing with the owner of the yard and lumber, having left his team in charge of the other man who thus had the two teams, his own and that of the plaintiff to look after; immediately upon the blast taking place the plaintiff\u2019s team or both of the teams started to run and the one man was unable to manage both. The plaintiff then, while in safety where he was, rushed forward to try and catch his own horses; to do so he had to get round the team of the other man; this, however, he was unable to do and almost immediately upon his rushing out from where he was to try and stop his horses he was knocked down by the other team, and was run over by it and injured. The question now is: Can the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants as found by the jury be said to be in law the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff? and I am of opinion upon principle and in perfect consistency with the authorities that it cannot.\nIt is said that the persons engaged in the blasting should reasonably have expected that there might be teams standing in the lumber yard, and that stones from the blast if not sufficiently covered might reach the shed and that thereby horses standing there might naturally be expected to run away, but whether such expectations would or would not be natural and reasonable expectations, I do not think we can impute as reasonable expectations to be entertained by the defendants or their servants engaged in the blasting, that the owner of one of the teams being there should, as the plaintiff said, leave his team in charge of another person having a team of his own to look after, or that having done so he should voluntarily expose himself to such imminent peril of injury to himself as the evidence shows that the plantiff did. If the court in Harris v. Mobbs were justified in having had considerable difficulty in arriving at the conclusion which they did in that case, that the negligence complained of there was a sufficiently proximate cause of the injury, we should, I think, without difficulty arrive at the conclusion in the present case that the defendants\u2019 negligence as found by the jury cannot in law be said to have been the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff.\nThe appeal, I think, should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed in the court below.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This action is brought to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been sustained by the respondent through the negligence of the appellants in conducting certain blasting operations in the town of Prescott. The appellants\u2019 servants were constructing a drain in one of the streets of the town, in which work it was necessary to blast rock by means of gunpowder. In making these blasts care was not taken (as found by the jury), to confine the broken rock to the trenches, and it happened that on the occasion in question a shower of stones was thrown up into the air which, in falling upon the roof of an adjoining building, frightened the plaintiff\u2019s team of horses which caused them to run away eventually doing the injury which the plaintiff complains of.\nThe plaintiff who is a farmer had driven into the town his span of horses and wagon and had proceeded to the lumber yard of one Elliott, entering by a gate at the east side of the yard on George Street, and after driving along a lane or passage way which extended to a gate opposite to the one by which he had entered he stopped his team, and handed the lines to one Bennett who had also driven in in the same way and was standing in front of his span of horses and wagon in the lane or passage way. The lumber yard is bounded on the north by Wood Street where the blasting operations were being carried on, and it was upon the roof of a shed built on this street and part of the lumber yard that the stones fell. As soon as the horses began to run the plaintiff who was in the shed observed them, and ran out in front of them for the purpose if possible of stopping them. He, however, found this impossible and in endeavouring to get away was in some way struck by them and thrown down and injured. If he had remained in the shed where he was, leaving the horses to their fate, while they may have been injured and possibly done injury he would have remained uninjured and the particular damage complained of would not have happened.\nThe case was tried before the Hon. Mr. Justice Street and a jury at Brockville. The jury found that the defendants were guilty of the negligence which caused the injury to the plaintiff; that the negligence consisted in not properly covering their blast; and that the plaintiff\u2019s action in exposing himself to danger for the purpose of saving his property was justifiable; and they assessed the damages at $3,000.\nUpon an appeal to the Chancery Division before the learned Chancellor and Mr. Justice Meredith the defendants\u2019 appeal was dismissed. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the appeal was likewise dismissed, Mr. Justice Burton dissenting. The finding of the jury upon the question of the defendants\u2019 negligence in connection with their blasting operations was hardly questioned before us at the argument, nor did we think it could be questioned. The defendants were bound to use those ordinary appliances which are well known for the purpose of preventing what happened in the present case. There are appliances in ordinary use for this purpose and the failure of the corporation to use them was in law negligence.\nThe main argument, however, upon which the defendants claimed immunity from liability was that their negligent act was not the proxima causa of the damage to the plaintiff; that it was the act of the plaintiff himself in voluntarily rushing from a place of safety to a place of danger that caused the accident.\nThe rule upon the question of proximate cause is stated by Addison[28] as follows:\u2014\nThe general rule of law is that whoever does an illegal or wrongful act is answerable for all the consequences that ensue in the ordinary and natural course of events, though those consequences be immediately and directly brought about by the intervening agency of others, provided the intervening agents were set in motion by the primary wrong-doer, or provided their acts causing the damage were the necessary or legal and natural consequence of the original wrongful act. If the wrong and the legal damage are not known by common experience to be usually in sequence and the damage does not, according to the ordinary course of events, follow from the wrong, the wrong and the damage are not sufficiently conjoined or concatenated as cause and effect to support an action.\nWhere there is no reason to expect it and no knowledge in the person doing the wrongful act that such a state of things exists as to render the damage probable, if the injury does result it is generally considered that the wrongful act is not the proximate cause of the injury so as to render the wrong-doer liable to an action.\nPollock in his work on Torts,[29] says:\nThe view which I shall endeavor to justify is that for the purpose of civil liability those consequences and those only are deemed immediate, proximate, or to anticipate a little natural and possible which a person of average competence and knowledge, being in like case with the person whose conduct is complained of and having the like opportunities of observation, might be expected to foresee as likely to follow upon such conduct.\nCooley in his work on Torts,[30] says:\nWhen the act or omission complained of is not in itself a distinct wrong and can only become a wrong to any particular individual through injurious consequences resulting therefrom, this consequence must not only be shown, but it must be so connected by averment and evidence with the act or omission as to appear to have resulted therefrom according to the ordinary course of events, and as a proximate result of a sufficient cause.\nEach of these statements, I apprehend, contains a substantially accurate definition of the law as applied to the present case, and the question is, whether the accident may be considered to be the \u201cnecessary,\u201d \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d consequence of the original wrongful act. Was it the natural or probable result of that act? Did it follow upon it in the ordinary course of events?\nPollock, in another place[31], refers to the standard of duty as being \u201cthe ideal behaviour of a reasonable man,\u201d and the determination of this case depends upon the view that that ideal man would take as to the probable consequences of the defendants\u2019 wrong-doing were he an eye-witness of it. Were he from some safe point observing it his reflections would be, I think, somewhat as follows:\u2014\u201cThese workmen are making a great mistake in not covering that blast. Why don\u2019t they stop the stones from flying in the air? They may fall upon people using the streets, and do damage; they may fall upon adjacent houses and do damage; they may fall upon horses standing upon the street of the neighbourhood and do damage. If they don\u2019t fall, the noise they make may frighten them and they will run away. The person in charge will naturally rush to stop them, and damage may happen to him.\u201d\nAny or all of these events the observer would think of as possible or likely to happen in consequence of what they were doing. Speaking from my own knowledge and observation a person in charge of horses naturally and instinctively rushes to save them or stop them when he sees them frightened and trying to run away. It is as natural and likely that he, without thinking of consequences, will rush to their rescue as that they themselves will be in a condition of alarm. The fright of the horses, as well as the efforts of the coachman to regain control, are both events which naturally followed upon the noise produced by the falling stones.\nThe present case, therefore, is one, in my judgment, which comes within the rule above stated. The accident followed upon the negligent act in a natural order of sequence. It was an event likely to happen, probable to happen, natural to happen, as the direct and immediate result of that negligent act.\nBut the appellants urge that it was the plaintiff\u2019s own wilful act that was the immediate cause of the accident, namely, his voluntarily leaving the place of safety in which he was at the time of the explosion and exposing himself to danger, and they invoke the principle that if between the agency setting at work the mischief and the actual mischief done there intervenes a conscious agency which might or should have averted the mischief the original setter in motion of the mischievous agency ceases to be liable. But in the present case it was the negligent act of the defendants that immediately produced in the plaintiff that state of mind which instinctively, as I believe, impelled him towards his horses; he did no more than any reasonable man, under the circumstances, would have done; his attempt was futile; it may have been a rash thing for him to attempt; but he did what any other man, reasonable or otherwise, situated as he was and in the same state of mind in which he was, might have been expected to do, that situation and that state of mind having been immediately and directly caused by the defendants\u2019 act. In the leading case of Scott v. Shepherd[32]\u2014the Squib case\u2014the ground of the decision was that the act of the intermediate persons who threw the squib was involuntary, unpremeditated and without distinct and independent volition, and therefore, as the act was instinctive, the actual proximate agent of the injury was not the responsible agent. It was the act of the defendant that placed these intermediate persons in such an excited or peculiar state of mind that they naturally threw from them the instrument which occasioned damage to the plaintiff. Persons who in a sudden emergency are distracted by terror, and thus between two causes choose the wrong one, are not disentitled to recover. The very state of incapacity to judge calmly is produced by the defendant\u2019s negligent act. To hold that a plaintiff is disentitled to recover in such a case would be to hold that the defendant, having aggravated his negligence by those circumstances of terror which deprived the plaintiff of his power to avoid the consequences, or which, irresistibly by the plaintiff, drove him upon the danger, could set up a state of terror produced by his wrongful act as a protection against the consequences. Beven on Negligence[33]. Jones v. Boyce[34]. The principle is thus laid down by Johnston J. in the New York Court of Appeals in Coulter v. The American Merchants\u2019 Union Express Company[35]. There can be no rule of law which imposes it as a duty upon one over whom danger impends by the negligence of another to incur greater danger by delaying his efforts to avoid it until its exact nature and measure are ascertained. The instinctive effort on the part of the plaintiff to avoid a danger did not relieve the defendant from responsibility.\nIt is not necessary in the present case to consider those American cases which were discussed at length at the argument in which it would appear to have been held that any person was justified in exposing himself to danger with a view of saving either life or property. If I while walking on the sidewalk see a pair of horses running away, I, for my part, would not feel called upon to incur the risk of attempting to stop them. That, however, is not the present case. It is not, it seems to me, necessary to cite authorities other than those already given in support of the general principles above laid down. The question in each case has been: Was the damage the natural result of the defendants\u2019 act, notwithstanding there may have been agencies intervening between the act or omission complained of and the damage sustained, or was the damage naturally referable to some cause altogether independent of the defendants\u2019 act? A few cases, however, may be considered. In Hill v. New River Co.[36] the defendant company had caused a stream of water to spout up in the middle of a highway without making any provision, such as fencing or watching, for the safety of persons using the highway. As the plaintiff\u2019s horse and carriage were being driven along the road the horses shied at the water, dashed across the road and fell into an open excavation on the road side which had been made by persons and for purposes unconnected with the Water Co. It was argued that the proximate cause of the injury complained of was not the unlawful act of the Water Co. but the neglect of the contractors who had made the cutting in leaving it open and unfenced, but the court held that the proximate cause was the first negligent act which drove the carriage and horses into the excavation; in fact it was a natural consequence that frightened horses should bolt off the road; it could not be foreseen exactly where they would go off or what they might run against or fall into, but some such harm as did happen was probable enough and therefore the defendants were liable. In Lynch v. Nurdin[37] the owner of a horse and cart left them unwatched in the street. Some children came up and began playing about the cart and as one of them (the plaintiff in the case) was climbing into the cart another pulled the horse\u2019s bridle; the horse moved on and the plaintiff fell down under the wheel of the cart and was hurt; but the owner who had left the horse and cart was held liable for this injury. It was contended that the one who immediately caused the accident was the child who pulled the horse\u2019s bridle and thereby set it moving, but the court thought it strictly within the provision of the jury to pronounce upon all the circumstances, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was wanting in ordinary care and the harm to the plaintiff was the result of it as might have been expected. So, too, in the the case of Clark v. Chambers[38] the chevaux de frise case. The defendant without authority set a barrier partly armed with spikes across a road subject to other persons\u2019 right of way. An opening was at most times left in the middle of the barrier and was there at the time when the mischief happened. The plaintiff went after dark along this road and through the opening by the invitation of the occupier of one of the houses to which the right of using the road belonged; and in order to go to that house some one, neither the defendant or any one authorized by him, had removed one of the chevaux de frise barriers and set it on end on the foot-path. Returning later in the evening from his friend\u2019s house the plaintiff, after safely passing the central opening above mentioned, turned on to the foot-path; he there came against the chevaux de frise (which he could not see, the night being very dark) and one of the spikes put out his eye. After a verdict for the plaintiff the case was reserved for further consideration and the court held that the damage was nearly enough connected with the defendant\u2019s first wrongful act, namely, obstructing the road with obstructions dangerous to people lawfully using it, for the plaintiff to be entitled to judgment. Cockburn C.J. says:\u2014\nA man who unlawfully places an obstruction across either a public or private way may anticipate the removal of the obstruction by some one entitled to use the way as a thing likely to happen, and if this should be done the probability is that the obstruction so removed will, instead of being carried away altogether, be placed somewhere near\u2014if the obstruction be a dangerous one, wherever placed it may (as was the case here) become a source of damage from which injury to an innocent party might occur, the original author of the mischief should be held responsible.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must fail and that the plaintiff is entitled to maintain his verdict.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: J.K.

For the purpose of getting to and from the steamer there was a plank sidewalk on one side part way down the wharf and persons using it usually turned at the end and passed to the middle of the wharf. Y. and his wife went to meet a passenger expected to arrive by the steamer between seven and eight o'clock one evening in November. They went down the plank sidewalk and instead of turning off at the end, there being no lights and the night being dark, they continued straight down the wharf which narrowed after some distance and formed a jog, on reaching which Y's wife tripped and as her husband tried to catch her they both fell into the water. Forty four days afterwards Mrs. Y. died.\nIn an action by Y. against the company to recover damages occasioned by the death of his wife it appeared that the deceased had not had regular and continual medical treatment after the accident and the doctors who gave evidence at the trial differed as to whether or not the immersion was the proximate cause of her death. The jury when asked: Would the deceased have recovered, notwithstanding the accident, if she had had regular and continual attendance? replied, \"very doubtful.\" A verdict, was found for the plaintiff with $1,500 damages which the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia set aside and ordered a new trial. On appeal from that decision:\nHeld, that Y. and his wife were lawfully upon the wharf at the time of the accident; that in view of the established practice they had a right to assume that they were invited by the company to go on the wharf and assist their freinds in disembarking from the steamer; and that they had a right to expect that the means of approach to the steamer were safe for persons using ordinary care and the company was under an obligation to see that they were safe.\nHeld, further, that it having been proved that the wharf was only rented to the agent because the landlord preferred to deal with him personally and that it was rented for the use of the company whose officers had sole control of it, the company was in possession of it at the time of the accident.\nHeld, also, that the evidence and finding of the jury having left it in doubt that the accident was the proximate cause of Mrs. Y's death, the jury not having been properly instructed as to the liability of the company under the circumstances, and the damages being excessive under the evidence, the order for a new trial should be affirmed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and more fully in the judgment of the court.\nNewcombe for the appellant. As to the right of deceased to be on the wharf see Holmes v. Northeastern Railway Co.[1]; Wright v. London & Northwestern Railway Co.[2].\nAs to the accident being the proximate cause of death see Davis v. Garrett[3]; Sauter v. New York & Hudson River Railroad Co.[4]; Coomes v.

New Brunswick Railway Co. v. Robinson[10]; Morgan v. Vale of Neath Railway Co.[11].\nThe defendant company had no property in the wharf. Wendell v. Baxter[12].\nThe court will not interfere with an order for a new trial. Allcock v. Hall[13].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The defendant is a steamship company owning a steamer, the SS. \"Halifax\" plying weekly between Halifax and Boston. The landing place of the steamer at Halifax was at the wharf known as Noble's wharf. The defendant company used Noble's wharf for that purpose under an arrangement with their general agents Messrs. Chipman Bros., the nominal lessees of the wharf, by which arrangement the defendant company had the privilege without making specific payment therefor of using the wharf and of occupying the store on the wharf and the office at the head of the wharf. The wharf is reached from Water Street by a passage way about 250 feet long. When this passage way reaches the head of the wharf there is an archway with a large gate at its west end the passage under the archway being about 12 or 15 feet wide. Immediately beyond the archway at the head of the wharf, on the occasion of the arrival or departure of the steamer, cabs stand at each side leaving a passage about the same width as that under the archway down the middle of the wharf; this passage under the archway is thus continued along the middle of the wharf. There is also access to the wharf by turning to the left after going through the archway and passing at the head of the cabs standing on the left of the archway, and then turning and going down the wharf by a plank sidewalk running along the north side for about 20 feet, and then turning to the right at the end of the plank sidewalk and passing through a gap left in the line of the cabs for that purpose to the passage way before mentioned along the middle of the wharf. About 50 feet east of the end of the plank sidewalk the wharf narrows a little and there is what is called in the evidence a jog; there is a capsill around the wharf at the jog about 8 inches above the level of the wharf; a short distance beyond the jog there is a fence across the wharf with a gate through which persons coming from or going to the steamer are admitted; beyond this fence there is a freight shed.\nThe SS. \"Halifax\" which is a passenger vessel making weekly trips between Halifax and Boston and carrying large numbers of passengers, arrived at Noble's wharf on November 30th, 1890, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening. Catharine York whose mother was an expected passenger on the steamer went with her husband (the plaintiff), her brother and another to meet her mother. The plaintiff and his wife in going down the wharf did not go down between the two lines of cabs but turned to the left after passing through the archway, went down the plank sidewalk on the north side of the walk and when they reached the end of the plank sidewalk, instead of turning to the right and coming back to the passage way along the middle of the wharf, continued straight along the north side of the wharf to the jog and then turned to the right, and as they did so Mrs. York tripped and as her husband tried to catch her they both fell into the water. Forty-four days afterwards Mrs. York died, and her death is alleged by the plaintiff to have been occasioned by this accident.\nAn action was brought by the plaintiff, who was appointed the administrator of the estate of his wife under the Provincial Act[14] which is substantially a copy of what is known as Lord Campbell's Act, to recover the damages occasioned by her death. The case was tried before Mr. Justice Meagher with a jury. Upon the finding of the jury judgment was entered for the plaintiff for $1,500. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court in banc the verdict was set aside and a new trial ordered, the Chief Justice dissenting. Mr. Justice Weatherbe was of opinion that it was not proved that the submersion of the deceased was the cause of death, nor did he appear to think that the defendants were under any obligation to protect the place where the accident occurred. Mr. Justice Townshend was of opinion that the plaintiff and the deceased were trespassers while on the wharf, or at least had no business there, and could not therefore throw the responsibility of the accident on the defendants. And Mr. Justice Graham thought that the case should be submitted to another jury, to ascertain whether there was a want of proper medical treatment and attendance, and also which one of the causes was the proximate cause of the death.\nI am of opinion that, under the evidence, the plaintiff and his wife were lawfully upon the wharf. The deceased went upon the wharf with the permission and upon the implied invitation of the company for the purpose of meeting her mother, who was in fact a passenger, and assisting her home. In view of the practice which had long previously prevailed she was right in presuming an invitation on the part of the company to go there and assist her friends in disembarking from the steamer. She had equally a right to expect that the means of approach to the steamer were safe for any one using ordinary care, and the company were, I think, under an obligation to see that they were safe.\nThe case is within the principle stated in Smith on Negligence[15] and as illustrated in the cases of Holmes v. North-eastern Railway Company[16]; and of Wright v. London and North-western Railway Company[17], affirmed on appeal[18]. In accordance with the same rule is a decision of Denman J. in Watkins v. Great Western Railway Company[19] where he says: \u2014\nI am of opinion that a railway company keeping open a bridge over their line for the use of their passengers is bound to keep that bridge reasonably safe, and that if in practice the friends of passengers are allowed to see them off by the train and to cross the bridge without asking special permission, the duty of the company in that respect cannot be put down towards them otherwise than it is towards those whom they accompany for such not unreasonable purposes.\nI think that this view is consistent with the case of Corby v. Hill[20] and Smith v. London Docks Company[21]:\u2014\nI regard the passenger's friend so permitted to go along the bridge by constant acquiescence on the part of the railway company as not being in the nature of a person barely licensed to be there but as being invited to go to the same extent as the passenger whom he accompanies, and is there on lawful business in which the passenger and the company have both an interest.\nAnd the rule is the same in the United States[22].\nI am also of opinion that the jury were right in finding that the defendant company were in possession of the wharf at the time of the accident. I gather from the evidence as a whole that the wharf was rented by Mr. Chipman for the use of the company; that it would have been rented in the name of the company except that the landlord preferred leasing it to the company's agent personally and that as a matter of fact the company's officers, as such officers, had sole control of the wharf and regulated the conduct of those having occasion to use it upon the arrival or departure of the steamer. The company, carrying on the business of carriers of passengers by water, inviting as they do the public to use their vessel were bound to use all reasonable efforts to secure the safety of persons who might lawfully come upon their premises. I agree with Mr. Justice Weatherbe that no wharf owner is under any obligation to erect barriers around his wharf with a view to prevent persons from falling into the water; a wharf surrounded by such a structure would cease to be a wharf; nor do I think they were under this obligation as respects the jog where the accident occurred; but the place on the night in question was manifestly a dangerous one; there were no lights near it; it was somewhat in the nature of a trap; the fact that both the husband and wife fell in is some evidence at least that it was dangerous (res ipsa loquitur); and the jury having found that there should have been a light there I am not disposed to disturb their finding on that point.\nI do, however, entertain the doubts expressed by Mr. Justice Weatherbe and Mr. Justice Graham as to whether as a matter of fact the accident in question was the proximate cause of Mrs. York's death; that question, it seems to me, was the crucial one, and it is that question chiefly which is left in doubt, not only by the evidence but by the finding of the jury.\nI have already in the case of the Corporation of the Town of Prescott v. Connell[23], now before this court on appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario, discussed somewhat fully the law as to the remoteness of damage in cases of negligence, and it is therefore unnecessary for me to enter into detail upon the same question here; but so far as the facts are concerned it seems to me that in the present case there is at least ground for believing that Mrs. York would have died when she did and from the same disease even if the accident had not happened at all. This difficulty appears to have pressed itself upon the jury, and when asked: Would the deceased have recovered, notwithstanding the accident, if she had had regular and continual attendance? they replied \"very doubtful.\" The answer to the question implies that she might have recovered. The length of time between the accident and her death would of itself give rise to doubt as to whether it was the accident which set the disease, of which she died, in motion. On the evening of the accident, the 80th November, she was attended by Dr. Jones. He saw her again next morning, when according to him she had recovered from the shock after passing a very good night. She was up afterwards every day and had been going out for seventeen days when she went to Dr. Jones complaining of a pain in the right lung, with a cough. She had not in the mean time seen a medical man or undergone any treatment. The doctor then found a slight derangement of the lung and prescribed a mixture for the cough. During the ten days following she remained in town without treatment and then went to her husband's home in Preston, a distance of several miles. She attended the funeral of her sister who died meanwhile of lung disease. Nineteen days after Dr. Jones had seen her Dr. Weeks, a physician in Dartmouth, near Preston, was called to see her; this was on January 6th. No professional man was ever called to see her after that, and on the 13th January, seven days after Dr. Weeks' first visit, and forty-four days after falling from the wharf, she died. While Dr. Jones testified that her death was due to some acute affection of the lungs, which in all probability was tubercular, an immersion such as she received at that season of the year would in all probability cause disease of the lungs, and might produce fatal results. Dr. Weeks, who was also called by the plaintiff, testified that she should have been under medical care throughout; that acute bronchitis requires constant medical care and treatment; and he comes to the conclusion, and he expressed the opinion, that if she had received continuous medical treatment after the accident there was a fair chance that the disease would not have been established. This is about all the evidence there is to establish the fact that the death of the deceased was occasioned by immersion.\nI do not wish to express here any opinion to the contrary; that is the \"function of the jury;\" but what I do insist upon is that, upon a point of such importance, it was the primary duty of the judge who tried the case to explain to the jury in the clearest terms possible the fundamental principle that a person who merely contributes in some way towards an accident is not necessarily responsible for the damages occasioned by it; that it must be his negligent act or omission that directly caused it; and that in the present case if the deceased or those in charge of her were careless in the use of means: if for instance they failed to provide efficient and continuous medical attendance, or if the deceased came to her death by reason of her failing to comply with the proper directions of her medical attendants, and if in consequence thereof, death ensued, the defendants were not liable. It might also I think have been suggested to the jury that the deceased might have died when she did irrespective of the accident altogether; her sister had in the meantime died; she herself had taken a journey in the meantime, and in an inclement season, on which journey she might have caught cold, or by which journey her disease might have been developed. There might between the time of the accident and her death have been an innumerable number of acts or omissions, one or all of which, might have been the occasion of the rapid development of the disease. All this is wanting in the judge's charge. He told them, it is true, that in an action founded on negligence the plaintiff would fail if the jury found that he was himself negligent or had contributed to the cause of the accident. But that was not the question here; he should likewise have told them that the plaintiff in this case would equally fail even if there had been no negligence on the part of the deceased contributing to the accident, if as a matter of fact there had been negligence on her part contributing to or hastening her death.\nI am further of opinion that the damages in this case are excessive. I can gather nothing in the evidence to convince me that the pecuniary loss which the plaintiff sustained by his wife's death amounts to the sum of $1,500, and I think the case should go back for a new trial upon this ground.\nOn the whole I do not think the judgment of the court below should be disturbed.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed, but the general rule as to costs should in the present case be departed from. At the argument below two judges thought that under no circumstances could the plaintiff succeed. Mr. Justice Graham's view as to the merits was uncertain. The plaintiff in coming to this court has obtained a declaration that there was an obligation due from the company to the deceased as to the safety of the wharf, and that there was negligence on the company's part (two points which the decision below left in doubt and which would remain in doubt had the case gone to a new trial without this appeal). He has therefore partially succeeded and has probably obviated the necessity of the case coming before us again. For this reason I think the appeal ought to be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W. B.

Smith v. Goldie (9 Can. S.C.R. 46) and Hunter v. Carrick (11 Can. S.C.R. 300) referred to.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed in respect to the patent in question.\nThe following statement of facts is taken from the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick in this court:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs carry on business at Brantford and the defendants at Oshawa, both as manufacturers of agricultural implements. On the 22nd of February, 1887, the plaintiffs had letters patent granted to them (no. 26049) as assignees of one James Samuel Heath for alleged new and useful improvements in spring hoes (these letters patent being a reissue of letters patent no. 17833 granted to plaintiffs on the 6th October, 1883), and on the 24th October, 1883, the plaintiffs had granted to them, as assignees of Heath, another patent for alleged new and useful improvements in combined seeding and drilling machines under no. 17963.\nThe allegation of the plaintiffs is, that the defendants had infringed both these patents by manufacturing and putting upon the market certain seeding and drilling machines containing certain of their patented improvements. At the trial the alleged infringements were by consent or abandonment reduced to two, namely: an infringement of claim no. 2 in patent no. 26049, and claim no. 2 in patent no. 17963. In the former patent the specification stated that\u2014\nThe object of the invention was to simplify the construction of the spring hoe and to arrange it so that the drill hoe can be taken off and the cultivator tooth put in its place without removing a single bolt or disconnecting the lifting chain, and that it consisted in the formation and arrangements of parts as thereinafter specified.\nAnd what was claimed as the invention was,\u2014\n2nd. \u201cIn a drill hoe or cultivator tooth having a projection to fit within the drag bar, and a notch formed on the top side of the said projection to fit on to the bottom side of the pivot pin, the combination of a strap, bolted or otherwise, fastened to the drag bar and extending below the notched projection, for the purpose of holding it against the pivot pin as specified.\u201d In the latter case (which is the case to be considered in this appeal) the object of the invention was stated to be the connection of a spring tooth with the drag bar of a seeding machine, and the invention was claimed to be as follows:\u2014\n\u201cIn a seeding machine in which independent drag bars are used, a curved spring tooth detachably connected to the drag bar in combination with a locking device arranged to lock the head block to which a spring tooth is attached, substantially as and for the purpose specified.\u201d\nThe defence denied the novelty and utility of the alleged inventions. It set up that they were known and used by others previously, and were in public use or for sale for more than one year before the patents were applied for, and generally denied the alleged infringements.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson, at Toronto, the trial lasting six days. Judgment was given in favour of the plaintiffs on both the claims above specified, and an injunction was ordered restraining the defendants from further infringement the amount of damages by reason of the infringement being left to reference. Upon appeal by defendants to the Queen\u2019s Bench Division judgment was delivered dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs. The plaintiffs thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal. That court in delivering judgment found unanimously in favour of the plaintiffs as to claim 2 of letters patent no. 26049, but dismissed the appeal, (Mr. Justice Burton dissenting) with respect to claim 2, of letters patent no. 17963 ordering a reference to take an account of damages with respect to that claim and awarding to plaintiffs the whole costs of action, less one fourth. In pursuance thereof damages were awarded to plaintiffs in the sum of $6,190. This amount together with costs has been paid, and the claim as far as respects the letters patent no. 26049 has been finally settled between the parties. It is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in respect to patent no. 17963 that this appeal is taken.\nRidout for the appellant referred to Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[1], and Smith v. Mutchmore[2].\nArnoldi Q.C. and Roaf the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and FOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The present appeal relates only to claim 2 of letters patent 17963, dated 24th October, 1883. I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, upon the grounds stated in the judgments of that learned judge and of Mr. Justice Burton, in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The evidence clearly establishes, and it has been so found by the learned trial judge, that as a matter of fact in a combined seeding and drill machine in which independent drag bars are used, the introduction of a small curved spring tooth, detachedly connected to the drag bar in combination with the locking device arranged to lock the head block to which the spring tooth is attached, as in the appellants\u2019 machine, is a marked improvement upon machines formerly used for the same purpose in this, that it does attain its results in a much more useful and beneficial manner than machines formerly used for a like purpose did. This is all the novelty which the appellants claim for their machine the several parts being all old, but with great deference to the opinion of my learned brothers I am of opinion that the attaining such more useful and beneficial results is sufficient to support the letters patent granted for the machine producing such results.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The points in controversy are well stated by Mr. Justice Ferguson in his judgment. He says:\u2014\nThen as to claim no. 2, in patent no. 17963. It is admitted that all the elements of this combination are old elements. It is also admitted that there was and is a combination prior in time to this and similar to it, excepting that in that combination the teeth used were rigid teeth and in this combination the teeth are curved spring teeth. The locking device is such a one as I have already endeavoured in some degree to describe. In regard to this combination the defendants say that it is simply inserting in an old combination a spring tooth attached by the same means as those before connecting the rigid tooth, and they argue that this cannot be a new combination. The view of the plaintiffs and the way in which their counsel states the matter do not, I think, differ widely, or perhaps not at all, from this. The plaintiffs admit that if a rigid tooth were substituted for a spring tooth the then combination would be old, and they say that what this virtually did was to take out of an old combination of old elements one of these elements, the rigid tooth, and to put in its place another and different old element, the curved spring tooth, thereby forming another and different combination which they say is a new combination, producing new and useful results.\nAccording to the evidence of the witness (Mr. Ridout) the combination contains four elements: First, the independent drag-bars; second, the locking mechanism; third, a curved spring tooth; and fourth, means of detachably connecting the curved spring tooth to the drag-bar and locking mechanism. The witness says, and it is admitted, that these are old elements; that a curved spring tooth detachably connected to the drag-bar is old, and this does not seem to be disputed. As nearly as I can understand then the parties do not disagree as to the facts of the construction of the combination in question. They seem to differ chiefly in this:\u2014the plaintiffs say that this is a new combination producing new and useful results. The defendants say that under such circumstances this cannot be a new combination. The machine which has given rise to this litigation is called a combined drill and seeder. The machine itself was in part exhibited at the argument before us, and in the case there is a diagram of it. It has for its object two purposes: first, by means of what is called a drill hoe making a trench or furrow in the ground and depositing seed therein through a tube in the drill hoe; and secondly, by substituting a spring tooth in place of a drill hoe, and with it breaking up the ground like an ordinary harrow. It is important to observe that the drill hoe and the spring tooth are not used at the same time. There is no mechanism in connection with the machine by which two processes, namely, the making of the furrow and depositing of the seed therein, and the harrowing of the ground, are carried on at the same time; in other words, the machine is used at one time as a seeder only, and at another time, by means of a different instrument inserted therein, as a harrow or cultivator only. It is a complete machine for two purposes; with the drill hoe attached it is a seeding machine only, and with the spring tooth attached it is a cultivator or harrow only. As Mr. Justice Ferguson stated, and as was admitted by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the argument, there is nothing in any of the separate elements of this machine when used as a cultivator or harrow that is new; neither the spring tooth nor the means of attaching that spring tooth to the drag bar, nor the drag bar itself, nor the locking mechanism by means of which the tooth springs back again into place when more than a certain strength is applied to it, nor any of the means by which the motive power is applied to the machine as a whole, is new, nor is there anything new in the machine when, by the removal of the spring tooth and the substitution of a drill hoe, it is used as a seeder, the drill hoe and spring tooth being attached to the drag bar in exactly the same way and by a process not now in question (although it was in question in respect to that portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim which has been settled, as I have above stated). In fact the machine in question, if used as a cultivator or harrow simply is all old; if used as a drill hoe only it is likewise all old; as a cultivator with one appliance it is an old machine and as a seeder with another appliance it is an old machine. The manufacturer may sell the one machine only, or the other machine only, or both machines, the purchase of both machines involving only the acquisition of the curved teeth or of the spring hoe. If the machine is sold without the hoes the purchaser has in his possession a cultivator every element of which and every combination of which is old; so, too, if he purchase a machine without the teeth, he has in his possession a machine every element of which and every combination of which is likewise old. But beyond this there is in the market, as I understand, a machine like the present, designed for the same objects, in which cultivator, teeth and drill hoes are interchangeably used, but in that machine the cultivator tooth, instead of being a spring tooth, is rigid, and it is from this difference, and from this difference alone, that the plaintiffs maintain the patentability of the machine in question and assert that it, as a whole, produces a known result in a more useful and beneficial way. But there is likewise upon the market a machine like the present, in so far as it fulfils the office of a cultivator or harrow, with curved spring teeth attached to a drag bar, with locking mechanism, &c., &c.\nThe principles of law involved in this case are well understood; they were very fully discussed in the case of Smith v. Goldie[3], before this court in 1882, when the late Chief Justice delivered an elaborate judgment, holding that the invention involved in that case was patentable, and in the case of Hunter v. Carrick[4], in 1885, where an alleged invention was held to be otherwise. The first and fundamental requisite in order to entitle to a patent is, that the machine is new. Its production must have required the existence and exercise of the inventive faculty, whether the idea of the invention was a happy hit, as has been expressed, or the result of patient and laborious investigation. There must be an exercise of skill and ingenuity to entitle it to the protection of an exclusive grant. Saxby v. Gloucester Waggon Co.[5] An invention is likewise patentable if it consists in the improved application of existing machines to materials whether new or old, if there be a new and beneficial combination and application of well known machines; a patent properly limited to and claiming this combination will be valid. Wright v. Hitchcock[6]. And if a combination of machinery for effecting certain results has previously existed and is well known, and an improvement is afterwards discovered consisting for example of the introduction of some new parts, or altered arrangement of some parts of the existing constituent parts of the machine, an improved arrangement or improved combination may be patented;. Foxwell v. Bostock[7]; or, as was stated by Lord Hatherley in Harrison v. Anderson Foundry Co.[8] before the House of Lords:\u2014\nA new combination of old parts producing a new result or producing a known result in a more useful and beneficial way is patentable.\nAnd it was upon that principle that Smith v. Goldie[9] in this court was determined. The law is similar in the United States. In Loom Company v. Higgins[10] it is stated that,\u2014 It might be laid down as a general rule, though perhaps not an invariable one, that if a new combination and arrangement of known elements produce a new and beneficial result never obtained before it is evidence of invention.\nBefore applying these principles to the case in hand I feel bound to call attention to the claim as now put forward by the appellants. What they now claim to to be an invention is an alleged combination in one machine of what was formerly two machines, namely, a cultivator and a seeder, the cultivator having spring teeth instead of rigid teeth. What they claim in the patent as the object of invention is to connect a spring tooth with a drag bar of a seeding machine, and what the inventor claims as his invention is in a seeding machine\u2014\nin which independent drag-bars are used, the curved spring tooth detachably connected to the drag-bar in combination with a locking device, arranged to lock the head block to which the spring tooth is attached.\nIn my judgment the wording of the claim as put forward in the patent conveys little or no meaning and certainly does not in terms describe the combination now contended for, and upon the authority of the Keystone Bridge Co. v. Ph\u0153nix Iron Co.[11], Burns v. Meyer[12], Hinks v. Safety Lighting Company[13], I am inclined to think the appellants would have to fail on this ground. But I am not disposed to rest my judgment upon this point, but rather upon the substantial question: Whether, under the circumstances of this case, the alleged invention, so far as this specific claim is concerned, is the subject of a patent.\nIn considering this question it must be kept continually in mind that the plaintiffs have already received damages by reason of the defendants\u2019 infringement of a patent held by them covering this machine, in so far as the attachment of the drill hoe or the spring tooth, as the case may be, to the drag bar, and the action in connection with both of the locking devices are concerned. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that the mere use of a curved spring tooth in a machine, which by the use of a tooth or a hoe may be either a cultivator or a seeder respectively, has been patented to them by the patent in question, and that the defendants\u2019 use of a spring tooth in such a machine is an infringement.\nNow, I am not able to see that the machine in question is a combination at all within the meaning of the cases which hold a combination patentable.\nThere are upon the market cultivators with independent drag bars and locking devices in which curved spring teeth are used. This machine, so far as the claim in question is concerned, is that machine and nothing more. This machine so far as the evidence goes produces the same results as the other in precisely the same way or, if in a different or more beneficial way, not by reason of the tooth being curved and flexible, but by reason of the improvements which the plaintiffs in other inventions have secured to them in connection with the attaching of a hoe or tooth, whether rigid or flexible, to a drag bar. The new and beneficial results, if any, have been produced not by the curved spring tooth but by other means, the curved spring tooth not being the occasion of these results. If there had been invented a new tooth of certain specified curves and other stated dimensions and shape, which upon trial was found to produce better results than any other curved tooth in existence, that doubtless might have been the subject of a claim itself but there is no such claim here. The plaintiffs insist upon their exclusive right to use a curved spring tooth in any machine which may be used both as a cultivator and a seeder. It appears, too, that in this case there is no combination at all. The combination mentioned in the cases is a combination which produces a result; here, there is no use at the same time of the tooth and the drill hoe. The idea of attaching a tooth to a drag bar at one time and for one purpose, and of attaching a hoe to the same drag bar at another time and for another purpose, does not involve, in my judgment, the exercise of the inventive faculty, any more than the harnessing of a wagon to a horse on one day for one purpose and the harnessing of a sleigh to the horse on another day for another purpose, or in the attaching to an engine of a freight train on one day and a passenger train on another. The idea itself is not new. The plaintiffs themselves had previously obtained a patent for an invention the object of which was to simplify the construction of a spring hoe and to arrange it so that the drill hoe could be taken off the drag bar and a cultivator tooth put in its place. The cultivator tooth there specified was not a rigid tooth but a curved flexible tooth.\nAs the learned Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal suggests, the mere insertion of one known article in place of another known article, namely, a tooth into a known machine, is not a patentable matter. If, as I have already intimated, there was some useful and novel device in the method of such insertion, or in securing or producing a new or more beneficial result after such insertion was made, the question would be altogether different. The plaintiffs\u2019 machine, although called a combined drill and seeder, is not a combination; it is not one machine but two machines. In so far as it is either (as respects this claim), it is wholly an old machine, and in neither case does it produce according to the evidence any new or useful result, even although it may be admitted that a machine which, with one mechanism attached can do one thing, and another mechanism attached can do another thing, is a most useful machine. A horse that draws both a carriage and a sleigh is a more useful animal than a horse that draws a carriage only.\nIt seems to me that the claim of the plaintiffs, if allowed, would be to prevent any manufacturer from any time hereafter manufacturing a machine for seeding and cultivating purposes together of which a curved spring tooth forms part. I am not prepared to give to the plaintiffs such a far reaching monopoly.\nIn my opinion this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John G.

In October, 1852, Thomas Jefferson Stephens being seized in fee conveyed the ten acres in question, part of the said south half of lot 27, concession 6, to John R. Torrance. John R. Torrance and the plaintiff\u2019s mother were the only children of John Torrance. John R. Torrance died first, leaving his widow Margaret Torrance, and leaving a will devising the land in question to his widow, Margaret Torrance, for life. He made no further dispositions and left no children. John Torrance died without a will, and was heir-at-law to John R. Torrance. The mother of the plaintiff, who claimed to be the heir-at-law of John R. Torrance her brother, by her will devised to Robert Hamilton Young 100 acres of land, the south part of lot 27, concession C, in the township of Scarboro\u2019, adding the words, \u201cTogether with all my right, title and interest therein, present and future.\u201d Then, on or about the 23rd day of October, 1871, Margaret Torrance being the tenant in possession of the ten acres in question, executed a conveyance to the defendants\u2019 predecessors in title the Toronto and Nipissing Railway. Upon executing the said conveyance the said Margaret Torrance was paid the sum of $1,200, which was the price agreed to be paid for the said land. The said Margaret Torrance departed this life on or about the 9th day of March, A.D. 1886.\nSubsequently the said Toronto and Nipissing Railway Company, by the act of the Ontario Legislature, 45 Vict. ch. 67, and the agreement which forms part thereof, became consolidated with other companies under the name of the Midland Railway of Canada, the defendants in this action. The plaintiff then brought this action against the said defendants to recover the sum of $1,200, the purchase money aforesaid, and interest thereon from the death of the said Margaret Torranee. The action came on for trial before the Hon. Mr. Justice Street, at the Toronto Spring Assizes, on the 16th May, 1888.\nAt the close of the argument the plaintiff applied for leave to add as parties the other heirs of Isabella. Hamilton Young the mother of the said plaintiff.\nIn March, 1889, the learned judge delivered judgment, giving the plaintiff leave to amend as asked, and postponing further disposition of the action until such amendments were made. Subsequently the plaintiff, on the 14th of May, 1890, amended by adding as defendants Margaret Mable Young and John Young, infants under the age of twenty-one years, children of one John Young, a son of the said Isabella Hamilton Young, who predeceased her, and by inserting in the statement of claim other additional paragraphs.\nThe defendant company on the 21st day of May, 1890, also amended by inserting an additional paragraph in the statement of defence.\nThe hearing and trial of the case concluded on the 15th day of November, 1890.\nJudgment was delivered by the learned judge on the 25th day of November, 1890, His Lordship holding under section 11, subsection 22, of chapter 66, Consolidated Statutes of Canada, which enacts that compensation shall stand in the stead of land, that inasmuch as the said Margaret Torrance would have been entitled to the annual rental of the said lands had the same not been taken by the Railway Company, and at her death those in remainder would have been entitled to the fee in possession, that therefore those rights should be maintained with regard to the compensation which the above section enacts shall stand in the stead of the land taken, and further that the railway company should not have paid the purchase money for the said land to the said Margaret Torrence, but should have paid the same into court.\nThe learned judge then directed that judgment be entered for the plaintiff against the defendants for the sum of $1,000, with interest at 6 per cent from 9th March, 1886, and the costs of the action, including the costs of the official guardian to be paid by the plaintiff and added to his own; and that the defendants, the railway company, pay into court for the infant defendants the remaining $200 of the compensation with interest at 6 per cent from the 9th March, 1886, and that defendant company should set off against plaintiffs\u2019 costs their costs occasioned by the amendment, including the costs of the hearing on 15th November, 1890, and plaintiffs should have no costs of said amendment and hearing.\nFrom this judgment the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The argument was heard on the ninth day of February, 1892, and on the 8th day of March, 1892, judgment was delivered affirming the judgment of the learned trial judge (Burton, J.A. dissenting) and dismissing the appeal with costs. From this judgment the defendants appeal to this court.\nOsler Q.C. for the appellants referred to Cameron v. Wigle[3].\nKerr Q.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed for the reasons given by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nIt appears to me that the judgment of Chancellor Spragge in Cameron v. Wigle[4], was in all respects correct, and was properly adopted by the Court of Appeal as the principle of their decision.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J. The title undoubtedly passed, but in such a case I think it well to hold that the company having power to protect themselves by payment into court should be required to do so.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The only question presented to us for consideration upon this appeal is the construction of section 11 of the Railway Act, Con. Stats. of Canada (1859) chapter 66 as amended by chapter 17 of 24 Vict. 1861, sec. 1.\nThe lands set out in the statement of claim were taken by the Toronto and Nipissing Railway Co. as a portion of the roadbed of their railway. One Margaret Torrance who had a life estate in the lands conveyed them to the company, the instrument of conveyance purporting to pass the fee simple, and the whole of the purchase money was paid to her.\nThe company held under this title alone.\nMargaret Torrance died on the 9th March, 1886. The plaintiffs who are interested in the remainder now bring this action to obtain compensation for that interest. The defendant company having succeeded to the rights and obligations of the company that constructed the road contend that the deed by Margaret Torrance above referred to, a life tenant only though she was, vested an absolute title in the Toronto and Nipissing Company, and that the receipt by her of the purchase money was a discharge of all claim thereon which, prior to such payment, any person interested in remainder might have. The statutes upon which the question depends are as follows: Con. Stat. Canada (1859) c. 66:\u2014\n11. The conveyance of lands, their valuation and the compensation therefor, shall be made in manner following: 14 & 15 V. c. 51 s. 11.\nFirst. All corporations and persons whatever, tenants in tail or for life, gr\u00e9v\u00e9s de substitution, guardians, curators, executors, administrators, and all other trustees whatsoever, not only for and on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, but also for and on behalf of those whom they represent, whether infants, issue unborn, lunatics, idiots, femes-covert, or other persons, seized, possessed of or interested in any lands, may contract for, sell and convey unto the company all or any part thereof; and any contract, agreement, sale, conveyance and assurance so made, shall be valid and effectual in law to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and the corporation or person, so conveying, is hereby indemnified for what he or it respectively does by virtue of or in pursuance of this Act.\n24 Vict. ch. 17, sec. 1:\u2014\nWhereas doubts are entertained as to whether rectors in possession of glebe lands in Upper Canada, ecclesiastical and other corporations, trustees of land for church and school purposes or either, executors appointed by wills in which they are not invested with any power over the real estate of the testator, administrators of persons dying intestate but at their death seized of real estate, are authorized by the eleventh section of the Railway Act to sell or dispose of any of such lands to any railway company for the actual use of, and occupation by, such company; and whereas it is desirable to remove such doubts and to amend the said Railway Act in the particulars hereinafter set forth: Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Assembly of Canada, enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. The true intent and meaning of the said section of the said act was and is, that the several persons and parties hereinbefore mentioned, with respect to the lands above in this act referred to, should and shall exercise all the powers mentioned in the first subsection of the said section eleven of the said Railway Act, with respect to any of such lands actually required for the use and occupation of any railway company; and any conveyance made under the first subsection shall vest in the railway company receiving the same the fee simple in the lands in such deed described, freed and discharged from all trusts, restrictions and limitations whatsoever.\nThe words of section 11, so far as they can be applicable to the case, are:\u2014 All tenants for life, not only for and on behalf of themselves, but also for and on behalf of those whom they represent, seized, possessed of or interested in any lands, may convey to the company all or any part thereof, and any conveyance so made shall be valid and effectual in law to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nIs there here any power given to a tenant for life to contract for or convey away the interest of a reversioner or remainder man? I cannot find it. The section includes all classes of persons and corporations (except the crown) capable of conveying. It refers to parties who may without it convey lands. It likewise gives authority to persons who without it would have no authority to convey lands. But that authority is given to those only who occupy a fiduciary position, and who at law represent other persons whose rights they are thereby empowered to affect. I am not aware that a life tenant represents the remainder-man. There is no natural or legal relationship between them. The statute allows the life tenant to contract on behalf of those persons whom he represents, but it does not intimate or even suggest who they are. Where it enables gr\u00e9v\u00e9s de substitution, guardians, curators, executors, administrators or trustees to contract on behalf of those whom they represent we can understand, at least, partially, what is meant. The offices which they each discharge are representative in character. Behind them, in each case, are persons whose rights they are bound to subserve, whose interest the law calls upon them to protect. Besides, these functionaries are all, in one respect or another, under the direction of the court, and either have given security for the faithful discharge of duty or have been chosen by reason of supposed fitness to discharge it. It does not, therefore, seem unreasonable that the legislature, in order to facilitate the inexpensive and speedy acquisition of railway lands, should invest them with additional powers in regard to the disposition of land of which they officially are in charge, and should seek to make it plain that they, at all events, could convey interests larger than their own.\nBut these considerations do not apply in the case of a life tenant. The law casts upon him no duty towards his successor in title. No relation of trust exists between them. In my view it is for the legislature in unambiguous terms to impose that duty and create that relationship. If it has not done so the courts cannot do it.\nAnd in this connection I may say that I am as desirous as any one of giving effect to the intention of the legislature, but when, as in the present case, it is contended that Parliament has given power to a life tenant to fix upon the price and convey away the interest of the person next entitled to possession\u2014a person who may be well known to the company, and as easy of access as the tenant himself\u2014and that too without that person\u2019s assent and even in spite of his protest I must have pointed out to me the expression of that intent in such clear and specific language that no doubt can remain. I am not to glean from doubtful inference, I must be satisfied by positive and direct words that what Mr. Chancellor Spragge has termed \u201ca most violent and unnecessary interference with the rights of property\u201d is made authoritative and legal by the statute.\nIt is true that in England tenants for life have power to sell the interest of the remainder-man. But in what clear and unmistakable terms has that power been conferred?\n\u201cIt shall be lawful for the following parties to sell, convey or lease, tenants in tail or for life not only on behalf of themselves but also for and on behalf of any person entitled in reversion remainder, or expectancy.\u201d (Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, sec. 7.)\nThere is no question there as to what the English Parliament intended, and for my part I cannot interpolate similar words in the Canadian statute without, as I think, doing violence to the elementary and fundamental principles by which statutes of this description are to be construed.\nIt may however be asked: What did the legislature mean by the words in question? The present case does not call for an answer to that question; but it may fairly be said that the words \u201cfor and on behalf of those whom they represent\u201d apply only to and are apt words to describe the extended powers intended to be given to gr\u00e9v\u00e9s de substitution, guardians, curators, executors, administrators and trustees, all of whom are mentioned in the section. They are as unapplicable to tenants for life as they are to \u201ccorporations and persons\u201d also mentioned in the section\u2014\u201ccorporations\u201d and \u201cpersons\u201d representing no one. But there is as much reason in the assertion that they represent persons entitled to reversionary interests as that life tenants represent them. Or, if these words do apply to life tenants they may apply to those life tenants only who by some express act or instrument have been empowered, either by the owner of the outstanding interest or by its creator, or by order of court, or by statute, to so represent that interest.\nBut we need not be astute to give these words a meaning. We know of many cases where legislatures without doubt intended to say one thing but signally failed to say it. We should not say it for them. The misfortune is curable by the legislatures only, not by the courts.\nBut, it is contended, if a life tenant has no power to dispose of a remainder-man\u2019s interest under the Railway Act of 1859, he has that power by virtue of the amending act of 1861.\nI have above written out the preamble and first section of the act. The preamble, it will be seen, deals with rectors, corporations, trustees, executors and administrators only. It is alleged that doubts are entertained as to their powers and that it is desirable to remove these doubts. No doubts appear to have been entertained as to the powers of life tenants. If what I have said is correct there could be no doubt as to their powers\u2014they could sell their own interest and that only. So far as appears there was no intention of dealing with any classes of persons except those mentioned in the preamble, and the first section therefore proceeds to enact in effect that the persons mentioned in the preamble might (notwitstanding the doubt referred to) exercise all the powers of sale specified in section 11 of the Railway Act with respect to lands actually required for the use of the railway \u201cand\u201d the section proceeds \u201cany conveyance made under the said first subsection shall vest in the railway company receiving the same the fee simple in the lands in such deed described, freed and discharged from all trusts, restrictions and limitations whatsoever.\u201d That in my judgment manifestly deals with the cases, and the cases alone, that are in doubt. The conveyance referred to is evidently a conveyance by the persons or parties just mentioned, the intent being that conveyances executed by them in their representative or fiduciary capacity of what purported to be a fee simple should in law have that effect, and that the land itself should be discharged from any \u201ctrust\u201d\u2014that is, the company was to be absolved from seeing to the application of the purchase money;\u2014\u201crestriction\u201d\u2014however the use of the land had been restricted by the instruments under which the vendors held, it was got rid of; or \u201climitation,\u201d\u2014whatever outstanding interests there might be, whatever limitations to which the land might be subject under the vendor\u2019s title, these were destroyed and an absolute estate became vested in the company. I am conversant with the principle that the preamble of an act cannot govern its enacting part; that although a particular mischief or inconvenience may be recited in a preamble the enacting clauses may extend beyond it; but at the same time it may be legitimately consulted for the purpose of keeping the effect of the act within its real scope, and generally to ascertain the legislative intent. It is a good means to find out its meaning and is, as it were, a key to the understanding of it.\nIt is, as I have said, clear, so far as we can gather the intent from the preamble, that the statute was not intended to deal with life tenants, nor do I think the enacting clause properly construed in any way enlarges its effect.\nThe latter clause of the first section forming, as it does, a part of the single sentence of which the whole section is composed must, I think, be taken to be an amplified re-expression of the first part including a declaration of the nature of the title intended to pass, and does not refer to a conveyance by a party whose case is not mentioned. This, I think, would be the obvious construction were the act in question of a character demanding a wide and liberal interpretation. That construction is, however, imperative when, as in the present case, a contrary interpretation would lead to manifest hardship and injustice.\nThe result of the opinion I have herein expressed will be, if adopted, that the appeal will be dismissed.\nThe majority of the court below had no doubt (nor have I), as to the right of the plaintiffs to recover, but they rested their decision upon the ground that while the effect of the two acts in question was to give the life tenant a right to convey the fee simple they did not give him authority to receive that portion of the purchase money that represented the remainder-man\u2019s interest. I am inclined to think that this opinion, given as it was with apparent hesitation, was influenced largely by the opinion of the late Chancellor Spragge in Cameron v. Wigle[5], where he would appear to have held the same view.\nReference to that case will show that whatever opinion he had, whether the tenant for life could or could not convey, the plaintiffs were equally entitled to judgment. \u201cIt may be conceded,\u201d he says, \u201cfor the purposes of this case, that the tenant for life had power to contract for sale (which would involve the agreement for price) and to convey.\u201d Whether the payment of this full value to the tenant for life was a good payment is quite a different question. In support of the company\u2019s contention he takes that for granted, but assuming that he proceeds to argue that it was the duty of the railway company to see that the remainder\u2011man\u2019s rights were secured by the payment of his share of the consideration money into court or to himself.\nThe reasoning of the learned Chancellor upon this latter point does not convince my judgment. I should suppose that where a statute authorizes a trustee or other person to contract for and give a conveyance in fee simple payment to that person would discharge the purchaser in the absence of any provision to the contrary. I know of no such provision in the statutes under discussion, and I am inclined to think that a railway company may, in good faith, in all cases pay to a trustee or other person empowered by statute to convey lands in fee simple the whole of the purchase money, and is under no obligation either to pay into court or to see to its proper application.\nFor reasons already stated I do not think that the tenant for life in the present case had authority to convey any interest but her own, and the company must therefore make good to the plaintiffs their interests in remainder.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John Bell.\nSolicitors for respondents: Kerr, Macdonald, Davidson & Patterson.\n[1] 19 Ont.

Lapierre ([2]), contended that the case was not appealable. [MR. JUSTICE TASOHEREAU.\u2014The case of Dufresne v. Dixon ([3]), a judgment on a petition en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret is a clear authority for our jurisdiction.]\nThe appeal was then heard on the merits.\nMercier Q.C. and Gouin for appellant cited and relied on arts. 479, 551, 653, 662 and 663 C. C. P. and Bissonnette v. Laurent ([4]); Trust & Loan Co. v. Monbleau ([5]); La Compagnie de Pr\u00eat v. Monbleau ([6]).\nBunin for respondent cited and relied on Bouvier v. Brush ([7]); rules 35 57 and 88 of Superior Court Rules of Practice, and contended also, that the Supreme Court should not reverse the decision of the two courts on a mere question of procedure sanctioned by judicial decision, viz.: Whether the prothonotary could issue a writ of venditioni exponas without the order of the court.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred with Fournier J\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The appeal in this cause is from a judgment rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal, on the 18th of January, 1892, dismissing the appellant's petition demanding the nullity of the sheriff's sale (d\u00e9cret made under a writ of venditioni exponas against the appellant' s property.\nNarcisse Bolduc, now represented by the defendant en reprise di instance, Adolphe V\u00e9ronneau, had obtained judgment against the appellant in the Superior Court sut Montreal for the sum of $433 4-6 and costs\nA writ of execution de bonis issued on the 10th August, 1875 was returned on the 25th October following indorsed a nulta bona, and the same day was issued a writ of fieri facias de terris which was returned on the 20th March, 1876, in obedience to an order of the Honorable Mr. Justice Rainville, granted upon a requ\u00eate civile presented by the appellant against the judgment of the Superior Court of the 28th November, 1874.\nOn the 30th June, 1876, the requ\u00eate civile was dismissed by the Superior Court.\nOn the 8th July, 1876, the then attorney of the plaintiff taxed cx parte his bill of costs upon the contestation of the said requ\u00eate civile and upon the back of the said bill asked for a fiat for a writ of venditioni exponas returnable on .the 7th September, 1876, addressed to the sheriff of Bedford. This writ was issued by the prothonotary without any order of the court.\nAfter two notices in the Official Gazette and one publication at the church door of St Val\u00e9rien de Milton, the parish in which the appellant's property is situate, the said property was sold by the sheriff, and. adjudicated to the plaintiff, Narcisse Bolduc, on the 17th August, 1876, for $55, which sum was insufficient to cover the sheriff's costs.\nOn the 23rd February following the appellant presented to the Superior Court a petition en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret to have the sale of his property declared null and illegal for the following reasons:\n1. Because no notice of the said sale had been given to him.\n2. Because the said writ of venditioni expanses was irregular, illegal and null and did not state what notices the sheriff should give before proceeding to the sale.\n3. Because the said sale had been made before the expiration of the delay fixed by law, and without the notices and publications mentioned.\n4. Because the said sale was tainted with fraud and fraudulent acts on the part of the plaintiff and, to his knowledge, to prevent the making of bids. 5. Because the proceedings adopted to arrive at the d\u00e9cret and at the sale and adjudication of the said property are irregular, null, illegal and void.\nThe only grounds relied on by the appellant in this court in support of his demand for nullity, are the following.\n1. The premature issue of the writ of venditioni exponas for an amount including costs, which were not yet due and which had not yet been regularly taxed. 2. The said writ was issued by the prothonotary without an order of the court no notice of the issue of the said writ or of the sale, had been given to the appellant.\nBeing of the opinion that the issuing of the writ of venditioni expanses by the prothonotary without an order of the court or judge is a sufficient ground for the decision of this case I need only deal with that point.\nIt is evident that the Code of Procedure has not placed the issuing of this writ upon the same footing as ordinary writs of summons, of execution and others. With regard to the latter the prothonotary is specially authorized to issue them. Art. 44 0. P. C. says:-\u201c Writs of summons are issued by the prothonotary, upon the written requisition of the plaintiff.\" Art. 46. \u201c They are attested and signed by the prothonotary.'' Art. 222. \" Parties are summoned to answer interrogatories upon articulated facts, by means of a process issued in the name of the sovereign by the prothonotary.\" By art 545 the writ of execution is attested and signed in the same manner as original writs, and must bear the seal of the court. Art. 633. \u201c The seizure of immoveables can only be made in virtue of a writ clothed with the same formalities as writs of executing against movables \" &c.\nIn the case of all the above mentioned writs the authority to issue them is given specially to the prothonotary. \"With respect to the writ of venditioni exponas no such authority is given to him.\nIn the present case the day fixed for the sale of the immovables of the appellant by the notices given under the writ de terris. and the day upon which it was returnable, having passed the said writ had lapsed. The sheriff could not proceed further and the prothonotary, there being no provision in the code to that effect, had no power to decree the sale of the property. To the court alone then belongs the \"power of ordering the sale under a writ of venaitiuni exponas in accordance with articles 653 662 and 663 of the Code of Procedure.\nArt. 653 obliges the sheriff, notwithstanding any opposition to the seizure (here requ\u00eate civile) or sale of immovable or rents, to continue the publication above prescribed, but he cannot in such case proceed with the sale without an order from the court. In the present case the requite civile had the same effect as an Opposition, and the sheriff continued his publications as he had been authorized to do But the writ having lapsed he could not as that article says proceed with the sale without an order from the court. These positive words show clearly that an order for the sale can only be given by the court and not by the prothonotary. The sheriff's duty was then governed by art 662 which provides that when oppositions have not been decided until after the day fixed for the sale he can only proceed to sell under a writ of venditioni exponas and in accordance with the conditions therein contained.\nArt. 663 also shows the necessity for the order of the court for the issue of the writ of venditioni exponas by declaring that this writ shall \"contain, moreover, such other conditions as the court has directed respecting the sale of the immovable or the rent.\" It is evident then that the order to issue this writ must be asked of the court and that the court alone can grant it since the writ must contain the-conditions upon \"which the judge may think proper to order the sale.\nThese several provisions of the code of civil procedure clearly establish that the court alone has power to order a writ of. venditioni exponas to issue as has been decided in the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in the case of Bissonnetle v Laurent ([8]) This decision was followed in the case of the Trust & Loan Co. v. J S Tonbleau ([9]).\nThe respondent has contended that the appellant could not invoke this jurisprudence because it was adopted some time after his petition nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret. But this jurisprudence is nothing else than the law itself, and settles nothing but what was already contained in the articles of the Code of Civil Procedure. There has been no change in the law in force at that time, and why should we be now asked to apply to this case an irregular practice, and one which is contrary to the text of the law ? To support this contention it is pretended that the appellant should have specially alleged this ground in his petition en nullit\u00e9. This ground was one of law and the want of an order of the judge to issue the writ appearing on the face of the record is sufficiently alleged twice viz. '. in the 2nd and 5th reasons in his petition en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret. In the 2nd he alleges that the writ of venditioni exponas is illegal, irregular, null and void; and in the 5th he alleges that all the proceedings adopted to arrive at the sale and adjudication of his property are irregular, illegal, null and void. There are, moreover, a number of other allegations complaining of the nullity of the writ upon which the court below ought to have pronounced judgment. But the court seems to have considered the irregular and erroneous practice relied upon by respondent, as having the force of a law.\nWe cannot admit that any practice, even long established but which is contrary to law, should be followed even when it has been sanctioned by a judicial decision. The duty of a judge is to disregard such a practice and to be guided solely by the text of the law.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the writ of venditioni exponas virtue of which the appellant's property was sold is null and void, and therefore that the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court below.\nGWYNEE J. was also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court below.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred with Fournier J\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Mercier, Gouin & Lemieux.\nSolicitors for respondent : Taillon, Bonin & Pagnuelo.\n[1] Q.

The Divisional Court reversed this judgment, but it was restored by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed from the latter decision to the Supreme Court.\nMoss Q.C. for the appellant. Separate use is not essential to possession of separate property. Chamberlain v. McDonald[6] where Mowat V.C. dissents from the holding in Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell[7]; Cameron v. Walker[8].\nIn re Konkle[9], and Taylor v. Meads[10], are leading cases on the question of separate estate.\nArmour Q.C. for the respondent cited McLean v. Garland[11]; Cahill v. Cahill[12]; Hope v. Hope[13].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent Jane Jackson, is a married woman, and the object of this action is to make certain lands situate in Parkdale and Etobicoke, held by her for an estate in fee and acquired since her marriage, liable for the payment of several promissory notes made by her during coverture and which are now held by the appellant.\nThe cause was originally heard by the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench who entered judgment for the respondent. This judgment was subsequently reversed by the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. The respondent then appealed to the Court of Appeal which court reversed the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division in part. Against the latter judgment the present appeal has been brought.\nThe solution of the questions which are raised depends upon the application of statutory enactments which have been varied from time to time. It becomes, therefore, important to ascertain the exact provisions of the statutes which are applicable. In order to arrive at this end we must bear in mind the several dates of the respondent\u2019s marriage, of the acquisition by her of the property in question and of the promissory notes sued upon. The marriage took place in 1869. The Etobicoke property was conveyed to her in June, 1879, and February, 1882. The Parkdale property was acquired in March, 1887. The promissory notes sued upon were made in May, June and July, 1887. I may say at once that as regards the Parkdale property its liability to be applied to the satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s debt has not been controverted by the Court of Appeal. In this conclusion I entirely agree. The question for our consideration is therefore confined to the lands in Etobicoke.\nIt may also be premised that as regards any of the lands in question which were conveyed by the respondent, Jane Jackson, to her co-defendant Mary Jane Graydon, which may be found to be otherwise liable to the appellant\u2019s claim, the conveyance of such lands was void as being in fraud of creditors. This has been decided by both the courts below, and I entirely acquiesce in the correctness of their judgments in this respect. I will therefore proceed to consider the case as confined to the Etobicoke lands which, as I have already said, were acquired by Mrs. Jackson in 1879 and 1882. The first statute which altered the common law property rights of married women was the Consolidated Statute U.C. cap. 73.\nBy the first section of that act it was enacted that\u2014\nEvery woman who has married since the 4th day of May, 1859, or who marries after this Act takes effect, without any marriage contract or settlement shall and may, notwithstanding her coverture, have, hold, and enjoy all her real and personal property, whether belonging to her before marriage or acquired by her by inheritance, devise, bequest, or a gift, or as next of kin to an intestate or in any other way after marriage free from the debts and obligations of her husband and from his control or disposition without her consent in as full and ample a manner as if she continued sole and unmarried, any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding; but this clause shall not extend to any property received by a married woman from her husband during coverture.\nThis statute did not in any way provide that married women should be liable on their contracts nor that their real property should be so liable. Nor did the statute confer upon married women the power to convey their real estate coming within the terms of the first section without the concurrence of their husbands nor otherwise than as the legal estates of married women had been theretofore required to be conveyed, namely, by a deed in which the husband should be a concurring party, duly acknowledged before the proper officers on an examination of the woman apart from her husband.\nSo far as the mere use of the term \u201cseparate estate\u201d has any bearing on the question before us, it may be remarked that this statute of 1859 affixes the denomination of \u201cseparate estate\u201d to the statutory property created by the first section. The expression will be found to be so applied in sections 3, 14, 15 and 16 of the act. It is manifest from the context that in all these clauses the words \u201cseparate estate\u201d are used to indicate the species of legal estate created by the first section of the statute, and not as in any way referring to separate estate arising under the peculiar doctrines of courts of equity with reference to the equitable interests of married women in property settled to their separate use. In the case of the Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell[14] Spragge V.C. expressly decided that the separate estate created by the statute was not analogous to the equitable property of a married woman settled to her separate use either in respect of the power of disposition or in respect of its liability for the debts of the owner. In Kraemar v. Gless[15] and in Wright v. Garden[16] similar conclusions were reached.\nThe next statute to be noticed is that of 1872, 35 Vic. cap. 16, intituled \u201cAn Act to extend the property rights of married woman. By the first section of this act it is enacted\u2014\nThat after the passing of this Act, the real estate of any married woman which is owned by her at the time of her marriage, or acquired in any manner during her coverture, and the rents, issues and profits thereof respectively, shall without prejudice and subject to the trusts of any settlement affecting the same, be held and enjoyed by her for her separate use, free from any estate or claim of her husband during her lifetime, or as tenant by the courtesy, and her receipts alone shall be a discharge for any rents, issues and profits, and any married woman shall be liable on any contract made by her respecting her real estate as if she were a feme sole.\nAnd by the 8th section of the same act it was declared that:\u2014\nA husband shall not be liable for any debts of his wife in respect of any employment or business in which she is engaged on her own behalf, or in respect of any of her own contracts.\nThe 9th section provides (inter alia) that:\u2014\nAny married woman may be sued or proceeded against separately from her husband in respect of any of her separate debts, engagements, contracts or torts as if she were unmarried.\nBy chapter 125 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, (1877) section 3, it is enacted as follows:\u2014 Every woman who married between the 5th day of May, 1859, and the 2nd day of March, 1872, (both inclusive) without any marriage contract or settlement, shall and may, notwithstanding her coverture, have, hold and enjoy all her real property, whether belonging to her before marriage or acquired by her by inheritance, devise or gift, or as heir-at-law to an intestate, or in any other way after marriage free from the debts and obligations of her husband, and free from his control or disposition without her consent, in as full and ample a manner as if she continued sole and unmarried; but this section shall not extend to any property received by a married woman from her husband during coverture.\nBy the second section of the same act provision was made for the case of a woman married before May, 1859, and by the 4th section for that of a woman married after March, 1872.\nSection 18 is as follows:\u2014\nA husband shall not be liable for any debts of his wife in respect of any employment or business in which she is engaged in her own behalf or in respect of any of her own contracts.\nThe last clause of section 20 provides that:\u2014\nAny married woman may be sued or proceeded against separately from her husband in respect of any of her separate debts, engagements, contracts or torts as if she were unmarried.\nChapter 127 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1877, is intituled \u201cAn Act to facilitate the conveyance of real estate by married woman,\u201d and by the 3rd section it is provided that a married woman may convey her real estate by deed to which the husband must be an executing party.\nBy \u201cThe Married Woman\u2019s Property Act, 1884,\u201d (47 Vic. cap. 19) which took effect on the 1st July, 1884, it is by section 2, subsection 1, enacted that:\u2014\nA married woman shall in accordance with the provisions of this Act be capable of acquiring, holding and disposing by will or otherwise, of any real or personal property as her separate property in the same manner as if she were a feme sole without the intervention of any trustee.\nSubsections 2 and 3 of the same act are as follows: Subsec. 2:\u2014A married woman shall be capable of entering into and rendering herself liable in respect of, and to the extent of, her separate property on any contract, and of suing and being sued either in contract or in tort or otherwise in all respects as if she were a feme sole, and her husband need not be joined with her as plaintiff or defendant, or be made a party to any action or other legal proceeding brought by or taken against her and any damages or costs recovered by her in any such action or proceeding shall be her separate property, and any damages or costs recovered against her in any such action or proceeding shall be payable out of her separate property and not otherwise.\nSubsec. 3:\u2014Every contract entered into by a married woman shall be deemed to be a contract entered into by her with respect to and to bind her separate property unless the contrary be shown.\nBy the last section of the statute (sec. 22) \u201cThe Married Woman\u2019s Property Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1877, c. 125, is repealed, and so much of section 3 of the \u201cMarried Woman\u2019s Real Estate Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1877, cap. 127, as required the husband to be a party to and to execute the conveyance by a married woman of her real estate is also repealed.\nI have now noticed all the material statutory enactments which in my opinion can apply to the present case. The \u201cMarried Woman\u2019s Property Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1887, cap. 132, so far as it alters the act of 1884, can have no application to the present case inasmuch as the Revised Statutes of that year did not take effect until 31st December, 1887, and the promissory notes, for the recovery of which the present action was brought, were made in May, June and July, 1887.\nThe question we have to answer, therefore, depends on the construction to be put on the two acts of 1877 and the act of 1884, read in the light furnished by certain clauses in the act of 1859.\nIt does not appear to me that in construing these statutes we have anything to do with the question of tenancy by the courtesy. As Mr. Justice Maclennan has put it in his judgment we may regard the case as if Mrs. Jackson\u2019s interest had been a mere life estate, in which case no question of tenancy by the courtesy could possibly arise. Again the doctrines of courts of equity as regards estates settled to the separate use of married women, either through the intervention of an express trustee or without a trustee, have, in my opinion, no bearing upon the question before us. So far from elucidating the acts of the legislature which we have to construe they would rather tend to embarrass us in performing that task, inasmuch as they present false and misleading analogies. No doubt the legislature might, if it had thought fit to do so, have referred to those doctrines as furnishing a proper standard by which to measure the rights and liabilities of married women as regards their legal separate estate created by the statutes, but I do not find that any such intention is expressed or is to be necessarily implied.\nThe separate estate of a married woman in property settled to her separate use was, as is well known, purely a creature of courts of equity originally introduced whilst that system of jurisprudence was in a formative stage. It was from time to time modelled and further developed, first by the introduction of the restraint upon anticipation, a fetter upon alienation which was altogether repugnant to the principles of the common law. Then it was further adapted to the case of a settlement upon a single woman to her separate use by providing that the separate use should arise as \u201ca postponed fetter\u201d (to use the words of Lord Langdale in Tullett v. Armstrong)[17], on her marriage. Next arose the question of the liability of this equitable property to make good the contractual liability of married women possessed of it. And lastly came the question as to her power of disposition over estates of freehold and inheritance in land thus settled. The settlement of these questions gave rise to rules involving much nicety and refinement which I can never think it was the intention of the legislature to have introduced into the statute law of Upper Canada and made applicable to the new species of statutory legal estate in land which was called into existence by the acts referred to.\nFurther, I do not consider that the extent of a married woman\u2019s power of voluntary disposition as regards her statutory separate estate is conclusive upon the question of the liability of that species of property to make good debts which she may have contracted. Incidentally this jus disponendi may have some relevancy in the interpretation of the statutes, but I cannot agree that it is in any way decisive.\nThe English cases decided upon the \u201cMarried Woman\u2019s Property Act\u201d (Imp.) 1882, so far as the legislation here has been borrowed from the English enactments, are applicable, but we have to be careful in applying them for the reason that the preceding legislation in England and in the province of Ontario was entirely different, and the Ontario statutes are of course all to be construed, especially as regards the meaning of terms, as in pari materi\u00e2.\nThe question then is: What, upon the true construction of the statutes before referred to, is the liability of the respondent Mrs. Jackson, a woman married after 1859 and before 1872, (viz., in 1869) upon these notes made in May, June and July, 1887, as regards these Etobicoke lands, which were acquired by her in 1879 and 1882? In Kraemar v. Gless[18] Draper C.J. speaking of the statutes of 1859, says:\u2014\nEvery provision for these purposes is a departure from the common law and so far as is necessary to give these provisions full effect we must hold the common law is superseded by them. But it is against principle and authority to infringe any further than is necessary for obtaining the full measure of relief or benefit the act was intended to give.\nThis principle of construction was adopted and acted upon by Spragge V.C. in Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell[19], by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Wright v. Garden[20], by my brother Gwynne in Balsam v. Robinson[21], and to the best of my ability I endeavoured to follow it in Mitchell v. Weir[22], and I propose to take it as a guide in the present case.\nThe right of Mrs. Jackson in these lands was originally dependent on the statute of 1877. By the third section of that act it was declared that a woman married between 1859 and 1872 should have in lands acquired by her after the statute precisely the same rights as were conferred upon a woman married after the 4th May, 1859, by the 1st section of Consolidated Statutes U.C. cap. 73, that is to say a right to\u2014\nHave, hold and enjoy her lands free from the debts and obligations of her husband and from his control or disposition without her consent in as full and ample a manner as if she continued sole and unmarried.\nIt was decided in the case of the Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell19, and Wright v. Garden20, that the estate which was thus conferred by the statute of 1859 upon women married after the date of that enactment was not liable to make good their debts, at least so far as debts arising under contracts are concerned, for the reason that the statute of 1859 neither imposed such a liability nor took away the common law disability of a married woman to bind herself by contract. Notwithstanding this, however, the right of unfettered enjoyment free from the control of the husband which the statute did confer was undoubtedly properly described and defined by the expression \u201cseparate estate\u201d or \u201cseparate property.\u201d We find indeed in the statute itself clear evidence of this. In the 16th and 18th sections of the statute of 1859 we find the new statutory property created in favour of femes covertes by the 21st section referred to by the legislature as her \u201cseparate property\u201d and her \u201cseparate estate.\u201d\nThis has a significance which I will refer to hereafter. In the case of Wright v. Garden[23], it was contended that the statute of 1859 had created separate property which was to be accompanied by the like incidents as property settled to the separate use had acccording to the doctrines of equity. One of the learned judges, Mr. Justice Wilson, was of this opinion; but the majority of the court repelled this construction and held that there was no liability, adopting the reasons which Spragge V.C. had previously stated for the same conclusion in the case of the Royal Canadian Bank v. Mitchell[24].\nIt follows; therefore, from these cases that by the reference to separate property in the statute of 1859 separate property in the sense in which the courts of equity used that term was not intended, but what was meant was that particular species of new separate property created by the statute itself. For this proposition, therefore, we have the high authority of the cases cited.\nThen the 20th section of the act of 1877 contains this clause:\u2014\nAny married woman may be sued or proceeded against separately from her husband in respect of any of her separate debts, engagements, contracts or torts as if she were unmarried.\nThe lands in question here were acquired after the statute was passed and before it was repealed. Would they then have been liable for the satisfaction of the promissory notes sued upon if there had been no repeal of this enactment?\nIn the first place this section 20 is not in terms confined to women married after the passing of the act of 1877; the words are \u201cany married woman\u201d which are extensive enough to include women married before the act. Then confining the operation of the provision to estates acquired after the act, and to contracts entered into also subsequently to the act, it surely could not be obnoxious to the rule against retroactive construction to hold that it did embrace married women included in the category provided for by the third section. This being so, what is the effect of saying that a married woman may be sued or proceeded against in respect of her separate debts, engagements and contracts as if she were unmarried?\nCan any rational meaning be attributed to such a statute other than this, that a creditor was to be at liberty not only to sue and proceed against a married woman upon her separate contract, but also that having so sued and proceeded against her and having obtained a judgment, he was to have execution of that judgment out of her separate property? Surely it was not meant to mock at creditors by telling them they might sue and recover a judgment, but that such a judgment was to be barren and fruitless because it had not been said specifically that it was to be satisfied out of the statutory separate estate. If there is such a thing as necessary implication we must have recourse to it here and hold that this right thus conferred to sue and proceed against a married woman upon her separate contract as if she was sole and unmarried implies that the judgment thus recovered was to be satisfied. Then, if it was to be satisfied satisfied out of what? What could be available to satisfy it except the judgment debtor\u2019s separate property. It must follow that the intention was to confer upon creditors the right to sue and to proceed against and enforce payment out of the statutory separate property of the debtor, or otherwise the clause would be wholly illusory.\nIn addition to the literal construction which I have referred to there is another reason why this 20th section should be held to include the class of women mentioned in the third section of the statute, those married between 1859 and 1872; it is this: Up to the date at which the Revised Statutes of 1877 came into force a married woman had no power of disposition over her real estate except by a deed to which her husband must have been a party, and which was ineffectual to pass her estate until she had been examined apart from her husband touching her consent to \u201cdepart\u201d with her estate. By chapter 127 R.S.O., 1877, before set forth, enlarged power was given her of conveying her land by a deed to which her husband was to be a party merely, an examination apart from her husband being now dispensed with. This was to some extent a relaxation, as was supposed, in the married woman\u2019s favour. This clearly applied to women married between 1859 and 1872. Then there being this dispensation with formalities previously required, and the power of alienation being thus enlarged, it was not unreasonable that as regards lands acquired after the statute married women should be made liable for their debts also contracted subsequently to that date.\nThe statute of 1877 was, however, repealed by the act of 1884, and although the 22nd section of the last act contains a saving of liability incurred under the act of 1877 yet that would not aid the appellant, inasmuch as his right and the corresponding liability did not accrue until the notes were made in 1887. We find, however, that assuming the correctness of my proposition that the liability created by the 20th section of the act of 1877 applied to women married between 1859 and 1872, the act of 1884 may, without any infringement of the rule against retroactive construction, be applied to the present case.\nIf Mrs. Jackson\u2019s lands in Etobicoke acquired by her in 1879 and 1882 were, under the act of 1877, liable for her contracts entered into subsequent to that act, it was not retrospective legislation offending against sound principles of construction that the statute which repealed the statute of 1877 should, as regards future contracts, also be held to provide a substitute for that liability neither greater nor less than that which the repealed act imposed. This is, in my opinion, just what the act of 1884 did by the 2nd and 3rd subsections of the 2nd section (which I have before set out.)\nThis act of 1884 greatly enlarged the power of disposition of married women for the 22nd section, repealing the previous law which required the concurrence of the husband of a married woman in any conveyance made by her, dispenses altogether with the necessity of such concurrence, and enables the married woman to convey alone provided she does so by deed.\nThenceforward married women were completely emancipated from their husbands\u2019 control both as regards the enjoyment and the disposition of their real estate. Can it be supposed that this would be the time and occasion chosen by the legislature to restrict the liability of their separate property? Surely not. So far then from there being any presumption against a continuance of the liability which existed under the statute of 1877, there ought, I think, to be a presumption that the legislature did not intend to withdraw from liability to the future separate creditors of married women any of their property which had previously been liable to creditors under the statute of 1877. All we have to see is, whether the language of the act is sufficiently comprehensive to include persons such as the respondent as regards the date of her marriage and as regards property acquired previously to the act and under the regime of the act of 1877. Subsection 2 says that a married woman shall be capable of entering into and rendering herself liable in respect of, and to the extent of her separate property on, any contracts, and of being sued as if she were a feme sole. And subsection 3 says, every contract entered into by a married woman shall be deemed to be a contract entered into and to bind her separate property, unless the contrary be shown.\nThis language is comprehensive enough to include the respondent and her liability as regards all these lands. It applies to all married women unless it is restricted to some particular class of them by the rule against retrospectivity. That rule, however, cannot apply here for, as I hope I have demonstrated, the 20th section of the statute of 1877 imposed, in other words it is true, just such a liability, and this merely carries on or continues the same liability.\nIt is not then to innovate in any way upon the respondent\u2019s rights to say that, as regards contracts entered into subsequent to the act of 1884, these clauses apply in the appellant\u2019s favour.\nAs to the words \u201cseparate property\u201d used in these subsections I have already, I think, sufficiently demonstrated that these words, first found in the statutes of 1859, are entirely applicable to the real property of a married woman the title of which was acquired under the statutes of 1877, section 3.\nI would lastly remark that I have been unable to see the force of the ratio decidendi of the Court of Appeal. Holding, as I do, that the statutes of 1884 subsections 2 and 3 apply, I think it quite immaterial what the married woman\u2019s power of disposition may be. No doubt courts of equity act upon the theory or presumption that a married woman who has separate property when she contracts a debt intends to make such separate estate as she then has liable to answer it, and it is so liable or at least so much of it as she retains when sued.\nIf a married woman was restricted in dealing with her separate equitable estate to an alienation by deed she could not make it liable for her promissory notes without a charge by deed. But there is no analogy between that and the present case. Surely it was competent for the legislature, if they thought fit to do so, to say that a married woman should not be competent to dispose of her property in any way, and yet to say that she should be liable on her contracts as if she were a feme sole and that to the extent of her estate.\nIt is all a matter of statutory construction and though the legislature have not done what I have above supposed yet they have by section 20 of the act of 1877 and subsections 2 and 3 of section 2 declared, not merely that the separate property shall be liable (which is all a court of equity does in the case of equitable separate estate), but they have declared that \u201ca married woman shall be capable of entering into any contract as if she were a feme sole,\u201d thus doing what a court of equity could not do\u2014repealing the rule of the common law and creating a new legal liability. To this they have superadded the declaration that this liability shall be to the extent of her separate property. The liability here does not, therefore, depend upon the power of disposition, but upon the direct and positive enactment declaring the liability of the woman personally as well as that of her estate.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench restored. FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question raised by this appeal is whether or not real property in the province of Ontario acquired in 1879 and 1882, in fee simple by a married woman who had been married in 1869, was liable to the satisfaction of a judgment recovered against her in an action brought against her for the breach of contracts entered into by her in 1887, and in my opinion that question is concluded in favour of the appellant, the judgment creditor, by the provincial statute of 1884, 47 Vic. ch. 19. Whatever difficulty there has been in the case seems to me to have arisen from what I cannot but think was the too hasty and inconsiderate introduction into the provincial act of certain sections of the Imperial act of 1882 in ipsissimis verbis and from the decisions of the courts in England upon one of the sections of that act; but the difficulty is wholly removed, I think, when we consider carefully the different state of the law which existed in England respecting the property of married women prior to, and at the time of, the passing of the Imperial act of 1882, from that which existed in the province of Ontario when the provincial act of 1884 was passed, and the great difference between the circumstances of the present case, and the question raised in relation thereto, and the circumstances of the cases in England to which we have been referred, and the question in those cases decided upon one of the sections of the Imperial act which has been imported verbatim into the provincial act.\nThe Imperial Act of 1882, 45 & 46 Vic. ch. 75, was passed, as its title and preamble show, for the purpose of consolidating and amending two acts, viz., the Married Woman\u2019s Property Act of 1870, and an act of 1874 37 & 38 Vic. ch. 50, which had been passed to amend some provisions of the act of 1870. By this act of 1870 a married woman was enabled to hold as her separate property all the wages and earnings acquired by her after the passing of the act in any occupation, trade or employment in which she might be engaged, and to make deposits in savings banks and to invest monies belonging to her in the funds and in shares in joint stock companies in her own name, and to effect insurances upon her own life and the life of her husband, and to hold all such moneys, stock, shares and policies of insurance as her separate property. And as to women who should be married after the passing of the act it was by the 7th section enacted that where any woman married after the passing of the act should during her marriage become entitled to any personal property as next of kin, or one of the next of kin, of an intestate, or to any sum of money not exceeding two hundred pounds under any deed or will, such property should, subject and without prejudice to the trusts of any settlement affecting the same, belong to the woman for her separate use and her receipts alone should be a good discharge for the same; and the 8th section enacted that where any freehold, copyhold or customary hold property should descend upon any woman married after the passing of the act as heiress or co-heiress of an intestate, the rents and profits of such property should, subject and without prejudice to the trusts of any settlement affecting the same, belong to such woman for her separate use, and that her receipts alone should be a good discharge for the same. Save as above provided a married woman was incapable of acquiring and holding any real or personal property as her separate property and free from the control and disposition and from the debts and obligations of her husband, unless it should be vested in trustees for the use and benefit of the married woman separate and apart from her husband. By the act of 1870 it was further enacted that a husband should not, in the case of any marriage which should take place after the passing of the act, be liable for the debts of his wife contracted before marriage, but that the wife should be liable to be sued for, and that any property belonging to her for her separate use should be liable to satisfy, such debts as if she had continued unmarried. This clause made the interest of every woman married after the passing of the act in all property vested in trustees for her separate use and benefit, as well as all property declared by the act to be her separate property, liable to the satisfaction of debts incurred by her dum sola, thus wholly relieving the husband of every woman married after the passing of the act from all liability in respect of all such debts, and leaving him, as all husbands married before the passing of the act were, entitled to all the property which the wife had dum sola at the time of her marriage, to the same extent precisely as before the passing of the act. This was deemed an injustice, and to remedy it the Married Woman\u2019s Property Amendment Act of 1874, 37 & 38 Vic. ch. 50, was passed, which recites that it was not just that the property which a woman has at the time of her marriage should pass to her husband, and that he should not be liable for her debts contracted before marriage, and that the law as to the recovery of such debts required amendment; it then repealed the provisions of the act of 1870 which exempted the husband from liability for the debts of his wife contracted before marriage, in so far as respects marriages which should take place after the passing of the act, and enacted that husband and wife married after the passing of the act might be sued jointly for any such debt, and proceeded to declare that in such action or in any action brought for damages sustained by reason of any tort committed by the wife before marriage, or by reason of the breach of any contract made by her before marriage, the husband should be liable to the extent only of the assets of the wife thereinafter mentioned, namely, the value of the property, real and personal, of the wife which by the marriage vested in the husband.\nSuch was the state of the law in England when the act of 1882 was passed for the purpose of consolidating the acts of 1870 and 1874 and of amending their provisions by extending the rights of married women in their real and personal property by enacting in substance, as it appears to me the act does, that every married woman, whenever married, whether before or after the passing of the act, should be capable of acquiring, holding and disposing by will or otherwise of any real or personal property as her separate property, in the same manner as if she were a feme sole, that is to say, the woman who should marry after the passing of the act, as provided in the 2nd section, and the woman who had been married before the passing of the act, as provided in the 5th section, thus conforming to the provisions of the 1st section which applies to every married woman whenever married. The only sections to which it is necessary to refer for the purposes of the present case are these 1st, 2nd and 5th sections, which enact as follows:\u2014\n1. A married woman shall in accordance with the provisions of this Act be capable of acquiring, holding and disposing, by will or otherwise, of any real or personal property as her separate property in the same manner as if she were a feme sole without the intervention of any trustee.\n(2.) A married woman shall be capable of entering into and rendering herself liable in respect of, and to the extent of, her separate property on any contract, and of suing and being sued, either in contract or in tort or otherwise, in all respects as if she were a feme sole, and her husband need not be joined with her as plaintiff or defendant or be made a party to any action or other legal proceeding brought by or against her; and any damages or costs recovered by her in any such action or proceeding shall be her separate property; and any damages or costs recovered against her in any such action or proceeding shall be payable out of her separate property and not otherwise.\n(3.) Every contract entered into by a married woman shall be deemed to be a contract entered into by her with respect to and to bind her separate property unless the contrary be shown.\n(4.) Every contract entered into by a married woman with respect to and to bind her separate property, shall bind not only the separate property which she is possessed of or entitled to at the date of the contract, but also all separate property which she may thereafter acquire.\n(5.) Every married woman carrying on a trade separately from her husband shall in respect of her separate property be subject to the bankruptcy laws as if she were a feme sole.\n2nd section. Every woman who marries after the commencement of this act shall be entitled to have and to hold as her separate property and to dispose of, in any manner as aforesaid, all real and personal property which shall belong to her at the time of marriage or shall be acquired by or devolve upon her after marriage, including any wages, earnings money and property gained or acquired by her in any employment, trade or occupation in which she is engaged or which she carries on separately from her husband or by the exercise of any literary, artistic or scientific skill.\n5th section. Every woman married before the commencement of this act shall be entitled to have and to hold and to dispose of in manner as aforesaid; as her separate property, all real and personal property, her title to which, whether vested or contingent and whether in possession, reversion or remainder shall accrue after the commencement of this act, including any wages, earnings, money so gained and acquired by her as aforesaid.\nNow these 2nd and 5th sections were quite appropriate having regard to the law as it previously stood and was being amended, which did not enable any married woman to acquire and hold as her separate property any real or personal property otherwise than to the limited extent specified in the 7th and 8th sections of the act of 1870, or through the intervention of a trustee who should hold the property for her use and benefit separate and apart from her husband. The first section then which enabled every married woman to acquire hold and dispose by will or otherwise of any real or personal property, in the same manner as if she were a feme sole without the intervention of any trustee, was an extremely appropriate provision to be inserted in the English act. Having regard also to the fact that in the property real and personal of women married before the passing of the act of 1882 husbands at the time of the passing of that act had vested in them the right of holding and enjoying to their own use and benefit such property as belonged to the wife at the time of the marriage, or was acquired by her subsequently other than such as might be acquired to the limited extent named in the act of 1870, or was vested in a trustee for her to her use and benefit separate from her husband, it was natural, reasonable, and appropriate that the distinction should be made between women married after the passing of the act and those then already married which is made in the 2nd and 5th sections. Under this 5th section arose the case of Reid v. Reid[25] to which we have been referred as a judgment of the Court of Appeal wherein the court reviewing several cases, namely, Baynton v. Collins[26]; In re Thompson and Curzon[27]; In re Hughes\u2019 Trusts[28]; In re Tucker[29]; In re Adames\u2019 Trusts[30]; In re Hobson[31] and In re Dixon[32], hold that where a woman married before the passing of the act of 1882 had, before the passing of the act, acquired a title in reversion subject to a life estate to certain property in excess of what she could have acquired as her separate property under the act of 1870, such property falling into possession after the passing of the act was not made her separate property by section 5. The object of the suit was to have it declared that the property in question was her separate property under that section, or in the alternative that it might be settled on her and her children. If the property had already been settled to her separate use the action would have been unnecessary, but not having been so settled it became the property of her husband who could have disposed of it and who in point of fact had (although after the passing of the act). It became necessary, therefore, for the wife in order to obtain the benefit of the property separate from her husband to establish that it had become her separate property under the section 5, but Lord Justice Cotton pronouncing judgment said:\u2014\nThere is a title accruing in reversion before the passing of the act. The husband acquires a title to it subject to his wife\u2019s equity to a settlement if it falls into possession during coverture, and subject to her right by survivorship if he dies before it has been reduced into possession leaving her surviving. He might before the passing of this act have disposed of it by mortgage or sale subject to the wife\u2019s equity to a settlement and to her chance of survivorship. If the construction contended for by the respondent (the wife) is correct the title of the person claiming under the husband would be ousted, and the wife, notwithstanding the dealing with the property by the husband, would take it as her separate estate when it fell into possession.* * * In my opinion considering the section truly and fairly there must be an accruer of title after and not before the passing of the act, and the title must be considered as accruing when the married woman first acquires her interest in the property whether such interest is at that time in possession, reversion, or remainder.\nNow we have only to consider what the nature of the title of the defendant in the present case to the property in question, with which alone we are at present concerned, was at the time of the passing of the Ontario Act of 1884 to see the utter inappropriateness and incongruity of this section 5 as regards the property of a married woman in the province of Ontario married before the passing of the act of 1884, and the inapplicability of the judgment in Reid v. Reid[33] to such a case as the present. Immediately upon the defendant acquiring the respective pieces of land in 1879 and 1882 she became seized of an estate of fee simple therein under ch. 125 R.S.O. 1877, which was but a repetition in that particular of ch. 73 C.S.U.C. in 1859, and under that act she had held and enjoyed the property:\u2014\nFree from the debts and obligations of her husband and free from his control and disposition without her consent, in as full and ample a manner as if she were sole and unmarried.\nAnd by chapter 127, sec. 3, of the same revised statutes she was enabled to convey such her estate in the said lands by deed as fully and effectually as if \u201cshe were a feme sole,\u201d except that it was provided that to make her conveyance of the land valid and effectual her husband must be a party to and execute the deed. Now the Ontario Act of 1884 having repealed this exception or proviso in sec. 3, of ch. 127, eo instanti upon the passing of that act the defendant became absolutely entitled to convey the said lands in fee simple as her separate property as fully and effectually as if she were a feme sole, by a deed executed by herself alone without her husband being a party to and executing the deed; this estate in the lands in question she still held when the promissory notes sued upon were made by her in June and July, 1887.\nThe act of 1884 also, while repealing ch. 125 R.S.O. 1877, enacted that such repeal should not affect any right acquired while the act was in force and thereby preserved the rights of all women then married to the property theretofore acquired by them under ch. 125, and eo instanti of enacting such repealing clause the act enacted in its 2nd section the 1st section of the English Act of 1882, in ipsissimis verbis save only the omission of subsection 5 omitted because of there being no bankruptcy law then in the Dominion of Canada, and thereby enacted, in language as I have shown sufficient to include every married woman, that a married woman should be capable not only of acquiring but of holding and disposing by will or otherwise of any real or personal property as her separate property, in the same manner as if she were feme sole. This power of disposition is in precise conformity with the clause of the act which repealed the exception or proviso contained in sec. 3 of ch. 127 R.S.O. 1877. The effect of this 2nd section, subsection 1, coupled with the said repealing clause, as regards the property in question in my opinion was, that eo instanti upon the passing of the act the defendant remained seized of the property in question as she had been before the act as her separate property, but discharged from the effect of the exception or proviso which previously had been contained in sec. 3 of ch. 127, and invested with the incident attached to absolute ownership of being able to dispose of the property by will or otherwise by the express enactment contained in the said 2nd section, so as to remove all doubt that after the passing of the act of 1884 she was seized of an absolute estate of inheritance in fee simple in the lands in question as her separate property which, under the 2nd subsection of section 2, was expressly made liable to satisfy all damages and costs recovered against her in any action instituted against her upon any contract entered into or tort committed by her.\nIn the argument before us this construction of the act and this application of the 1st subsection of the 2nd section to the property in question was not alluded to; the argument was confined on the part of the appellant to dispute, and upon the part of the respondent to support, the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which mainly appears to have rested upon this argument, that the repeal of the exception contained in the 3rd section of ch. 127 only enabled the married woman to convey her real property by deed, and that therefore she could not dispose of it by will, and as a resulting consequence it was argued that the property in question could not be levied upon and made available for satisfaction of an execution issued upon a judgment recovered against the defendant in an action instituted by authority of law against her; that is to say, that while she can cut off any estate by the courtesy which the husband might have, and can convey away absolutely for her own benefit all her real property by deed inter vivos, she can, by not conveying it but holding on to it, obtain credit upon the strength of her having it, and prevent her judgment creditors from obtaining satisfaction thereout of their judgment debts. I have already expressed my opinion that section 1 of 47 Vic. ch. 19 enabled every married woman to dispose of her real property by will or otherwise; but apart altogether from this clause, and resting solely upon the repeal of the exception in section 3 of ch. 127 R.S.O., 1877, it is clear that every married woman can dispose of absolutely (by deed executed by herself alone) the whole estate which is vested in her. So long as she lives, therefore, it cannot be doubted that she has an absolute jus disponendi of all real property which the law enables her to hold and enjoy free from the control and disposition and from the debts and obligations of her husband. Now the real property of every judgment debtor, to the extent of his estate therein, is bound by a judgment recovered against the debtor and execution issued to enforce satisfaction of such judgment. There is no law which makes the case of a married woman judgment debtor any exception from that rule; on the contrary, the 2nd subsection of section 2, which enables her to enter into any contract and of being sued thereon, or in tort, in all respects as if she were a feme sole, and that, all damages and costs recovered against her on any action instituted against her shall be payable out of her separate property, in express terms subjects her to the provisions of the general law respecting writs of execution, ch. 66 R.S.O., 1877, the 14th section of which declares that:\u2014\nAny person who becomes entitled to issue a writ of execution against goods and chattels may, at or after the time of issuing the same, issue a writ of execution against the lands and tenements of the person liable.\nThe estate vested in her in the lands in question was an estate in fee simple even though her husband, if he should survive her, might have an estate by the courtesy therein. Whether he would or not have such estate it is not necessary to decide in the present case, and I express no opinion. Whether she could or could not dispose of the lands by will is immaterial, for it is clear and is admitted that she could dispose of them absolutely by a deed inter vivos, and that estate which she could have disposed of by a deed executed by herself alone is what the law has expressly made liable to satisfy the judgment obtained against her, and she has no more right than any other judgment debtor to defeat the rights of her judgment creditors by a voluntary or fraudulent conveyance. I have not overlooked the case of Douglas v. Hutchison[34]. Mr. Justice Street considered it to be distinguishable from the present case. I have not thought it necessary to consider whether it be so or not, for if it be not it will be seen from what I have already said that I cannot concur in it, and unless and until our judgment in the present case shall be reversed it cannot hereafter be considered of binding authority. The appeal must be allowed, with costs, and the judgment of the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench restored. PATTERSON J.\u2014Mrs. Jackson, a married woman, made several promissory notes, all of them in the months of May, June and July, 1887, payable to the plaintiff.\nShe was married in 1869 without a settlement.\nShe had acquired real estate in the township of Etobicoke in 1879 and 1882 by conveyances to herself in fee without the intervention of a trustee.\nThe question is whether, under the law of Ontario as it existed in 1887, the Etobicoke lands were charged so as to be exigible for the payment of the notes.\nThe Revised Statutes of 1887 did not come into force until the 31st of December of that year. The law has therefore to be looked for in the Revised Statutes of 1877 and some later acts\nThe Married Woman\u2019s Property Act, which was chapter 127 of R.S.O. 1877, was repealed and replaced by The Married Women\u2019s Property Act 1884[35].\nBy the Married Women\u2019s Real Estate Act[36] as amended by the Married Women\u2019s Property Act 1884, every married woman of the full age of 21 years was empowered to convey by deed her real estate and to do other specified things as fully and effectually as she could do if she were a feme sole.\nThe Married Woman\u2019s Property Act 1884, while it repealed chapter 125 of the R.S.O. 1877, provided that the repeal should not affect any act done or right acquired while chapter 125 was in force.\nLooking at the third section of that act which was in force in 1879 and 1882 when the Etobicoke properties were acquired by Mrs. Jackson we find it enacted that:\u2014\nEvery woman who married between the 5th day of May, 1859, and the 2nd day of March, 1872, without any marriage contract or settlement shall and may, notwithstanding her coverture, have hold and enjoy all her real property, whether belonging to her before marriage, or acquired by her by inheritance, demise or gift, or as heir-at-law to an intestate, or any other way after marriage free from the debts and obligations of her husband, and from his control or disposition without her consent, in as full and ample a manner as if she continued sole and unmarried, but this section shall not extend to any property received by a married woman from her husband during coverture.\nThe 4th section enables a woman who married after the 2nd day of March, 1872, to hold her real estate for her separate use free from any estate therein of her husband during her lifetime and from his debts and obligations, and from any claim or estate by him as tenant by the courtesy, but provides that nothing therein contained shall prejudice the right of the husband as tenant by the courtesy in any real estate of the wife which she has not disposed of inter vivos or by will; but in the case of woman married, as Mrs. Jackson was, before 1872, the husband\u2019s estate by the courtesy remains as at common law.\nThe state of the law respecting the property of married women and their power to charge it by their general engagements under the Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1859[37], was ably explained by Moss C.J. in the case of Furness v. Mitchell[38]. I do not propose to enter at present upon an historical examination of the subject. For that I refer to the judgment just mentioned, and to what was said in that case by the Chief Justice and other judges of whom I was one, and to my judgment in Lawson v. Laidlaw[39].\nThe act of 1859 called the property enjoyed under its provisions \u201cseparate property.\u201d I referred in Furness v. Mitchell38, to five sections of the statute in which it was so designated. But it was held that some qualities of separate property, as recognized by courts of equity and as capable under the doctrines of those courts of being charged by a married woman by her general engagement, were wanting paticularly the jus disponendi, the woman being incapable of disposing of her property except by a deed in which her husband joined and the husband having still his estate by the courtesy, and that therefore the property, though designated separate property by the statute, was not separate in the sense essential to the married woman\u2019s power to create the equitable charge upon it.\nHas that state of things been changed by the act of 1884? That is the main question before us.\nIt has, in my opinion, been changed.\nThe effect may be the same when property is charged by the general engagements of a married woman whether the charge is one depending in doctrines of courts of equity, or is effected by a process authorized or sanctioned by statute law, but it is to be noted that what was formally recognized only in equity is now a statutory principle. Take subsections 3 and 4 of section 2 which I have already quoted, and apply those provisions to the contracts now sought to be enforced, viz., the promissory notes made by Mrs. Jackson; each note is deemed to be a contract entered into by her with respect to and to bind her separate property, and binds not only the property she was possessed of or entitled to at the dates of the notes respectively, but also all separate property thereafter acquired by her.\nThen were these Etobicoke properties her separate property?\nThey certainly were so, and were so as to the full and absolute estate in fee, subject only to the husband\u2019s right by the courtesy.\nThat right may exist without destroying the character of separate estate even when the separate estate of the wife is equitable only, and of course may when by the operation of a statute it becomes a legal estate. Morgan v. Morgan[40]; Appleton v. Rowley[41].\nNo question of jus disponendi is now open. The necessity for the husband joining in a deed by which the wife conveys her property or any interest therein was done away with by the act of 1884[42]; but that restriction in her power to convey by deed would not, as it would seem to me, have prevented the effect given to her contracts by section 2.\nMrs. Jackson\u2019s property in the Etobicoke lands was in my opinion separate property and was bound by her contracts under section 2, subsections 3 and 4, that is to say the fee simple of the lands was bound subject to her husband\u2019s right if all things existed necessary to create in him an estate by the courtesy. His right as possible tenant by the courtesy should no more stand in the way of making his wife\u2019s estate exigible for her debts than would her right of dower stand in the way of a creditor of the husband who sought to enforce a judgment against the husband\u2019s lands.\nIn my opinion we should allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the divisional court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Roaf & Roaf.\nSolicitors for respondent: Armour, Mickle & Williams.\n[1] 19 Ont.

At that time a municipality was not authorized to construct a street railway beyond its territorial limits. The by-law was voted upon by the ratepayers and passed but none was submitted ordering the construction of the work. Subsequently an act was passed by the legislature of Ontario in respect to the said by-law which enacted that the same \u201cis hereby confirmed and declared to be valid, legal and binding on the town * * * and for all purposes, &c., relating to or affecting the said by-law any and all amendments of the municipal act * * * shall be deemed and taken as having been complied with.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the said act did not dispense with the requirements of ss. 504 and 505 of the municipal act requiring a by-law providing for construction of the railway to be passed, but only confirmed the one that was passed as a money by-law.\nHeld, also, that an erroneous recital in the preamble to the act that the Town Council had passed a construction by-law bad no effect on the question to be decided.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nMr. Justice Street granted an injunction until the trial restraining the Town Council from paying out any money for the building of the street railway and the contractors from proceeding with its construction. At the trial the interim injunction was, by consent of parties, made perpetual against the town subject to appeal and the action was dismissed against the other defendants, individual members of the council and the contractors. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of the trial judge was reversed, the injunction set aside and liberty was given to respondents to apply for a reference to ascertain the damages sustained by the continuance of the injunction after the validating act came in force. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nAylesworth Q.C., for the appellant.\nDelamere Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The by-law no. 281 passed on or about the 5th January, 1891, was ultra vires of the corporation and void inasmuch as it made provision for the raising of a sum of $75,000 \u201cfor the purpose of building, equipping, maintaining and operating a street railway connecting the municipality of Neebing with the business centre\u201d of the town of Port Arthur. As the law then stood the municipal corporation of a town had no statutory authority to raise money for any such purpose. Had the by-law been restricted to the raising a fund for the construction of a street railway wholly within the limits of the municipality I am not prepared to say that it would have been void merely because a by-law under sec. 504, subsec. 14 of the Municipal Act (as amended by sec. 25 of the Municipal Amendment Act of 1890) providing for the construction of the road upon such terms as the Lieut. Governor in Council should approve, had not been previously passed after a due compliance with the preliminaries and conditions required by section 505 of the Municipal Act. There is nothing in the statute indicating the order in which the by-law for construction and the by-law for raising money to be applied to that purpose are to be passed. The other objection that the by-law provided for a work of railway construction beyond the limits of the municipality was, however, a fatal one. Then there was a necessity for validating the by-laws as a financial ordinance, more especially as debentures appear to have been issued under it. This was done by the local act 54 Vic. ch. 78 passed on the 4th May, 1891, which was entitled \u201cAn Act to consolidate the debt of the town of Port Arthur.\u201d The preamble recites inter alia that the corporation had passed a by-law authorizing the construction and operation of the Electric Street Railway by a majority of the electors voting thereon on the 5th January, 1891, and that the corporation had petitioned that, for the purpose of removing all doubts as to the validity of the by-law, the same might be confirmed and legalized. Several other subjects besides this street railway matter were embraced in the act. Then the 15th section is that part of the enacting portion of the act which is material here; it enacts that \u201cthe said by-law,\u201d (that before referred to) \u201cis hereby confirmed and declared to be valid, legal and binding on the town, notwithstanding anything in any act or law to the contrary. And for all purposes, matters and things whatsoever relating to or affecting the said by-law any and all amendments of the Municipal Act having force and effect on the 1st of August, 1891, shall be deemed and taken as having been complied with, and as having been made and been in full force and effect prior to, the passing of said by-law.\u201d\nBy 54 Vic. ch. 42 a subsec. (16) was added to sec. 504 of the Municipal Act by which city and town municipalities were authorized to construct street railways extending beyond their own limits.\nThis provision was, however, not to come into force until the 1st July, 1891.\nThe question in this appeal is whether the validating act before referred to had the effect of dispensing with the requirements of the Municipal Act that a by-law authorizing construction should be passed, or whether it was intended only thereby to confirm the by-law of the 5th January, 1891, as a money by-law.\nThe erroneous recital in the preamble that the Town Council had passed a construction by\u2011law can, in my opinion, have no effect whatever on this question. It is well settled that an erroneous recital of a fact in an act of Parliament may be controverted, and that a mistaken assumption of law is not conclusive. I need not do more that to refer on this head to a well known text book where all the cases are collected[2]. Then a reference to the by-law itself, set out in the schedule to the act, shows conclusively that it did not provide for construction but merely for the issuing of the debentures by means of which the fund for construction was to be raised.\nThe only other argument which it is necessary to notice is that founded on the provision that for all purposes, matters and things relating to and affecting the by-law, all amendments of the Municipal Act having effect on the 1st August, 1891, should be deemed and taken as having been complied with, and as having been in full force when the by-law was passed.\nI am unable to see in this anything like a legislative dispensation with the requirements of the 504th and 505th secs. of the Municipal Act before adverted to, requiring a by-law providing for construction to be passed under the conditions therein enacted. The provisions in question are of great importance to the ratepayers giving them a control over the expenditure of their money, and I am decidedly of opinion that it is incumbent on the courts not to allow these rights of the ratepayers to be taken away by any ambiguous or uncertain expressions in a legislative enactment which might well have another object in view.\nI think it is the bounden duty of the courts to construe with the utmost strictness all retroactive legislation of this kind, and in the absence of express words to decline to enlarge by implication the terms in which such statutes are expressed.\nI can find nothing in the validating act taking away the rights of the ratepayers to control the construction of the railway, and I must, therefore, express my adherence to the judgment of Mr. Justice Street, and the reasons he has given for holding the contrary.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice McMahon should be affirmed with costs to the appellant in this court and in all the courts below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Wink & Cameron.\nSolicitors for respondents: Keefer & Boyce.\n[1] 19 Ont.

Ewart v. Gordon (13 Gr. 40) discussed.\nW. and C. were executors and trustees of an estate, under a will. W., without the concurrence of C., lent money of the estate on mortgage, and afterwards assigned the mortgages which were executed in favour of himself, described as \u201ctrustee of the estate and effects of\u201d (the testator.) In the assignment of the mortgages he was described in the same way. W. was afterwards removed from the trusteeship and an action was brought by the new trustees against the assignees of the mortgages to recover the proceeds of the same.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that in taking and assigning said mortgages W. acted as a trustee and not as an executor; that he was guilty of a breach of trust in taking and assigning them in his own name; that his being described on the face of the instruments as a trustee was constructive notice to the assignees of the trusts, which put them on inquiry; and that the assignees were not relieved as persons rightfully and innocently dealing with trustees, inasmuch as the breach of trust consisted in the dealing with the securities themselves and not in the use made of the proceeds.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2], which affirmed the judgment of the Chancellor[3].\nThe plaintiffs are the trustees of the estate of James Cumming, and the action was brought to recover from defendants the proceeds of certain mortgages assigned to them by Thomas B. Wragg, formerly an executor and trustee of the estate.\nWragg and Robert Cumming were executors and trustees under the will of James Cumming, the management being almost entirely left to Wragg, his co-executor being only eighteen years old at his father\u2019s death. Wragg lent money of the estate and took mortgages in his own name, being described in the instrument as \u201cThomas Busby Wragg, of the city of Belleville, Esquire, trustee of the estate and effects of the late James Cumming, deceased.\u201d Two of these mortgages were assigned to a building society and in the assignment Wragg was described as in the mortgages.\nNegotiations were subsequently made by one Bell, solicitor of the estate, with the defendants for a loan to pay off the money borrowed from the building society, which was agreed to and a new assignment was made by Wragg to the defendants, in which Wragg was also described as in the former instruments. Except this description the defendants had no knowledge of Wragg\u2019s position or of the affairs of the estate.\nAn action on behalf of the estate was brought against Wragg to make him account for his dealings with the estate money and judgment was recovered against him for a large amount, and he was removed from the trusteeship. The present action was then brought by the newly appointed trustees against the defendants.\nThe action was tried before the Chancellor who gave judgment in favour of the plaintiffs[4]. His judgment was affirmed by the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[5], whose decision was afterwards reversed by the Court of Appeal[6]. The plaintiffs then brought the present appeal.\nMarsh Q.C., for the appellants, referred to Duncan v. Jaudon[7]; Hill v. Simpson[8]; and Haynes v. Forshaw[9], where Hill v. Simpson8 is cited as authorities for the contention that defendants, in dealing with Wragg, were bound to make inquiries\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Mackelean Q.C., for the respondents, cited Ashlon v. Atlantic Bank[10]; Forbes v. Peacock[11].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The Chancellor by whom this action was originally tried, the Queen\u2019s Bench Division consisting of three judges, and the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, all came to the conclusion that in the matter of the assignment of the mortgages in question Wragg was acting as trustee, and not in the capacity of executor, under the will of James Cumming. Three learned judges of the Court of Appeal arrived at a contrary conclusion. In the several judgments which were delivered in the courts below the reasons for and against the view which ultimately prevailed are fully set forth.\nI have come to the conclusion that the judgment in the court of first instance was entirely right, and that for the reasons given by the Chancellor to whose conclusions, as both regards the facts and the law, I give my unqualified assent.\nHad Wragg not been an executor under the will of Cumming at all no one can doubt that there would have been a breach of trust in the assignment of these mortgages of which the respondents must be deemed to have had notice. That there would have been in that case in fact a breach of trust is evident, as Wragg had no power to deal with or transfer the securities in which the trust funds belonging to the estate might happen to be invested.\nGranting that there was authority to invest the trust funds in the mortgages to Foley & Brignall yet Wragg would have been guilty of a breach of trust in taking those securities in his own name alone. He would have been guilty of a further breach of trust when he assigned these mortgages to the building society, and of yet another dereliction of his duty as a trustee when he made the transfer to the respondents.\nThen, on the face of all the instruments,\u2014the mortgages themselves, the assignments to the building society, the re-assignments by the latter to Wragg, and the assignments by Wragg to the respondents,\u2014he is described as a trustee. This was beyond all doubt or question sufficient to give notice to the respondents that he was a trustee professing to act under some trust contained in the will of James Cumming. They, therefore, had constructive notice of the trusts contained in that instrument. If they had made the inquiries which they ought to have made they would surely and easily have discovered the fraud and breach of trust which Wragg was perpetrating.\nIt is said, however, that Wragg having been an executor as well as a trustee, and the law being that as an executor he had power without the concurrence of his co-executor to make a valid mortgage of any of the assets provided the mortgagees had no notice either from the nature of the transaction or from extrinsic circumstances that he was acting in fraud of the estate, he must be assumed to have been acting as executor in these transactions, and that therefore the respondents having had no actual notice of any breach of trust are purchasers for value without notice and entitled to hold the mortgages as such. The case of Ewart v. Gordon[12] is relied on as an authority for this. I was counsel for the defendant in that case, and my recollection of it, confirmed by a recent perusal of the judgment, leads me to the same conclusion as the Chancellor, viz.: that the actual decision there has no bearing on the present question.\nAs regards Wragg himself and all persons taking securities from him it would, I think, without altogether ignoring Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal,[13] be impossible to say that he was not acting as on the face of these instruments he declared himself to be acting, viz., as a trustee and not as an executor.\nThe respondents\u2019 own officer in his evidence swears that the respondents\u2019 company dealt with Wragg as a trustee, and in their statement of defence they do not even set up the ground the majority of the Court of Appeal have rested their judgment upon, namely, that he was acting as an executor.\nI think it impossible now to hold that Wragg was acting as executor after having announced himself to be dealing with the respondents as a trustee, and after their own officer\u2019s admission that they dealt with him in that character.\nFurther, I am not prepared to say that after all the debts of an estate are paid, and after the lapse of ten years from the testator\u2019s death, there ought not to be in any case at least a presumption that one of several executor-trustees who is dealing with assets is so dealing with them qu\u00e2 trustee and not as executor. I think in such a case it should lie on the person seeking to uphold the transaction to show that he dealt with the other party as an executor. What I have now said may perhaps to some extent contravene propositions laid down in Ewart v. Gordon[14], or in some of the cases relating to the same estate decided at the same time. I should be unwilling to do this did I not feel that that case was a very strong decision bearing hardly on the beneficiaries of the estate. I do not go so far as to say that the presumption I speak of ought to be conclusive, but I think it ought at least to shift the burden of proof. Then, if it is sufficient for that purpose it is clear that the respondents here cannot say that they did not deal with Wragg as a trustee, for they accepted transfers of these securities from him acting ostensibly in that character, and moreover their officer says they dealt with him as a trustee.\nI also agree with Mr. Justice Street that if it was necessary to show that these mortgages had been appropriated to the trust (referring to the case of Willmott v. Jenkins)[15], there was proof of such an appropriation here, inasmuch as that fact appeared from the form of the mortgage deeds themselves. What could show more plainly that personal assets held originally by an executor, who was also a trustee, had been turned over to the trust than the fact that he had invested them in securities taken in favour of the trust?\nIf there had been within the scope of the trust power in Wragg acting alone to deal with these securities in the way he has done, and the only breach of trust had consisted in his misapplication of the moneys received from the respondents, then it would have been a case within the statute which relieves persons rightfully and innocently dealing with trustees from seeing to the application of purchase money and loans. But, as I have said, the dealing with the securities themselves, not merely the use made of the proceeds, involved a breach of trust of which the respondents must be taken to have had constructive notice.\nThe original judgment pronounced by the Chancellor must be affirmed with costs to the appellants in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Lount, Marsh & Lindsey.\nSolicitors for respondents: Mackelcan, Gibson & Gausley.\n[1] 19 Ont.

He applied to a bill broker for the discount who took it to M. a solicitor, between whom and the broker there was an agreement by which they purchased notes for mutual profit. M. agreed to discount the note. M.\u2019s firm had a judgment against the maker of the note and an arrangement was made with the broker by which the latter was to delay paying over the money so that proceedings could be taken to garnishee it. This was carried out; the broker received the proceeds of the discounted note and while pretending to pay it over was served with the garnishee process and forbidden to pay more than the balance after deduction of the amount of the judgment and costs; and he offered this amount to the maker of the note which was refused. P., the indorser, then brought an action to restrain M. and the broker from dealing with the discounted note and for its delivery to himself.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the broker was aware that the note was indorsed by P. for the purpose of settling the suit on the former note; that the broker and M. were partners in the transaction of discounting the note and the broker\u2019s knowledge was M.\u2019s knowledge; that the property in the note never passed to the broker and M. could only take it subject to the conditions under which the broker held it; that the broker not being the holder of the note there was no debt due from him to the maker and the garnishee order had no effect as against P.; and that the note was held by M. in bad faith and P. was entitled to recover it back. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nDonovan for the appellant.\nBeck for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The plaintiff, Plummer, a responsible gentleman living in Toronto, indorsed a note for the accommodation of one Charles Lowe, a person of no means or credit, of which note the firm of John Fisken & Co. were the holders. Lowe did not pay the note and Fisken & Co. commenced an action against Plummer and Lowe for its recovery. After the suit was commenced and on the first day of April, 1891, Lowe drew a note for $230 payable to the order of Plummer, went to Plummer and obtained his endorsation and agreed with him that from its proceeds when discounted, if he could succeed in discounting it, he would pay the note in suit held by Fisken & Co. Lowe then applied to the defendant Coldwell, who is a bill broker, to discount the note. Coldwell did not discount it but a day or two afterwards, meeting Lowe on the street, he asked him for the note and obtained possession of it for the alleged purpose of seeing what he could do about it; he thereupon went to the appellant Millar, a solicitor in the city of Toronto, between whom and Coldwell there was an agreement under which they purchased notes for their mutual profit. Millar agreed to discount the note. Now it so happened that the legal firm of which Millar was a member and of which one Levisconte was also a member had an un- satisfied judgment in the Division Court, for clients of theirs, C.P. Reid & Co. against Lowe, and upon Millar applying to his partner Levisconte for a check with which to discount the note, the idea struck the mind of Levisconte that in some way or other he might get a portion of this money for the purpose of satisfying their judgment against Lowe, and the scheme resolved upon was to bring Coldwell into their confidence, pay him the proceeds of the note but get him to delay paying over the money in the meantime, then to commence garnishee proceedings in the name of Reid against Coldwell as a debtor of Lowe, and attach in Coldwell\u2019s hands the amount of that claim, and to pay over only the balance to Lowe. The scheme was partially successful; Millar and Levisconte paid to Coldwell $205 (the discount charged was only at the rate of 45 per cent per annum): garnishee proceedings were issued; Coldwell went to Lowe with the money and while he was pretending to pay it over to him Levisconte walked in with his garnishee process, served it on Coldwell and forbade him paying over $111.20 the amount of money attached with costs. Coldwell then offered Lowe the balance which he refused to take. This suit was then brought by Plummer for the purpose of obtaining an order restraining Millar and Coldwell from dealing with the note in question and for its delivery to the plaintiff. Mr. Justice McMahon who tried the case held in effect that Millar was the holder of the note in due course and dismissed the action. The Divisional Court unanimously, and the Court of Appeal with Mr. Justice Burton dissenting, reversed the judgment of the trial judge and ordered a decree for the plaintiff as prayed; and on this appeal we are asked to restore the original judgment. I think the following facts are established by the evidence. (1) Lowe obtained the note from the plaintiff with his endorsation upon it, not for the purpose of accommodation generally, but for the purpose of discounting it and with the proceeds paying the Fisken\u2019s claim; (2) Millar never became the holder of the note; no definite agreement had been come to between him and Lowe in reference to it and no property passed to him; (3) Coldwell was aware of the circumstances under which Lowe obtained Plummer\u2019s endorsation; (4) there was a joint conspiracy to which Caldwell, Millar and Levisconte were all parties, its object being to divert the proceeds of the note from its proper channel and to dishonestly obtain a benefit for Millar and Levisconte\u2019s clients at the expense of Plummer; (5) Plummer was not in any way a party to the garnishee proceedings. This suit was instituted and an interim injunction obtained before any final garnishee order had been made, and the amount of Reid\u2019s claim was paid by Coldwell to Millar and Levisconte as solicitors for Reid before a final garnishee order had been passed directing payment.\nThe contention of the appellant\u2019s counsel is that Millar is a holder of the note in due course; that it was discounted by him, and the proceeds paid to Coldwell in good faith; and that whatever may have been the character of the dealings as between Plummer and Lowe, and Lowe and Coldwell, he is not in any way affected by them, and is entitled to hold the note against both Plummer and Lowe. I do not so view it. Both Coldwell and Millar admit that the note in question was one within the purview of their agreement; that agreement was, substantially, that Millar was to loan to Coldwell one half of the moneys which he might require in the discounting of notes; that Coldwell should give his own notes to Millar for that half, as well as transfer to him the securities themselves; that Millar was to be Coldwell\u2019s attorney irrevocable in connection with the securities; and that the profits in connection with these transactions were to be equally divided between them. It is true that the agreement provided that neither party was to be an agent of the other, except as therein expressly set out, but that, I think, does not in any way affect the relationship of partnership or quasi partnership created between them under the agreement. I am strongly of opinion that, in consequence of the agreement, Coldwell\u2019s knowledge was Millar\u2019s knowledge; Coldwell could not give Millar a better title than he had himself. It is clear that Coldwell was not a holder in due course of the note; the title had never passed to him at the time of the alleged discounting; and although, upon the authorities, he might have conveyed the title to a purchaser for value without notice, so as to have bound Plummer and Lowe, yet his relationship to Millar was such that Millar could not take it from him except subject to the conditions under which he himself held it. If Coldwell was not the holder of the note there was no debt due from him to Lowe, and the garnishee order had no effect as against Plummer. The result necessarily is that the note now in Millar\u2019s hands is held by him in bad faith; it is not his property, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover it back. The appeal is therefore dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Joseph A. Donovan.\nSolicitors for respondent: Beck & Code.\n",

A horse crossing the track stepped on a grooved rail and the caulk of his shoe caught in the groove whereby he was injured. In an action by the owner against the company it appeared that the rail, at the place where the accident occurred, was above the level of the roadway.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that as the rail was above the road level, contrary to the requirements of the charter it was a street obstruction unauthorized by statute and, therefore, a nuisance and the company was liable for the injury to the horse caused thereby.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] refusing the defendants a new trial.\nThe action was brought to recover damages from the defendant company for injuries caused to plaintiff's horse while crossing the street railway and getting his foot caught in the groove of one of the rails. There were two trials, the first resulting in a verdict for defendant which was set aside and a new trial ordered. An appeal to this court from the order for a new trial was quashed[2]. On the second trial a verdict was given for plaintiff which was affirmed by the full court, from whose decision the present appeal was taken. The main contention of the defendant in moving the court below for a new trial was that the jury had failed to answer questions submitted to them as to the state of the roadway at the place of the accident, but the court held that the point of the questions submitted was disposed of by other answers and the mere fact that certain questions were not answered did not entitle defendant to another trial.\nRoss Q.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) recovered a verdict against the city, in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, for $32.25. The plaintiff's horse, in crossing defendant's street railway, stept on a grooved rail; the caulk of his shoe caught in the groove and he was injured. The court in banc refused to disturb the verdict and from that judgment this appeal is taken. We are of opinion the appeal should be dismissed. The accident was occasioned by the defendant company placing on the street the grooved rail in question. They had a right, under the facts proved in evidence and their charter, to place a grooved rail on the street but they were bound to see that the roadway on both sides of the rail should be kept level with it. They had a right to place a grooved rail on the street but only in such a way as not to protrude above the level of the street. The rail in question protruded above that level. It was a street obstruction unauthorized by statute and therefore a nuisance. It was this obstruction that caused the damage and the company was properly found liable.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: F. G.

Held, also, that though it would appear by the procedure in the case that McD. and C. had been irregularly condemned jointly to pay , the amount of the judgement, yet as McD. had pleaded to the merits of the action and had taken up fait et cause for C. with his knowledge, and both courts had held them jointly liable, this court would not interfere in such a matter of practice and procedure.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Iberville which maintained respondent's action confessoire and adjudged that a servitude or right of way exists on the lot of land no. 369 of the cadastral plan of the parish of St. Margaret of Blairfindie, belonging to the appellant \"William Cully, in favour and for the benefit of the lot of land no 370 of the said cadastral plan belonging to the respondent, and condemned both appellants to pay twenty-five dollars damages to the respondent.\nOn the 2nd day of April, 1860, Prosper Ferdais, the respondent's father, sold the lot of land no. 369 to Thomas Haddock by deed passed before Mtre Charbonneau, notary public, reserving in his favour a right of way on the said lot in the following' terms to wit :\nAvec r\u00e9serve de la part flu dit vendeur d'un chemin de voiture sur le terrain ci-dessus vendu en par le vendeur ne causant aucun dommage, pour charroyer du bois, foin ou autres fruits r\u00e9colt\u00e9s, chaque fois que le vendeur le jugera n\u00eacessaire.\nThat deed of sale was not registered until the 10th day of June, 1886, subsequently to the registration of appellant Cully's title deed of said lot no. 369.\nOn the 16th day of April 1874 the said Prosper Ferdais made a donation of the lot of land no. 370 to the respondent without any mention whatever of the said right of way.\nBy deed of sale passed on the 28th day of October 1882, duly registered on the. 28th day of December, 1882 Rose Tobin the widow and universal legatee of the said. Thomas Haddock sold. the said lot of land no 369 to the appellant L. G. Macdonald, with no mention whatever of a right of way.\nAnd on the 1st day of June, 1886, the said L. G. Macdonald sold the said lot of land no. 369 to the appellant William Gully, without any mention of a right of way and. this last mentioned deed of sale was duly registered on the 8th day of June, 1886, two days before the registration of the aforesaid deed of sale, dated the 2nd day of April, 1860, upon which the respondent pretends to establish his right of way.\nOn the 15th day of Tune, 1887, the respondent instituted the present action against the appellant William Gully, claiming the said right of way and $200 damages.\nTo this action the said \"William Cully filed a preliminary plea, a dilatory exception, asking for the suspension of the proceedings until he would have called in the case the said L. G. Macdonald, his vendor and his warrantor; and before adjudication upon the said dilatory exception, the said L. G. Macdonald, on the 23rd day of April, 1888, presented a petition in intervention to be allowed to take the fait et cause of the said William Cully and to contest the said action\nOn the 12th day of December, 1888, the said intervening party L. G. Macdonald filed his pleas to the said action, alleging in said pleas:\n1st. That he acquired the said lot of land no. 369 free from any servitude whatever and that when he acquired the said land and when he sold the same to the defendant William Gully, the pretended deed creating the alleged servitude was not registered, and that such deed was never registered except after the delay fixed by law to register the same had elapsed.\n2nd. That the right of way stipulated in the said deed of sale of the 2nd day of April 1860 does not specify or create any servitude of passage for the said Prosper Ferdais and his assigns, or for the said lot of] land no. 370 but merely for the said vendor Prosper Ferdais personally and individually.\n3rd. That there is nothing in the action or in the deeds set up to show where or at what point or place the alleged right of way existed or now exists.\n4th. That two or three years before the institution of the action the fences and ditches dividing the said lands were rebuilt and made anew by the respondent himself, and that no gate in the fence and no bridge over the ditch was made at any point or place for the use of said pretended right of way.\n5th. A general denial.\nThe respondent joined issue with the said intervening party L G. Macdonald and after all the evidence had been taken on the 2nd day of March, 1889, the plaintiff (respondent) inscribed the case for hearing on the dilatory exception and intervention giving notice thereof to the defendant, the appellant, William Cully.\nOn the 28th day of September 1889 the Superior Court for the district of Iberville, after having heard the plaintiff the respondent) and the intervening party L. G. Macdonald, rendered judgment against both the intervening party L. G. Macdonald and the defendant William Cully, affirming the existence of the said right of way upon defendant's lot of land no. 369 in favour and for the benefit of plaintiff's land no. 370, ordering both the defendant and the intervening party to rebuild the gates in the fences at each end of such road or passage and condemned the defendant and the intervening party jointly and severally to pay to the plaintiff the sum of twenty-five dollars damages, with the costs of the action up to the filing of the intervention; the intervening party being alone condemned to pay the costs of his intervention and contestation of the action\nE.

Par l'acte du 2 avril 1860 le dit Thomas Haddock s'obligea de maintenir tout le chemin qui traversait et a toujours traverse jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour le dit lot n 369 et le divise en deux depuis au-del\u00e0 de quarante ans et est connu sous le nom de chemin de Lacadie, c'est-\u00e0-dire le chemin qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 Lacadie.\nAvant l'acte de vente \u00e0 Thomas Haddock 2 avril 1850, le dit lot n 370 \u00e9tait enferm\u00e9 par la petite rivi\u00e8re de Montr\u00e9al, les repr\u00e9sentants de William Brownrigg, et par le lot n 369,\u2014qu'il l'a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'il est encore ainsi enferm\u00e9 et que la seule sortie du dit Prosper Ferdais avant et au temps de la dite vente, pour communiquer du dit lot au chemin ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 \u00e9tait par le chemin de voiture r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par le dit acte de vente et que le dit chemin de voiture existait au temps de la vente et a toujours exist\u00e9 pour cette fin.\nLe dit Prosper Ferdais et l'intim\u00e9 ont toujours fait usage du dit chemin de voiture jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur.\nLe dit lot n\u00b0 370 a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 avec tous ses accessoires et d\u00e9pendaness dont il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 et est encore le propri\u00e9taire.\nLe chemin de voiture ainsi r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par l'acte de vente du 2 avril 1860 cr\u00e9e une servitude r\u00e9elle apparente sur le lot de terre no 369 en faveur du lot n\u00b0 370, quels que soient les propri\u00e9taires des dits lots, et que le lot n 370 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 avec tous ses accessoires et d\u00e9pendances le chemin de voiture se trouve compris dans la dite donation.\nThomas Haddock a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 le dit lot n\u00b0 369 \u00e0 Marie Rose Tobin, son \u00e9pouse, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9e en secondes noces \u00e0 Frank Cully.\nLes dits Rose Tobin et son mari ont ensuite vendu le dit lot n 369 le 28 octobre 1882 \u00e0 l'appelant L. G. Macdonald qui l'a ensuite revendu, le let juin 1886, \u00e0 l\u2019appelant Gully qui en a toujours depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire en possession.\nPendant le printemps de 1887 et \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques depuis, l'appelant Cully a, par lui-m\u00eame et ses employ\u00e9s, troubl\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 dans la jouissance du dit chemin r\u00e9serve, l'a labour\u00e9 et ensemenc\u00e9, et l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de s'en servir \u00e0 son grand dommage.\nL'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 par ses conclusions \u00e0 ce qu'il soit fait d\u00e9fense \u00e0 Cully de le troubler \u00e0 l'avenir\u2014 et que le dit lot 369 soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sujet \u00e0 la servitude du chemin en question en faveur de l'immeuble n 370 et condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 des dommages.\nCully a produit une exception dilatoire pour obtenir d\u00e9lai pour appeler son garant, Macdonald, et a m\u00eame intent\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet une action en garantie contre lui. Macdonald au lieu de d\u00e9fendre \u00e0 cette action s'est reconnu garant et est intervenu dans la cause pour prendre le fait et cause de Cully et a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 l'action principale:\nQue par son acquisition du 28 octobre 1882 il a achet\u00e9e le lot 369 sans aucune servitude et qu'il n'en existait pas alors\nQue l'acte cr\u00e9ant cette servitude n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 et que la servitude ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e contre les appellants ; que l'acte ne sp\u00e9cifie pas l'endroit o\u00f9 doit s'exercer la dite servitude ; \u2014que l'acte du 2 avril 1860 ne cr\u00e9ait pas un droit de servitude r\u00e9el envers le vendeur et ses successeurs mais lui accordait seulement un droit personnel.\nQue quelques ann\u00e9es auparavant la cl\u00f4ture et le foss\u00e9 s\u00e9parant les dites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 refaites par l'intim\u00e9 et Frank Cully de qui Macdonald avait achet\u00e9, les dits Cully et l'intim\u00e9 refirent la cl\u00f4ture et le foss\u00e9 sans mettre de barri\u00e8re ni de pont sur le foss\u00e9 pour indiquer le dit chemin. L'intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue en r\u00e9ponee \u00e0 ces moyens d'intervention que le d\u00e9faut de description de l'endroit pr\u00e9cis de la servitude ne pouvait le priver de son droit, qui existait avant l'acquisition de Macdonald et dont ii avait 'joui depuis ouvertement.\nQue son titre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 duement enregistr\u00e9, que de plus l'enregistrement n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire; qu'en outre, Macdonald, ayant acquis ce lot de terre sujet au droit de chemin de la m\u00eame personne que l'intim\u00e9 avait aussi acquis le sien, ne pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir du d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement du titre en question.\nLa preuve a.\u00e9tabli de la mani\u00e8re la plus complete et la plus satisfainante l'existence de la servitude en question. L'intim\u00e9 a prouv\u00e9 par un grand nombre de t\u00e9moins que le chemin existait depuis bien longtemps, que son p\u00e8re et lui s'en \u00e9taient toujours servi, ouvertement et sans aucune objection de la part de Gully ni de ses auteurs despuis 1860 jusqu'\u00e0 1887, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle Cully a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 le troubler dans sa jouissance. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins out d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le chemin existait depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial. L'intim\u00e9 en a toujours joui et ce \u00e0 la connaissance de Cully et de ses auteurs, d'une mani\u00e8re publique et notoire. Tous ces t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9tabli positivement que le chemin \u00e9tait visible et apparent et les deux cours Sup\u00e9rieure et d'Appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que la dite servitude \u00e9tait apparente. En face de la preuve du dossier, il est impossible de mettre en doute l'opinion de ces .deux cours sur le fait de l'apparence de la servitude en question\nLa premi\u00e8re objection de l'appelant que l'acte cr\u00e9ant la servitude n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9, est fond\u00e9e sur le Statut do Qu\u00e9bec 44-45 Vic. (1881), ch. 16, sec. 5, qui d\u00e9clare: qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l'enregistrement do l'acte cr\u00e9ant aucune servitude r\u00e9elle, discontinue et non apparente constitu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avenir n'aura d'effet vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers acqu\u00e9reuss dont les droits auront \u00e9t\u00e9 ou seront euregistr\u00e9s.\nLa sect. 6 accorde un d\u00e9lai de deux ans pour l'enregistrement des servitudes \u00e9tablies avant la passation de cette loi. Ce d\u00e9lai a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite prolong\u00e9 jusqu'au 8 janvier 1885, sujet aux droits acquis.\nLa vente du 2 avril 1860 par Ferdais \u00e0 Haddock, cr\u00e9ant la servitude, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e que le 10 juin 1886.\nL'acte 41-45 Vict., n'est pas applicable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause parce qu'il s'agit ici d'une servitude apparente qui se trouve par la clause ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, et sp\u00e9cialement exempt\u00e9e de l'enregistrement de m\u00eame que par l'art. 1508 du code civil.\nUn droit de chemin peut \u00eatre une servitude apparente d'apr\u00e8s la doctrine des auteurs.\nFerrot, Lois du Voisinage ([7]).\nDe m\u00eame le droit de passage, qui est une servitude discontinue, peut \u00eatre apparent, s'il est manifest\u00e9 par un chemin, par une porte donnant sur l'h\u00e9ritage voisin; et non apparent si aucun signe ne l'indique.\nDemolombe ([8]).\n\u2026\u2026C'est ainsi, par exemple, qu'un droit de passage peut \u00eatre apparent ou non apparent, suivant qu'il se manifeste par une porte, un- chemin trac\u00e9, ou par une voie quelconque\nNo. 718. Il importe peu d'ailleurs, quant au point de savoir si la servitude est apparente ou non apparente, que l'ouvrage qui en manifeste l'existence soit \u00e9tabli sur le fonds servant ou sur le fonds-dominant.\nNo. 719. Une servitude de passage, qui se manifeste par une porte-ou un chemin fray\u00e9 est sans doute apparente.\nAinsi, une servitude de droit de chemin manifest\u00e9e comme dans le cas actuel par un chemin est suffisamment indiqu\u00e9e par un chemin ouvert. Il n'est pas m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire que ce chemin soit visible sur les deux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ii suffit qu'il soit apparent sur l'une d'elles Ce n'est donc qu'une question de preuve en cette cause. Le fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9vidente. La servitude \u00e9tant apparente, l'enregistrement n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. Ti est certain qu'avant l'acte 44-45 les servitudes r\u00e9elles n'\u00e9taient pas soumises \u00e0 la formalit\u00e9 de l'enregistrement ni sous l'ancien droit ni depuis le code. Il en \u00e9tait de m\u00eame en France avant 1855.\nDemolombe, ([9]).\nTous les auteurs avaient enseign\u00e9, jusque dans ces derniers temps, que le titre constitutif de la servitude n'est pas soumis \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la transcription\nLa seconde objection des appelants est que le droit de chemin en question est un droit personnel et non pas une servitude r\u00e9elle affectant l'immeuble de l'appelant Cully.\nOn a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit plus haut que l'immeuble en question est enferm\u00e9 par les terres avoisinantes et par une petite rivi\u00e8re sur laquelle ii faudrait construire un pout pour donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 sur une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Sans ce chemin, ii n'aurait pas droit de communication avec ses autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Le chemin en question lui est indispensable et c.est sans doute \u00e0 cause de cette position qu'il se l'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9, cr\u00e9ant par l\u00e0 une servitude par la destination du p\u00e8re de famille.\nLe titre \u00e9tablissant la servitude dit express\u00e9ment que le chemin est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour charroyer du bois et autres produits r\u00e9colt\u00e9s sur l\u00ba lot en question. Les besoins de Ta culture \u00e9tant les m\u00eames tous les ans ii est clair que le but \u00e9tait d'en faire une servitude permanente en faveur de l'immeuble et non pas une servitude personnelle pour le vendeur.\nDemolombe, ([10]).\nEt voil\u00e0 pourquoi on n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 regarder comme servitude r\u00e9elle la concession faite au propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds de passer sur le fonds voisin, etc. Dans tous ces cas, et autres semblables, on voit bien que la concession du droit a eu directement et essentiellement pour but l'utilit\u00e9 du fonds lui-m\u00eame, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme fonds, et non point l'avantage individuel de la personne, pr\u0153dii magis quam person\u0153 (L. 4, h. t.)\nLa me objection est que le titre ne d\u00e9signe pas l'en-droit o\u00f9 doit s'exercer la servitude.\nD'abord, rien ne prescrit l'obligation de designer la partie de 1 immeuble o\u00f9 sera exerc\u00e9e la servitude et dans la pratique la chose ne se fait pas pour la raison que ce serait inutilement rendre la servitude plus on\u00e9reuse pour l'immeuble assuj\u00e9ti. Bien qu'une description particuli\u00e8re de la servitude soit importante, elle n'est cependant pas essentielle; il suffit que le titre en continne l'indication. Demolombe a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet l'opinion des auteurs comme il suit Il suffit donc aujourd'hui l\u00e9galement que l'acte contienne l'indication d'une servitude susceptible d'\u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l'application de l'article 1129.\nA plus forte raison il en doit \u00eatre ainsi non seulement lorsque la servitude est indiqu\u00e9e, mais lorsqu'elle est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et visible, comme dans le cas actuel par les traces du chemin sur le sol de l'appelant.\nL'objection que l'intim\u00e9 a laiss\u00e9 le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de l'appelant Cully fermer le passage, est tout \u00e0 fait sans fondement, le fait n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement prouv\u00e9. Les appelants out aussi failli dans leur tentative de prouver que le chemin n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et le fait reste acquis que le chemin r\u00e9serv\u00e9 est le seul moyen de communication avec le terrain enclave,\nLe propri\u00e9taire qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude est le seul juge de sa n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Demolombe ([11]).\nLes propri\u00e9taires eux-m\u00eames, d'ailleurs, sont, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, souverainement juges des motifs d'utilit\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'avantage, de commodit\u00e9, de convenance on d'agr\u00e9ment, qui leur font \u00e9tablir des servitudes. (art. 686). Sans doute, une pr\u00e9tendue servitude \u00e0 laquelle le fonds dominant n'aurait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat, serait nulle. (L 15 princ. if. de servit.) Mais il faudrait que le d\u00e9faut d'int\u00e9r\u00eat fut bien manifeste car l'utilit\u00e9 dont parle notre article (537 doit s'entendre d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s large; et il suffit que cette utilit\u00e9 soit apparente, \u00e9loign\u00e9e et m\u00eame seulement possible. C'est en ce sens que le jurisconsulte Lab\u00e9on disait que nous pouvons stipuler m\u00eame une servitude inutile, et si inutilis sit; qu\u00e6dam enim habere possumus, quam vis ea nobis utilia non sunt. (L. 19, tit. supra cit.) Je pourrais, par exemple, quoique mon fonds eut un acc\u00e8s facile, ou m\u00eame d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus d'un acc\u00e8s sur la vole publique, acqu\u00e9rir encore, sur un autre fonds, un nouveau droit de passage;\nIl est regrettable de voir qu'il se trouve dans la proc\u00e9dure une omission constituant une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 assez grave. C'est que le d\u00e9fendeur\u2014quoique ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure de plaider, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement forclos de le faire\u2014et, que n'ayant pas demand\u00e9, comme il en avait le droit apr\u00e8s l'intervention de Macdonald d'\u00eatre mis hors de cause ii se trouve \u00eatre rest\u00e9 partie an proc\u00e8s et aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme tel. Mais an lien de cela les demandeurs et d\u00e9fendeurs l'ont trait\u00e9 comme hors de cause et ne lui ont plus donn\u00e9 avis des proc\u00e9dures. On a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une longue enqu\u00eate dont ii a sans doute d\u00fb avoir connaissance et l'on a plaid\u00e9 an m\u00e9rite sans qu'il ait donn\u00e9 signe d'existence. Evidemment voyant la d\u00e9fense faite par Macdonald, il a pens\u00e9 qu'il n'en avait pas d'autre \u00e0 faire et s'est abstenu de prendre part au proc\u00e8s; attendant ainsi sans risque un r\u00e9sultat favorable sauf \u00e0 le r\u00e9pudier plus tard si cela lui convenait mieux. Mais il vient maintenant \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure, se plaindre, en appel, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 forclos de plaider et n'a pas eu d'avis d'inscription an m\u00e9rite et qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 sans \u00eatre entendu Toutefois il a en tout le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Ta d\u00e9fense faite par Macdonald\u2014et il n'en avait certainement pas d'autre \u00e0 faire. Peut-on maintenant lui permettre de prendre avantage de cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9, et pour ce motif annuler le jugement ? Je ne le pense pas, \u00e0 cause de l'opinion que nous entretenons sur le m\u00e9rite de la question soumise. En principe, notre cour n'intervient pas dans les questions de proc\u00e9dure et ii n'est pas permis de faire pour la premi\u00e8re lois des objections de ce genre en cour d'appel. Dans les circonstances on doit conclure que l'appelant Cully s est lui-m\u00eame mis hors de cause et n'a pas droit de prendre objection de l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dont - ii se plaint.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'avis que l'intervention de Macdonald soit, quant \u00e0 lui, renvoy\u00e9e, vu qu'il n'est pas garant de la servitude en question et que jugement soit prononc\u00e9 contre Cully d\u00e9clarant son immeuble sujet \u00e0 la servitude conform\u00e9ment aux conclusions de l'action de l'intim\u00e9, le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The first question to be disposed of is whether the reservation of a road in the deed of sale of April, 1860, by Prosper Ferdais to Haddock constitutes a real servitude towards the lot now called lot no. 370, or merely a reserve personal to Prosper Ferdais and to cease with his ownership of the said lot no. 370. On this point I am free to say there is room for doubt, but to doubt is to confirm. Upon the intention itself of the parties to this deed there cannot be much doubt, but whether they have clearly expressed that intention in the document is open to controversy. However, the appellant has failed to make it clear to my mind that there is error on this point in the judgment of the two courts below.\nThe only other point on Macdonald's appeal is upon a question of fact. Was this an apparent or a non-apparent servitude? On this the appeal also fails. The courts below have found that the servitude was apparent and the evidence, in that sense, is, in my opinion, overwhelming. Out of the fourteen witnesses examined one only, a man named Leggatt, appellant Gully's brother-in-law, never could see a road there. All the others prove that a road existed there as vis\u00edtale and open as a road of that nature could be expected to have been. I would therefore on this point again come to the same conclusion as the court below. There is no difficulty as to the legal consequences of that finding of fact. If the servitude is an apparent one registration was not required, and the plaintiff\u2019s right of action is uncontrovertible. But there arises some difficulty in the case on the appeal by the defendant Cully from the nature and form of the proceedings. The servitude being declared to have been an apparent one it follows that Macdonald was not warrantor, and consequently that his intervention on that ground should have been dismissed purely and simply but it seems that the condemnation given against him jointly with the defendant, Gully, is wrong, so that as to him, Macdonald, the form of the judgment should be that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and his intervention and pleas as to the action dismissed with costs.\nAs to Gully, the proceedings have not been strictly regular. All that is wanted, however, on the face of the record is an express order declaring him hors de cause. But he clearly treated himself as being hors de cause and left his defence in the hands of Macdonald. After having filed a dilatory exception he was asked by respondent for a plea to the merits but never filed one, and why ? Because, I assume, Macdonald himself pleaded to the merits of the action, and so as to avoid double issues and double costs. He took his chances of getting the action dismissed on the intervention, but now that it is the intervention that is dismissed he says he has not been heard. By not pleading to the merits, when duly summoned to do so, he, de facto, consented to the issue being tried and determined between Macdonald and the respondent. He treated himself as hors de cause: we do the same. And the fact that Macdonald is now declared not to have been a warrantor cannot avail to Gully against this view for having himself summoned Macdonald en garantie he cannot now argue that Macdonald did not represent him. The case is not free from difficulty I am free to say. The proceedings are not regular. But the point is one of practice and procedure and I think that, under the circumstances, as the Court of Appeal in Montreal did not feel justified to interfere we should not do so. The appeal in my opinion should be dismissed. Macdonald having taken up the fait et cause of Gully cannot complain if he has been condemned as garant. He is estopped from availing himself on this appeal of the ground that he is not a warrantor.\nGWYNNE and SEDGEWICK JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Paradis & Chass\u00e9.\nSolicitors for respondent : Geoffrion.

S. N. S. 5th sec. c. 45\u201450 V. c. 23 (N.S.)\nThat the ownership of lands adjoining a highway extends ad medium filum vi\u00e6 is a presumption of law only which may be rebutted, but the presumption will arise though the lands are described in a conveyance as bounded by or on the highway. Gwynne J. contra.\nIn construing an act of parliament the title may be referred to in order to ascertain the intention of the legislature.\nThe act of the Nova Scotia legislature, 50 Vic. c. 23, vesting the title to highways and the lands over which the same pass in the crown for a public highway, does not apply to the city of Halifax.\nThe charter of the Nova Scotia Telephone Company authorized the construction and working of lines of telephone along the sides of, and across and under, any public highway or street of the city of Halifax provided that in working such lines the company should not cut down or mutilate any trees.\nHeld, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that the owner of private property in the city could maintain an action for damages against the company for injuring ornamental shade trees on the street in front of his property while constructing or working the telephone line, there being nothing in the evidence to rebut the presumption of ownership ad medium or to show that the street had been laid out under a statute of the province or dedicated to the public before the passing of any expropriation act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment for defendants at the trial. The following statement of facts is taken from the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nThe plaintiffs are the owners of a dwelling house and lot of land in the city of Halifax, fronting on Spring Garden Road, a street in that city. In front of the house on the sidewalk are several ornamental trees. The defendant company in erecting a line of telephone along the street cut down portions of these ornamental trees in such a way as to lessen their beauty and diminish the shade which they afforded for the plaintiff's dwelling.\nAn action for this alleged trespass was brought against the company in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The case was tried before Mr, Justice Meagher, who found that the plaintiffs were the owners of the dwelling; that their predecessor in title, Patrick Walsh, had vested in him the fee to the centre of the highway; that in 1862, when Mr. Walsh was owner and in possession, he had planted these trees, and from that time until his death in 1880, had cared for them frequently hiring parties to prune and otherwise attend to them; that the plaintiffs since his death had performed that duty, and that the trees in question were beneficial to the plaintiffs and their property as shade and ornamental trees. He further found that the cutting by the defendants was a mutilation of the trees, injuring their appearance materially and rendering them unsightly particularly from the plaintiff's windows, and further that the cutting in question was not an absolute necessity for the performance of the defendants' business. He assessed the damages of the plaintiffs, in the event of their being entitled to recover, at $100.00, but he directed a verdict for the defendants in consequence of his being of opinion that the effect of chapter 23 of the acts of 1887 was to vest the fee of the street in the crown, and that, therefore, the property of the trees injured, being in the crown, the plaintiffs could not recover for injury done them even by a trespasser. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banc, on which appeal the court was equally divided, McDonald C. J. and Weatherbe J. being of opinion that the verdict for the defendants should stand\u2014Ritchie and Graham JJ. contra. The plaintiffs thereupon asserted an appeal to this court.\nNewcombe for the appellant cited Wansdworth Board of Works v. Telephone Co.[2], Bliss v. Ball[3], Beauchamp v. City of Montreal[4].\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and FOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action is based wholly upon the contention that the fee in the highway upon which the land of the plaintiffs abuts is their soil and freehold ad medium filum vi\u00e6, and that in right of such freehold the trees growing upon that half of the highway which adjoins the land of the plaintiffs, the tops of which the defendants, for the purposes of the business for carrying on which they have been incorporated, have lopped off, were their property, whereby, as is contended, the defendants have subjected themselves to this action of trespass. It is admitted that the law in England is that a prim\u00e2 facie presumption in law arises that waste lands of a manor on the sides of a public highway, and the soil to the middle of the highway, belong to the owner of the adjoining freehold. In Doe d. Pring v. Pearsey[5] it is said that the origin of this presumption is unknown, but that in all probability it has arisen from, and is founded upon, the supposition that the proprietors of the adjoining lands at some former period gave up to the public for passage all the land between their enclosures and the middle of the road, or that it has arisen from its being a matter of convenience to the owners of the adjoining lands and to prevent disputes as to the precise boundaries of the property. In Holmes v. Bellingham[6] it is said that the presumption is based upon the supposition, more or less founded on fact, but which at all events has been adopted, that when the road was originally founded the proprietors on either side each contributed a portion of his land for the purpose. In Berridge v. Ward[7] Erle C.J. states the rule thus:\u2014\"Where there is a conveyance of a piece of land which abuts on a highway, and there is nothing to exclude the highway, the presumption of law is that the soil of the highway usque ad medium filum, passes by the conveyance;\" and Williams J. there states the rule thus:\u2014\"That the conveyance of a piece of land, to which belongs a moiety of an adjoining highway, passes the moiety of the highway by a general description of the piece of land.\" The presumption, then, is that by a grant or conveyance of a piece of land in England, abutting on a highway, there is to be implied a grant or conveyance of the soil of the highway ad medium filum, and as the presumption is only a prim\u00e2 facie one it can be rebutted, and so it is held to be always a question of intention to be collected from the terms of the conveyance and the surrounding circumstances. Marquis of Salisbury v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[8]. The rule that the soil and freehold of a highway, ad medium filum,, is presumed to be the property of the owner of the soil and freehold in the adjoining land cannot be said to be founded upon the same reason as is the rule in relation to the soil and freehold in the bed of a stream adjoining a piece of land granted and conveyed, for it cannot be said that there is any ground for a supposition that the land covered with the waters of a stream, ad medium filum aqu\u00e6, was given up at some remote period by the proprietors of the land on either side, ad medium filum, to the public for passage. I must confess that I cannot see any necessity whatever for the introduction of a rule or presumption of law, based upon the supposition upon which the rule in England is based, into the jurisprudence of any part of the Dominion of Canada, where the origin of every highway can be easily traced, and where there is no pretence for the existence of such a supposition, and where, therefore, the presumption could not be rested on the sole foundation upon which it is said to rest in England; as, however, the presumption, if it is to be considered as forming part of the law of Nova Scotia, can be rebutted by the terms of the grant or deed of conveyance construed in the light of all surrounding circumstances, the first question which arises is: Is there anything in any of the deeds of conveyance under which the plaintiffs claim title which rebuts the presumption? And secondly; If not is or is not the presumption rebutted by any of the acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia? The case of the Marquis of Salisbury v. Great Northern Ry. Co[9] was that the Marquis, being the owner of the freehold on both sides of a turnpike road, sold two pieces of land which abutted on the turnpike road to the railway company. In the plans and books of reference required by the standing orders in parliament the pieces of land conveyed to the company were numbered respectively 75 and 79, and the deed described their exact contents; the deed only conveyed 75 and 79, which, however, adjoined the road which on the plan was numbered 47. The road was, in fact, the property of the Marquis, but at the time of the conveyance was supposed to be the property of the trustees of the turnpike, in whom the control over the turnpike was vested. The deed of conveyance referred to and incorporated the schedule and plan, and specified the lots conveyed as numbered 75 and 79, and coloured red. Under these circumstances it was held that the intention of the parties clearly was that only the parcels numbered 75 and 79 should pass and that the soil of the road did not pass out of the Marquis, the vendor, and that therefore he was entitled to recover in ejectment a portion of the turnpike which had been enclosed and taken possession of by the defendants, they having, under powers in their act, substituted another road for the piece of the turnpike which the defendants had taken possession of.\nIn Ernst v Waterman[10], where the owner of the land laid it out into town lots with streets and had sold the lots on either side of the streets, it was held by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the sale of the lots on either side of the streets did not pass out of the vendor the soil of the streets ad medium filum. The above presumption of law was urged in support of the contention that the soil of the streets had passed but Thompson J. pronouncing the judgment of the court said: \"The presumption is by no means conclusive, and it may be rebutted\" which it was held to be sufficiently by the lots being numbered on either side of the streets on a plan, and by specified dimensions of each lot which sufficiently showed an intention to exclude the streets. It was held that under the circumstances the vendor retained in himself the fee in the soil of the streets while he dedicated them as streets to the use of the public.\nThe same point had been decided by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in 1876 in Pugh v. Peters[11], where it was held that lots being sold by specific numbers on a plan with the dimensions specified in the deed sufficiently rebutted the presumption that the soil of the adjoining street had passed and that the deed only passed to the grantees, in relation to the street, the easement and right of user of it as a street.\nThese judgments appear to me to be sound in principle and to have been well supported by the statute law of Nova Scotia, for by the statute law of that province all deeds and also all copies of any plans and schedules annexed thereto are required to be registered, so that every person interested can readily ascertain the precise limits of the land expressed by the deeds to be conveyed. Then by chapters 44-45 of the Revised Statutes it is enacted that any road which had theretofore been or should thereafter be made or altered without any demand for compensation by the proprietors of the land through which such road runs, within one year from the opening thereof, such acquiescence of the proprietors shall be held to be a voluntary surrender to Her Majesty for ever for a public highway of all the land through which the road passes. Even in such a case the absolute title to the soil and freehold in the road is to be held to have been surrendered to and vested in Her Majesty for ever for a public highway, while by chapters 46 and 47 the control over all highways and the providing for their maintenance and repair is placed in the respective municipalities within which the roads are; and by chapter 49 it is enacted that where a line of road has been altered and the old road has been abandoned any of the proprietors of the land adjoining the old road may by petition apply to the council of the municipality to shut or otherwise dispose of the same. These provisions are but re-enactments of similar provisions in chapters 61, 62, 69 and 113 respectively of the Revised Statutes of 1851.\nNow in the present case the plaintiffs claim title to the soil and freehold of the highway adjoining a lot of land devised to the female plaintiff by her father one Patrick Walsh, and they claim the trees in question as their property in virtue of such devise. We are not furnished with an extract of this devise from the will of Patrick Walsh, but we assume that the will passed all his estate in the lot. Walsh's title was derived from one Patrick Lynch who as trustee of one Wiswell held the lot upon trust for sale for the benefit of Wiswell's creditors. We have not either the precise description of the lot as contained in these deeds but assume that it conformed to the description in the deed by which the lot was conveyed to Wiswell which we have and which was executed in May 1847 by one William G. Anderson. We have also the description contained in a deed dated in April 1812 from one William Lawson who conveyed the land therein mentioned to one Brenton Haliburton who by a deed dated in April 1847 conveyed the same land presumably by the same description to the said William G. Anderson. We have also the description contained in a deed executed in 1809 of land conveyed by John Woodin to William Lawson and one Grassie and of the piece thereof allotted by deed of partition to the said William Lawson who conveyed it to the said Brenton Haliburton who conveyed it to the said William G. Anderson. The description in the deed of 3809 from Woodin to Lawson and Grassie is as follows:\u2014\nAll that lot of land and field situate and being in the township of Halifax beginning at the north-west corner of a lot of land near the Windmill hills formerly the property of Richard Bulkley, Esq., deceased; thence running westerly 363 feet until it meets the common; thence southerly on the common 880 feet; thence easterly on the lot formerly belonging to Joseph Fairbanks, Esq., 363 feet; thence on the aforesaid lot of Richard Bulkley, deceased, until it meets the bound first mentioned, containing by estimation 7 1\/4 acres more or less.\nIn this description no mention is made of the highway but the line or \"bound\" first mentioned namely \"from the northwest angle of the lot of land near the windmill hill formerly the property of Richard Bulkley, westerly 363 feet until it meets the common,\" is the southerly limit of the highway in question; and the area contained within the limits described south of such south limit of the highway is just 7 1\/3 acres that is to say a little in excess of the 7 1\/4 acres expressed to be intended to be conveyed. The description in the deed of partition between Lawson and Grassie of the piece of the above land which was allotted to Lawson and conveyed by him to Haliburton is as follows:\u2014\nAll that northerly half of the said lot and field which is situate and being next to the road or street leading from Halifax to the common and is described as follows: Beginning at the north-west corner of the lot of land formerly owned by the said Richard Bulkley, thence running westerly 363 feet until it meets the common; thence on the common 440 feet, thence easterly to the said field of Richard Bulkley, thence northerly on the said field to the place of beginning.\nThe description in the deed from Haliburton to Anderson is that:\nLot of land lying southward of the road leading from the jail to the common now called Spring Garden Road, being the northern half of a lot purchased by William Lawson and George Grassie from John Woodin.\nImmediately after his purchase Anderson appears to have subdivided the piece of land into town lots numbered on a plan which was filed by him in the Surveyor General's office, and the lot now under consideration was conveyed by him to Wiswell as lot no. 4, under the description following, that is to say, as:\nSituate, lying and being on the south side of Spring Garden, in the city of Halifax, being a portion of the field conveyed to the said William G. Anderson by Brenton Haliburton by deed bearing date the 15th day of April, in the present year, which said lot is marked on the plan of division of the said field filed by the said W. G. Anderson in the Surveyor General's office as lot no. 4, and is described and bounded as follows: Beginning at the north-west corner of lot no. 3, thence running westerly on Spring Garden Road 52 feet to the north-east corner of lot no. 5, thence southerly on the division line between lots numbers 4 and 5, 104 feet to the north-west corner of lot 18, thence easterly along the division line between lots nos. 4 and 18, 52 feet to the south-west corner of lot no. 3, thence northerly on the division line between lots nos. 3 and 4, 104 feet to the place of beginning on Spring Garden Road.\nNow Woodin who conveyed to Lawson and Grassie acquired the piece so conveyed to them from one Jonathan Belcher, who as appears by the abstract of the title on registry in the case was the grantee of the crown in 1764, of the said piece of land under the following description, viz.:\nA lot of pasture land in the township of Halifax, bounded on the north by the high road on the west by the common, on the south by the lands of James Monk, on the east by lands of Richard Bulkley, measuring 7 acres.\nNow, Anderson, assuming him for the sake of argument to have been seized of the fee in the soil of the highway ad medium filum, having subdivided the piece of land described in the deed of conveyance thereof to him into town lots, designated by numbers on a plan which was filed in the office of the Surveyor General, and having sold and conveyed the lot under consideration as the lot designed no. 4 on that plan describing it by its number on the plan and by metes and bounds which, as a matter of fact, do not include any part of the highway, and the deed of conveyance of such lot together with a copy of the plan whereon the lots were designated by numbers having been registered as required by law, the natural and reasonable inference is that neither did Anderson intend to convey nor Wiswell to purchase any estate, if Anderson had any, in the soil and freehold of the highway and so that the prim\u00e2 facie presumption insisted upon is rebutted; and this inference is justified and supported by the authority of the Marquis of Salisbury v. The Great Northern Railway[12], and of Pugh v. Peters[13], and Ernst v. Waterman[14], in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, both of which latter cases were, in my opinion, well decided and should be followed especially upon a question which is one purely of the law of Nova Scotia; so that in this view no estate in the soil of the highway was ever vested in any of the intermediate parties through whom the plaintiffs claim from Anderson, and therefore not in the plaintiffs. But apart from this it is plainly apparent from the abstract of title in the case that so far back as 1764 the highway in question, while the estate therein was in the crown, had been laid out and appropriated as a public highway, and that the soil and freehold therein never passed out of the crown to Belcher the grantee of the piece of land \"bounded on the north by the highway\" unless it can be held that by the presumption of law insisted upon the estate of the crown ad medium filum is to be deemed to have passed by implication from the crown to Belcher; but in my opinion the crown cannot be prejudiced or in any manner affected by an invocation of the presumption insisted upon or be divested by implication of its estate in a piece of land which is in point of fact outside of the limits of the description of the piece granted, because of the crown itself having been pleased to appropriate for a public highway the piece of land outside of the limits of the piece described in the grant. But however this may be the question in the present case is in my opinion put beyond all doubt by chapter 23 of the statute of the legislature of Nova Scotia passed in 1887 which statute is in its terms purely a declaratory act and which declares that\u2014\nThe legal title to all highways and the lands over which the same pass is hereby declared to have been heretofore vested in Her Majesty the Queen for ever for a public highway.\nNothing can, to my mind, be clearer than that this was intended to be, and is, a plain legislative declaration that the legal estate in all highways then already laid out, including the one in question which has been laid out in the township of Halifax as early as 1764, had always continued to be vested in Her Majesty from the time of their being originally laid out respectively but subject to the easement of the public therein as a public highway. When the act declares that \"all highways have been heretofore (that is to say up to the time of the passing of the act) vested in Her Majesty for ever for a public highway,\" such vesting must at least relate back in all cases to the period when each highway was first laid out and appropriated to public use, and in case of the highway in question, by reason of its having been laid out when the seisin was in the crown, to the original seisin of Her Majesty in right of her crown, which seisin as to this highway the act in effect declares had never passed out of Her Majesty. The law as it had already stood was that when the property of private persons was appropriated for the purpose of making a new road in substitution for an old one, however the old one may have been founded, the acquiescence of the private proprietors in the appropriation of their land for the new road for one year without demand of compensation for the land taken should be held to be a voluntary surrender to Her Majesty for ever for a public highway\u2014that is to say should operate as a surrender to Her Majesty of her original seisin to date in that case from the time when the acquiescence ripened into a title in the crown by surrender. But chapter 23 of 1887 goes farther and declares that the legal title to all highways\u2014including all then in existence\u2014\"and the lands over which they pass have been heretofore (that is say up to the time of the passing of the act from the time they were first made to be highways respectively) vested in Her Majesty the Queen for ever for public highways,\" that is to say subject to the easement of the public therein as public highways. Thus the cases of the Board of Works of Wandsworth v. the Telephone Co.[15], and Coverdale v. Charlton[16], though relied upon in argument have really no application whatever in the present case. There the words \"vest in\" as used therein were construed to be limited to transferring simply all control over the roads as highways which was plainly all that by the context and surrounding circumstances was intended to pass and not the soil and freehold in the highways which were left in the precise condition in which they then were, but the words \"vested in Her Majesty, &c\" as used in the present act, have by the express terms of the act and its manifest object and context a very different and more extensive meaning as already shown. The plaintiffs have wholly failed to establish their title to the trees as asserted in their statement of claim and if they had established such title I should entirely concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Weatherbe that still they could not recover against the defendants for the cutting of the trees, because the act of cutting was clearly justified by the act of Parliament although the manner might amount to mutilation of which the owners of the trees might complain.\u2014But not only was no such case made by the plaintiffs but no evidence was given or offered which would justify a judgment as for mutilation. It was also suggested but scarcely argued that the plaintiffs even though not owners of the trees cut could recover as persons suffering direct and special injury from a public nuisance in excess of that sustained from the nuisance by the public.\u2014But whether any act be a public nuisance or not is a matter of fact and no such case has been made nor has any act of the defendants been found or proved to be a public nuisance.\u2014The act of cutting has not been and could not be so found upon the evidence.\u2014The act was lawful although the manner might have been injurious to the owner and only to the owner of the trees, and even if a case for public nuisance had been made and proved by reason of the defendants' act in cutting the trees, the injury in such case complained of by the plaintiffs in the damage done thereby to their land by depriving it of the ornament and shade of the trees would not be such a direct and peculiar injury sustained by the plaintiffs in excess of the damage occasioned by the nuisance to the public as would support an action at suit of the plaintiffs, However no such claim has been made by the plaintiffs.\nThe appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The first question to be considered is as to whether or not the plaintiffs' property extended to the medium filum of the street independently of the statute upon which Mr. Justice Meagher bases his opinion. The doctrine is elementary that the law presumes the ownership of half the soil over which a highway exists to be in the owners of the land on either side of that highway, and that although lands described in a conveyance may be bounded by or on that way, the ownership ad medium filum vice will pass. It is likewise as elementary that the application of this doctrine depends upon the facts in each case. It is a presumption only, and where, as in Ontario and the North-west, road or street allowances have been made in the original survey of the country the presumption is destroyed, and owners of land abutting upon such roads or streets do not take to the middle thread. It must also, I think, be taken to be settled law in the province of Nova Scotia, upon the authority of Koch v. Dauphinee[17], that lands expropriated for highways under provincial statutes become vested in the crown as its property, the right of the original owner, upon payment of compensation, being extinguished. It is likewise clear that where there has been no expropriation or other acquisition by the crown or municipality of lands for highway purposes the law presumes that the original proprietor has dedicated the highway to the use of the public, and that upon such dedication the right of the public to use such highway is paramount and perpetual. Mr. Justice Meagher has expressly found, upon what I think is satisfactory evidence, that Spring Garden Road, the street in question, had not been laid out under any statute of the province; he further found, in effect, that it had been dedicated to the public before any expropriation act had been passed by the provincial legislature, and he was of opinion, and I agree with him, that there was nothing in evidence to rebut the presumption of which I have spoken, as to the plaintiffs' ownership extending to the centre of the street. The material question then is: Does the act upon which the learned judge relied apply to the city of Halifax?\nThe act is as follows:\u2014 An act to amend chapter 45 of the Revised Statutes, 5th series, \"of laying out of roads other than great roads.\"\nBe it enacted by the Governor in Council and Assembly as follows:\u2014 (1.) The legal title to all highways, and the lands over which they pass, is hereby declared to have been heretofore vested in Her Majesty, the Queen, forever for a public highway. (2.) Every highway or street now opened or used as such shall be deemed to have been laid out under the statute of this province applicable thereto unless the contrary can be shown.\nI am clearly of opinion that this act does not, and was not intended to, apply to the city of Halifax. If we are permitted to look to the title of the act this is manifestly clear. The title indicates that the object of the legislature is to amend chapter 45 of the Revised Statutes. The assertion that that chapter applies to the city of Halifax is not even arguable; its sole object is to provide machinery for the expropriation of land in order to the making or changing of highways. The charter of the city of Halifax provides an altogether different machinery for the same purpose, and for that reason chapter 45 cannot be held to apply to the city. If, then, we are at liberty to look to the title of the act of 1887 it simply means that the lands expropriated for highway purposes, under chapter 45, shall vest in Her Majesty for these purposes, and that all highways and streets outside of the city of Halifax shall be deemed to have been expropriated unless the contrary is shown.\nThe act has obviously been drawn by a person unacquainted with legal draughtsmanship. The first section is ungrammatical in form. It is otherwise ambiguous and difficult of interpretation. According to recognized usage its first section should have specified the special act it was intended to amend and it should then have proceeded by distinct paragraphs to indicate the character and extent of such amendment. It is manifestly obvious from the title that chapter 45 only was the statute to be amended. Are we to ignore that intent by reason of any supposed rule forbidding reference to such title? Suppose an act with the same title contained the following words only: \"The word 'twenty' in the first line of the second section of the said act is hereby repealed and the word 'thirty' substituted therefor.\" Is there any possible method of interpreting such an act without reference to the title? In such a case would not the courts be imperatively bound to call the title to their aid in the interpretation rather than to do what would otherwise be a necessity, treat the act as absolutely meaningless and nugatory? So in this case we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the legislature intended, and only intended, to amend the general Provincial Road Act. They did not intend to legislate in respect to the streets in the city of Halifax.\nWe are not, I conceive, obliged to disregard this intention out of deference to what is said to be a rule of construction, a rule which I may say has probably been just as much honoured in the breach as in the observance.\nI doubt whether as a matter of law there is at present any rule at all upon the subject. In none of the cases referred to in the text books has the existence or authority of the rule been the point to be determined. The assertion of the rule has been dicta and nothing more. There is this difference too between English and colonial statutes. In England the title of an act is a creation of modern growth; at one time acts were passed without it and there is even now no binding rule as to its character. Colonial legislatures have, on the other hand, always been under a constitutional obligation, by virtue of express instructions from the\n(1) See Maxwell on Statutes, pages 49 to 52 and cases there cited. crown, to take care that no clause shall be inserted in any act foreign to what the title of it imports, and I know as a matter of practice that in the legislature of Nova Scotia it is the title of the act alone that is read while going through its different stages in the House of Assembly except when before the House in committee of the whole. It is true that when a bill there passes its third reading, the motion is \"that the bill do pass and that the title be &c., &c.,\" just as in our House of Commons the motion is \"that the bill do pass its third reading, and that the title be as in the motion paper,\" but the legislators have before them in both cases, from the introduction of the bill until it receives its final assent, in its title what its object is.\nWe cannot, with propriety, shut our eyes to the words of the title when it may be absolutely necessary to have regard to these words in our attempt to ascertain the legislative intention, and I submit that when, as in the present case, obvious omissions are inadvertently or ignorantly made the title may and must be regarded with a view of ascertaining the objects or purposes which the legislature has in view.\nMy view upon this point is strengthened and supported by the consideration that the legislature of Nova Scotia by a subsequent statute (chapter 60 of the acts of 1890, section 5), passed an act expressly in relation to the city of Halifax, and provided, in effect, that all of the streets of the city should thereafter be vested in the corporation. This latter statute would be absolutely meaningless if the legislature then had supposed that the act of 1887 affected the streets of the city of Halifax. If they had been by that act vested in the crown they could only have been taken from the crown by a statute expressly declaring that it was the interest of the crown which was being affected. Here there is no such declaration, and the statute itself is equivalent to a legislative declaration that the act of 1887 had not the extended meaning which is now sought to be given to it. The result would, therefore, seem to be that the land upon which the trees mentioned in the pleadings were growing was the plaintiffs' land, subject to the rights of the public to use the same for street purposes.\nNow, what were the rights of the defendant company? They were incorporated by the act of 1887, chapter 100, and were authorized to construct and work lines of telephone along the sides of, and across and under, any public highway or street, with the consent of the council having jurisdiction to give such consent, but it was further provided that in working such lines the company should not cut down or mutilate any trees.\nIn the present case the company obtained the consent of the city council to erect their telephone line along Spring Garden Road, and in front of the plaintiffs' residence. To that extent only was the city in any way implicated in the alleged trespass. The mutilation of the trees was, therefore, an act in direct violation of the company's charter, and by such mutilation they became liable to this action to the extent of the damage incurred. These damages have been assessed at $100, and no complaint has been made that they are excessive.\nQuestions were raised at the argument as to whether the statute of 1887 vested the fee simple of highways in the crown, or only an easement,\u2014as to whether, assuming the street in question to be vested in the crown, the plaintiffs had not still an action against the defendants by reason of their wrongful act\u2014as to whether the city of Halifax might not, in the exercise of its controlling power over streets, cut down or mutilate trees growing on the highway for the public benefit, &c., &c. It being settled that the plaintiffs owned the trees in question and that the defendant corporation mutilated them without authority, either from the plaintiffs or the municipal authorities, and that they were therefore trespassers, these questions do not demand discussion in the present case.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher should be reversed, and that the judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs for the sum of $100 with interest from the date of trial, together with all the costs of the court below and of this court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: John M.

[1887] c. 184, ss. 532, 534.\nBy the Ontario Municipal Act R.S.O. [1887] c. 184, s. 532, the council of any county has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over all bridges crossing streams or rivers over one hundred feet in width within the limits of any incorporated village in the county and connecting any main highway leading through the county,\u201d and by s. 534 the county council is obliged to erect and maintain bridges on rivers and streams of said width. On rivers or streams one hundred feet or less in width the bridges are under the jurisdiction of the respective villages through which they flow.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the width of a river at the level attained after heavy rains and freshets each year should be taken into consideration in determining the liability under the act; the width at ordinary high-water mark is not the test of such liability.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendants the County of Waterloo.\nThis action is brought under the provisions of 53 Vic. ch. 50, sect. 40 (O.), now section 535 (a) of the Consolidated Municipal Act, 1892 (55 Vic. ch. 42), for the purpose of determining whether the duty and liability to build and maintain a certain bridge, called the Huron Street bridge, across the River Nith, which passes through the village of New Hamburg, an incorporated village in the county of Waterloo, rests upon the appellant corporation or the respondent corporation.\nSection 531 of ch. 184, R.S.O., deals with the general duty of municipalities to keep in repair the roads, streets, bridges and highways.\nSection 532 provides as follows:\u2014\n532. The county council shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all roads and bridges lying within any township, town or village in the county, and which the council by by-law assumes, with the assent of such township, town or village municipality, as a county road or bridge, until the by-law has been repealed by the council, and over all bridges across streams, or ponds, or lakes, separating two townships in the county, and over all bridges crossing streams or rivers over one hundred feet in width within the limits of any incorporated village in the county, and connecting any main highway leading through the county, and over all bridges over rivers, or ponds, or lakes forming or crossing boundary lines between two municipalities.\nSection 534 provides as follows:\u2014\n534. When a county council assumes by by-law any road or bridge within a township as a county road or bridge the council shall, with as little delay as reasonably may be, and at the expense of the county, cause the road to be planked, gravelled or macadamized, or the bridge to be built in a good and substantial manner; and further, the county council shall cause to be built and maintained in like manner all bridges on any river or stream over one hundred feet in width, within the limits of any incorporated village in the county, necessary to connect any main public highway leading through the county.\nThe only question to be decided on the appeal was: Is the River Nith a river or stream over one hundred feet in width within the meaning of these provisions?\nThe evidence showed that the river has well defined banks higher on one side than on the other and that after an ordinary freshet or heavy rain the water rises nearly to the height of the lower bank, which is overflowed by a heavy freshet. When the water is within one foot of the lower bank it is about 112 feet in width, but in dry weather, when the water is low, it is less than 100 feet.\nMr. Justice Ferguson, who tried the action, held that the proper mode of ascertaining the width of the river under the section was to measure from a point a little below the brow of the lower bank across the stream in a straight line to the bank opposite which would make the river in this case more than 100 feet in width. The Divisional Court reversed this decision, holding that the width at the ordinary high-water mark was the true width for the purpose. The Court of Appeal sustained the judgment of the Divisional Court by being equally divided in opinion.\nMeredith Q.C. for the appellants was stopped by the court.\nKing Q.C. for the respondent referred to Phear on Rights of Water[3]; McCullough v. Wainright[4]; Gilman v. Philadelphia[5].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question raised upon this appeal is whether or not a bridge over the River Nith in the village of New Hamburg, connecting the parts of a main public highway on either side of the river leading through the county of Waterloo, is a bridge within secs. 532 and 534 of ch. 184, R.S.O., that is say, whether or not it is a bridge crossing a river or stream over one hundred feet in width. That the bridge which crosses the river is considerably more than 100 feet in length is not disputed, but it is contended that the river itself is not one hundred feet in width. The evidence shows the river to be one having well defined banks, that upon one side being much higher than that on the other. It is also shown that in ordinary freshets and even after an ordinarily heavy rain the waters of the river rise as high as the lower bank, while in heavy freshets they overflow that bank; when, however, the waters in the river rise as high as within one foot of the top of the lower bank and so are, flowing within its well defined banks the river is over 112 feet in width, but in dry weather and when the waters are low it is not as much as 100 feet in width. Now a bridge across such a river is, in my opinion, clearly within the sections in question, that is to say, is a bridge which crosses a river over 100 feet in width and is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the county council whose duty it is to maintain the bridge. After heavy rain and during freshets, which are ordinary occurrences in this country, the waters of the streams and rivers are accustomed to be much swollen and raised to a great height, and a bridge therefore which is designed to be the means of connecting the parts of a main highway leading through a county which are separated by a river must necessarily be so constructed as to be above the waters of the rivers in such periods, and the width of the rivers at such periods must therefore, in my opinion, be taken into consideration in every case in which a question arises like that which has arisen in the present case under the sections of the act under consideration. The appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Meredith, Clarke, Bowes & Hilton.\nSolicitor for respondents: John King.\n[1] 20 Ont.

[1887] c. 19, ss. 15, 65\u2014Illegal assessment\u2014Court of revision\u2014Business carried on in two municipalities.\nSec. 65 of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. [1887] c. 193) does not enable the Court of Revision to make valid an assessment which the statute does not authorize.\nSec. 15 of the act provides that \u201cwhere any business is carried on by a person in a municipality in which he does not reside, or in two or more municipalities, the personal property belonging to such persons shall be assessed in the municipality in which such personal property is situated.\u201d W., residing and doing business in Brantford, had certain merchandise in London stored in a public warehouse used by other persons as well as W. He kept no clerk or agent in charge of such merchandise but when sales were made a delivery order was given upon which the warehouse keeper acted. Once a week a commercial traveller for W., residing in London, attended there to take orders for goods, including the kind so stored, but the sales of stock in the warehouse were not confined to transactions entered into at London.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that W. did not carry on business in London within the meaning of the said section and his merchandise in the warehouse was not liable to be assessed at London.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial by which plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed.\nThe plaintiffs were wholesale grocers doing business at Brantford, and for convenience in supplying cus- tomers at London and vicinity they kept a quantity of sugar at the latter city stored in a public warehouse kept by a man named Slater. The warehouse was used by other parties as well as the plaintiffs. When any of the sugar was sold a delivery order was given to the purchaser and the goods were delivered on such order by Slater. The plaintiffs were assessed for the years 1891 and 1892 on their sugar in the warehouse and paid the assessment under protest. In 1891 they appealed from the assessment to the Court of Revision by which it was affirmed and they eventually brought an action to recover back from the corporation of London the amounts so paid under protest for the two years. Two other firms, Lucas Park & Co, and Macpherson, Glassco & Co, respectively carrying on business at Hamilton, were assessed by the city of London in the same way and had also paid their assessments under protest. Both these firms assigned their claims to the plaintiffs for the purpose of bringing the action.\nThe case was tried before Chief Justice Armour who dismissed the action holding that it was a question solely for the Court of Revision. On appeal to the Court of Appeal this judgment was reversed and judgment given for the plaintiffs for the several amounts claimed.\nMeredith Q.C. for the appellants. The policy of the assessment act is that every person carrying on business in a municipality shall, in respect to his personal property there, pay his share of the local rates. See Toronto Street Railway Co. v. Fleming[2].\nThe plaintiffs having property in London it was for the Court of Revision to decide as to whether or not they did business there and its decision, and that of the County Court Judge in appeal therefrom, are final. By section 65 of the assessment act the assessment roll as finally revised is conclusive as to all matters it contains. The act was amended in consequence of the decision in Nicholls v. Cumming[3] in this court.\nFor purposes of assessment tangible personal property is in the same position as real estate. McCarrall v. Watkins[4]; City of Kingston v. Canada Life Assurance Co.[5]\nGibbons Q.C. for the respondents. Plaintiffs had no place of business in London within the meaning of the act. Kingston v. Canada Life Co.5; Ex parte Charles[6].\nThis case is not distinguishable in principle from City of Brantford v. Ontario Investment Co.[7], and Nickle v. Douglas[8].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. First, I agree with the Court of Appeal in holding that the 65th section of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. ch. 193) does not make the roll, as finally passed by the Court of Revision, conclusive as regards question of jurisdiction. If there is no power conferred by the statute to make the assessment it must be wholly illegal and void ab initio and confirmation by the Court of Revision cannot validate it.\nTo this effect were the decisions in Scragg v. City of London[9]; Nickle v. Douglas[10]; Nicholls v. Cumming[11]. Several other Ontario cases might be cited to the same effect. All these cases were founded on principles laid down in English decisions of the highest authority. I cannot assent to Mr. Meredith\u2019s argument that McCarrall v. Watkins[12], has any application to the present case. The distinction is that the property assessed in McCarrall v. Watkins12, was real estate, in which case the property itself is the subject of assessment; here the property is personal in which case not the property but the owner is assessed. I adhere to what is said in Nickle v. Douglas[13], as to this distinction.\nThen if the roll was not conclusive the only question remaining can be whether the case of the respondents comes within the 15th section of the Assessment Act which provides that\u2014\nWhere any business is carried on by a person in a municipality in which he does not reside, or in two or more municipalities, the personal property belonging to such person shall be assessed in the municipality in which such personal property is situated.\nIt is not disputed that the personal property\u2014merchandise consisting of sugar\u2014assessed in the present case was actually in a warehouse within the appellant municipality at the time it was assessed; nor can it be disputed that the respondents are residents of the city of Brantford and do not reside in the city of London. The sole question is, therefore, whether upon the evidence it can be said that they carried on business in London. The proof upon this head is that the sugar was stored in a public warehouse kept by a Mr. Slater in the city of London; that this warehouse was used for bonded as well as for unbonded goods, and by other persons as well as by the respondents; and that the respondents paid Slater the usual warehouse charges upon these goods. It further appears that they had no clerk or agent in charge of the goods, but that when they made sales of sugar they gave a delivery order which Slater acted upon; that once a week or so their commercial traveller, who resided in London, attended there to take orders for goods, including sugar, but that the sales of sugar out of the stock in Mr. Slater\u2019s warehouse were not confined to transactions entered into at London.\nI am of opinion that this does not show that the respondents carried on business at London. It only shows that some of their stock in trade incidental to the business they carried on at Brantford was stored in a warehouse in London. The proper presumption is, therefore, that they were assessed for this same sugar at Brantford where they exclusively carried on business. To maintain this assessment at London would therefore be to impose upon the respondents a double tax upon the same property which would be illegal and oppressive.\nThe case of Kingston v. Canada Life Assurance Company[14], which appears to me to have been properly decided, is an authority for the respondents as is also Ex parte Charles[15] referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: T.G.

S. N. S. 5 Ser. c. 53.\nBy R. S. N. S. 5 Ser. c. 53, s. 9, s.s. 30, the road, bed etc., of all railway companies in the province is exempt from local taxation. By s. 1 the first part of the act from secs. 5 to 33 inclusive applies to every railway constructed and in operation or thereafter to be constructed under the authority of any act of the legislature and by s. 4 part 2 applies to all railways constructed or to be constructed under authority of any special act, and to all companies incorporated fur their construction and working. By s. 5, s. s. 15, the expression \"the company\" in the act means the company or party authorized by the special act to construct the railway.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Gwynne J. dissenting, that part one of this act applies to all railways constructed under provincial statutes and is not exclusive of those mentioned in part two; that a company incorporated by an act of the legislature as a mining company with power \"to construct and make such railroads and branch tracks as might be necessary for the transportation of coals from the mines to the place of shipment and all other business necessary and usually performed on railroads,\" and with other powers connected with the working of mines \"and operation of railways,\" and empowered by another act (49 V. c. 45 [N.

S. N. S. 5 Ser., entitled 'of railways,'\" is a railway company within the meaning of the act; and that the reference in 49 V. c. 145, s. 1, to part two does not prevent said railway from coming under the operation of the first part of the act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the defendant company.\nThe facts of the case will sufficiently appear from the following judgments.\nMr. Justice Townshend who tried the case held that the defendant company was exempt from taxation in respect to the said railway. His judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and the company appealed to this court.\nHarris Q.C. for the appellants referred to Doughty v. Firbank[1].\nBorden Q.C. for the respondents cited In re East & West India Dock Co.[2]; In re Exmouth Docks Co.[3].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and FOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment of the majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the appellants are not a railway company within the meaning of the 30th subsection of section 9 of ch. 53 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series, as amended by 53 Vic. ch. 25 of the statutes of Nova Scotia, which section, as so amended, enacts that \"the road, rolling stock, bed, track, wharfs, station houses, and buildings of all railway companies in the province shall be exempt from local taxation.\" That section, by the provisions of the said chapter 53, which is entitled \"of railways,\" applied only to such railways as at the time of the passing of the said ch. 53, viz., in 1884, were then constructed and in operation, or which should thereafter be constructed, under the authority of any act passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia; and the term \"railway companies in the province\" whose property is by the above subsec. 30 of sec. 9 of ch. 53, as amended by ch. 25 of the acts of 1890, exempted from taxation, must, of necessity, as it appears to me, apply only to such companies as had been or should be incorporated by an act passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia as a railway company, for the purpose of constructing and operating the railway authorized by the legislature of Nova Scotia to be constructed. In fact it applies, as it appears to me, only to railway companies with whose special act of incorporation as a railway company the provisions of the first part of the general act \"of Railways,\" viz., ch. 53, were declared to be incorporated, and therefore to those companies only whose corporate powers consisted solely in the working of the railway.\nNow the appellants were not incorporated by an act passed by the legislature as a railway company at all or for the construction of any railway; they have come into existence as a company under the name of the International Coal Company, limited, under an act of the Dominion of Canada, viz., the Joint Stock Companies Act of 1877, for the purpose of purchasing and holding certain coal mining properties in Cape Breton. The property, for the purpose of purchasing which the appellants were so incorporated by Dominion letters patent under the provisions of the above Dominion act, was the property of a company which had been incorporated by an act of the legislature of the province of Nova Scotia before Confederation, in 1864, as the International Coal and Railway Company, for the purpose of opening and working coal mines, manufacturing coal oil, and the constructing and making such railroads and branch tracks as might be necessary for the purpose of the transportation of coals from the mines to the place of shipment, and all other business necessary and usually performed on railroads. Now, in 1885, an act of the Dominion of Canada, 48 & 49 Vic. ch. 29, was passed upon the petition of the appellants who were so, as aforesaid, incorporated as the International Coal Co., limited, by Dominion letters patent, by which it was enacted that\u2014\nNotwithstanding any thing in the Canada Joint Stock Companies Act 1877, the said the International Coal Company, limited, is hereby declared to have, as having acquired the properties of the said International Coal and Railway Company which included their said railway, the right and authority to hold and work the said railway for the purposes of their own mines and operations and may hold and exercise such powers of working the said railway for the transport of passengers and freight generally for others for hire as may be conferred upon the company by the legislature of the province of Nova Scotia.\nSubsequently, and in 1886, the appellants obtained an act of the legislature of Nova Scotia to be passed whereby it was enacted that,\nThe International Coal Company, limited, is hereby authorized to hold and operate the railway lately purchased and now belonging to the company and leading from the mines of the company at Bridgeport to Sydney, for general traffic and the conveyance of passengers and freight for hire as well as for all purposes and operations connected with said mines in accordance with and subject to the provisions of part second of ch. 52 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, fifth series entitled \"of railways.\"\nNow it is to be observed that in this act the appellants are dealt with as \"The International Coal Company, limited,\" and not as a railway company at all. To the International Coal Company who have a railway for the necessary purposes of the company as a coal company are given certain powers which they may or may not exercise at their pleasure, namely, the power to operate their railway for general traffic and the conveyance of passengers and freight for hire, as well as for the purposes and operations of the company as a coal company in connection with their mines. Now such additional powers conferred upon the coal company does not constitute them a railway company within the meaning of subsec. 30 of sec. 9 of ch. 53, as amended by ch. 25 of the acts of 1890, and I confess to being unable to see any principle upon which we would be justified in holding that the property of the coal company, and which is used by them for the purpose of carrying on the business of a mining coal company, and for carrying on which business they were incorporated, should be exempt from taxation because in addition to the business of a mining coal company they have had conferred on them a privilege which they may or may not exercise at their pleasure of using property essentially necessary to their business as a coal company for other purposes. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The point to be determined on this appeal is as to the liability of the appellant corporation for local taxation in respect to their railway between Bridgeport and Sydney, in the county of Cape Breton. A case was agreed upon between the parties and upon its being submitted to Mr. Justice Townshend he gave judgment in favour of the company. This judgment was reversed upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the opinion of the court being delivered by Mr. Justice Graham, Mr. Justice Ritchie dissenting, and it is from that judgment that this appeal is taken.\nThe railway in question is twelve miles long. It is worked continuously except during four months of the winter season. It has a regular train service for passengers and freight with a fixed tariff of tolls. Its principal use to the company is the carrying of coals from Bridgeport (where the mines are) to Sydney Harbour, but it none the less is operated as an ordinary railway for the use of the public generally.\nIt was built by the International Coal and Railway Company, a company incorporated by the Nova Scotia legislature in 1864 (cap. 42) for the purpose of working coal mines in Cape Breton and for the further purpose of\nConstructing and making such railroads and branch tracks as might be necessary for the transportation of coal from the mines to the place of shipment and all other business necessary and usually performed on railroads; and for constructing and building such wharfs, docks and piers as might be necessary for the working of mines and protection and safety of shipping, the shipment of coals and the transaction of business connected with mines and operation of railways.\nAfter the railway was so constructed in pursuance of the powers stated the company became involved and its property including the road in question was sold at sheriff's sale. Thereupon the purchasers or their assignees formed themselves into a joint stock company under the name of the International Coal Company (the defendant company) incorporating themselves under \"The Canada Joint Stock Companies. Act 1877.\"\nIt happened, however, that under that act (as well as under the present companies act) companies incorporated by letters patent were incapacitated from constructing or working railways (sec. 2). Application was therefore made to Parliament asking in effect for these among other powers, and by section 3 of 48 & 49 Vict. cap. 29 (Canada) it was enacted that notwithstanding anything in the Canada Joint Stock Companies Act the defendant company might hold and work their railway for the purposes of their own mines and operations, and might hold and exercise such powers of working the railway for the transport of passengers and freight generally for others for hire as might be conferred on the company by the legislature of Nova Scotia. And by chapter 145 of the acts of the Nova Scotia legislature 1886, sec. 1, the company were authorized to hold and operate the railway\nfor general traffic and the conveyance of passengers and freight for hire as well as for all purposes and operations connected with said mines, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of part second of chapter 53 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series, entitled \"of railways.\"\nThe statutes above referred to are the enactments under which the defendant company now operate their road. In my view they justify its claim to be considered a \"railway company\" in the ordinary acceptation of these words. Whether or not they are a railway company within the meaning of the Nova Scotia act remains to be considered.\nSection 9 of subsection 30 of chapter 53 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia \"of Railways\" (hereafter called for convenience \"the Railway Act,\") provides that\nThe road, bed, track, wharfs, station houses and buildings of all railway companies in the province shall be exempt from local taxation.\nThe contention of the municipality is that this provision does not apply to the defendant company; first, because it is not a \"railway company;\" and second, because even if it be a railway company, part first of the \"Railway Act\" in which the exempting clause occurs does not apply to it.\nSections 1 and 4 of the \"Railway Act\" are as follows: \u2014\n1. The provisions of this chapter from sec. 5 to sec. 33 (both inclusive), being part one of this chapter shall apply to every railway constructed and in operation, or hereafter to be constructed, under the authority of any act passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia, and shall, so far as they are applicable to the undertaking, be incorporated with the special act, form part thereof, and be construed as forming one act, unless they are inconsistent with or are expressly varied or excepted by the special act or other act of the legislature of Nova Scotia.\n4. The remaining provisions of this chapter, being part second, shall apply to all railways which have been or which may hereafter be constructed under the authority of any special act passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia and to all companies which have been or may be incorporated for their construction and working.\nDealing with the second contention first, it appears to me that confusion has arisen by supposing that the classes of railways referred to in these two clauses are mutually exclusive of each other. This is not so. The railways referred to in section 4, and in respect to which part second of the act is intended to apply are likewise included in those railways referred to in section 1. In the analogous Dominion act, the Consolidated Railway Act 1879, almost every clause of which is substantially embodied in this act, part first applied to the Intercolonial Railway only, but part second applied to that railway also, as well as to all railways, whether built by Canada or under the authority of its parliament. The Nova Scotia legislature has, however, widened the effect of part one and made it applicable to every railway in the province constructed or operated under its authority, including any railways built under the general railway act of the province if such now there be. But, apart from this consideration, let us examine more minutely whether this railway does not in express terms fall within part 1.\nIt is a railway constructed; it is a railway in operation; it is a railway constructed under the authority of an act of the legislature (the act of 1864) and it is likewise a railway in operation under the authority of an act of the legislature (the act of 1886). So far as I can see nothing else is necessary to bring it within the purview of part one and to confer upon it the benefits as well as to subject it to the obligations thereby created. Nor is there anything in the acts under which it was constructed and is now operated from which it can be inferred that this part is inapplicable. It follows that unless there is something to the contrary elsewhere in the act the exempting clause applies to this railway, assuming always that it is the property of \"a railway company.\"\nBut I see nothing to the contrary, Part second of the act undoubtedly applies to the company.\nIt applies because the act of 1886 under the authority of which the railway is operated expressly so enacts, and because, as well, it is a \"railway which has been constructed under the authority of a special act passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia.\" But that fact cannot by any process of reasoning that I can understand exempt it from, or deprive it of, the burdens and benefits of part one. I am therefore of opinion that if the company is a railway company it is entitled to exemption from local taxation.\nI have already intimated that in my opinion it is as that phrase is ordinarily understood a \"railway company.\" But, if what has been stated is correct, the company is subject to the provisions of the Railway Act. The acts under which the road was built and is now operated all refer to it as a railway company. It operates the road as a railway company.\nIt is in my view, therefore, a bold construction to hold (even although the principal business of the company is the mining of coal) that in spite of legislative declarations several times repeated both by the Parliament of Canada and by the legislature of Nova Scotia to the contrary, the company in question is not a railway company.\nIn my view the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment should be rendered for the appellants for costs including the costs of the hearing before Mr. Justice Townshend and appeals to the court below and to this court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henry, Harris & Henry.\nSolicitors for respondents: Borden, Ritchie, Parker & Chisholm.\n[1] 52 L.

J., and Founier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Sedgewick J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nSale of deals Contract\u2014Breach of\u2014Delivery- Acceptance \u2014 Quality\u2014 Warranty as to\u2014Damages_-Arts. 1073, 1473, 1507 C.C .\nIn a contract for the purchase of deals from A. by S. et al, merchants in London, it was stipulated inter alia, as follows \u2014 \"Quality \u2014 Seller's guarantee quality to be equal to the usual Etchemin Stock and to be marked with the Beaver Brand,\" and the mode of delivery was f. o. b. vessels at Quebec, and payment by drafts payable in London 120 days sight from date of shipment. The deals were shipped at Quebec on board vessels owned by P. & Bros. at the request of P. & P. intending purchasers of the deals. When the deals arrived in London they were inspected by S. et al., and found to be of inferior quality, and S. et al., after protesting A. sold them at reduced rates. In an action in damages for breach of contract ',\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the delivery was to be at Quebec, subject to an acceptance in London and that the purchasers were entitled to recover under the express warranty as to quality, there being abundant evidence that the deals were not of the agreed quality. Arts. 1507, 1473, 1073 C. C. The Chief Justice and Sedgewick J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action in damages for breach of contract for $12,252.44. The facts as alleged by the declaration were as follows:\u2014\nThat on the 10th November, 1880, at Quebec, the appellants then merchants in London, England, acting\" through one Porteous their agent specially authorized for that purpose, made a contract for the purchase of certain quantity of deals with the respondent, a merchant in Quebec.\nThat the contract provided for the quantity, specification and price of the deals and the time at which they were to be ready for delivery. The mode of delivery stipulated for was f. o. b. vessels by respondent at Quebec.\nTwo clauses provided for \"quality\" and \"payment\" and read as follows :\u2014\nQuality.\u2014Sellers guarantee quality to be equal to the usual Etchemin Stock and to be marked with the Beaver Brand.\nPayment.\u2014By acceptance of sellers' drafts payable in London at 120 days sight from presentation and exchange for bill of lading and shipping documents as each shipment is made.\nThat there was in the contract a further stipulation to the effect that should any of the goods remain unshipped on first of August the respondent was to have the option of drawing for the estimated amount of invoice for whatever quantity they had then ready for delivery, and in like manner on the first of November for any further quantity which they might have ready and not shipped.\nThat part of the deals were shipped at Quebec in September, 1881 and 1882, and on their arrival in London and when they had been piled in the docks, their defective quality was brought to the notice of the respondent, who was then in London.\nThat they were all paid for before they had reached London.\nTo this declaration, respondent answered as follows: Firstly, by a general denial, secondly, by a perpetual peremptory exception in which he alleged:\n1. That J. S. Porteous, mentioned in the declaration, .acted throughout in the execution of the contract as appellants agent. 2. That before the deals had. been all sawn and. before the first cargo had been shipped, the appellants had already sold them to Price & Pierce, of London, represented at Quebec by Price, Bros. & Co. to whom, by appellants' instructions, contained in a letter of date the 8th September, 1881, the respondent was to deliver the goods.\n3. That the deals were delivered to Price Bros. & Co. as appears by the receipts for bills of lading produced.\n4. That the deals were of the stipulated quality, as admitted by Price & Pierce who declared that they were satisfied.\n5. That before delivery, Price had caused the said deals to be measured and culled.\n6. That respondent's drafts were paid by the appellants, without protest, after delivery of the deals by Price & Pierce.\n7. That when the said drafts became due and were paid, the goods had passed into the hands of Price & Pierce, the appellants having no interest in them, and having sold them at a profit to Price & Pierce, who had resold the same.\nTo these pleas, the appellants replied generally.\nThe evidence as to the acceptance, delivery and quality of the deals is reviewed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fournier hereinafter given.\nFitzpatrick Q. C. and Ferguson Q C. for appellants contended that the proper construction of the contract was that the delivery was to be at Quebec subject to an acceptance in London. If so, there is abundant evidence that the deals were of an inferior quality and under articles 1507, 1473, 1073 CO. the appellants were entitled to recover. Moreover, there being an express warranty, they could not bring their action under art. 1063 until they had sold the deals and therefore art. 1530 relied on by respondent does not apply. Casgrain Q.C., Attorney General of Quebec for respondent, contended that the evidence of the appellant on his own behalf was not admissible and if not admissible the courts below were quite right in holding that there had been delivery and acceptance at Quebec. This is nothing else than a redhibitory action and it has not been brought within a reasonable time. Art. 1530 C. C.\nThe Chief Justice was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le 10 novembre 1880, les appelants, marchands de Londres, en Angleterre, par le minist\u00e8re de Porteous, leur agent sp\u00e9cialement autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet firent avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 un contrat pour l'achat d'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de madriers.\nLe contrat mentionne les quantit\u00e9s, sp\u00e9cification, et prix des madriers et l'\u00e9poque de la livraison.\nLes autres clauses concernant la qualit\u00e9 et le paiement sont comme suit:\nQualit\u00e9.

Les appelants se consid\u00e9raient comme suffisamment prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la garantie que les madriers achet\u00e9s seraient de qualit\u00e9 \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle du stock d'Etchemin portant la marque de Beaver Brand.\nLes madriers ne furent exp\u00e9di\u00e9s qu'en septembre 1881 et les premi\u00e8res charges arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 Londres furent dans les docks ou l'on pouvait facilement les examiner Leur qualit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure fut constat\u00e9e en novembre 1881 lorsque la premi\u00e8re cargaison fut d\u00e9charg\u00e9e et l'intim\u00e9, requis de venir les voir, afin de juge par lui-m\u00eame de leur qualit\u00e9, refusa constamment d'y aller. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s plusieurs demandes \u00e0 cet effet que l'appelant prit son action pour recouvrer la difference de valeur entre les madriers livr\u00e9s et la qualit\u00e9 garantie par le contrat.\nL'intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette action par un plaidoyer, all\u00e9guant que les appelants n'avaient plus d.int\u00e9r\u00eats dans les madriers, les ayant vendus avant m\u00eame que le bois fut coupe et avant la date de la premiere livraison et qu'ils avaient donn\u00e9 ordre de liver tous les madriers a MM.

Price et Pierce de Londres, ils se charg\u00e8rent de fournir les vaisseaux pour transporter le bois en question en Angleterre. II s'ex prime comme il suit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nA. As far as my recollection goes, we received a cable from London, from Price & Pierce, requesting us to see to the shipment of these cargoes, that they had made arrangements with Stewart Brothers about them. We engaged ship here, and had the deals shipped to London\u2014 the deals were shipped by Atkinson, and not by ourselves and he handed us the Bills of Lading after the shipments were made. With the exception of giving Atkinson instructions about the shipping of the deals we practically had nothing to say to them.\nA la question de savoir s'ils avaient des instructions concernant la qualit\u00e9 le t\u00e9moin r\u00e9pond '.\nA. It was giving orders for the vessels. We took up ships and gave orders to suit the stocks that might be on hand at the time.\nQ. Had you, as acting for Price & Pierce, anything to do with the quality of the deals shipped, or with the accepting of them on their behalf, as being under the contract 1\nA. Nothing whatever.\nII affirme aussi qu'ils n'ont re\u00e7u aucune instruction des appelants et qu'ils n'ont agi que sur celles des MM. Price et Pierce.\nLes MM. Price et Fr\u00e8res n'ont pas non plus fait recevoir et examiner le bois en question, ni pour les appelants ni pour eux-m\u00eames. Ce lot de bois \u00e9tant sur le march\u00e9 ils l'ont fait examiner pour leur information seulement, pour se tenir au courant du march\u00e9 comme ils ont l'habitude de le faire.\nWalter J. Ray, le foreman de leur \u00e9tablissement, dit. aussi au sujet de la r\u00e9ception des madriers. We had nothing to do with the receiving or accepting of the deals here all we had to do was to see to their shipment under instructions from Price & Pierce.\nII est donc contratire \u00e0 la preuve de dire que le bois a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u et approuv\u00e9 par Price Fr\u00e8res, comme tant de qualit\u00e9 conforme au contrat.\nOn voit \u00e0 la page 93 du dossier, une lettre des appelants informant l'intim\u00e9 qu'ils ont vendu \u00e0 MM. Price et Pierce le bois qu'ils ont ach\u00e9e de lui i mais cette vente ne parait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de suite, comme le fait voir la partie suivante du t\u00e9moignage de M. Price.\nQ. Did you become aware at any time after the receipt of that cablegram as a matter of fact Price & Pierce did not purchase these deals ?\nA. Yes, I knew they did not, but they informed me themselves that they were Only handling the deals for Stewart.\nOn voit aussi par le t\u00e9moignage de T. L. Pierce, l'un des associ\u00e9s de Price et Pierce, que cette vente n'a pas eu lieu. Le rapport s'exprime ainsi :\nHe repeats his previous statement that the deals were sold by his firm on account of the plaintiffs (appellants), between 1881 & 1883:\nPrice et Pierce n'ont en cons\u00e9quence pas agi pour eux-m\u00eames dans la r\u00e9ception du bois, soit \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans les vaisseaux, soit \u00e0 Londres, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sur les quais. La livraison ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi faite sans qu'il y eut quelqu'un de sp\u00e9cialement charg\u00e9 de le recevoir, ii n'est pas extraordinaire que ce bois se soit trouv\u00e9 d'une qualit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure au point de faire dire \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin que les meilleurs madriers semblaient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tries avant l'exp\u00e9dition de la cargaison. La valeur en \u00e9tait beaucoup au-dessous des prix du march\u00e9.\nPlusieurs t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus sur ce sujet et ont positivement \u00e9tabli le fait de l\u2019inf\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de la qualit\u00e9 du bois et constat\u00e9 que les appelants ont d\u00fb n\u00e9cessairement souffrir des dommages parce que le bois n'\u00e9tait nullement de qualit\u00e9 conforme \u00e0 celle du contrat.\nPour constater ce fait je me bornerai \u00e0 donner quelques extraits des t\u00e9moignages.\nM.J. L. Pierce dit de plus;\nThat he knew of the contract and. had seen it that the goods were put into the hands of his firm for sale by the plaintiffs; that they had occasion to examine the same minutely, owing to a report that the quality was not what it ought to be; that he had frequently had occasion, previous to 1881, to see these deals, and that he. was able to speak with certainty as to their usual and ordinary quality; that the deals in 1881 were not equal to the usual quality, and not equal to the average of previous years, the culling not so strict as it should have been, and usually had been; and that the inferior quality prevented ready sale, causing extra dock charges and interest to a serious amount; That he was aware the plaintiffs lost money; that he knew that the deals were inspected and surveyed by Mr. Browning, aman of great experience in the timber trade; that he knew as a fact that the culling was not in accordance with the usual culling of the Etchemin stock; that the stock had been usually sawn from a run of logs of so good a quality that the brand had been a favourite one; that the deals shipped under this contract were sawn out of logs totally different and of an inferior nature and that the culling of even these was not so strict as it should have been; that if the deals had come forward of the usual good quality, plaintiffs would have made a profit, and certainly no loss; that they were finally realized for the plaintiffs that he had seen the Etchemin deals between 1867 and 1881 inclusive and visited the mills personally in 1866 or 1867; that the deals could have been sold for full market price had they been of the ordinary Beaver Brand. He repeats his previous statement that the deals were sold by his firm on account of the \"plaintiffs between 1881 and 1883.\nMr. E. G. Price, autre associ\u00e9 de la maison Price et Piece dans son interrogatoire dit\nThat he knew of the contract which was handed to his firm in 1881 that he had seen the deals when they came into their hands for sale and that he examined them minutely; that he knew what the usual quality was, having had occasion to see them every year from 1872 to 1881; that he had frequently sold them and could speak with certainty as to the usual and ordinary quality; that the deals shipped under this contract were not of the usual quality and not equal to the previous years, owing to the first quality being coarser and containing more centre deals cut from smaller logs and the seconds and thirds being also coarse and not equal to the usual quality; he knew the plaintiffs had lost money on the contract; he knew of a survey by Browning which was made at the request of his firm for the purpose ' of ascertaining whether or not the deals had been shipped according to the usual custom at the Etchemin Mills, with the result that they were not considered equal to the usual quality; and he produces Mr. Browning's letter which is attached to his evidence; that he knew the culling was notas usual, having had occasion to examine the stock in previous years; that he had sold some of these deals at 30 shillings per standard less than the figures at which they were selling other good deals; that on the arrival of the deals they gave samples to different buyers at \u00a311 10s. 0d. per standard, and all declined them although they wanted them badly; that ultimately they sold them at \u00a39 and \u00a39 10s. when they were making for good deals such as they should have been \u00a311 10s. and \u00a312. He speaks of good deals arriving at the same time as these came in, and being sold readily at \u00a311 and \u00a312, while these deals were kept on band for months and finally disposed of at reduced prices.\nThis was in reference to the first quality. Buyers of the second and third qualities, he stated, were very such dissatisfied with their purchases and declined to take more. He also states that being specially interested in the spruce trade he had seen and examined these deals every year from 1872 to 1881; that the deals should have brought \u00a311 10s. for first quality \u00a39 for the second and \u00a38 10s. for third, if they had been of the ordinary quality, and that they could have sold them at these prices; that his firm had sold all these deals for the plaintiffs.\nMr. J. H. Howard de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pace & Sons dit:\nThat he knew of the contract \"quite recently \"; that he saw part of the deals when being landed and others afterwards, that he had. occasion to examine them very minutely, his object being to purchase them for Pace & Sons for the purpose of making match boxes specially; that he reported verbally to his firm that they were of inferior quality and that in consequence they did not buy them; that he knew the usual quality known commonly as \"Beaver Brand\"; that he had occasion every year since 1870 to examine them; that from 1870 to 1875 he purchased them for Pace & Sons, (of which firm he was a partner); that he is able to speak with certainty as to the usual and ordinary quality; that they were not equal to usual quality although marked with the \" Beaver Brannd\"; that they had 30 per cent of heart or centres and that usually the percentage was 3 per cent; that he estimated the difference in value from the usual shipments at 30 shillings per standard for first quality and 12s. 6d. for the third quality; his firm did not buy second's; that he knew that the calling was not according to usual culling, that the culling of the stock stood first in London; that there were not deals like them that they fetched more in the London market than any other; that the deals shipped under this contract were so inferior that they were perfectly useless for the purpose for which they had used them before; that he knew that if they had been according to the usual\u2019 quality, they would have fetched full market prices, which prices were higher than in 1879 or 1880; that he had seen and examined the stock in Quebec in 1874 1876 and 1878, and that he had seen and examined it elsewhere every year from 1870 to 1881; that he had made these examinations for the purpose of purchasing; that the market was not a falling market but a rising one for first quality from 1879; he estimated the values; first quality \u00a311 10s. ; third quality \u00a38 and he knew that they could have been sold for these prices, because he had paid \u00a311 10s. and \u00a38 for goods inferior to the usual\" Beaver Brand. \"\nM. E. D. Wilson un marchand de Londres dit:\nThat he had examined the deals minutely as an intending purchaser; he speaks emphatically of knowing what the usual quality was; that he had seen them for six or seven years previous to 1881 and that he had purchased them in very large quantities, he believed about 20 cargoes; that the shipment under the contract in question was not equal to the usual quality, that they were inferior in respect of bad classification, the first quality being very \" centry \" and the second and third quality being very rough and inferior; and he estimates the difference in value to the usual shipments at 20 shillings per standard on. the first quality and 10 shillings on the second and third quality; that he considered the culling was not the usual culling and that the deals were distinctly inferior both in quality of wood and classification: that he considered the contract would have been a good one for the plaintiffs if the quality had been right; that he knew the deals from having purchased them from first class Quebec shippers who represented them as Etchemin deals under contract, describing them as such, also \"Beaver Brand\"; that the market was not a falling one and he estimates the values at \u00a311 for first quality, \u00a38 15 0 for second quality and \u00a38 for third quality and knows that they could have been sold at these prices because he was able to make a profit on them\nRobert H. Lightburn, un autre t\u00e9moin, dit:\nThat he knew of the contract and he proves the payments, and due dates of the drafts drawn by defendant, and also proves that the deals were handled by Price & Pierce for the plaintiffs, and an account was rendered of the sales.\u201d\nA G- Sheriff dit:\nThat he knew of the contract and that the plaintiffs had bought the same stock of deals before in 1879; and that the deals in question in this case were not equal in quality y he exhibits an account showing loss to the plaintiffs of 2,521 11s. 7d'., proves the payment of the bills and puts in a table showing them to have been drawn between the 25th June 1881 and the 15th December, 1881, and all paid; he knew that the deals had been surveyed and the quality generally condemned d describes his interview with the defendant, in which interview he urged him to \u00a3\"0 to the docks when in London to see the deals, and the indifference of the defendant to his request; states that the Beaver Brand is a well known and favourite stock; and that the quality of the shipments under this contract rendered them useless for what they were usually wanted, otherwise they could readily have been sold. He produces the account of sales, certified by Price & Pierce showing how the deals were sold for account of plaintiffs. He also deposes to having seen the survey of the late Mr. Browning, thus showing this gentleman s death previous to the closing of the commission and the consequent impossibility of examining him.\nTous ces t\u00e9moins s'accordent \u00e0 dire que le march\u00e9 \u00e9tait alors plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la hausse qu'\u00e0 la baisse; que la demande \u00e9tait bonne et que du bois de la qualit\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e au contrat se serait promptement vendu, au lieu que la vente de celui envoy\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9e.\nAtkinson l'intim\u00e9, se trouvant en Angleterre lors de l'arriv\u00e9e d'une partie de son bois, fut inform\u00e9 par l'appelant de la qualit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure du bois, et invite \u00e0 aller avec eux l'examiner dans les docks. S'\u00e9tant une fois rendu chez l'appelant qui se trouvait alors absent, ii ne voulut plus y retourner quoique souvent requis de le faire pour examiner le dit bois. Le dossier contient en outre plusieurs lettres des appelants se plaignant de la qualit\u00e9 du bois et lui demandant des instructions sur la mani\u00e8re d'en disposer; mais il a toujours refus\u00e9 de tenir aucun compte des r\u00e9clamations des appelants. Enfin les appelants se sont d\u00e9cid\u00e9s \u00e0 s'adresser \u00e0 la justice. Je crois que les appelants ont fait une fort bonne preuve de leurs dommages et qu'ils out droit \u00e0 Un jugement en leur faveur.\nJe suis d'avis que les dommages devraient \u00eatre estim\u00e9s \u00e0 raison de $3.00 par cent de madriers de premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9, de l'\u00e9talon de St. Petersburg (per hundred deals) et \u00e0 raison d'une piastre et cinquante cents par cent madriers de 2e et de qualit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9talon de St. Petersburg. Le tout avec frais et d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal for reasons given by my brother Fournier. Damages $3 per hundred St. Petersburg Standard for first class, and $1.50 for second and third class.\nGWYNNE J. concurred with FOURNIER J.\nSEDGEWICK J. was of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be affirmed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Fitzpatrick & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for respondent : Casgrain, Angers & Lavery.\n",

On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by E the action was dismissed in 1893\nC. then appealed to the Supreme Court.\nHeld that the building\" for which the contract had been entered into having been completed, there remained but the question of costs and the claim for $545 in dispute between the parties and that amount was not sufficient to give jurisdiction to the Supreme Court under It S C ch. 135 sec 29\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the head note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau, hereinafter given.\nBefore the case was inscribed for hearing on the merits, R. C. Smith, for the respondent, moved to quash the appeal on the following grounds: \u2014\n1. Because the case is not appealable to this court\n2. Because the matter in controversy herein does not amount to the sum or value of two thousand dollars nor does it involve the question of the validity of any-legislative act or ordinance nor relate to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound;\n3. Because no question is involved in the present appeal but one of costs;\n4. Because appellant acquiesced in the judgment of the Superior Court herein, dismissing his claim for damages and did not appeal therefrom, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) now appealed from, specially reserved to appellant all his rights in the bricks and building material taken by him to respondent's premises, or to their value, and there remains of appellant's original conclusions but the prayer to resilient a contract of less than two thousand dollars;\n5. Because appellant has no interest whatever in bringing the present appeal to demand the r\u00e9siliation of said contact, the building in question having been completed more than five years ago, and the question of appellant's liability for breach of said contract not arising in this case, but being before this honouirable court upon another appeal to wit in the case in which the present appellant is appellant, and the present respondent is respondent, wherein appellant was condemned by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) to pay to respondent the sum of eight hundred and eighty-two dollars damages, and the present appeal is unnecessary and useless, aid involves only the question of costs,\nArchibald Q.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered de\nTaschereau J.

The only question is one of costs and the $545 for bricks, for which the \"judgment of Queen's Bench reserves appellant's recourse. Fraser v. Tapper ([1]), Moir v.

On appeal from the decision of the full court assessing damages to plaintiff:\nHeld, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that as by the practice in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick all matters of fact must be decided by the jury, and can only be entertained by the court by consent of parties, the full court in considering the case pursuant to the agreement at the trial acted as a quasi-arbitator and its decision was not open to review on appeal as it would have been if the judgment had been given in the regular course of judicial procedure in the court.\nHeld, further, that if the merits of the case could be entertained on appeal the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.\nHeld, per Gwynne and Patterson JJ., that the case was properly before the court and as the evidence showed that the servants of the company had complied with the statutory requirement as to giving notice of the approach of the train the company was not liable.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in favour of the plaintiff on a submission of the case to the court both on the facts and the law.\nThe action in this case was brought to cover compensation for injuries received by plaintiff caused by being struck by an engine of the defendant company at a crossing near the Intercolonial Railway station in the city of St. John. The particulars of the accident are not dealt with by the majority of the court but are fully detailed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson. On the trial the counsel for the respective parties entered into the following agreement:\n\"It is agreed that the jury be discharged without giving a verdict, the whole case to be referred to the court which shall have the power to draw inferences of fact, and if they should be of opinion upon the law and the facts that the plaintiff is entitled to recover they shall assess the damages, and that judgment be entered as the verdict of the jury. If the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover a nonsuit shall be entered.\"\nPursuant to this agreement the case was considered by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick sitting in banc and decided in favour of the plaintiff. The defendants appealed to this court.\nSkinner Q.C. for the respondent took a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the court contending that the case having been referred to the court by consent of parties the defendants could not appeal any more than they could if it had been referred to private arbitrators. After hearing counsel for the appellants on this objection the court reserved its judgment and heard argument on the merits of the appeal.\nWeldon Q.C. for appellants cited Cornish v. The Accident Insurance Co.[1]; Rodrian v. New York, &c., Railway Co.[2]. Skinner Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This was an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in an action instituted by the respondent against the appellants to recover damages for an injury received whilst driving along a street in the city of St. John at a point where the Intercolonial Railway, over which the appellants have running powers, crosses the public highway or street on a level, the injury in question having been occasioned by an engine and tender belonging to the appellants, and which was at the time of the accident being worked by the servants of the appellants.\nOn the trial of the action and at the conclusion of the evidence the following agreement was come to between the respective counsel of the parties and was entered upon the minutes of the trial:\u2014\nIt is agreed that the jury be discharged without giving a verdict, the whole case to be referred to the court which shall have the power to draw inferences of fact, and if they shall be of opinion upon the law and the facts that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, they shall assess the damages and that judgment be entered as the verdict of the jury. If the court is of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover a non-suit shall be entered.\nThe jury were then discharged.\nThe court in banc accepted the functions which the parties had delegated to them and assumed the duty of ascertaining the damages, which they assessed at the sum of $300.\nThe preliminary objection was taken in the respondent's factum, and repeated on the appeal being opened, that there was no jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal.\nI am clearly of opinion, both upon principle and authority, that this case is not a proper subject of appeal. According to the law and the established procedure of the province of New Brunswick all questions of fact arising in actions at common law are to be tried by a jury, by whom also damages must be assessed, and except by consent of parties the court has no power to dispense with a jury and to exceed its ordinary legal jurisdiction by taking upon itself the decisions of such questions of fact as the assessment of damages. When, therefore, the court in this case undertook to deal with the evidence, to determine the questions of fact, and to assess the damages, it took upon itself to perform the functions of a jury, for which it had no legal or any other authority save the consent and agreement of the parties The court, therefore, acted as quasi arbitrators.\nIt is well settled by authority that in such cases, where a jurisdiction beyond the ordinary jurisdiction which it has by general law is conferred upon a court of justice by an arrangement between the parties, its decision is regarded as that of a private tribunal constituted by the parties, such as a board of arbitrators, and cannot be reviewed, in appeal or otherwise, as judgments pronounced in the regular course of its ordinary procedure may be reviewed and appealed from.\nThis principle was acted upon by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in the case of the Quiddy River Boom Co. v. Davidson[3], and I am of opinion that that decision was entirely in accordance with many English authorities from amongst which I may select two as being directly in point. I refer to the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia v. Gregory[4], and Shortridge v. Young[5].\nI think the appeal should be quashed with costs. Apart altogether from the question of jurisdiction I should upon the merits, if I had considered them to be open, have been prepared to dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I do not dissent on the question of jurisdiction, but if I had to decide the case on the merits I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice King in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Patterson.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The plaintiff, who is respondent in this appeal, brings his action to recover damages for injury to himself and to his horse and carriage from a collision with a locomotive of the appellant company on the 17th of March, 1889, charging that the accident was caused by negligence of the servants of the company.\nThe action was tried at St. John and, after all the evidence on both sides had been given, the following agreement was come to:\nIt is agreed that the jury be discharged without giving a verdict, the whole case to be referred to the court which shall have the power to draw inferences of fact, and if they should be of opinion upon the law and the facts that the plaintiff is entitled to recover they shall assess the damages, and that judgment be entered as the verdict of the jury. If the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover a nonsuit shall be entered.\nThe case was heard before six judges, two of whom, viz., Mr. Justice Tuck who had presided at the trial and Mr. Justice Fraser, were of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and gave judgments explaining fully the grounds of their opinion. The other four judges thought the plaintiff entitled to recover, Mr. Justice Palmer and Mr. Justice King giving their reasons at length, and the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Hanington expressing their concurrence, and damages were assessed at $300.\nThe appeal is from that judgment.\nA preliminary question was raised on the part of the respondent as to the right to appeal from a judgment given in pursuance of the agreement which I have read. For the appellant it was answered that the amount of damages was not questioned, but only the right of the plaintiff to recover, or, in other words, the liability of the defendants for the negligence charged against them.\nI notice that in the court below Mr. Justice Palmer who discussed the amount proper to be assessed as damages after he had dealt with the question of liability, and who suggested that it would be better if such questions as the assessment of damages were left to the jury, concluded his judgment with the following observation:\nThe parties made another difficulty by leaving the case to the court by agreement, the power we are exercising is that conferred upon us by such agreement; and not such as is so conferred by law, for in the latter of which only is there any appeal. See Quiddy River Boom Co. v. Davidson[6].\nThe learned judge here refers, as I understand him, to the assessment only. In the case he cites it had been agreed that the court should assess damages in place of the jury, and the parties were properly held to the amount assessed under that agreement. Setting aside this matter of the assessment, the agreement is in effect the familiar reservation of points for the court with a consent that the court shall draw inferences of fact.\nThe right to appeal from the decision of a common law court upon a point reserved at the trial was first given in England by the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852, and in Upper Canada where there was a court of appeal it was given in 1857[7].\nThose enactments gave a right of appeal in all cases of rules to enter a verdict or non-suit upon a point reserved at the trial. Such reservations, which could only be by consent of the litigant parties, were very commonly accompanied by a consent that the court should have power to draw inferences of fact as a jury might have done, and it never was supposed, as far as I am aware, that that consent extended only to the court of first instance. Had any such idea existed we should doubtless find it noticed in the books of practice. I believe we may look in vain for any such thing in those books, and I do not doubt that examples to the contrary abound in the reports. When the point was in discussion I happened to think of, and I mentioned, one of those examples which occurs in Moeller v. Young[8] decided in 1855, where, on a reservation of leave to move, authorizing the court to draw inferences of fact as a jury might do, the Court of Exchequer Chamber, differing from the Court of Queen's Bench as to the proper inferences of fact, reversed the decision of that court.\nIn the case before us there was no difference of opinion among the judges who took part in the decision concerning any of the leading facts. Those facts, by which I mean actual occurrences as distinguished from inferences of fact, are practically undisputed. From those facts a majority of the judges inferred that there was negligence for which the defendants were responsible which caused the injury to the plaintiff; a minority inferred the contrary. Under the circumstances, and having regard to the consent, we need not trouble ourselves with the inquiry whether the conclusion depends on inferences of fact or of law, or partly of fact and partly of law. The question is whether, in view of both the law and the facts, the defendants have been properly condemned.\nThe line of the Canadian Pacific Railway terminates outside of the city of St. John, and the company's trains enter the city from the west upon the track of the Intercolonial Railway. On the 17th of March, 1889, an engine of the company with its tender was proceeding backwards along the Intercolonial line towards the station for the purpose of taking out a train. The track crosses a street in St. John called Mill Street, and at that crossing the collision occurred after dark or between eight and nine o'clock. There are gates at the crossing, on each side of the railway, which are usually lowered when an engine or train is about to pass, and raised up at other times. It happened, however, that on this 17th of March the gates could not be lowered because the frost had made the machinery unworkable. That seems to have been a not unusual occurrence, and when it happened the practice was for a man to warn travellers when a train was coming, by means of a flag in the daytime and a light at night. The man whose duty it was to do this was the same man who attended to the semaphore. When an engine approaching from the west whistled for the semaphore the man would lower it by means of the apparatus in a small building at the crossing, and then station himself with his flag or his light as near as possible to the centre of the crossing. He did so on the occasion in question, and seeing the plaintiff approaching with his vehicle he swung his light and shouted to the plaintiff, but failed to attract his attention. Mr. Justice Palmer, who thought the plaintiff was entitled to recover, states his view, formed from reading the evidence, that the plaintiff did see the light but attached no importance to it as it conveyed no meaning to him, and probably did not particularly notice it, or had forgotten it when he stated in the witness-box that he did not see it.\nThe plaintiff says, also, that he did not hear the bell of the locomotive ringing, but the evidence left no doubt in the mind of any of the judges that the bell was duly rung.\nWith great respect for the learned judges who formed the majority in the court below I think their reasoning proceeds upon a faulty principle. The tenor of it appears from the judgment of Mr. Justice King who prefaces his remarks upon the facts by quoting some general observations made by English judges in three cases, Cliff v. Midland Ry. Co.[9]; Stubley v. London & N. W. R. Co.[10] and Davey v. London & S. W. Ry. Co.[11]. I do not think those cases bear out the application, in circumstances like those before us, of the doctrines indicated by the passages quoted. I may allude by and by to the cases or some of them.\nThe learned judge then refers to some provisions of the Railway Act 51 V. ch. 29 (D.). One of these is contained in sec. 187 which empowers the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, if it appears to it expedient or necessary for the public safety, from time to time, with the sanction of the Governor in Council, to authorize or require a company whose railway crosses a street or public highway at rail level or otherwise to protect such street or highway by a watchman or by a watchman and gates or other protection. That provision is a repetition of the law contained in s. 74 of R. S. C. ch. 109. It assumed its present form in 3 884 under 47 Y. c. 11 s. 3, but existed in more general words\u2014the watchman and gates no; being specifically mentioned\u2014in the Consolidated Railway Act 1879, in sec. 48, and in the same section as re-enacted in 1883 by 46 V. c. 24, s. 4; but, as the learned judge remarks, it did not apply to the Intercolonial Railway. He also refers to section 256 of 51 V. ch. 29 which embodies the long standing and familiar provision for the ringing of the bell or sounding of the whistle, which provision is also contained in the Government Railways Act, R. S. C. ch. 38, s. 36; and to s. 259 which, like s. 28 of the Government Railways Act, limits the speed at which an engine may pass through a thickly peopled neighbourhood to six miles an hour, and sec. 260, another old provision corresponding to sec. 29 of the Government Railways Act, and requiring that whenever any train of cars is moving reversely in any city, town or village, the locomotive being in the rear, a person shall be stationed on the last car in the train who shall warn persons standing on or crossing the track of such railway of the approach of such train.\nThis last mentioned provision applies only to a train of cars, and the six miles an hour mandate was not violated by the engine that struck the plaintiff, as its speed was not over five miles an hour.\nThe learned judge then remarks:\u2014\nThere was therefore no breach by the defendants of any statutory obligations; and if they are to be made liable at all it must be because, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, they omitted that reasonable degree of care which the law justly requires of those who, in the exercise of their rights, are using an instrument of danger.\nI should not myself deduce from the considerations set out by Mr. Justice King and by Mr. Justice Palmer the conclusion that there was want of reasonable care on the part of the company. The reasoning by which they reach that conclusion seems to me to cast on the railway company the duty of absolutely averting all risks from the most careless of wayfarers, and to make the occurrence of an accident proof that some duty was neglected by the company. Still, the conclusion being a conclusion of fact founded to a great extent on opinion, I should be slow to interfere with it were it not that it seems to me to err in applying to our railway companies the same rules that govern in England, without sufficient regard to the differences created by our legislation.\nThe English Railway Clauses Consolidation Act[12] requires the erection of gates at level crossings of turnpike and carriage roads, which as a, rule are to be kept shut except when required to be opened to let horses, &c., pass along the highway, and provision is also made for gates at footpaths which cross the railway; but the questions of duty and negligence in the mode of running trains have to be dealt with on general principles, without any such statutory guide as we have in the enactments which prescribe the precautions to be observed with moving trains.\nThose enactments define the duty of the railway company, and, in such situations as a level crossing of a highway, inform the public what signals of danger may be expected.\nThe position in England is stated in a few words by Lord Justice Bowen in his judgment in Davey v. London and South-western Railway Company[13]:\u2014\nThere is no statute law, he says, as regards the obligations of a railway company with respect to a level crossing, so far as I know, and the learned counsel for the appellant admitted as much. It seems to me that whether a railway company has or has not taken the proper precautions with regard to the speed at which, and the warning accompanied by which, their trains pass on a level crossing must be in each case a question of fact. A level crossing in a prairie where you see twenty or thirty miles on each side is very different from a level crossing outside the mouth of a tunnel, or a level crossing in a street, and you must look at each case, and all the facts of the case, before you make up your mind what the railway company ought to do. The difference under our system is very marked. The obligations of the company are defined by statute law. They are framed for all cases, and are not, as in England, a question of fact in each case. Our rule may prescribe more than may, in supposable cases, be absolutely required, as in the instance of a prairie where, as put by the Lord Justice, one can see from afar if there is any one to be warned by the whistle or the bell, while in other situations, as e.g. at the crossing of Mill Street in St. John, the rule provides for an effective warning and one which is intended as a sufficient protection to travellers who use ordinary vigilance in approaching the railway.\nIt is the duty of the traveller to exercise such ordinary vigilance. Many decisions illustrate that proposition and none more clearly than that in Davey v. London and South-western Railway Co.[14] where the servants of the railway company negligently omitted to give warning of the approach of the train by either sounding the whistle or displaying a flag which was provided for the purpose, but the plaintiff was nonsuited because with ordinary vigilance he ought to have seen the train.\nThe legislature having prescribed the precautions to be taken at level crossings, we have no right to hold those precautions insufficient and to throw it open to the jury on every trial to find, ex post facto, that something more ought to have been done in the case that for the moment excites their sympathy. Whatever is proper for the court to do in this case, under the consent, would of course have been proper for the jury to do if the case had been left to them. A remark of Pigott B. in Stubley v. London and North-western Railway Co.[15] that there would be no limit to the liability of railway companies if it were left loosely to juries in every case to say whether further precautions ought to have been taken is as true in this Dominion as in England.\nThe accident in Stubley's case occurred on a public footpath which was crossed on a level by the railway. In obedience to the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, the company had a swing gate at the crossing on each side of the line, placed at some distance from the rails. A woman who was about to cross the line waited until a train passed, and then, crossing the line, was killed by a train on the further track which she had not perceived. Mr. Justice Blackburn, before whom the action was tried, reserved leave to the defendants to move to enter a nonsuit, and subject to that leave, he told the jury to assume for the purposes of the day, and only for that purpose, that the law casts upon the company the duty of taking all reasonable precautions for the purpose of protecting the passengers from risk, including that of keeping a watchman to warn passengers of the approach of a train if, from the nature of the traffic at that place, that was a reasonable practice; and he left to the jury the questions: Was there negligence on the part of the company? And could the deceased with reasonable care on her part have avoided the accident? Under that direction the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, adding that they were of opinion that at that crossing there ought to be reasonable precautions taken by the company beyond what they had taken. Against the motion for a nonsuit on leave reserved it was contended that it was open to the jury to consider that further precautions, such as having a watchman at the crossing, ought to have been taken by the company, the peculiar features of the crossing being of course dwelt upon, chiefly that sixty trains a day passed there, and that a person at the gate through which the deceased had come was prevented by a bridge from seeing a train more than thirty yards off in one direction, though, when still nine feet from the line, he could see 300 yards each way. The court, consisting of Pollock C.B. and Bramwell, Channell and Pigott BB. unanimously held that there was no case for the jury, and a nonsuit was accordingly entered.\nThe case of Stapley v. London, Brighton & South Coast Railway Co.[16] was tried shortly before Stubley's case before Pollock C.B. whose charge was relied on for the plaintiff at the trial in Stubley's case, and it was argued and decided a week later than Stubley's case by the same judges, Bramwell B. excepted. The railway there crossed a carriage way, and the statutory duty was to have gates across the road and to keep them shut. There were proper gates, and there was also a turn-style for foot passengers. It happened, however, that' from a temporary derangement of the service, partly arising from the death of the man who had charge of the gates, one of the gates was left open and without an attendant. While this was so a foot passenger walked on to the line and was killed by a train. The neglect of the statutory duty to keep the carriage gate shut was held to justify a verdict against the company. The rules of the company provided that before opening the gates the gateman was to satisfy himself that no train was in sight, and the fact that the gate was open and no gateman there was held to be an intimation to the foot passenger that no train was in sight. Channel B., giving the judgment of himself and of Pigott B., said:\u2014\nThe case depends upon the principle of Bilbee v. London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co.[17]\u2014(which case had been held not to govern Stubley v. London & North-western Railway Co.)\u2014We adopt the opinion there expressed by Erle C.J., that we ought not to impose any undue burdens on railway companies that are not imposed on them by Act of Parliament, and we do not say that a railway company must keep servants at every crossing. At the same time we concur in the view presented to us by Mr. Manisty, that the company are not to be exempt from using due and ordinary care, although their statute gives them the right of crossing public ways on a level.\nThis last observation brings us back to our immediate point that, with us, the statute which permits the railway to cross a highway at the level expressly declares what shall be done to give warning of the approach of a train. That is just what in the Stapley case would in all probability have been held to be all that could reasonably be required. It is in that case stated as a fact that \"the engine driver of the train sounded no whistle until the accident was actually taking place.\"\nIt is said, and the judgment of the court below proceeds on the idea, that some level crossings may be peculiarly dangerous, and that at them the statutory signals may be insufficient.\nThat is, in my opinion, a consideration for the legislature, and not, under our system, for the court or jury To hold otherwise would be to give a right to the jury in every case, even when the statutory signals are put beyond denial, but the traveller pays no more attention to them than the plaintiff in this case did to the bell that was rung or to the signalman's lantern, to say that the crossing was peculiarly dangerous and more ought to have been done; saying that, perhaps, on evidence which, as put by Bramwell L.J. in Jackson v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[18] would not be allowed to make any body or person liable but a railway, or perhaps a tramway, or may be a steam-boat company.\nBut this subject of the peculiar character of some crossings, and the necessity for special protection at such places for travellers on the highway, has not been overlooked by our legislature, as the jurisdiction given to the railway committee of the Privy Council proves. If the ordinary safeguards are deemed insufficient in a particular locality, the means are thus provided for super-adding a further duty to that cast on companies by the general rules.\nThe remark of Lopez J. in Brown v. Great Western Railway Co.[19] that\u2014\nthe law with regard to negligence has somehow or the other got into a lamentable state of confusion,\nthough well founded in view of English decisions touching accidents at level crossings, ought not to have so much force under our more definite system; but it is to be feared that the confusion will become worse confounded if a jury may always say that, though the statute or the order of the railway committee was faithfully obeyed, yet something more ought to have been done.\nThe opinions on which the judgment in review is based turned a good deal on reasonings from the fact that there were gates at the crossing, and the other fact that they would not work that night. It does not appear that the gates were put there under any statutory obligation. It is not suggested that the defendant company put them there. Even if the railway had been the property of that company no obligation to protect the street by gates could be recognized without proof of an order of the railway committee, nor could it be said that such an order had been disobeyed unless its terms were in evidence.\nThe gates were no doubt put there by the Minister of Railways in connection with the Intercolonial Railway, and they were in charge of the officials of that railway and not of the defendant company. They were even not put there under any statutable obligation. The duty to maintain and use them was a self imposed duty. I do not know that a railway company exercising running powers over the line of another company is liable for an injury to a stranger caused by the default of the company owning the railway, as it might be liable on a contract to carry. Thomas v. Rhymney Railway Co.[20]; Great Western Railway Co. v. Blake[21]. But if by any process of reasoning, the duty assumed by the government with regard to the gates at the crossing could be attributed to the defendant company, it would still be in the character of a self imposed duty, and on the principle on which the case of Skelton v. London and North-western Railway Co.[22] was decided, the neglect of it would give no ground of action.\nIn that case the railway company had, in obedience to the statute, placed swing gates on each side of the railway across a public footpath. The statute did not require that those gates should be fastened, but they were usually fastened by rings attached to the gate posts and it was the duty of the signalman who was stationed near to let down the rings by means of a lever, and so fasten the gates whenever a train was approaching. One morning one gate was, through the neglect of the signalman or from the ring failing to catch the gate, left unfastened, and a man passed through and was killed by a train which he had not perceived. The action was under Lord Campbell's Act, and the plaintiff was nonsuited. I shall read one or two short passages from the judgments, which bear on the points made in the present case concerning the gates and touch also a suggestion that the defendant company ought to have adopted special precautions because a high fence made it somewhat difficult to see an engine approaching Mill Street from the west until one was very near the railway. Bovill C.J. said:\nIf the crossing was rendered dangerous by obstructions to the view, it only made more incumbent upon him to take due care. There is no evidence, however, that the deceased took any care or caution whatever, and it was owing to this want of caution on his part that the accident occurred. It is upon precisely similar grounds that Bramwell B. bases his judgment in Stubley v. London and North-western Railway Co.[23].\nWilles J. said:\u2014\nI should be prepared to decide this case on the grounds stated by my lord had I not a still clearer opinion on the other part of the case. Actionable negligence must consist in the breach of some duty. Here it is not pretended that the defendants had acted improperly in the management of the trains, and the gates fulfilled all the requirements of the statute, so that the plaintiff has to rely on the self-imposed duty, as it is called, or precaution, as I should call it, of keeping the gates shut when trains were passing * * The precaution must have been wholly voluntary, and it would be much to be deplored if the defendants' liability were increased by their taking additional precautions, whether from motives of humanity or discretion. Such, however, is not the case. If a person undertakes to perform a voluntary act, he is liable if he performs it improperly, but not if he neglects to perform it. Such is the result of the decision in Coggs v. Bernard[24].\nMontague Smith J.:\u2014\n\"The first question is whether there is any duty which the defendants discharged negligently. It is conceded that there is no such statutable duty, since the gate was a proper one. * * But it is said that the defendants voluntarily took upon themselves to fasten the gate when a train was approaching, and that its being open, therefore, amounted to an invitation to the deceased to cross the line. I think, however, that that is not the true inference to be drawn from the evidence. It was not proved that the gate was invariably fastened when there was danger, and therefore, putting it at the highest, it amounts to this, that when the gate was unfastened there was probably no train passing. That was not sufficient to absolve a foot passenger from the duty of taking the ordinary care which he would otherwise be bound to do, and it was the want of care on the part of the deceased which was the cause of his death, and not any default on the part of the defendants.\" But although the defendants were not responsible for the closing of the gates, there is another way of stating the charge against them, and that is that their engine was driven across the highway without due precautions being taken for the safety of travellers. Put in other words it amounts to this: the crossing was dangerous unless the gates were down; grant that it was the duty of the Intercolonial Railway people to lower the gates, still you should not have crossed, knowing as you did that the gates were up, without seeing that adequate protection was substituted. This is, after all, a change only in the form and not in the substance of the charge, and in this shape it is answered by what I have said. The precautions taken by the man who signalled with his lantern and by shouting, were, in my judgment, a sufficient warning had the plaintiff, who knew he was approaching the railway, been on the alert as a man of reasonable intelligence and prudence would have been. There was no duty towards him to have the gates closed or to substitute any other method of protecting him against his own imprudence. The only obligation on the defendants was to ring the bell and to keep down the speed of the engine to under six miles an hour, and that duty they fulfilled\nI have not referred to American decisions, and I do not think we should gain much certainty with regard to the principles I have discussed from doing so.\nIn the excellent and useful treatise on Railway Accident Law by Mr. Patterson of Philadelphia[25], the author notes several decisions of the courts of Illinois and New York as authorities for the proposition that when the railway has followed the statutory directions as to giving signals, &c., it has discharged its whole duty in the premises, and other decisions in New York and Massachusetts where the doctrine is held that compliance with such statutory regulations does not necessarily relieve the railway from the necessity of taking such additional precautions as are essential to the safety of passengers on the highway. The learned author thinks the latter the sounder doctrine.\nI am not familiar enough with the railway legislation of the different states of the Union to know how far the railway committee of our Privy Council resembles in its power and its functions any tribunal there existing. The power which it possesses cannot, as I have endeavoured to maintain, be left out of consideration as an important datum in the present controversy, and whether the statutory duties of a railway company in the particular in discussion are simply those defined by the general rule, or whether they are supplemented by an order of the committee, I am satisfied that no principle properly deducible from the current of English decisions requires us to hold that, in this Dominion, the question of duty in the premises is in every case an open question for the jury.\nWe are dealing, as it is scarcely necessary to say, only with the precautions for the safety of the public in general, to be observed at all local crossings or at particular crossings where special precautions have been enjoined by the constituted authority, and not with the different subject of duty towards an individual who is seen to be in a position of peril like the donkey in Davies v. Mann[26]. The rule acted on in that case of course applies to railway companies, but it does not come in question upon the facts before us.\nIn my opinion we should allow the appeal.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondent: Geo.

The case was en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 before the Superior Court on the 30th September 1891, when the statute 54 & 55 Vic. c. 25 sec. 3 ss. 4 came into force enacting that the amount demanded and not that recovered should determine the right to appeal when the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute.\nThe Superior Court on the 5th December, 1891, dismissed the respondent's action. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) the court on the 28th February, 1893, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, granted $880 damages to the respondent with interest from the 16th June, 1887.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada respondent moved to quash for want of jurisdiction;\nPer Curiam. The statute 54 & 55 Vic. c. 25 sec. 3, did not apply to cases pending en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 before the Superior Court, on the 30th September, 1891, and as the amount of the judgment appealed from was under $2,000 the case was not appealable, following on the question of the no retroactivity of the statute, Williams v. Irvine ([1]), and as to the amount in dispute, Monette v. Lefebvre ([2]).\nGWYNNE J. dissenting:\u2014It is impossible in my opinion that justice can be done between the parties to these suits unless the two cases ([3]) should be heard together as one consolidated case, and that as it appears to me is what should be done, and the appeal then heard. Although not formally consolidated in the court below the evidence applicable to both cases was taken in one. Both cases were argued together in the court below and judgment given in both cases at the same time, and by an order made on .the appeals to this court the two cases have been ordered to be printed together. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeals in the two cases should be consolidated and argued as appeal and cross appeal In one suit, as the only way by which justice can be done between the parties and all technical objection removed. The court surely cannot be so powerless as to be unable to put the cases into such a position that justice may be done.\nR. C. Smith for motion.\nJ S Archibald Q. C. contra. MITCHELL v. TRENHOLME.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal.\nMotion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nThis was an action brought by the respondents on the 25th July, 1889, claiming $5,000 damages alleged to have been sustained by them by the production of a plea and incidental demand by appellants in a case before the Superior Court for the District of Montreal under number 528. The Superior Court on the 27th day of September, 1890, granted $300 damages to the respondents.\nThe appellants (defendants) then appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, and that court on the 28th day of February, 1893, confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court, following the decision of Williams v. Irvine ([4]) quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction, holding that 54 & 55 Vic. c. 25, did not. apply.\nGWYNEE J. dissenting. No question as to a right of appeal arose in this case until the month of February, 1893, when the judgment of the Court of Queen's. Bench was rendered, and when it did arise sec. 2311, of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, was in force, which declares, in unmistakable language, that whenever the right to appeal is dependent on the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different. Here the amount demanded was $5,000. We are, therefore, in my opinion, bound to conform to the provisions of the statute which declares what shall be the result of the event which has happened, and to declare that the appeal should be heard and the motion . to quash dismissed.\nJ. S. Buchan for motion.\nA Delisle contra.\nMILLS v. LIMOGES.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court granting to the respondent (plaintiff) one thousand dollars damages.\nMotion to quash.\nThis was an action of damages for $5,000 brought for the deathh of a person by a consort. The Superior Court in April, 1891, granted $1,000 damages and the judgment was acquiesced in by the plaintiff, but defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench and that court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court on the 23rd December, 1892. The statute 54 & 55 Vic. c. 25 sec. 3 ss. 4, declaring that \" whenever the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different,\" was sanctioned 30th September, 1891.\nPer Curiam. 54 & 55 Vic. did not apply to such a case and that the case was not appealable under R. S. C. ch 135 s. 29 the amount in dispute being under $2,000. Mouette v. Lefebvre ([5]) and Williams v. Irvine followed ([6]). GWYNEE J. dissenting:\u2014\nNo question as to the right of appeal arose in this case until the 23rd December, 1892. At that time sec. 2311 R. S. Q. was in force, which declares that \"whenever a right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered.\" We are in my opinion governed by the above section of the Revised Statutes, which declares what shall be done in the event which has happened, and I can see no reason for not conforming to the provisions of that section. I am therefore of opinion that the appeal lies and should be heard.\nAppeals quashed with costs.\nN.B\u2014 In the October session , 1893, the appeal in The Montreal Street Railway Co v Carri\u00e9re, in which an action for $5,000 damages was dismissed by the superior court prior to the passing of 54 & 55 Vic .c. 25, but maintained by the court of Queen\u2019s Bench on 26th April, 1893, for $600, was also quashed for want of jurisdiction following this case of Cowen v.

J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Sedgewick J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nRailway accident to passenger\u2014Train longer than platform\u2014Damages\u2014 Negligence,\nL. was the holder of a ticket and passenger of the company's train from Levis to Ste Marie Beauce. When the train arrived at Ste. Marie station the car upon which L. had been travelling was some distance from the station platform, the train being longer than the platform, and L. fearing that the car would not be brought up to the station, the time for stopping having nearly elapsed, g ot out of the end of the car and the distance to the ground from the steps being about two feet and a half, in so doing he fell and broke his leg which had to be amputated.\nThe action was for $5,000 damages alleging negligence and want of proper accommodation. The defence was contributory negligence. Upon the evidence the Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, gave judgment in favour of L for the whole amount\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, reversing the judgments of the courts below, that in the exercise of ordinary care E. could have safely gained the platform by passing through the car forward and that the accident was wholly attributable to his own default in alighting as he did and therefore he could not recover. Fournier J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action for $5,000 damages for loss of a leg through the alleged negligence of the Company (appellant.) By his declaration the respondent (plaintiff) alleged that on the 13th May, 1891, he was a passenger by appellants' express train from Levis to Ste. Marie de la Beauce.\nThat on arriving at Ste. Marie the train was stopped in front of the station in such a manner that the locomotive was in front of the platform and the passenger cars, including that in which the plaintiff was riding, were left a distance from the platform and that no stool was furnished to assist the passengers in disembarking.\nThat the distance between the lowest step of the car and the ground was very considerable; that plaintiff was obliged to get down at that place, and treading on a round stone broke his leg in. such a manner as to necessitate amputation, and claimed 55,000 damages.\nAppellants filed two pleas:\n1st. An express denial of the allegations of plaintiff's declaration.\n2nd. That if plaintiff met with an accident and suffered any damage, it was attributable entirely to his own negligence and fault and not to any negligence or fault on the part of the appellants or train employees.\nThat proper accommodation, suitable to the requirements of the place is furnished at Ste. Marie to enable people to embark on and disembark from the trains.\nThat if plaintiff chose to alight from the rear end of the car on to the street which there crosses the railway he did so at his own risk.\nThat if plaintiff had passed through the car he could have alighted on the platform as other passengers did, but, in broad daylight he chose to step down into the street, and the injury he sustained in so doing is entirely attributable to his own negligence.\nThe Superior Court, upon the evidence, found as a matter of fact, that the company had stopped the car upon which the respondent was riding at some distance from the platform of the station and had allowed passengers and the respondent to alight in a dangerous place, and that the company was thereby guilty of negligence and liable. This judgment was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe facts brought out in the evidence upon which the appellant company relied as proving that the accident was attributable to the respondent's own fault are the following:\u2014\nThe platform at the village of Ste. Marie not being so long as the train on the day of the accident, part of the baggage car, the whole of the second-clsss car, and nearly the whole of the first-class Q. C. R. car were alongside the platform when the train stopped.\nThe front end of the Boston and Maine car and the rear end of the first-class Q. C R. car were on a street crossing and within five or six feet of the station platform.\nRespondent and one Vallerand, a resident of Ste. Marie, and well acquainted with the locality, were riding in the B. & M. car without objection from the conductor, who, however, did pass some passengers (ladies) into the car forward.\nRespondent was told by this witness Bois that this car was a through car going to Boston and that his place was in the next car.\nWhen the train stopped respondent crossed over from the platform of the B. & M. car to the rear platform of the Q. C. R. car, and there alighted a distance of about two feet, seven inches from the ground having in one hand an overcoat and a \"portmanteau\" or valise, and so jumping and falling on a round stone broke his leg.\nA. J. Brown Q.C. for appellant.\nThe carrier of passengers is only liable for his negligence. He is not an insurer of the safety of his passengers, nor responsible for injuries suffered by them from any cause other than the negligence or fault of himself or of persons employed by him. Daniel v. Merropolitan R. Co. ([1]); Readhead v. Midland R. Co. ([2]); Sherman and Redfield on Negligence ([3]); Grofts v. Waterhouse ([4]) quoted by Chief Justice Ritchie in The Queen v. McLeod ([5]).\nThe passengers themselves must exercise reasonable care.\nIn this case, if the place of disembarking was dangerous for the plaintiff he should not have attempted it. He was not obliged to get off at that place, and no official of the company invited him to do so.\nIt is however, quite manifest that there could be no danger in a man of plantiff's age stepping down a distance of two feet seven inches, if he exercised ordinary care.\nNone of the cases relied on by respondent bear any resemblance to the present. But see Siner et al v. The Great Western Railway Go. ([6]) Cockle v. The London & South-eastern Railway Go. ([7]) Rose v. North-eastern Railway Go. ([8]); Eckerd v. Chicago & North-western Railway Go. (Iowa) ([9]).\nMoreov\u00e9runder the French law when the proximate and sole cause of the accident was the respondent's own negligence he cannot recover.\n\" Quad quis ex culpa sua damnum sentit, non intelligitur damnum sentir\u00e9\"\nSee Sourdat ([10]).\nIn this sense is the \"judgment in Recullet v. Chemin du Nord ([11]).\nThe learned counsel also relied on Moffette v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([12]); Periam v. Dompierre ([13]); Allan v. Mullin ([14]) \" Charbonneau v. The Corporation of St. Martin ([15]); Ware v. Carsley ([16]); Allan v. La Cie d' Assurance Marine des Marchands du Canada ([17]); Main-ville V. Hutchins ([18]); Central Vermont Ry. Go. v. Lareau ([19]); Desroches v. Gauthier ([20]); Gray v. Mayor &c. of Quebec ([21]); Richelieu and Ontario N. Co.v. Desloes ([22]).\nIf there were any negligence or fault, on the part of the company, it was not the proximate cause of the accident; and even if we admit, for the sake of argument merely, that it was one of the causes of the accident yet there was contributory negligence such as to either defeat recovery or reduce the damages.\nJ. E. Lavery for respondent.\nAs to whether respondent should have gone through the first class Quebec Central Car and alighted from the south end of same on to the platform, it is proved that the express train stops but a few minutes at Ste. Marie station, that a good many passengers get off and. on the cars there, that the trains only stop for a very short time, that if people start to go from one car to another so as to get off on the platform, they are exposed to be carried on past the station. Vallerand, who spends the summer season at Ste. Marie, swears that for the last twelve or thirteen years, he was obliged more than twenty-five times to get off where respondent alighted for fear of being carried beyond his destination.\nOn this point I will cite Robson v. The North-eastern Railway Go. ([23]) Rose v. The North-eastern Railway Co. ([24]). The obligation of common carriers seems to be stricter in the French, law than the English law for not only are they, according\" to the former, obliged to carry the holder of a ticket to his destination, but they aire insurers of his safety.\nArticle 1675 of the civil code which comes under the heading \"carriers s is as follows: \" They (carriers) are liable for the loss or damage of things entrusted to them unless they can prove that such loss or damage was caused by a fortuitous event or irresistible force or has arisen from a defect in the thing itself.\"\nThe authors are unanimous in declaring that this article applies to the carrying of persons as well as thing's.\nTroplong Louage, ([25]); Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, ([26]); Curasson, Comp\u00e9tence des Juges de Paix, ([27]); Alauzet, Commentaire du code de commerce, ([28]); Duvergier, Louage d'ouvrage, ([29]); Dalloz, Repertoire, Vo. \"Commissionnaire,\" ([30]); Wood v. South-eastern Ry. Co., ([31]); Borlase v. St. Lawrence Steam Nay. Co. ([32]); Boulanger v. G.T.R. Co., ([33]); Boulanger v. G.T.R Co., ([34]); Chalifoux v. C.P.R. Co., ([35]).\nThis last case was reversed by the Supreme Court, ([36]) but only on the ground, as far as can be judged from the short report, that the breaking of the rail was a fortuitous event caused by climatic influences.\nIf, as we contend, the carrier here was an insurer of the safety of the passenger he was bound to carry him safely and to see him landed safely in a place where there was no danger of an injury. Any negligence on the part of the appellants would render them liable for the injury.\nFoy v. The London Brighton and South Coast Railway Co., ([37]); and Gee v. Metropolitan Railway Co., ([38]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was of opinion to allow the appeal.\nFOURNIER J. La seule question dans cette cause comme dans celle de Chalifoux v. La Compagnie du Pacifique Canadien ([39]), est an sujet de l'\u00e9tendue de la responsabilit\u00e9 des voituriers qui font traffic de transport des personnes. Les principes qui doivent d\u00e9finir, cette responsabilit\u00e9 sont ceux du droit fran\u00e7ais et particulier rement du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans laquelle l'accident dont il s'agit est arriv\u00e9. Cependant, dans la cause de Chalifoux, la majorit\u00e9 de cette Cour s'appuyant sur le droit anglais et la d\u00e9cision des tribunaux anglais a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de prouver la n\u00e9gligence pour rende le le voiturier responsable, tandis que d'apr\u00e8s notre droit, art. 1675 C. C , il est responsable \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve que l'accident est arriv\u00e9 par cas fortuit on force majeure.\nLa preuve de la n\u00e9gligence est requise dans le cas de l'art. 1053 mais ici il s'agit de l'art. 1673 concernant les voituriers et cette preuve n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nL'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait passager dans le train rapide allant de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Boston. Des que le train fut arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 la station de Ste-Marie Beauce il se rendit sur la plate-forme \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du char dans lequel il avait pris place pour descendre. Ce char se trouvait en de\u00e7\u00e0 du quai de la gare. L'intim\u00e9 en sautant du marchepied (une hauteur de 21\/2 \u00e0 3 pieds) se. cassa la jambe et dut se la faire amputer quelques jours apr\u00e8s l'accident. L'Honorable Juge en Chef, Sir Alexandre Lacoste, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette canse sur le principe que les r\u00e8gles concernant le transport des marchandises par los voituriers, s'appliquent mulatis mutandis au transport des voyageurs.\nC'est aussi sur ce principe que la Cour du Banc de la Reine avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la cause de Chalifoux v Le Pacifique Canadien ([40]). En France on appliue au transport des personnes, aussi bien qu'au transport des marchandises, la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie contre les voituriers par l'art. 1784 C N. Un arr\u00eat de la Cour Imp. de Paris de 27 novembre 1866 in r\u00e9 Compagnie du nord dit \u00e0 ce sujet: \"L'article 1784, qui les rena responsables de l'avarie ou de la perte des objets qu'elles transportent \u00e0 moins qu'ellss ne prouvent le cas fortuit et la force majeure, s'applique a fortiori au transport des personnes. La protection due \u00e0 celles-ci ne peut \u00eatre moindre que celle que l'on accorde aux marchandises. C'est cc que d\u00e9cide avec raison, un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Paris le 27 novembre 1866 (Droit du ler d\u00e9cembre 1866).\nLe premier consid\u00e9rant de cet arr\u00eat est ainsi con\u00e7u\nConsid\u00e9rant que le voiturier r\u00e9pond de l'avarie des choses \u00e0 lui confi\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve qu'elles ort \u00e9t\u00e9 avari\u00e9es par un cas fortuit ou force majeure.\nSir Alexandre Lacoste avait donc raison de dire que les r\u00e8gles concernant le transport des marchandises parles voituriers s'appliquent au transport des voyageurs.\nOn doit en dire autant au sujet de l'art. 1675 de notre code qui est presque textuellement le m\u00eame que l'art 1784 C.N Mais ceci est rendu \"plus \u00e9vident par l'art 1673, qui applique toute la sec. III des voituriers an transport des personnes, aussi bien qu'au transport des marchandises. Cet article dit (les voituriers) sont tenus de recevoir et transporter aux temps marqu\u00e9s dans les avis publics toute personne qui demande passage, si le transport des voyageurs fait partie de leur trafic accoutum\u00e9; et tous effets qu'on leur offre \u00e0 transporter; \u00e0 moins que dans l'un ou l'autre cas il n'y ait cause raisonnable et probable de refus.\nLe trafic de transport des passagers fait aussi bien partie du trafic de l'appelante que le transport des marchandises.\nDans la cause ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, Cotelle, L\u00e9gislation des chemins de fer ([41]) fait les observations suivantes sur ce jugement:\nEn. principe, suivant elle, le voiturier r\u00e9pond de lavarie des choses \u00e0 lui confi\u00e9es, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve qu'elles out \u00e9t\u00e9 avari\u00e9es par cas fortuit ou force majeure. Ce principe s'applique \u00e0 plus forte raison au transport des personnes et prot\u00e8ge la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des voyageurs. Mais, c'est \u00e0 la compagnie qu'incombe i'obligation de prouver les faits qui la d\u00e9chargeraient de sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nL'accident, ainsi qu'il est dit plus haut est arriv\u00e9 parce que le train dans lequel se trouvait l'ntim\u00e9 \u00e9tant beaucoup plus long que la plate-forme de la station, le char dans lequel il \u00e9tait, ne put aborder la plate-forme pour v faire descendre ses passagers. Le train \u00e9tant un express qui n'arr\u00eate que quelques instants, les passagers de crainte d'\u00eatre emmen\u00e9s \u00e0 une autre station se pr\u00e9cipitent tous aux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s du char et souvent s'aper\u00e7oivent que le char n'est pas vis-\u00e0-vis du quai. il leur faut rebrousser chemin ou aller plus loin contre le courant des passagers ou bien sauter du marchepied. Ce mode n'est pas sans inconv\u00e9nient mais la compagnie ne peut pas leur reprocher un risque qu'ils out couru pour ne pas \u00eatre emmen\u00e9s \u00e0 la station prochaine, chaque marchepied est pour le voyageur, une invitation \u00e0 descendre et l'arr\u00eat est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement trop court pour qu'il refuse la premi\u00e8re chance qui lui est\nil est prouv\u00e9 qu'il y a toujours beaucoup de voyageurs \u00e0 cette station; il y aussi preuve que plusieurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9s aux stations voisines parce que le temps d'arr\u00eat est trop court. L'intim\u00e9 qui voyageait pour affaire craignant ce r\u00e9sultat, sauta du marchepied \u00e0 une hauteur de 21\/2 \u00e0 3 pieds de la derni\u00e8re marche, mais malheureusement \u00e0 quelque pieds de la se trouvait une grosse pierre dont la forme \u00e9tait ovale sur laquelle il mit le pied, tomba et se cassa la jambe. L'intime n'est pas le seul qui a pris cette direction pour sortir du char. Le t\u00e9moin Vallerand dit que piusieurs passagers les out suivis, et entre autres une Dlle Noonan, qu'il a descendue dans ses bras par\u00e9e qu'elle ne voulait pas sauter li ajoute, elle aussi aurait pu traverser l'autre char mais elle trouvait le voyage trop long.\nil est aussi prouv\u00e9 que la plate-forme est trop petite, qu'ii y a beaucoup de voyageurs \u00e0 cette station et que la compagnie a un terrain qui lui permet de i\u2019 agrandir facilement. Elle est coupable de n\u00e9gligence en ne faisant pas cette am\u00e9lioration Si n\u00e9cessaire.\nLes observations suivantes de Sir Alexandre Lacoste au sujet du soin que dolt apporter le voiturier pour prot\u00e9ger ses passagers sont parfaitement correctes.\nLe voiturier est tenu d'user de la, plus grande vigilance pour prot\u00e9ger ses passagers, contre les p\u00e9rils du voyage, tandis qu'il ne peut exiger d'eux que la prudence ordinaire. Si, par sa n\u00e9gligence, il soumet un voyageur a quelqu'inconv\u00e9nient, il doit s'attendce que celui-ii prendra les moyens que sa discr\u00e9tion lui sugg\u00e9rera pour se tirer d'embarras et pour cela il encourra m\u00eame un certain risque sil le faut et le voiturier sera responsable de l'accident qui surviendra, a moins qu'il ne prouve que le voyageur a agi avec une imprudence inexcusable\nToute compagnie de chemin de fer est tenue de procurer \u00e0 ses voyageurs un d\u00e9barcad\u00e8re convenable. S'il n'y a pas de quai, elle doit pourvoir \u00e0 un autre moyen facile de descente et indiquer aux voyageurs ou ils devront d\u00e9barquer, si les chars d\u00e9passent le quai.\nD'ancr\u00e9s le droit fran\u00e7ais la responsabilit\u00e9 de la compagnie ne para\u00eet pas douteuse, car l'imprudence m\u00eame du voyageur n'excuse pas les torts du conducteur. Dalloz, Vo. Responsabilit\u00e9 no 510. Par tous ces motifs et pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par Sir Alexandre Lacoste, C.J., je suis d'avis que le jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow the appeal\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The case is in my opinion free from all doubt. I cannot see anything which can be pronounced to be negligence of the company. The accident is attributable wholly to the plaintiff's own default in alighting as he did. Every man travelling by rail in this country must have known that it was not the way he should have alighted or by which there was any necessity for his so alighting or was ever intended that he should alight.\nSEDGEWICK J. was also of opinion to allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Brown & Morris.\nSolicitors for respondent : Casgrain, Angers & Lavery.\n[1] L.R 5 HL 45\n[2] L.R. 4 Q.B. 379.\n[3] 4 ed. sec. 494.\n[4] 3 Bing. 319.\n[5] 8 Can.

J. and Founier, Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and King J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nOpposition afin de conserver on proceeds of a judgment for $1,129\u2014Amount in dispute\u2014Right to appeal\u2014R. S. G. c. 135, sec. 29.\nK. (plaintiff) contested an opposition afin de conserver for $240000 filed by L. on the proceeds of a sale of property upon the execution by K. against H. & Co. of a judgment obtained by K. against H. & Co. for $11129. The Superior Court dismissed L.'s opposition but on appeal the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) maintained the opposition and ordered that L. be collocated au marc la livre on the sum of $930 being the amount of the proceeds of the sale\nHeld, that the pecuniary interest of K. appealing from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) being under $2,000 the case was not appealable under R.S.C. c. 135 sec. 29. Gendron v. Mc Dougall (Cassels's Dig. 2 ed. 429) followed:\nHeld also, that sec. 3 of 54 & 55 Vic. c. 25 providing for an appeal where the amount demanded is $2,000 or over has no application to the present case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court which had rejected an opposition afin de conserver filed by the respondent. The appellant, Kinghorn, in this case obtained judgment at Quebec, for $1,125 against the executors of late Dame Patterson widow of late G. B. Hall. A writ of execution was issued to the Sheriff of the District of Quebec and a return of nulla bona made thereon A writ de terris was then issued to the Sheriff of the District of Three Rivers, upon which a large block of land, known as the St. Joseph Forge Lands, was seized and sold realizing a sum of $950.\nThe respondent having filed an opposition afin, de conserver for $24,000 claiming to be collocated on this sum of $930 au marc la livre, the appellant contested his opposition and the Superior Court maintained his contestation. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that Court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, and maintained the respondent's opposition, ordering that he be collocated au marc la livre on the sum of $950.\nThe respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nBelcoutt for motion cited and relied on Flail v. Ferland ([1]); Gendron v. Mc Dougall ([2]); Chagnon v. Normand ([3]).\nStuart Q. C. for appellant contended that the amount of the demand in the Superior Court being $24,000, the case was appealable under 54 & 55 Vic. c. 25 sec 4 and cited and relied also on Doutre v. Gosselin ([4]); Beaudry v. Desjardins ([5]); and art. 2311 R.S.Q.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J . This case is before the court on a motion by the respondent to quash the appeal taken by Kinghorn from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, in Montreal, dismissing his, Kinghorn's, contestation of an opposition afin de conserver for $24,000 filed by the respondent on the proceeds of a sale upon the execution by Kinghorn against Hall & Co., of a judgment by him obtained against the said Hall & Co., for $1,129, the judgment now appealed from, having maintained the said opposition for $24,000, and ordered that the respondent be collocated au marc la livre.\nThe \"proceeds of the sale amount to $930. I am of opinion that this appeal must be quashed, according to the well settled jurisprudence on this point, viz., that it is the interest of the party appealing from a judgment that has to be taken into consideration, to determine whether the case is appealable or not. Here the appellant's judgment is for $1,129, and to that amount and that amount alone, is he peculiarly interested in the present case The case of Gendron v. McDougall ([6]) is clearly in point. In that case, Gendron had obtained a judgment against one Ogden for $231, and in execution thereof seized an immovable worth $2,000. McDougall filed an opposition afin de distraire claiming the land so seized as his property. Gendron contested that opposition. The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed his contestation and maintained McDougal's opposition. Gendron then appealed to the Supreme Court, but, though the question at issue on McDougall's opposition was one of title to a piece of land, and that piece of land was worth $2,000, this Court quashed Gendron's appeal, on the ground that his pecuniary interest on his appeal was limited to $231, the amount of his judgment. That case, which is binding upon us, seems conclusive upon the question. The appellant invoked in support of his right to appeal the case of Mac Farlane v. Leclaire ([7]) but as I view that case it does not help him.\nThe facts of that case were as follows:\nLeclaire brought an action in the Superior Court against one Delesdeniers for \u20a4417.0.8 Canadian currency, with a saisie-arr\u00eat or attachment before judgment in the hands of MacFarlane. MacFarlane upon the saisie-arr\u00eat denied that he had any goods, effects, &c. of Delesderniers' in his possession, but that the property alleged to be the property of Delesdeniers had been purchased by him for \u00a31,642.14.5, from one Pr\u00e9vost and were his property. Leclaire, the plaintiff, contested this declaration and alleged that the sale invoked by MacFarlane was null and made in fraud of Delesderniers' creditors. The Superior Court dismissed the contestation on the declaration of the tiers-saisi, on the ground that as Pr\u00e9vost was not a party to the proceedings, the court could not declare the transfer of the property to the tiers-saisi, MacFarlane, by Pr\u00e9vost, to be fraudulent; the Court' of Queen's Bench on appeal reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, maintained the contestation by Leclaire of Macfarlane\u2019s declaration and declared the goods in Macfarlane\u2019s hands to have been those of Delesderniers.\nThe appellant, MacFarlane, being di3satisfied, applied for and leave was granted by the Court' of Queen's Bench to appeal to the Privy Council. Leclaire then applied by petition to the Privy Council to have the leave rescinded on the ground that the matter in dis-pute did not exceed the sum or value of \u00a3500 sterling, the amount fixed by 34 Geo. III.,c. 6, sec. 30, and there-fore that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was final. But the Privy Council dismissed that petition, and held that MacFarlane's pecuniary interest on the appeal being over \u00a3500 sterling, the case was appealable under the statute. Now it is evident that in that case all of MacFarlane's goods, amounting in value to \u00a31 60.0, were put in jeopardy by the judgment maintaining the contestation of his declaration as -every article of it might have been sold to satisfy Leclaire's writ of execution. And MacFarlane, in that case stood in the position that Larue the respondent occupies in. the present case, whilst Leclaire occupied a position analogous to the position Kinghorn, the present appellant occupies here. And their Lordships in the Privy Council clearly intimate, though of course without determining it, that, had the judgment in the case of MacFarlane v. Leclaire ([8]) been against Leclaire ne, Leclaire might not have had a right of appeal, because in such a case Leclaire's pecuniary interest on the appeal would not have amounted to \u00a3500 sterlings.\nIn a case of Gugy v. Gugy, as long ago as 1851 ([9]) under an analagous statute, Sir James Stuart laid down the rule that on a judgment dismissing an opposition for 610,000 filed by a defendant against an execution for \u00a3200 being the balance of a judgment against him for \u20a46900 the case was not appealable to the Privy Council. The case of L' Esp\u00e9rance v. Allard, in a foot note to that case of Gugy v. Gugy (2), is in the same sense. I refer also to Bourget v. Blanchard ([10]) and in appeall ([11]) and for the facts of the case ([12]). See also Champoux v. Lapierre ([13]); Martin v. Mills ([14]); Russell v. Graveleu ([15]) The statute 54 & 55 Vic. does not affect this case. This is not a case where the amount demanded and the amount granted are different.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitors for respondent : L. P.

Hall & Co\u2019s lumber mills and the establishment of a box factory.\nMessrs. Hall Neilson & Co. wrote to the city authorities, on 19th January, 1886, that being about to reconstruct their lumber mills at the Grandes Piles, influential citizens of Three Rivers had suggested to them the advantages to the working classes if the mills were removed to that city. That they Messrs. Hall Neilson & Co. also intended to establish a box factory in connection with their mill, which latter was specially adapted for providing the kind of lumber necessary for making boxes. That the operation of said mill and of said box factory would require the employment of at least 150 persons and could provide labour for at least 500 men and 125 horses during the winter season. That in order to realize these advantages, viz., the construction of the said saw-mills and box factory the said Hall Neilson & Co. would require assistance from the city of Three Rivers in the form of a cash bonus of $25,000 and exemption from taxation for 20 years.\nSome verbal communications passed between the city authorities and Messrs. Hall Neilson & Co. and on 22nd February, 1886, a letter of Messrs. Hall & Co. was laid before the City Council, accepting a verbal pro position which had been made by the city which Messrs. Hall & Co. repeated as follows:\nThe bonus to be $20,000 and the exemption from taxes 10 years, the property to be hypothecated to the city for a term of four years to the extent of said 23 $20,000, as a guarantee for the fulfilment of the two following conditions, viz.: That Messrs. Hall & Co. should, furnish employment during the four years to a sufficient number of employees to equal the work of 150 men during five months each year, and 2nd, the total value of the establishment and dependencies, when completed to be not less than $75,000. , Messrs. Hall & Co also undertook in addition to enter into a personal obligation to continue the establishment in operation for six additional years after the expiry of the four covered by the mortgage. Thereupon the Council by resolution unanimously accepted this proposal and undertook to pay the said bonus of $20,000 upon the conditions of that letter, and ordered a by-law to that effect to be prepared and submitted to the ratepayers.\nThese conditions are stated in the by-law as follows:\n1st. The establishment that the Messrs. Hall, Neilson & Co. are at present operating at the locality known as Grandes Piles on the River St. Maurice, consisting of saw-mills dryers, machinery, etc., to be transferred to, and rebuilt within the limits of the city of Three Rivers in a place on the south-west side of the River St Maurice and to be there put in operation between this date and the close of the summer of the present year, and further, within same delay and said limits, a box factory to he also constructed and put in operation; and the entire establishment when finished to be of a value equivalent to not less than seventy-five thousand dollars.\n2nd. During the course of the fifteen years following the operation of said establishment, the said establishment to be kept in operation for the space of four consecutive years from the beginning of said operation: One hundred and fifty people at least to be kept employed during the space of five months of each of the four years and at the terminaci\u00f3n of said four years said establishment to be continued in operation for at least six of the eleven following years and the number of people employed during said eleven years to be equivalent to the number of one hundred and fifty people during five months of the year, for the space of six years.\nThis by-law was afterward formally adopted by the Council and subsequently on the 31st March, 1886, by the electors. In fulfilment of their \"Dart of the contract Messrs. Hall, Neilson & Co. proceeded at once to acquire the necessary site within the limits of the city and removed to it their lumber mill from, the Grandees Piles and set them in operation in July of that year, 1886.\nThe box factory was completed on the 2nd November 1886 and the total cost of the whole establishment is proved to have exceeded $100,000.\nOn the 5th November, 1886, Messrs Hall, Neilson, & Co wrote to the city that; the conditions of the by-law on their part had been fulfilled entitling them to the payment of the bonus. The City Corporation paid over the $20,000 without protest or objection, receiving from Messrs. Hall & Co. the four years guarantee in the form of a mortgage. This bore date November 29th 1886.\nThe establishment continued in operation until October, 1889, when in consequence of a change in the United States tariff in reference to the admission of boxes Messrs. Hall & Co. were obliged to discontinue work. They had in the meantime given a second mortgage upon their Three Rivers property to the Banque du Peuple for advances. Financial difficulties followed the closing of the establishment and the property was afterwards sold at sheriff's sale. The city of Three Rivers claimed from the proceeds, by special privilege, the payment of three years arrears of taxes and two years water rates, amounting with interest to $2,555, and in addition the payment of the $20000 amount of their mortgage. The bank did not dispute the claim for special water rates but contested the claims E for taxes and also for any claim under the mortgage, on the ground that its conditions had been fulfilled, viz., that Hall & Co. had made the expenditure originally stipulated and had employed the equivalent of 150 men for five months of each of four years\nIrvine Q.C. for appellants.\nThe question on this appeal is whether the appellants are entitled to recover on their hypothecary guarantee that Messrs. Hall & Co. would keep in operation, for four consecutive years, 150 men employed during five months in each year at their mill establishment and box factory in the city of Three Rivers. The court below has held that they cannot on the ground that the Messrs. Hall & Co. have executed and fulfilled their obligations per equipollents. As the box factory was-not completed till November 2nd, 1886, and the whole establishment only began operations in October, 1889, I do not think it can be contended that there has been a specific performance of the conditions upon which the ratepayers voted the bonus and it is the conditions and obligations contained in the by-law itself and not in Messrs Hall, Neilson & Co. letters and petitions that Messrs Hall, Neilson & Co. accepted by their hypothecary guarantee in favour of the city. How it can be said that four years means four seasons and that operations commenced in November, 1886, would be equivalent to one season, I cannot understand.\nThen the object of the city being to have a number of men to settee in the town as citizens it cannot be said that it is equivalent to have 600 men employed during one year to 150 men during four consecutive years. Martel Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for respondent.\nThe main point to be decided according to our contention is whether the first season's operations, some of them prior to the execution of the mortgage and the payment of the bonus are to be reckoned as one of the four years during which Hall & Co. guaranteed the establishment should be in operation. If it is then there is ample evidence that more than 150 men were employed in Three Rivers in connection with the whole establishment during the season of 1886. Now as the box factory could not be in operation for five months during that season we have complied with that condition, per equipollents. See Simard v. Fortier ([1]). Moreover this is the interpretation put on the contract by the city for when on the 5th November, 1886, Messrs. Hall & Co., when the box factory was only \"just completed, wrote to the City Council that the conditions of the bylaw had been fulfilled and that they had paid wages to date for over 26200 days an excess over the contract requirement of 6,700 days, and that the cost of the establishment considerably exceeded their agreement in that respect, the council, who had daily seen the work progressing, paid over the bonus before the expiry of that month and did not collect any taxes for 1886. Nor did the council intimate any different view during the seasons of 1887 1888 and 1889. No taxes were imposed and no objection made in any form, either that the stipulated expenditure had not been made or that 150 men were not employed in the box factory.\nThe only claim the appellant could set up might be the personal one (cr\u00e9ancier chirographaire) as a creditor of Hall Neilson & Co. for a sum of $12000,00 in case the firm of Hall, Neilson & Co. or. their assigns neglected fulfilling the conditions of the by-law applying to the six years operation following the first four years; but that firm or its assigns have plenty of time left to yet fulfil these remaining conditions.\nBY THE COURT.\u2014The agreement upon which the $20,000 bonus was lent by the corporation. to the respondents is to be found in the by-law of the 3rd March, 1886, and in the mortgage dated the 26th November. 1886. It is apparent that the four consecutive years during which the establishment was to be kept in operation under the second condition of the said by-law, can only date from the month of November, 1886, when the box factory (an important part of the proposed establishment of Miessrs. Hall Neilson & Co.) was completed and put in operation and when the mortgage was granted on a completed establishment of the value of $75,000, and that the appellants had not in November, 1889, complied with the said second condition of the by-law, viz. the establishment to be kept in operation for the space of four consecutive years.\nFOURNIER, J. dissenting.\u2014Le trois mars 1886, apr\u00e8s certains proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pr\u00e9liminaires, la cite des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res adopta un r\u00e8glement municipal dans le pr\u00e9 ambule duquel il est dit que les messieurs Hall Nielson et Oie ont par leurs lettres du 25 janvier 1882 et du 22 f\u00e9vrier 1886 fait application au conseil de la ville des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res pour une aide ou bonus et une exemption de taxes municipales en faveur d'une manufacture de bo\u00eetes et attendu qu'il est avantageux\nd'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande des dits Hall Neilson et Cie et de leur accorder un bonus de $20,000 et une exemption de taxes sur la dite manufacture il est. en cons\u00e9quence ordonn\u00e9:\nSec. 1.

L'intim\u00e9e a lie contestation.\nLa seule question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si messieurs Hall, Neilson et Oie ont rempli leurs engament, Lo, la mise en op\u00e9ration pendant quatre ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives depuis la date de sa mis en op\u00e9ration, 2o, si pendant cc temps ils ont employ\u00e9 \u00e0 leur \u00e9tablissement an moins 150 personnes durant cinq mois chacune des dites ann\u00e9es?\nCe qui a fait la principale cause de la difficult\u00e9, c'est l'interpr\u00e9tation erron\u00e9e que l'appelante a donn\u00e9e aux r\u00e8glements. Se fondant sur le pr\u00e9ambule des regalements, elle pr\u00e9tend qu'il avait principalement pour but d'\u00e9tablir une manufacture de bolets et non pas un moulin \u00e0 scies pour faire concurrence \u00e0 ceux qui existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0.\nLa proposition de l'appelante, serait vraie si le r\u00e8glement consistait dans le pr\u00e9ambule seulement. On y voit en effet que messieurs Hall Neilson et Oie ont demand\u00e9 un bonus et une exemption de taxes en faveur d'une manufacture de boltes\nOn peut bien invoquer le pr\u00e9ambule d'un r\u00e8glement pour le faire servir \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de clauses obscures on douteuses, mais on ne peut pas plus le faire servir \u00e0 limiter l'effet des dispositions pr\u00e9cises du r\u00e8glement, qu'on ne pourrait \u00e9tendre les dispositions d'un statut en se fondant sur les consid\u00e9rants de son pr\u00e9ambule\nDans son factum devant cette cour l'appelante (p. 20) dit que Hall et Cie devront employer durant les quatre premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'op\u00e9ration de la manufac- ture de boltes, cent cinquante hommes. Elle s'exprime ainsi :\nMoreover the terms of the said by-law are clear and formal and We do not find. therein any mention of an equivalent as to the number of men which Messrs. Hall, Neilson & Co. should employ during each of the four first years in the operating of this box factory, and it is the conditions and obligations contained in the by-law itself and not in Messrs. Hall, Neilson & Company's letters and petitions, that Messrs. Hall, Neilson & Co. accepted by their hypothecary guarantee in favour of the appellants, dated the 29th November, 1886 (see page 27 and 28 of the case).\nLa m\u00eame mani\u00e8re de voir est exprim\u00e9e comme suit dans son factum du Banc de la Reine.\n\u201cComme on le voit, l'affaire principale, l'objet en vue pour toutes les parties \u00e9tait la cr\u00e9ation d'une industrie nouvelle l'\u00e9tablissement d'une manufacture de boites \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.\"\nCette mani\u00e8re de voir qui ferait de la manufacture de boites l'objet principal, et presque unique, du r\u00e8glement n'est pas soutenue par le paragraphe n\u00b0 1 du r\u00e8glement o\u00f9 il est dit que l'\u00e9tablissement que Hall et Cie exploite aux Grandes Piles, sur le St-Maurice consistant en moulin \u00e0 scie, s\u00e9choirs, machineries etc, defrost \u00e8lre transport\u00e9s et reb\u00e2tis dans la cite de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et mis en op\u00e9ration d'hui \u00e0 la fin de l'\u00e9t\u00e9; de plus il sera construit dans les m\u00eames limites et dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai une manufacture de boltes et tout r\u00e9tablissement une fois termin\u00e8 devra valoir au moins soixante et quinze mille piastres.\nLes avantages accord\u00e9s par le r\u00e8glement \u00e9taient donc tout aussi bien pour le transport des moulins des Grandes Piles \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, que pour la manufacture de baltes. Le r\u00e8glement ne fait aucune distinction quelconque entre les deux; mais au contraire ne les consid\u00e8re tous deux que comme un seul \u00e9tablissement, et tout l'\u00e9tablissement une fois termin\u00e8, dit le r\u00e8glement devra valoir au moins soixante et quinze mille piastres.\nLe r\u00e8glement ne fait non plus aucune distinction entre les moulins \u00e0 scies et la manufacture de bottes-quant au nombre d'hommes qui devront y \u00eatre employ\u00e9s. Au n\u00b0 2 du dit r\u00e8glement, il est dit que le dit \u00e9tablissement devra \u00eatre tenu en operation pendant au moins quatre ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives \u00e0 compter de sa mise en op\u00e9ration, et cent cinquante personnes au moins, devront y \u00eatre employ\u00e9es pendant l'espace de cinq mois par ann\u00e9e.\nil est \u00e9vident que le nombre d'hommes qui doivent \u00eatre employ\u00e9 est fix\u00e9 pour tout l'\u00e9tablissement, \u00e0 \u00eatre, sans doute distribu\u00e9s suivant le besoin des op\u00e9rations.\nIi est indubitable que l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9mise par l'appelante sur le r\u00e8glement est erron\u00e9e.\nLa preuve faite par l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive qu'elle a rempli la premi\u00e8re condition,. qui \u00e9tait que l'\u00e9tablissement devait \u00eatre mis en op\u00e9ration avant la fin de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 1886 et valoir au moins' $75,000. La preuve a \u00e9tabli ces deux faits de la mani\u00e8re la plus compl\u00e8te.\nQuant \u00e0 la seconde question, au sujet de la dur\u00e9e des op\u00e9rations et an nombre des personnes qui devaient \u00eatre employ\u00e9es chaque ann\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 \u00e9galement que l'\u00e9tablissement a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en op\u00e9ration au moins pendant cinq mois chaque ann\u00e9e, et pendant plus de vingt mois pour les quatre premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et que le nombre de personnes qui y out. \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es exc\u00e9dait celui fixe par le r\u00e8glement. 11 est vrai que cc nombre n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois dans la manufacture de baltes qui n'en pouvait pas contenir plus de trente, mais ce que l'intim\u00e9e affirme et a prouve c'est que ce nombre, et au del\u00e0, a \u00e9t\u00e9 employee dans tout l'\u00e9tablissement pendant le temps voulu-C'\u00e9tait suffisant de la part de messieurs Hall, Neilson et Cie pour remplir leurs obligations, et le r\u00e8glement n'exigeait rien de plus.\nApr\u00e8s un examen s\u00e9rieux de la preuve je me suis convaincu que les deux cours qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 prononc\u00e9 sur cette cause, en out fait une juste et correcte appr\u00e9ciation et que leur jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : L.

G Judicial admission Art. 1245 C. G. Art. 320 G.G.P.\nThe respondents having lent a sum of money to one Liborron, subsequently, on the 9th May, 1876, took a transfer of his property by a deed en dation de paiement, in which the registered title deed of Liboiron to the same was referred to and by which it also appeared that the appellants had a bailleurs de fonds claim on the property in question. Lib\u00f3iron remained in possession and sub-let part of the premises, collected the rents and continued to pay interest to the appellants for some years on the bailleurs de fonds claim. In 1887 the appellants took out an action en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que for the balance due on their bailleurs de fonds claim. The respondents pleaded that they had acquired in good faith the property by a translatory title, and had become freed of the hypothec by ten years possession. Art. 2251 C C.\nHeld, reversing the judgments of the courts below, that the oral and documentary evidence in the case as to the actual knowledge on the respondents' part of the existence of this registered hypo thec or bailleurs de fonds claim was sufficient to rebut the presumption of good faith when they purchased the property in 1876, and therefore they could not invoke the prescription of ten years. Art. 2251 C. C. Fournier J. dissenting.\nIn their declaration the appellants alleged that the respondents had been in possession of the property since 9th May, 1876, and after the enqu\u00eate they moved the court to amend the declaration by substituting for the 9th May, 1873, the words 1 1st Dec, 1886. \"The motion was refused by the Superior Court which held that the admission amounted to a judicial avowal from which they could not recede. On appeal to the Supreme Court it was\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court, below that the motion should have been allowed so as to make the allegation of possession conform with the facts as disclosed by the evidence. Art. 1245 C.C. Founder J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) rendered on the 23rd December last (1892) allowing the personal claim of $92.92 made by appellants, but affirming that portion of the judgment of the court below by which appellants' hypothecary action was dismissed.\nThis was an action en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que for $3544 being the balance due on the purchase price of the property known as lots 443 and part of lot 442 in the Parish of Montreal, secured by a bailleurs de fonds privilege. The action was brought by the appellants on the 26th January, 1887, as representatives of the estates of William Workman and Alexander Maurice Delisle, alleging that on the 2nd December, 1874, they sold the property to Leon Poiriaux and Pierre Demeule for $2,235, the purchasers agreeing to pay 22 235 in seven annual consecutive payments, the first of which was to be $320 and the last $315 the first to be made on the first day of November then next, and thereafter half yearly on the first days of May and November in each year with interest at seven per cent counting from the 11th November then next, the purchasers to keep the building insured for the vendors' benefit and also to pay to the vendors the sum of $60 towards the cost of a clarion: that to secure these terms and conditions the land was hypothecated by a bailleur de fonds privilege and the deed was registered on the 10th December 1874; that the said purchase price with interest, insurance, cost of said drain added, made a total of $4,216.00, and the balance due after crediting what had been received on account of said sale was $3,544 34, and that in addition thereto the appellants had paid and had a right to charge against the defendants a sum of $92.92 paid by appellants for taxes; that the defendants were in possession of the said immoveable property since the 9th May 1876, as proprietors thereof; that in consequence the said plaintiffs were well founded in bringing the pre sent action and demanding that the said property be declared hypothecated to them for the sum of $3544.34, inasmuch as the defendant refused to pay the same although thereunto lawfully required, and in asking that defendants be condemned to pay the said further sum of $92.92.\nThe respondents pleaded that they had acquired the immoveable in question in good faith by translatory title, to wit, by deed of sale from Liboiroa. on the 29th May 1876 and had become freed from the hypothec by ten years' possession thereunder By another plea they alleged that they did not owe personally the capital nor the interest of the price of sale, and that as to the items of account for insurance taxes and sixty dollars for a drain, they were prescribed, and further, had never been authorized or expended with the respondents' knowledge.\nNo answer was made to that plea. Issue was joined and by the oral and documentary evidence adduced, which is reviewed in the argument of counsel it appeared that M\u00e9ssrs. Poiriaux and Demeule on the 10th December, 1874, by deed registered 21st December, 1874 sold this property to Mr. Antoine Liboiron who assumed the obligations of the vendors towards (the representatives of) Workman and Delisle. Mr. Liboiron borrowed money from the respondents, and gave them a mortgage on the property as security, by notarial deed of date 6th February 1875; and on the 29th May 1876, before Marion notary he transferred this property to respondents by way of dation en paiement; and he also, by the same deed, ceded to the respondents the rents due and to become due on the property, including some eight tenements. They had previously instituted an action affaist Liboiron as tiers d\u00e9tenteur and there was evidence that the appellants had no direct knowledge of this deed. Liboiron remained in possession and continued for a time to pay out of the rents he received from sub-tenants the interest due to the appellants upon their bailleur de fonds claim.\nAfter the enqu\u00eate was closed the plaintiffs moved the court to be allowed to amend the allegation in their declaration that the defendants had been in possession of the property as proprietors since the 9th May, 1876, their declaration to accord with the proof by striking out the words \"9th May, 1876\" and by substituting therefor the words \" 1st December, 1886.\"\nThe Superior Court refused the motion and held that the judicial admission in the plaintiffs' declaration was complete proof against them as to the ten years' pos session, and that under their translatory title the respondents were entitled to plead prescription against the appellants' claim. Art. 2251 C. C. The Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) unanimously affirmed this judgment.\nThe question which arose on this appeal was whether the respondents had acquired the property in question in good faith under a translatory title duly registered on the 26th May, 1876, and were now in a position to prescribe the ownership thereof, and liberate themselves Of the claim of bailleur de fonds registered prior to the deed of acquisition of the 9th May, 1876.\nH. Abbott Q. C. for appellants:\nThe pleas raise, in the first place, the question of whether or not the respondents can set up against the appellants a ten years possession under a title; acquired in good faith. It appears from the evidence that Liboiron remained in possession of the property up to within a couple of years before the institution of the action. It also appears that during those years; say from 1876 to 1884, the rents were collected by him. In making this latter statement I must refer to the evidence of Mr. Christin, who states that during a part of the year 1876 and 1877 he collected certain rents for the Building Society. This evidence is not the best evidence that could be adduced of these payments, inasmuch as the receipt books of the society from which Mr. Christin said he refreshed his memory and made up his statement were not produced; and there is nothing to show whether the rental during those years was collected by special authority of Mr. Liboiron or not. There is moreover no evidence that there has been actual physical possession by the purchaser exclusive of that of the personal debtor. Stuart v. Bowman ([1]); Veillancourt v. Lessard ([2]).\nWe then have against the contention of good faith the fact that the respondents had a second mortgagee upon the property for money lent. There can be no doubt they had examined the titles, and must have been acquainted with the fact that the property was originally a part of the Workman and Delisle estates and had been alienated subject to a bailleur de fonds claim. The deed of transfer from Liboiron to them mentioned the deed of sale from Poiriaux and Demeule to him, and the date of its registration. Mr Marion, the notary of the Building Society, admits that he took notes of this deed of sale and that the titles were examined by the society's solicitor. Now this deed of sale makes express mention of the bailleur de fonds claim held by Messrs. Workman and D\u00eblisle, and by its terms the property is mortgaged to secure the payment. This shows actual knowledge on their part of the existence of the mortgage apart from the constructive knowledge to be presumed from the registration of the deeds, upon which appellants strongly rely. Carter v. Molson ([3]).\nWith this knowledge they took from Liboiron a transfer of the land in payment of the amount due by him. This transfer they did not avail themselves of for a period of years, during which term, instead of compelling Liboiron to pay over to them the rents and profits of the property, which they were entitled to take by the terms of their deed, they allowed him to remain in possession, he or the appellants paying the taxes, the insurance, the repairs, the cost of drains upon the property, and the Church cotisations, and during the greater part of the time, .Liboiron paying also the bailleur de fonds interest and instalments as far as he could. In addition to these facts we have the statement by Mr. Matthew and by Liboiron, that Mr. Brunei, the manager of the defendant company was aware of the existence of the mortgage.\nWhen this company took the deed of transfer from Liboiron it was making a bad debt. If the good faith existed, which the respondents pretend, why did they not during the period of ten years endeavour to realize upon that property in some way or another. No steps have been taken to do this, and no rental has come in, nor have the assessments been paid by them. Briefly, the condition of affairs is not consistent with the assumption that the respondents were bona fide owners of this property for value, and looked upon it as theirs and managed it. It is consistent with an assumption that having made a bad debt respondents took a transfer of the property for what it was worth, and knowing that it was not more than would pay off the bailleur de fonds claim, left it alone hoping to come in later if the property greatly increased in value. However, it was only necessary to constitute the respondents in bad faith to show knowledge on their part of the existence of the bailleur de fonds claim. Blain v. Vautrin ([4]). And this knowledge has been clearly shown as already pointed out.\nThe court below, however, confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court holding that there had been a possession in good faith for ten years. In doing so, the court seems to have gone entirely on the fact that the appellants, in their declaration, alleged that the respondents had been in possession as proprietors since the 9th May, 1876, and that this allegation constituted a judicial avowal from which the appellants could not recede. The court seems to have ignored the evidence of bad faith on the part of respondents shown by their knowledge of the appellants' hypothec. As to the allegation in the appellants' declaration with regard to possession it was never accepted or acted upon by the respondents, who went to proof in order to establish their possession Their own witnesses proved that they had not had a continuous uninterrupted possession for ten years, but only since December, 1886. The appellants thereupon moved, under art. 320 C.C.P. to amend their declaration so as to agree with the facts proved. This motion was refused by the court.\nThe appellants submit that they should have been allowed to amend their declaration in the manner specified. The allegation as made in the declaration was not intended to mean more than that the respondents had not had possession such as described in their deed of transfer, that is to say, the legal possession which the execution of such a deed gives to the transferee by the code. It was not intended thereby to allege that they had had actual physical possession of the property, as this certainly was not the case. Finding the court disposed to consider that this clause constituted an express admission as to physical possession from which they could not recede and the facts in evidence showing an actual possession of a much more limited extent, the appellants moved to be allowed to amend their pleadings to accord with the evidence and this they submit was then their right and should have been granted; otherwise their clients would be made to suffer by the putting of a too strained construction upon that allegation and the holding it, as did the court below, to be a judicial avowal. Even if this allegation were to be looked upon as a judicial avowal, it is submitted that the appellants had a right to revoke it or recede from it when it was found to be erroneous in fact ([5]) especially when it had not been accepted or availed of by the opposite party; Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises ([6]); Sirey ([7]); Dalloz ([8]); Pothier ([9]); Nouveau Denizart ([10]); Merlin Rep. ([11]); Toullier ([12]).\nLaflamme Q. C. and T. Fortin for respondents:\nThe only question which comes up upon the issues as joined, is whether the respondents have had possession of the property in question for more than ten years previous to the institution of this action and whether, as a consequence, the appellants' action is prescribed.\nThe courts below have found that the respondents' plea has been established and we submit that their judgment is correct. The law on the subject is contained m article 2251 of our Civil Code\nThe deed of the respondents is filed by both parties, the copy filed by the respondents bearing upon its face a certificate of registration. It is a translatory title, being a deed of sale.\nNow the appellants allege in the following words that the respondents have been in possession of said property as owners thereof, since the 9th of May, 1876, viz.:\n\" That the defendants are in possession of the said immovable property herein above described and have been since the 9th of May, 1876, as proprietors thereof.\"\nThis constitutes the best evidence that can be made. Indeed, it is sufficient of itself to support the plea of the respondents; it is a judicial admission, which forms complete proof against the party making it. Art. 1245 C. C.; Demolombe ([13]).\nAnd this admission is corroborated by the title deed filed by the appellants themselves.\nThe appellants realizing the position they had made to themselves by their allegations, moved the court to be allowed to amend their declaration by striking out the words \" 9th May, 1876,\" and substituting therefor, the words \"1st December, 1886.\"\nThis motion was presented after the trial and was submitted with the whole case. No error is alleged in the motion, no affidavit is filed in support of it; nothing but a bare application to amend. It is not even asked to reopen the enqu\u00eate in order to adduce more evidence or at least, to give the respondents the opportunity of adducing more.\nThe court below very properly found that the averments in the declaration constitute an admission in favour of the respondents on which they had relied and of which they could not be deprived; and the evidence on that point being insufficient it dismissed the motion. This was approved of by the Court of Appeals and seems to us indisputable law'.\nThe article just quoted says clearly that the admission cannot be revoked unless it is proved to have been made through an error of fact. Now here no such error is even alleged, still less proven.\nWith this allegation of the appellants, no evidence was necessary on behalf of the respondents. The possession is explicitly alleged, good faith is presumed by law, there is no allegation of bad faith; so that the respondents were not obliged to adduce any evidence whatever.\nNevertheless, whatever evidence is found in the record is we submit in their favour.\nAs to the question of good faith the learned counsel reviewed the evidence and cited and relied on Art. 2202, 2040, 2253 (J. C. Lepage v. Chartier ([14]); Primean v. Guerin ([15]); Kaigle v. Pierce ([16]); Aubry & Rau ([17]) and Troplong ([18]); and in addition contended that the question being mainly one of fact, the judgments should not be disturbed. Ryan v. Ryan ([19]).\nH. Abbott Q. C. in reply: Kaigle v. Pierce (3) relied on by respondents, has been virtually overruled by Blain v. Vautrin ([20]).\nBY THE COURT There was sufficient evidence of the knowledge by the respondents of the existence of the bailleur de fonds claim when they acquired the property in May, 1876, to constitute them in bad faith and therefore they could not invoke the prescription of ten years. See Blain v Vautrin (7). The motion to amend the plaintiffs declaration so as to make the allegation as to the possession of the property conform to the facts as disclosed by the evidence should have been allowed. Art. 1245 C. C\nFOURNIER, J. dissenting.\u2014L'action des appelants est en declaration d'hypoth\u00e8que accompagn\u00e9e d'une de mande de $92.92 pour taxes pay\u00e9es par les appelants \u00e0 l'acquit de l'intim\u00e9e. L'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e in loto par le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le 3 novembre 1890.\nEn appel la cour du Banc de la Reine a confirm\u00e9 cette partie du jugement renvoyant l'action hypoth\u00e9caire, et infirm\u00e9 l'autre partie du m\u00eame jugement qui avait aussi renvoy\u00e9 cette partie de l'action r\u00e9clamant $92.92 pour taxes pay\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acquit de l'intim\u00e9e.\n' Les appelants, comme repr\u00e9sentants de feu William Workman \u00e9t Alexandre Maurice Delisle, all\u00e8guent que ces derniers ont vendu \u00e0 L\u00e9on Poiriaux et Pierre Demeule l'immeuble d\u00e9crit en leur d\u00e9claration, pour la somme de $2,235, payable en sept versements annuels cons\u00e9cutifs, le premier devant \u00eatre de la somme de $320, et le dernier de celle de $315, en commen\u00e7ant le premier novembre prochain, et \u00e0 continuer tous les six mois, les premiers de mai et novembre de chaque ann\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de sept par cent. Pour s\u00fbret\u00e9 de ces paiements la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue fut hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e avec privil\u00e8ge de bailleur de fonds.\nLe dix d\u00e9cembre Poiriaux et Demeule vendirent le dit immeuble \u00e0 Antoine Liboiron, qui se chargea des obligations des vendeurs envers Workman et Delisle.\nLe 29 mai 1876, Liboiron vendit cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\nLes appelants all\u00e8guent sp\u00e9cialement que l'intim\u00e9e est en possession du dit immuble, comme propri\u00e9taires d'icelui, depuis le 9 mai 1876, et apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli la balance de leur r\u00e9clamation hypoth\u00e9caire \u00e0 la somme de $3,544.34, ils prennent les conclusions ordinaires de l'action hypoth\u00e9caire.\nLes appelants r\u00e9clamaient aussi personnellement la somme de $92.92 qui leur fut accord\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc de la Reine; comme il n'y a pas de contre-appel] \u00e0 cette cour \u00e0 ce sujet, le jugement quant \u00e0 cet item est chose jug\u00e9e entre los parties.\nL'intim\u00e9e a d'abord plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 cette action par une d\u00e9fense au fond en droit devenue inutile par suite de l'amendement \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration; et ensuite par un autre plaidoyer, all\u00e9guant sp\u00e9cialement qu'elle avait achet\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question de Antoine Liboiron, le 29 mai 1876, par acte authentique d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour, et que par une possession do plus de dix ans avant la date de l'action des appelants (26 janvier 1887), leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de la dite hypoth\u00e8que par l'effet de la prescription.\nIl n'y a pas eu de r\u00e9ponee \u00e0 ce plaidoyer.\nAinsi la seule question soulev\u00e9e par la contestation li\u00e9e entre Ies parties est de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a en la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question pendant plus de dix ans avant l'institution de l'action en cette cause et si l'action des appelants n'est pas en cons\u00e9quence prescrite.\nLes deux cours ont donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e.\nLa loi concernant la prescription de dix ans est l'article 2251 du Code Civil, qui d\u00e9clare: \" Celui qui acquiert do bonne foi et par titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, un immeuble corporel en prescrit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et se lib\u00e8re des servitudes, charges et hypoth\u00e8ques par une possession utile en vertu de ce titre pendant dix ans.\"\nArticle 2253. Il suffit que la bonne foi des tiers-acqu\u00e9reurs ait exist\u00e9 lors de l'acquisition, quand m\u00eame que leur possession utile n'aurait commenc\u00e9 que depuis\nAinsi les conditions pour acqu\u00e9rir la prescription de dix ans se r\u00e9duisent \u00e0 trois, 1\u00b0 l'acquisition de bonne foi par un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9; 2\u00b0 une possession utile en vertu de cc titre; 3Q cette possession doit durer dix ans.\nLes appelants n'ont pas r\u00e9pondu au plaidoyer des intim\u00e9s invoquant la prescription.\nL'acte d'acquisition de l'intim\u00e9e est produit par les deux parties; la copie produite par l'intim\u00e9e porte certificat de son enregistrement\u2014c'tst un acte de vente en dation en paiement par Liboiron pour demeurer quitte envers l'intim\u00e9e d'une certaine obligation qu'il avait consentie en sa faveur. Get acte est translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1592 Co. la dation en paiement n'est parfaite que par la d\u00e9livrance de la chose.\nLa preuve de la possession de l'immeuble en question est faite par les appelants eux-m\u00eames qui ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans leur d\u00e9claration dans les termes suivants: \" That the defendants are in possession of the said immovable property hereinbefore described and have been since the 9th of May, 1876, as proprietors thereof.\" La preuve resultant de cette admission est en outre corrobor\u00e9e par le titre d'acquisition de l'intim\u00e9 produit par les. appelants eux-m\u00eames.\nCette admission constitue la preuve la plus compl\u00e8te qui peut \u00eatre faite de la possession de l'intim\u00e9, et elle suffit \u00e0 elle seule pour prouver le plaidoyer de l'intim\u00e9 C'est un aveu judiciaire qui, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 1245 C. C, fait pleine foi contre celui qui l'a fait. Larticle ajoute qu'il ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'on ne prouve qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 la suite d'une erreur de fait.\nLes appelants s'\u00e9tant aper\u00e7u que par cette admission ils avaient dispens\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 de faire preuve de sa possession cherch\u00e8rent \u00e0 se tirer de la fausse position dans laquelle ils s'\u00e9taient places en faisant motion pour amender leur d\u00e9claration en retranchant les mots \" 9th May 1876, \" pour y substituer les mots \"1st December, 1886. \"\nCette motion faite apr\u00e8s l'enqu\u00eate fut plaid\u00e9e eu m\u00eame temps que le m\u00e9rite de la cause. Il n'est pas m\u00eame all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il y a eu erreur et aucun affidavit n'est produit \u00e0 son soutien. Il n'y a que la simple demande d'amender, sans m\u00eame une demande de rouvrir l'enqu\u00eate pour produire de nouvelles preuves, ou du moins pour donner occasion \u00e0 i'intim\u00e9e de faire la preuve dont elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dispens\u00e9e par l'aveu des appelants.\nCette motion fut renvoy\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel. . C'est \u00e9videmment conforme \u00e0 l'article 1245 C. C. qui d\u00e9clare que l'aveu ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouv\u00e9 qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par suite d'une erreur de fait. Loin d'en avoir tent\u00e9 la preuve l'erreur de fait n'a pas m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 allegu\u00e9e. Les appelants ne s'\u00e9tant pas conform\u00e9s \u00e0 la condition de l'article 1245 C. C., qui exige la preuve de l'erreur, la permission de r\u00e9voquer leur erreur devait \u00eatre refus\u00e9e\nSi les appelants n'eussent pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'ind\u00e9pendamment de leur aveu il y avait an dossier une preuve suffisante de la possession de l'intim\u00e9e, ils n'auraient pas n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d'invoquer un moyen plus s\u00fbr et plus facile de se d\u00e9barrasser des cons\u00e9quences de l'aveu en ayant recours an d\u00e9saveu de leurs procureurs. En effet ceux-ci n'avaient pas mission de faire des aveux ces actes \u00e9tant exclus de leur mandat, mais cependant les appelants \u00e9taient tenus de les d\u00e9savouer, pour emp\u00eacher que leur silence ne fut pris pour une ratification. Ce moyen est indiqu\u00e9 par Toullier ([21]), Il pouvait sans doute r\u00e9voquer l'aveu indiscret fait par son mandataire, ou du moins en an\u00e9antir les effets et les cons\u00e9quences en prouvant que l'aveu est la suite d'une erreur; mais il n'est point oblig\u00e9 de suivre cette marche, qui le charge du fardeau d'une preuve souvent difficile. La loi lui en indique une plus simple et qui rejette la preuve sur l'adversaire, celle du d\u00e9saveu, fond\u00e9 sur ce qu'il n'a point autoris\u00e9 l'aveu. dont il se plaint. Il n'a dans ce cas aucune preuve \u00e0 faire; c'est au procureur d\u00e9savou\u00e9e dont la conduite est inculp\u00e9e, on \u00e0 l'adversaire qui vent en tirer avantage, de prouver que le d\u00e9saveu est mal fond\u00e9.\nLa marche \u00e0 suivre dans ce cas est trac\u00e9e par le code de proc\u00e9dure, par les articles 1.92 jusqu'\u00e0 199, inclusivement. L'article 1166 donne le droit de faire cette proc\u00e9dure m\u00eame en appel,\nL'aveu au sujet de la possession rendait inutile toute preuve de la part de l'intim\u00e9e. Cependant celle que l'on trouve dans le dossier est en sa faveur.\nIl est prouv\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a pris possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question le jour m\u00eame de l'acte d\u00e9 vente, vingt-neuf mai 1876, ainsi qu\u2019elle y \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par la clause suivante de son titre;\nPour du dit terrain et d\u00e9pendances jouir, user, faire et disposer par la dite acqu\u00e9reur, ses successeurs et ayant cause, en toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes, et en prendre possession imm\u00e9diatement.\nLe m\u00eame jour, 29 mai 1876, l'intim\u00e9e loua un des logements de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Liboiron, l'ancien propri\u00e9taire, qui paya loyer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 pendant quelque temps et fut ensuite \u00e9vinc\u00e9e pour d\u00e9faut de paiement.\nBien que le bail \u00e0 loyer consenti \u00e0 Liboiron par l'intim\u00e9e n'ait Pu \u00eatre produit, il n'est pas moins l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9 qu'il y en a eu un qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9. Le notaire Marion qui l'avait pass\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 requis d'en produire une copie en fit la recherche dans ses minutes et ne put la trouver, la dite minute ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue. Mais il se souvient parfaitement d'avoir pass\u00e9 le dit bail qui est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement entr\u00e9 dans son r\u00e9pertoire. Cette preuve est corrobor\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moignage do Christin qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 comme collecteur pour les loyers dus par les locataires de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui d\u00e9clare positivement qu'il \u00e0 retire le loyer d\u00fb par Liboiron comme un des locataires. Ce t\u00e9moignage positif est confirm\u00e9 par un \u00e9tat (p. 15 du dossier) produit par Christin des collections qu'il a faites et dans lequel on voit que Liboiron ne lui a pas ] fait moins de six paiements de loyer.\nApr\u00e8s que Christin e\u00fbt laiss\u00e9 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9, Liboiron parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 collecter les loyers des autres locataires. Cette autorisation fut ensuite r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e ainsi quo le dit Marion, p. 40 du dossier. Liboiron ne payant pas son loyer, fut \u00e9vinc\u00e9. C'est sans doute pour ce motif que dans son t\u00e9moignage il s'est montr\u00e9 si hostile \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Il va m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 dire qu'il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9-Ii va m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 dire qu'il n'a jamais vendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e e qu'il n'en a jamais lou\u00e9 une partie de l'intim\u00e9e et qu'il a toujours collect\u00e9 les loyers pour lui-m\u00eame et en son nom. Son ressentiment l'a emport\u00e9 \u00e0 dire toutes ces choses qui sont toutes absolument fausses et contredites par la preuve. Certainement qu'il jure faux, lorsque en face de son acte do vente il ose dire qu'il n'a jamais vendu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'il n'en a jamais lou\u00e9 une partie, lorsque l'existence du bail qui lui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait est parfaitement prouv\u00e9e et que le paiement du loyer de la partie lou\u00e9e est si positivement prouv\u00e9 par Christin, auquel il a fait au moins six paiements do son loyer. Il nie aussi avoir re\u00e7u avis do cesser do faire la collection des loyers, lorsque ce fait est si positivement prouv\u00e9 par le notaire Marion.\nToutes ces contradictions sont \u00e9videmment do nature \u00e0 rendre le t\u00e9moin tout \u00e0 fait indigne de foi lorsqu'il dit quo l'intim\u00e9e savait qu'il y avait une hypoth\u00e8que en faveur de Workman et Delisle. La question suivante lui est faite \u00e0 Ce sujet:\nQ. Quand vous avez donn\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction est-ce que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sati\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le temps qu'il v avait une hypoth\u00e8que en faveur de la succession Workman & Delisle ?\nR. Comme de raison qu'elle le savait.\nQ. Est-ce que \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans le temps ?\nR. \u00c7a ne faisait pas plus que sept a huit jours que j'avais achet\u00e9s de Monsieur Demeule; par exemple l'argent retournait \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nQ. Mais quand vous avez emprunt\u00e9 de l'argent de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 savait dans le temps qu'il y avait cette hypoth\u00e8que ?\n(Object\u00e9 \u00e0 cette question comme suggestive. Objection r\u00e9serv\u00e9e.)\nR. Oui, c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que.\nEn se bornant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre seulement comme de raison qu'elle le savait il est \u00e9vident qu'il n'en savait rien lui-m\u00eame, et que sa r\u00e9ponse n'est bas\u00e9e que sur une supposition et non sur un fait positif. Ceci est confirm\u00e9 par une autre r\u00e9ponse \u00e9vasive qu'il donne \u00e0 la question suivante: \" Est-ce que \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le temps ? \" En se contentant de dire qu'il n'y avait pas plus de sept \u00e0 huit jours qu'il avait achet\u00e9, au lieu de dire si oui ou non la chose avait \u00e9t\u00e9 alors mentionn\u00e9e, il est \u00e9vident qu'il a voulu \u00e9viter de dire une fausset\u00e9 de plus et qu'il craignait de trop s'avancer en donnant un detall qui pourrait \u00eatre contredit.\nDans ses transquestions sur le m\u00eame sujet, il finit par avouer qu'il n'a pas dit \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il y avait une hypoth\u00e8que, voici ce qu'il dit:\nQ. Comment avez.-vous dit cela \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il y avait une hypoth\u00e8que; \u00e0 quel propos leur avez-vous dit cela ? Avez-vous dit, d'abord, \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il y avait une hypoth\u00e8que.\nR. Quand une personne ach\u00e8te une terre \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit, une place, je suppose que le fonds Se trouve la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que.\nQ. Alors, ils ont dl le comprendre ?\nR. Bien\nQ. Mais vous ne leur avez pas dit cela ?\nR. Je ne leur ai pas dit.\nQ. Ils ont d\u00fb le voir ?\nR.\nEt le d\u00e9posant ne dit rien de plus. En affirmant le fait que l'intim\u00e9e connaissait l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que des appelants on voit \u00e9videmment que ce n'est qu'une pure supposition de la part de Liboiron. \" Quand une personne ach\u00e8te, dit-il, une terre \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit, une place, je suppose que le fonds se trouve la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que,\" Apr\u00e8s avoir h\u00e9sit\u00e9 il finit par avouer qu'il n'a pas parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (l'inti m\u00e9e) de l'hypoth\u00e8que de Workman et Delisle.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de toutes ces contradictions que le fait qui e\u00fbt pu avoir de li importance sun le sort de la cause comme tendant \u00e0 prouver que l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas de bonne foi dans sa possession, n'est nullement prouv\u00e9. Ce t\u00e9moignage n'a pas contredit la preuve de possession faite par les autres t\u00e9moins, Marion, Christin, etc.\nComme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, et ainsi qu'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par le dossier, les appelants n'ont fait aucune r\u00e9ponde au plaidoyer de prescription, de sorte que toute la preuve qui peut \u00eatre faite pour \u00e9tablir la mauvaise foi de la part de l'intim\u00e9e est tout \u00e0 fait ill\u00e9gale parce qu'iI n'y a aucune all\u00e9gation \u00e0 laquelle on puisse l'appliquer. Et il serait contraire \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e9gl\u00e9s de la proc\u00e9dure de prendre en consid\u00e9ration une preuve ainsi faite, suntout lorsque la partie adverse: n\u2019a pas en l'occasion de faire une contre-\u00e9preuve. Si la mauvaise foi on l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9es, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait alors en l'occasion de prouver sa bonne foi et la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de sa possession.\nMalgr\u00e9 l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette preuve, les appelants ont produit trois t\u00e9moins pour prouver que l\u2019intim\u00e9e conne naissait l'existence de la r\u00e9clamation des appelants. Ce sont les t\u00e9moins Matthews, Baker, l'un des appelants, et Liboiron. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 plus haut du t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier, et fait voir qu'il est impossible d'y ajouter aucune foi. On a vu aussi qu'il avait fini par r\u00e9tractent le fait qu'il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que des appelants et que son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point se r\u00e9duit absolument \u00e0 rien.\nLe t\u00e9moin Matthews dit d'abord qu'en 1878 il a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Brunet. secr\u00e9taire de l'intim\u00e9e, un \u00e9tat de la r\u00e9clamation des appelants an sujet de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais ensuite il reconna\u00eet que ce n'est qu'en 1884 ou 1885 qu'il a vu Brunet \u00e0 ce sujet pour la premi\u00e8re fois.\nBaker, l'un des appelants qui, comme l'un des de mandeurs dans la cause, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre l\u00e9galement t\u00e9moin en sa faveur, commence aussi par dire qu'en 1878, apr\u00e8s la mort de Workman, \" en examinant les affaires \" on a d\u00e9couvert que l'intim\u00e9e avait sur la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e8que post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la leur et qu'il leur proposa de leur c\u00e9der l'hypoth\u00e8que de Workman et Delisle. Mais plus loin dans son t\u00e9moignage il ajoute que ceci se passait en 1889.\nSi cette hypoth\u00e8que existait pourquoi n'a-t-elle pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9e. Rien n'emp\u00eachait les appelants de produire une copie authentique de leur acte d'obligation. D'apr\u00e8s la loi de Qu\u00e9bec toutes les hy poth\u00e8ques sont en forme authentique\u2014et la seule mani\u00e8re l\u00e9gale d'en faire preuve est d'en produire une copie,\u2014ce qu'ils n'ont pas fait\nD'apr\u00e8s Matthews ce serait en 1884 on 5 qu'il avait produit \u00e0 Brunet un compte de la r\u00e9clamation des appelants, c'est-\u00e0-dire sept on huit ans apr\u00e8s la date de leur acte d'acquisition et d'apr\u00e8s Baker lui-m\u00eame ce ne serait que beaucoup plus tard, en 1889, qu'il avait propose \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'acqu\u00e9rir leur hypoth\u00e8que. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait alors propri\u00e9taire depuis le 29 mai 1876, c'est-\u00e0-dire depuis au moins onze \u00e0 douze ans.\nVoil\u00e0 toute la preuve offerte par les appelants, pour prouver la mauvaise foi de l'intim\u00e9e. Ils ont failli de la mani\u00e8re la plus compl\u00e8te de faire aucune preuve que 1 intim\u00e9e avait connaissance de la r\u00e9clamation des appelants lorsqu'elle a fait en 1876 l'acquisition de. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nAu soutien de cette preuve aussi insuffisante qu'ill\u00e9gale, les appelants ont invoqu\u00e9 la cause de carter v. Molson, pour \u00e9tablir la mauvaise for contre l'intim\u00e9e ([22]).\nMais la question d\u00e9cid\u00e9e dans cette cause est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente de celle dont il s'agit ici Dans celle-l\u00e0 il s'agissait de la validit\u00e9 du titre de Molson \u00e0 la \"propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur laquelle il avait donn\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier Carter Dans l'hypoth\u00e8que il v avait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 tous ses titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et sp\u00e9cialement au testament de feu l'honorable John Molson, son pr\u00e9. Ce dernier par son testament avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 en faveur de la femme et des enfants de son fils une substitution avec clause d'insaisissabilit\u00e9 et d\u00e9fense d'ali\u00e9ner et hypoth\u00e9quer les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient donn\u00e9es pour les aliments et le soutien de la famille\nLe partage des biens avait pris la forme d'une vente dans laquelle on avait vendu, on plut\u00f4t donn\u00e9 en partage \u00e0 Molson, sous la forme d'une vente, des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s au montant de sa part dans l'h\u00e9ritage. Mais ce n'\u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu'un partage des biens sujets \u00e0 la substitution. En r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux titres cit\u00e9s dans son hypoth\u00e8que Carter se serait de suite aper\u00e7u que Molson n'\u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire que sous la charge de substitution et que son titre lui faisait d\u00e9fense de l'ali\u00e9ner on hypoth\u00e9quer les biens substitu\u00e9s. Le Conseil Prive a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Carter dans ces circonstances devait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme ayant en une connaissance compl\u00e8te que le testament avait \u00e9tabli une substitution en faveur de la femme et des enfants\nDans l'acte d'acquisition de l'intim\u00e9e, il est vrai qu'il est fait mention du titre de Liboiron mais cette vente \u00e9tait faite express\u00e9ment, comme il est dit dans l'acte, sans aucune reserve par le dit vendeur pour l'avoir acquis de Leon Poiriaux et Pierre Demeule. Cette vente \u00e9tait faite sans autre mention que la date du titre du vendeur et n'obligeait nullement l'acheteur, d'apr\u00e8s le Droit fran\u00e7ais, de faire la recherche des hypo th\u00e9ques qui pouvaient exister sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il lui suffisait pour les fins de la prescription dun titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et son acte de vente en \u00e9tait un \u00e9videmment.\nDans la cause de Molson v. Carter ([23]) il ne s'agissait pas d'une vente, mais d'une hypoth\u00e8que donn\u00e9e par Molson, accept\u00e9e par Carter, sur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui n'appartenaient pas \u00e0 son d\u00e9biteur, mais qui \u00e9taient, au contraire, par le testament de feu John Molson, la pro pi\u00e9t\u00e9 de la femme et de la famille de Molson. Le cr\u00e9ancier Carter par la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 tous les titres ,cit\u00e9s dans l'acte constituant son hypoth\u00e8que et, entre autres, au testament, pouvait facilement s'assurer que son d\u00e9biteur n'\u00e9tait pas le propri\u00e9taire des immeubles hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s. L'examen du testament l'aurait convaincu du fait.\nDans le cas actuel l'acte de vente \u00e9tait fait sans r\u00e9serve et n'obligeait pas l'acheteur \u00e0 faire des recherches pour s'assurer de l'existence d'hypoth\u00e8ques sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait garanti par son acte de vente.\nDans la cause de Molson v. Carter, (1) il s'agissait de savoir si les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9es par le d\u00e9biteur Molson lui appartenaient ou n'\u00e9taient pas plut\u00f4t substitu\u00e9es en faveur de sa femme et de ses enfants.\nDans celle-ci, il ne s'agit que de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e a un titre suffisant pour invoquer la prescription.\nCette d\u00e9cision est \u00e9videmment inapplicable \u00e0 la question de prescription qui se pr\u00e9sente ici, et ne peut contrabalancear l'effet des d\u00e9cisions de nos cours et les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s. En l'absence de toute preuve pour \u00e9tablir la connaissance par l'intim\u00e9e de l'hypoth\u00e8que des appelants an moment de son acquisition, il est impossible de mettre en doute sa bonne foi i et sa position comme acqu\u00e9reur de bonne foi, lui permet d invoquer la prescription de dix ans. La connaissance qu'elle a eu plus tard de l'existence de cette hypoth\u00e8que ne la constitue pas en mauvaise foi et ne pent l'emp\u00eacher de plaider prescription. Ceci est conforme \u00e0 l'art. 2253, qui d\u00e9clare:\nIl suffit que la bonne for des tiers acqu\u00e9reurs ait exist\u00e9 lors de l'acquisition, quand m\u00eame leur possession utile n'aurait commenc\u00e9 que depuis.\nL'article 2202, indiqu\u00e9 dans notre code comme droit nouveau, dit que l la bonne foi se pr\u00e9sume toujours. \" C'est \u00e0 celui qui all\u00e8gue la mauvaise foi \u00e0 la prouver.\" D'apr\u00e8s cet article, pour avoir droit de prouver la mauvaise foi il faut l'avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par\u00e9e qu'elle ne se pr\u00e9sume jamais. Les appelants n'ont donc pas droit d'en fournir la preuve puisqu'ils ne l'ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\nL'hypoth\u00e8que de Workman et Delisle n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans le titre de l'intim\u00e9e, on ne peut dire que l'intim\u00e9e a d\u00fb en avoir connaissance. Ceci eat conforme \u00e0 l'opinion de Troplong, Commentaires des privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques ([24]), o il dit:\nSi l'hypoth\u00e8que n'a pas 4te d\u00e9clar\u00e9e, on peut dire pour soutenir qu'il y a mauvaise foi, que le tiers-acqu\u00e9reur a d\u00fb en avoir eu connaissance par l'inscription, car il est peu probable qu'un individu se d\u00e9cide \u00e0 acheter un bien sans s'assurer pr\u00e9alablement des hypoth\u00e8ques qui le gr\u00e8vent.\nMais il faut r\u00e9pondre que la bonne foi se suppose toujours, et que pour \u00e9tablir qu'il y a mauvaise foi, le cr\u00e9ancier devait prouver que le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur a eu connaissance des inscriptions au moment de l'acquisition.\nJe die au moment de l'acquisition, car une connaissance post\u00e9rieure ne pourrait nuire. Arr\u00eat de Case. du 26 ao\u00fbt 1825 ([25]).\nIl ajoute au num\u00e9ro 880. 2\u00b0 11: Mais si le cr\u00e9ancier vient a prouver que lacqu\u00e9reur a eu connaissance positive de l'hypoth\u00e8que Iors de l'acquisition, je crois qu'alors la bonne foi manquera dans le cours de sa possession.\nMais au num\u00e9ro suivant, 881, il reconna\u00eet cependant que ce n'est pas l'opinion de Rousseau, de Lacombe, de Oatelan de Grenier, de Delvincourt.\nMais notre code dont les dispositions sur le sujet de la prescription sont plus positives que celles du code Napol\u00e9on dit qu'il suffit (art. 2253) que la bonne foi des tiers-acqu\u00e9reurs ait exist\u00e9 lors de leur acquisition. Voir \u00e0 ce sujet l'opinion de Zachariae, de Grenier, de Persil et de Delvincourt, Battur n\u00b0 772, Carrier n\u00b0 299, de Duranton n\u00b0 315. Les opinions de ces diff\u00e9rents auteurs sont cit\u00e9es dans le m\u00eame vol. de Troplong, dans les notes.\nCette doctrine est aussi celle d .Aubry et Rau ([26]), o\u00f9 il est dit:\nLa bonne foi n'est exig\u00e9e qu'au moment de l'acquisition, c'est-\u00e0-dire lorsqu'il s'agit d'une transmission op\u00e9r\u00e9e par acte entre-vifs, au moment de la conclusion de la convention translative de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et en mati\u00e8re de legs au moment ou le l\u00e9gataire a manifest\u00e9 l'intention d'accepter le legs. La connaissance que le possesseur obtiendrait ult\u00e9rieurement des droits du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire ne forme aucun obstacle a 1 inscription Art. 2269.\nNos cours se sont constamment conform\u00e9es \u00e0 ce principe, comme on peut le voir par les d\u00e9cisions suivantes: primeau v. Gu\u00e9vin, ([27]) o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9\u2014\nQue pour prescrire par dix ans et faire les fruits siens, il suffit que le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi au moment de son acquisition; la connaissance des vices de son titre ou de celui de son auteur survenue au tiers-d\u00e9tenteur depuis son acquisition, ne peut vicier sa possession. Art. 2283.\nDans la cause de Lepage v. Chartier', ([28]) il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour de R\u00e9vision, entre autres questions,s\nQue pour prescrire par dix ans et faire les fruits siens, il suffit que le tiers. Acqu\u00e9reur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi au moment de son acquisition; la connasssance des vices de son titre ou de celui de son auteur survenue au tiers-d\u00e9tenteur depuis son acquisition ne peut vicier sa possession.\nJe ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de citer le paragraphe suivant du jugement de feu l'honorable juge Loranger, car il me semble r\u00e9sumer parfaitement la doctrine de notre droit au sujet de la bonne foi eu mati\u00e8re de prescription. Les arguments sont d'une application si \u00e9vidente au pr\u00e9sent litige qu'on le dirait \u00e9crit pour cette cause ([29]):,\nEn mati\u00e8re de possession, quelle est l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle doit remonter la bonne foi du possesseur ? En quel temps doit-il avoir connu l'emp\u00eachement pour \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9 en mauvaise foi i\nS'il \u00e9tait de bonne foi lors de son acquisition et qu'il n'ait connu les vices de son titre que plus tard cette connaissance fait-elle obstacle \u00e0 sa possession, et \u00e0 la prescription qui est fond\u00e9e sur elle 1\nL\u0141 principe en mati\u00e8re de bonne ou mauvaise foi est que c'est \u00e0 celui qui all\u00e8gue la mauvaise foi \u00e0 la prouver. Tel est le sens textuel du second paragraphe de l'article 2202 du code civil du Bas-Canada, emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 notre ancien droit, et de l'article 2268 du code Napol\u00e9on, qui porte que la bonne foi est toujours pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, et que c'est \u00e0 celui qui all\u00e8gue la mauvaise foi \u00e0 la prouver L'article 2253 de notre code ajoute: Il suffit que la bonne foi des tiers-acqu\u00e9reurs alt exist\u00e9 lors de l'acquisition, quand m\u00eame leur possession utile n'aurait commenc\u00e9 que depuis.\nL'article 2269 du code Napol\u00e9on porte: Il suffit que la bonne foi ait exist\u00e9 au moment de l'acquisition.\nQue peut-il y avoir de plus clair pour d\u00e9montrer que la connaissance survenue au tiers-d\u00e9tnnteur post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 ion acquisition avant ou pendant la possession utile ne peut vicier sa possession s'il l'ignorait quand il a acquis les vices de son titre ou de celui de son auteur. Et tel est le cas du d\u00e9fendeur C'\u00e9tait aux demandeurs \u00e0 prouver sa mauvaise foi, sa bonne foi \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, et hormis qu'ils prouvent qu'au moment de son acquisition le d\u00e9fendeur connaissait l'existence du douaire et l'imperfection du titre de son auteur, ce qu'ils ont failli d'\u00e9tablir, ils n'ont point repouss\u00e9 son plaidoyer de prescription contre l'action de Domitilde Lepage.\nCe principe a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu par ha cour du Banc de ha Reine dans la cause de Kaigle v. Pierce. ([30]). Cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ha connaissance par he donateurd'une hypoth\u00e8que sur ha propri\u00e9t\u00e9 acquise, au temps del'acquisition ne le constituait pas en mauvaise foi et qu'il pouvait invoquer la prescription de dix ans. Cette question de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 savamment disent\u00e9e connue on peut s'en convaincre par la lecture des nombreuses autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans le rapport Troplong, au n\u00b0 660, dit:\" La bonne foi existe quand m\u00eame le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur aurait su que le prix \u00e9tait d\u00fb, car il a pu l\u00e9gitimement penser que le vendeur originaire serait pay\u00e9 par son acqu\u00e9reur direct.' Duranton, ([31]) dit la m\u00eame chose en ces termes:\nLe sous-acqu\u00e9reur peut opposer la prescription de dix ou vingt ans \u00e0 l'action en r\u00e9solution, s'il y a juste titre; et la connaissance qu'il aurait au temps de la vente, que son vendeur doit encore tout on partie du prix, ne le constituerait pas en mauvaise for, \u00e0 l'effet de l\u2019emp\u00eacher d invoquer cette esp\u00e8ce de prescription.\nLa doctrine contenue dans ces deux derni\u00e8res autorit\u00e9s est adopt\u00e9e par feu l'honorable juge Caron, qui s'exprime en ces termes : \" Cette doctrine est confirm\u00e9e par les auteurs cit\u00e9s au factum.\"\nCes autorit\u00e9s vont peut-\u00eatre un peu plus loin qu'il ne faut pour les besoins de cette cause. Il suffit, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, d'\u00e9tablir que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait, au temps de son acquisition, aucune connaissance de l'hypoth\u00e8que des appelants pour avoir le droit de plaider la prescription de dix ans.\nDans la cause de Blain v. Vautrin ([32]), la cour du Bane de la Reine semble, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 au contraire que la connaianance de l'hypoth\u00e8que constituait le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur en mauvaise foi. La raison de cette diff\u00e9rence d'opinions est fond\u00e9e sur la diff\u00e9rence des faits. Dans la cause de Kaigle v. Pierce ([33]), la donation avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 franche et quitte de toutes r\u00e9clamations quelconques tandis que dans celle de Blain v. Vautrin (2) l'hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait formelle\" ment mentionn\u00e9e dans le titre d'acquisition.\nAussi, l'honorable juge qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement termine ses remarques sur ces deux causes en disant: Je ne veux pas dire. N\u00e9anmoins, que je ne suivais pas la jurispmdence \u00e9tablie par le jugement de la Cour d'Appll in r\u00e9 Pierce v. Kaigle ([34]), si ce cas \u00e9tait parfaitement analogue, mais ici il y a dans l'acte d'acquisition du possesseur la reconnaissance formelle de l'hypoth\u00e8que.\nOn voit par Ces diff\u00e9rentes decisions que la doctrine est bien \u00e9tablie que pour prescrire par dix ans, il suffit que le tiers-acqu\u00e9reur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi au moment de son acquisition. L'existence d'hypoth\u00e8ques enregistr\u00e9es, dont il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que l'acheteur a eu connaissance au moment de son acquisition, ne d\u00e9truit pas sa bonne foi. S'il en \u00e9tait autrement, l'article 2251, au sujet de la prescription, se trouverait sans effet\u2014et, contrairement au principe que la prescription court au profit de l'acheteur \u00e0 partir du jour m\u00eame de l'entr\u00e9e en possession utile, elle serait suspendue par un moyen que la loi n'indique point.\nLes causes qui peuvent interrompre la prescription sont mentionn\u00e9es aux articles 2222, 2223 C.C. et sui vants.\nL'acte d'acquisition de l'intim\u00e9e ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s sa possession, les appelants se trouvaient inform\u00e9s du chanorement de propri\u00e9taire et pouvaient emp\u00eacher la prescription le courir au profit du nouvel acqu\u00e9reur, en prenant le moyen indiqu\u00e9 par l'article 2224, d'une demande en justice.\nIl est prouv\u00e9 que les appelants ont eu connaissance de la vente faite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e plusieurs ann\u00e9es avant l'expiration du terme de la prescription. Ils auraient pu s'ils l'eussent voulu, emp\u00eacher la prescription d'\u00eatre acquise en prenant une action ou d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que contre l'intim\u00e9e. S'ils en souffrent aujourd'hui, la faute en est \u00e0 eux seuls. L'intim\u00e9e se trouvant dans toutes les conditions pour acqu\u00e9rir par la prescririons, elle doit en avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. L'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitors for respondents : Fortin & Lauendeau.\n[1] 2 L.C.R. 369: 3 L.C.R. 309.\n[2] 9 L.

B. owned 188 shares on which he had paid an amount equal to 40 per cent of their value, but being unable to pay the balance the directors of the company agreed to treat the sum paid as payment in full for 75 of the 188 shares and B. consented to transfer that number to N. as fully paid up. N. agreed to this and B. signed a transfer which was entered on the books of the company. There was no formal resolution by the board of directors authorizing the appropriation of the money paid by B.\nA judgment creditor of the railway company whose writ of execution had been returned nulla bona brought an action against N. for payment of his debt claiming that only 40 per cent had been paid on the 75 shares and that the remaining 60 per cent was still due the company thereon. A judgment in favour of N. was affirmed by the Divisional Court but reversed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the appropriation by the directors of the money paid by B. was invalid for want of a formal resolution authorizing it.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the company having got the benefit of loan by N. were estopped from disputing the application of the money paid by B. in such a way as to constitute N. the holder of the 75 shares upon the security of which the loan was made and creditors, not having been prejudiced, are bound in the same way; and the transaction being binding between B. and the company, and not objectionable as regards creditors, N. could accept the 75 shares in lieu of the 168 he was entitled to. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows:\u2014\nBy an agreement in writing entered into November 1st, 1887, the defendant Neelon agreed to advance to the St. Catharines & Niagara Central Railway Company $100,000, taking as security, among other things, a number of paid up shares in the stock of the company specified in a schedule attached to the agreement. Among the said shares were 168 held by one Blain\u2019 who owned in all 188, upon which he had paid $3,750 equal to about 40 per cent of their value. Before the agreement was consummated Blain had got into financial difficulties and was unable to pay the balance of his subscription to the stock and at a meeting of the directors of the company it was proposed that the said sum of $3,750 be appropriated to payment in full of 75 of Blaine\u2019s shares and that number be transferred to Neelon instead of the 168. This was agreed to by the board, but no formal resolution was passed authorizing it. The secretary sent a transfer to Blain of the 75 shares in favour of Neelon and it was executed by Blain and accepted by the defendant who was aware of what had transpired at the meeting of the board. The transfer was entered in the books of the company as of 75 fully paid up shares and the remainder of Blain\u2019s shares he retained as stock upon which nothing was paid.\nThe plaintiff corporation had obtained judgment against the railway and issued execution which was returned nulla bona. They then brought an action against Neelon claiming that only 40 per cent had been paid on the 75 shares received from Blain and the balance was still due the company and liable to satisfy their judgment debt.\nAt the trial judgment was given in favour of Neelon, the trial judge finding as facts that while he, Neelon, had a general knowledge of all that had been done he received the 75 shares believing that they were fully paid up and relying upon the representations of the proper officer of the company to that effect. Also that he would not have received them, nor advanced his money to the company, if there had been any doubt about the legality of the transaction. The judgment at the trial was affirmed by the Divisional Court but the Court of Appeal held that the want of a formal resolution by the board of directors authorizing the appropriation of the money paid by Blain to the 75 shares made the transaction void and the judgment of the Divisional Court was accordingly reversed.\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Cox for the appellant referred to Miles v. New Zealand Alford Estate Co.[3]; McCracken v. Mclntyre[4].\nCollier for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In my opinion the judgment of the Divisional Court delivered by Mr. Justice Ferguson as regards the appellant\u2019s liability in respect of the seventy-five shares acquired by him from Blain as paid-up shares, was entirely right.\nThere can be no doubt that under the agreement of the 1st November, 1887, made under the seal of the railway company, the appellant was entitled to have paid-up shares. From Blain he was to receive 168 paid-up shares. No variation in this agreement was assented to by the appellant, further than this: finding that all the 168 shares to be transferred by Blain were not paid-up, he made a concession in favour of the company and agreed to take less than he was entitled to, namely, 75 shares in lieu of 168. These 75 shares were accordingly transferred to him, with a certificate of the proper officer of the company that they were paid\u2011up, and on the faith of this and on the security of these shares the appellant honestly advanced his money.\nMr. Justice Robertson, who tried the action without a jury, found as follows:\u2014\nI also find, that according to the terms of the said agreement the stock was to be paid-up stock, and the defendant received it believing and relying on the representations of the proper officer of the company that the stock was fully paid-up at the time it was transferred to him. I also find that, had there been any doubt in the mind of the defendant at the time the said stock was transferred to him that the said stock was fully paid-up he would not have received the same, nor would he have made the advance of $100,000, or any part thereof, to the company. I also find that there never was any contract between the defendant and the railway company, or with the said parties of the second and third parts to the said agreement, to take, accept or receive the said stock or any part thereof other than on the terms mentioned and set forth in the said agreement.\nThese findings were fully warranted by the evidence.\nMr. Blain had originally acquired 188 shares of $50 each, upon which there had been paid $3,750. The transaction between Blain and the company, as regards these shares, was entered in the stock ledger of the company by charging Blain with $9,400 as for 188 shares at $50 per share, and giving him credit generally for $3,750 in a gross sum, as having been paid on account of these shares, without any specification of the particular shares sold to him, and without any specific application of the money paid, either as distributed amongst all the shares ratably, or as having been. applied to any particular shares.\nThe first question which arises is as to the powers of the company to apply this money to 75 shares in full payment for these shares. Blain does not appear to have made any objection to such a proceeding but, on the contrary, to have fully assented to it. Then, apart from the rights of creditors if the company, either acting as any creditor has a right to do in applying money not particularly appropriated by a debtor, or even having made originally an application of the money by which it was ascribed ratably to all the shares, had thought fit, Blain consenting, to re-appropriate it and treat it as a payment in full for 75 shares, I am at a loss to see why they should not have been free to do so. No authority has been, or could be, invoked to show that such a simple transaction was ultra vires. Blain would still have continued to be the holder of shares in the company to the amount of $9,400, upon which $3,750 had been paid, and its appropriation, or re-appropriation, to particular shares could have made no difference to him.\nThen no prejudice to creditors can be suggested.\nAs Mr. Justice Ferguson in his judgment says this transaction had not the effect in any way of derogating from the rights of creditors. In the words of the learned judge:\nMr. Blain\u2019s liability remained for the same amount as before this transaction. What the creditor really complains of, is that he is not permitted to gain an accidental advantage by making his claim against a man of wealth rather than against one who, however high his financial standing had been, was, and I suppose is, more or less embarrassed by reason of the occurrences before alluded to.\nIt was, however, considered by the Court of Appeal that the transaction as regards the imputation of all cash paid to the 75 shares was invalid by reason of the want of any formal resolution of the board of directors authorizing it. Blain having consented to the transfer of the credit, and the creditors\u2019 rights not being in any way affected by the appropriation made, this must be regarded purely as a question between the appellant and the company.\nThe first observation I have to make on this is, that we are not dealing with a case between the directors and the whole body of the shareholders. The company got the money loaned by Mr. Neelon on the strength of their 75 shares being fully paid-up, and without that, as he swears and as the learned trial judge has found, the advance would not have been made. Surely, under these circumstances, as between the company and Mr. Neelon, if the latter was seeking to deal with these shares by transferring them as paid-up shares, the company would not be permitted now to allege the want of a resolution as a ground for refusing to register the transfer. In such a case, they would undoubtedly be held to be estopped from insisting on such a dishonest defence to a proceeding to compel registration.\nI am further of opinion that the high authority of Lord Justice Bowen may also be invoked for the appellant. I refer to his judgment in the case of Miles v. New Zealand Afford Company[5], cited in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario. In that case the Lord Justice was of opinion that the want of formality in the proceedings of the company could not affect a third party with whom it was dealing. The other Lord Justices differed, it is true, but on a ground which did not call for any opinion on this point. It has long been the doctrine of the courts, as I understand it, that mere irregularities in the internal proceedings of corporations and joint stock companies do not affect persons contracting with the corporation or company. I do not think that such a doctrine is the less applicable in the present case for the reason that Mr. Neelon was himself a director and had notice of all that was done.\nThen the deed of the 1st November, 1887, was authorized by the resolutions of the 12th and 13th October, 1887, and was recognized as binding by the resolution of the 10th November, 1887.\nBy this agreement Mr. Neelon was entitled to 168 paid-up shares from Blain. Surely there could be no reasonable objection why he should not take less than he had stipulated to receive, viz., 75 shares in lieu of the 168. If a resolution of a board of directors authorizes the payment to a creditor in full it could not be said that having received a part payment only he was disentitled to retain it because he did not get all the resolution authorized. I cannot distinguish that case from this.\nIt appears to me, therefore, that there are two distinct grounds upon which the allowance of this appeal may be rested: first, the company having got the benefit of the loan by the appellant were estopped from disputing the application of the money paid by Blain, in such a way as to constitute him the holder of the 75 shares upon the security of which the loan was made, and creditors, not having been prejudiced, are bound in the same way; secondly, the transaction having been perfectly binding as between Blain and the company, and not objectionable as regards creditors, there was no reason why the appellant should not have been at liberty to do as he did in accepting 75 shares instead of 168, which, under the agreement duly authorized by the resolution of October, 1887, he was entitled to call for.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson restored, with costs to the appellant, in all the courts below. FOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal and dismiss the action. I agree with the opinion of Robertson J. at the trial and of Mr. Justice Ferguson in the Divisional Court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs, for the reasons given in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appellant not having acquired the stock from Blain in virtue of the arrangement authorized by the St. Catharines & Niagara Railway Company, but in virtue of a private arrangement with Blain himself not authorized nor sanctioned by the company can take under Blain\u2019s transfer of the stock to the appellant no greater right than Blain himself had, that is to say, as liable to the creditors of the Railway Company which the respondents are to the amount which at the time of the transfer of the stock to the respondent remained unpaid thereon.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Cox & Yale.\nSolicitors for respondents: Collier & Shaw.\n[1] 18 Ont.

Gwynne J. dissenting.\nMortgagees out of possession cannot, after their interest has ceased to exist, maintain an action for such trespass and injury committed while they held the title.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014A mortgagee in possession at the time the trespass and injury is committed is the only person damnified thereby and can maintain an action therefor after be has parted with his interest, nor is he estopped therefrom by having consented to a sale to one of the trespassers of the personal property as to which the trespass was committed. The tort feasors could not set up such estoppel even though the amount recovered from them with the sum received by such mortgagee for his interest should exceed his mortgage debt.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming a judgment at the trial against the defendants.\nThe action in this case was for trespass to mortgaged property and injury to the freehold by removal of fixtures. The plaintiffs were Brown the first mortgagee, Horton the third mortgagee, Robinson the owner of the equity of redemption at the time of the trespass and Hesslein the assignee of such equity and of the third mortgage. The second mortgagee was Brookfield one of the defendants. The first mortgagee, Brown, had foreclosed his mortgage and the property was sold two days after the trespass, realizing sufficient to pay off the first two mortgages. The plaintiff Hesslein was the purchaser at said sale and on the same day that the property was conveyed to him by sheriff's deed the plaintiff Horton assigned to him the third mortgage and the equity of redemption was conveyed to him by Robinson.\nThere was no question at the trial that a trespass had been committed and the only matter in dispute was as to which, if any, of the plaintiffs could maintain the action. The defendants claimed that the right to sue was in Horton if in any one and that he was estopped by having, prior to the trespass, given his consent to a sale under chattel mortgage of the personal property in respect to which the trespass was committed to the defendant Brookfield.\nThe trial judge held that Brown, the first mortgagee, could maintain the action as he must be considered to be a trustee for subsequent incumbrancers. The majority of the court in banc differed from this view, but gave judgment against defendants in favour of Robinson the owner of the equity of redemption at the time of the trespass.\nRoss Q.C. for the appellants. The plaintiff Robinson was not damnified to an extent that would entitle him to damages, Hosking v. Phillips[2]; and see Tucker v. Vowles[3]. Borden Q.C. for the respondents. As to the right of the mortgagees to sue see King v. Bangs[4]; Higginbotham v. Hawkins[5]; Mann v. English[6]; and as to estoppel of Horton Moore v. Spiegel[7]; Smith v. Cropper[8]; Maddison v. Alderson[9]; Town of Clinton v. Haddam[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I entirely agree in the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend. It is manifest that the appellants were guilty of an unjustifiable act of spoliation which caused injury and damage to the owner of the property.\nIt would be much to be lamented if for any technical difficulty regarding the proper person to sue for an indemnity in respect of this injury the appellants should evade liability. I am of opinion, however, that there is really no such difficulty. Under the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, which amalgamates the jurisdictions of law and equity formerly exercised separately, it is open to the owner of the equity of redemption to sue for this injury to his equitable and beneficial estate just as a reversioner though not in possession might at law have sued for an injury to his reversion. Had the old procedure been still in force by which law and equity were separately administered there can be no doubt that in favour of the plaintiff Robinson, the owner of the equity of redemption, a court of equity, even if it would not have given him full relief, would at least have restrained the appellants from setting up the outstanding mortgages and the want of possession as a defence, and thus have removed all impediments in the way of his right to recover. Now that the jurisdictions are combined that can be done in one action which would formerly have required two. The respondent, Robinson, was clearly an owner of the equity of redemption at the time of the wrongful acts complained of which were committed on the 12th June, 1890. The conveyance of the equity of redemption by Marr, the mortgagor, to Robinson was on the 24th March, 1890. No justification for the appellants' conduct has or could have been shown. The only question is. Who is entitled to sue them for it? Brown, the first mortgagee, could not sue as he has been paid off. Horton having transferred his mortgage for value is also without any locus standi as it appears to me. Hesslein could not sue as his purchase was not until the 14th June, 1890, after the wrongs had been committed and no right of action was or could have been assigned to him. There remains only Robinson and it is no answer to his action to say that he has conveyed away the estate. Presumably the estate was sold for so much less by reason of the removal of these fixtures and the consequent injury to the freehold. The quotation from. Rolle's Ab. in the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend clearly establishes the proposition that the owner of land upon which trespass has been committed may recover for the injury after having conveyed away his estate. All principle and reason point to a like conclusion.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I have some hesitation in agreeing to dismiss this appeal. I was at one time inclined to give judgment the other way but as the majority of the court are in favour of dismissal I will not dissent. GWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs, and that the person entitled to recover the amount assessed by the jury for the very unjustifiable tort committed by the defendants, and as the value of the fixtures severed by them from the premises and taken away by them and disposed of to their own use, is the plaintiff Horton, who, although third mortgagee of the premises, was in actual possession thereof as mortgagee at the time of the commission by the defendants of the serious damage to the premises of which he was so in actual possession, and who alone appears to have been the person pecuniarily damnified by the defendant's outrageous act of wrong, and whose cause of action as the person in actual possession of the injured premises was complete the moment the tort was committed. The judgment should, in my opinion, be varied accordingly, so as to enable Horton to recover the amount assessed by the jury, with full costs. There seems to be no foundation whatever for the contention that Horton was estopped from suing for the tort committed to premises of which he was in actual possession, nor are the tort feasors persons who can be heard to urge any such objection, or any objection to his right to maintain this suit for such tort or to recover the damages awarded by the jury against the defendants as the tort feasors. If the amount recovered from the defendants for the gross wrong committed by them, together with the amount for which the mortgagee Horton afterwards, when his mortgage security was so reduced in value by the defendants' wrong, assigned and transferred his mortgage, would exceed the amount of his mortgage debt that is not a matter of which the tort feasors could claim the benefit; it would be a matter with which the mortgagor, or the person or persons entitled to his equity of redemption would be alone concerned, and they can be trusted to look after their own interests in such a case, as being better able to do so than the defendants who have committed the wrong complained of, and whose sole object in resisting the present action is to endeavour to escape being made responsible to any one for the outrage they have committed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant Brookfield: Adams A.

Askwith, J.L.P. O\u2019Hanly, M. Starrs Defendants.\n1893: March 10; 1893: November 20.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSurety\u2014Interference with rights of surety\u2014Discharge.\nThe Union Bank agreed to discount the paper of S., A. & Co. railway contractors, indorsed by O\u2019G. as surety, to enable them to carry on a railway contract for the Atlantic & North-west Ry. Co. O\u2019G. endorsed the notes on an understanding or agreement with the contractors and the bank that all moneys to be earned under the contract should be paid directly to the bank and not to the contractors, and an irrevocable assignment by the contractors of all moneys to the bank was in consequence executed. After several estimates had been thus paid to the bank it was found that the work was not progressing favourably, and the railway Co. then, without the assent of O\u2019G. but with the assent of the contractors and the bank, guaranteed certain debts due to creditors of the contractors and out of moneys subsequently earned by the contractors made large payments for wages, supplies and provisions necessary for carrying on the work. In October, 1888, the bank, also without the assent of O\u2019G., applied for and got possession of a cheque of $15,000 which had been accepted by the bank and held by the company as security for due performance of the contract, in consideration of signing a release to the railway company \u201cfor all payments heretofore made by the company for labour employed on said contract and for material and supplies which went into the work.\u201d The contract under certain circumstances gave the right to the company to employ men and additional workmen, &c., as they might think proper, but did not give the right to guarantee contractors\u2019 debts or pay for provisions and food, &c.\nHeld, that there was such a variation of the rights of O\u2019G. as surety as to discharge him.\nTaschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice, dismissing the appellants\u2019 motion to set aside the findings and judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson.\nThe action was commenced by the respondents, the bank, in the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario upon four promissory notes held by the bank, upon which the defendants, Starrs, Askwith & Co. were sued as makers, and the defendants, John E. Askwith, J.L.P. O\u2019Hanly, M. Starrs and M. O\u2019Gara were sued as indorsers.\nJudgment was entered at the trial by consent against all the defendants except the defendant O\u2019Gara, who pleaded and went to trial upon a special defence, alleging that after the contract for constructing a line of railway known as the Short line through the State of Maine was awarded to Starrs, Askwith & Co. the contractors negotiated with the respondents\u2019 bank for a line of credit, which the bank agreed to make, provided they could procure the appellant to indorse their notes.\nThat after some time the appellant agreed to indorse for them, provided they would as security assign to the bank the moneys to be earned under the contract. This being done the appellant from time to time indorsed the notes of the firm to the bank which were from time to time renewed.\nThat the bank received all the moneys earned by the contractors down to March, 1888, which was partly applied on the notes and partly in the making of new advances, but in March, 1888, the C.P.R. Co. disregarded the assignment and paid the moneys earned to the other creditors of the contractors.\nThat afterwards the bank neglected to enforce its assignment or to collect the moneys earned, and on the 27th of October, 1888, without consulting with the appellant, and without any notice to him, the bank confirmed the payments already made by the C.P.R. Co. amounting to about $75,000.00.\nThat he was a surety on the faith of the security he had procured to be given to the bank, that the bank had wasted the security without his knowledge, that he was absolutely discharged by reason of the bank not fulfilling its duty to collect the money or at all events to the extent of the payments made by the C.P.R. Co.\nThe action was tried at the sittings of the court for the trial of action in the Chancery Division before Mr. Justice Ferguson, without a jury.\nThe documentary and oral evidence given at the trial in support of appellant\u2019s defence and the other material facts and pleadings are reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Justice Ferguson gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff bank for the sum of $36,872.31 and costs of suit.\nThe defendant, O\u2019Gara, thereafter moved in the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice to set aside the findings and judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson.\nThe motion was argued and judgment given therein against the defendant, directing the dismissal of his motion with costs.\nThe defendant O\u2019Gara then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Court of Appeal was divided, the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osler being in favour of dismissing the appellant O\u2019Gara\u2019s appeal, and Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Maclennan in favour of allowing the appeal, and the appeal was therefore dismissed.\nD. McCarthy Q.C. and A. Ferguson Q.C. for appellants:\nThere is no dispute as to the terms of the agreement or understanding upon which Mr. O\u2019Gara undertook to indorse the contractor\u2019s notes, and both parties agree with the findings of the learned judge at the trial as to particular terms of agreement. The equitable assignment of the contract moneys was drawn up by the bank and sent to them and acted upon. There was, therefore, something more than the mere agreement to indorse; there was a pre-existing agreement between the contractors, the bank and Mr. O\u2019Gara.\nThe payments of some $125,000 made under another and subsequent arrangement between the bank and the contractors and the company were made without the knowledge or consent of Mr. O\u2019Gara, and as the work was never taken out of the contractors\u2019 hands under clauses 23 or 24 of the contract, the legal effect is that the indorser is released.\nAmounts were paid directly by the company to parties who furnished supplies and although the company, by obtaining the release which the bank signed and for which the bank got back a sum of $15,000 which had been deposited as security for the due performance of the contract, cannot be sued, yet the indorser can claim that all such moneys so paid were diverted and not paid in accordance with the terms of the equitable assignment upon the faith of which alone Mr. O\u2019Gara consented to become a surety. The law as stated in the following authorities is applicable to the facts of this case, viz.: Walker v. London and North- western Railway Co.[1]; Hudson on Building Contracts[2]; Brice v. Bannister[3]; Drew v. Josolyne[4]; Polak v. Everett[5].\nMeredith Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C. for respondents: The main position of the appellant, Mr. O\u2019Gara, is that being a surety he is entitled to avail himself of the equitable defences of a surety, and that in the present case his rights have been interfered with. In the first place we contend that the appellant was not a surety but a co-adventurer in the enterprise, being entitled to a share of the profits, and that the only contract with the bank was the obligation to pay at maturity if the notes he indorsed were presented for payment dishonoured, and notice of dishonour given to him. When in October, 1888, the contract proved to be a losing one, and when it was found that the $15,000 were in jeopardy, an arrangement was arrived at with Mr. O\u2019Gara (for he was in daily communication with the contractors), by which, for the benefit of all concerned, the works were continued.\nThe findings of the trial judge are to that effect, and if they remain there is an end of the case.\nBut as it is contended that there was an equitable assignment of all moneys to be earned and that it constituted the bank assignee in equity of a chose in action, relying on Brice v. Bannister3. We answer that that case is distinguishable, for if we adopt the reasoning of one of the judges, Lord Justice Bramwell, who stated an hypothetical case which is practically this case, we find there is no room for argument.\nIs it not a fair answer to the appellant\u2019s contention to say that no moneys were subsequently earned after arrangement of October, 1888, because no supplies were furnished by the contractors? Then again, we submit there has been no practical binding acceptance by the company of this assignment, for under section 27 of the contract the Atlantic and, North-western Railway might have refused to be bound by the order on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and that all payments made are justified by sections 23 of the contract and 101 of the specifications and notices given thereunder.\nThe bank further contends that O\u2019Gara was not a proper surety for the principal debtors at the date that the bank assented to the payments made by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, because he was then merely an indorser of notes not then dishonoured nor overdue. Lord Blackburn in Duncan Fox & Co. v. North and South Wales Bank[6], and Lord Watson in same case at pages 21 and 22. Further, we say that there was no change or variation of any contract between the bank and the promissors so as to release the indorser O\u2019Gara. The arrangement as to the estimates was purely collateral. Sanderson v. Aston[7]. Parol evidence is not admissible to vary the terms of the contract embodied in the promissory notes. Abrey v.

West[13]; Pearl v. Deacon[14]; Benjamin on Surety[15]; Grant on Suretyship[16].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and FOURNIER J. concurred with SEDGEWICK J.\nTASCHEREAU, J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I think that the defence fails for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice in the court appealed from.\nI cannot see, as a matter of fact, that the position of the appellant as surety has been in any way injuriously affected by any of the dealings that have been proved to have taken place between Starrs & Co. and the Bank or the Railway Company.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal by the indorser of certain promissory notes made by a firm of contractors, styled Starrs, Askwith & Co., payable to the appellant and indorsed by him, and, as so indorsed, discounted for the makers by the plaintiffs, in the course of their business as bankers, against a judgment rendered in favour of the plaintiffs in an action upon the promissory notes against the makers and indorsers.\nA thorough understanding of the facts of the case is all, as it appears to me, that is necessary to remove all difficulty attending the determination of the appeal; and, first, as to the relationship which existed between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, with which latter company the firm of Starrs, Askwith & Co. entered into the contract out of which the transaction which is the subject of litigation in the present suit arises, for the construction of a portion of their railway, situate in the State of Maine, one of the United States of America.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company were no doubt interested in the construction of the work which Starrs, Askwith & Co. contracted with the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company to perform, because the Canadian Pacific Railway Company had accepted a lease whereby they were to be lessees of the railway as soon as it should be constructed by the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, which company had entered into a covenant with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to build the railway, and entered into a contract with Starrs, Askwith & Co. for the construction by them of two sections of the railway. The proceeds of the sale of certain bonds of the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company were placed in the hands of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to be disbursed by them by their cheques to the contractors, upon the authority and direction of the Atlantic and North\u2011western Railway Company.\nTo this extent then, in so far as the present action is concerned, and to this extent only, can the Canadian Pacific Railway Company be said to have been the agents of the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, namely, to pay out of the funds of that company placed in their hands the moneys which, from time to time, they should be authorized by the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company to pay to the persons with whom the latter company had entered into contracts for the construction of the railway.\nThen, secondly, as to the terms of the contract entered into by and between Starrs, Askwith & Co. and the plaintiffs, there appears to be no reason to doubt the evidence of Mr. O\u2019Hanly, one of the members of the firm of Starrs, Askwith & Co., upon that point; and the learned trial judge has expressly found the contract to have been as stated by him, and at the trial it was finally conceded by the appellants so to be. Now, O\u2019Hanly\u2019s evidence, in substance, is that in order to obtain the contract it was necessary for the firm to deposit with the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company $15,000 in money, or in a cheque accepted and certified as good by a bank. They therefore applied to Mr. Anderson, the plaintiffs\u2019 agent and manager at their Ottawa branch, and informed him that they wanted, in the first place, $15,000 as a security deposit, and afterwards, $25,000 to enable them to carry on the work, in all $40,000. The firm wanted to get the accommodation which they required upon their own security alone, but the plaintiffs\u2019 agent declined to give the accommodation without a good indorser. Eventually an agreement was arrived at between the firm and the plaintiffs, through their agent Mr. Anderson, to the following effect:\u2014The bank agreed to give their acceptance of the firm\u2019s cheque for $15,000, and to honour the drafts of the firm to the further amount of $25,000, as they should want funds to carry on the work, upon their supplying their notes, with an approved indorser, the firm also agreeing that all moneys coming to them under their contract, upon their progress estimates, should be paid into the bank at Ottawa, against which the firm were to be at liberty to draw in order to carry on the work, and that, for so much of the notes discounted by the bank for the firm as upon maturity the firm could not afford to pay out of the progress estimates, these notes should be renewed by the bank until the work should be completed under the contract, which time was, by the contract, declared to be the first of November, 1887; and Mr. O\u2019Gara was agreed to be accepted by the bank as an approved indorser.\nAccordingly, on the 24th May, the bank discounted a note of the firm, dated 23rd May, and indorsed by Mr. O\u2019Gara, for $15,500, payable six months after date, the proceeds of which, amounting to $15,023.53 were placed to the credit of the firm in the bank, and the firm drew thereon a cheque for $15,000 payable to the Canadian Pacific Railway, or order (security contract, sections one and two, Short Line Railway), which the bank certified as good. This cheque, so certified, was handed by the firm to a Mr. Ross, manager of the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company. On the 1st of June, 1887, the bank discounted for the firm another note of that date for $10,000, made by the firm and indorsed by the appellant, and placed the proceeds to the credit of the firm; at the same time the firm left with the plaintiffs\u2019 manager, at their Ottawa branch, a letter dated the 30th May, 1887, addressed to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, as follows:\u2014\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014Please make all cheques payable to us for work done on our contract on Atlantic and North-western Railway (International Maine Division) to the order of the Union Bank of Canada, and send to their Ottawa branch, or any other estimate for said work, and we hereby agree that this authority shall be irrevocable on our part, without the assent of the said bank.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) M. STARRS,\n\u201c JNO. E. ASKWITH,\n\u201c J.L.P. O\u2019HANLY.\nThis letter the plaintiffs\u2019 agent at Ottawa enclosed in a letter dated 1st June, 1887, addressed and sent to W. Sutherland Taylor, treasurer of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, which letter is as follows:\u2014\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I enclose an authority from Messrs. Starrs, Askwith and O\u2019Hanly, contractors for work on International Maine Division of the Atlantic and North-western Railway, requesting your company to make all payments, by cheque or otherwise, due them for work, to this bank, and to have same sent here when due. Will you please acknowledge this and say if you will comply therewith. If you are not the proper officer of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to take this, will you kindly forward it to the proper person and notify me, and oblige.\nYours truly,\nM.A. ANDERSON,\nManager,\nTo this letter Mr. Taylor replied by a letter, dated the 2nd June, 1887, as follows, addressed to Mr. Anderson:\u2014\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I am in receipt of yours of yesterday. The order which you enclose is not satisfactory in so far as the firm of contrac- tors do not give the bank the authority to sign binding receipts to this company on their behalf for the moneys which may be monthly remitted to the bank as per estimates. Please supplement order in that way. I enclose form for the signature of firm.\nThe form sent in the above letter was signed by Starrs, Askwith & Co. per M. Starrs and as so signed is as follows:\u2014\nTo the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe Union Bank of Ottawa is hereby empowered by us to grant valid and binding receipts on our behalf to you for moneys remitted by you in payment of our estimates under contract on Atlantic and North-western Railway, as per order given by us dated 30th May, 1887.\n(Signed) STARRS, ASKWITH & CO.\nPer M. STARRS.\nThis paper so signed Mr. Anderson enclosed in a letter dated June 3rd, 1887, addressed and sent by him to Mr. Taylor as follows:\u2014\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I have received your letter of the 2nd inst., and now enclose form sent by you duly signed by firm. I suppose I may now consider the power of attorney to draw their estimates irrevocable by contractors for this work.\nAt the same time that Starrs, Askwith & Co. gave to the plaintiffs\u2019 agent the above Letter of the date of 30th May, addressed to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, they gave to him also the following letter:\u2014\nUNION BANK OF CANADA,\nOTTAWA, May 30th, 1887.\nManager Union Bank,\nOttawa.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Having requested the Canadian Pacific Railway to make all estimates for our work on the Main Division of the Atlantic and North-western Railway payable to you and sent to your office, we now hereby authorise you to use such estimates for the payment of any advances made by you to us and to charge such notes to our account by which ever of us made, without notice or protest of any kind, and we hereby waive all such notice and protest and ratify and confirm all agreements in this letter.\nYours truly,\nSigned M. STARRS,\n\u201c JOHN E. ASKWITH.\n\u201c J.L.P. O\u2019HANLY. Afterwards the bank, from time to time, discounted for the firm other promissory notes made by them and indorsed by Mr. O\u2019Gara to an amount in the whole of, about $55,000, including the note for which the bank gave their acceptance of the said cheque for $15,000 as deposit security.\nAs to the terms upon which Mr. O\u2019Gara agreed with Starrs, Askwith & Co., to indorse their paper for them, there is a discrepancy between the evidence of Mr. O\u2019Hanly and of the appellant as to the time when that agreement was entered into. Mr. O\u2019Hanly says that when Mr. O\u2019Gara indorsed the note of the 23rd of May for $15,000, no agreement was entered into or spoken of; that Mr. O\u2019Gara indorsed that note as he had frequently been in the habit of indorsing paper for Starrs & O\u2019Hanly before they had formed a partnership with Askwith and the agreement was first spoken of and entered into upon the 31st May, and signed by Askwith and O\u2019Hanly on the 1st of June, when O\u2019Gara indorsed the note of that date for $10,000, as follows:\nIn consideration of Mr. O\u2019Gara indorsing for us we agree to indemnify him against such indorsations and to pay him twelve and a half per cent of the net profits of our contracts on the short line of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, we to charge for expenses only our actual expenses.\nSigned JOHN E. ASKWITH.\n\u201c J.L.P. O\u2019HANLY.\nJune 1st, 1887.\nMr. O\u2019Gara\u2019s recollection on the contrary is that the terms upon which he should indorse the firm\u2019s paper were discussed upon different occasions and finally verbally agreed upon before he indorsed the note of the 23rd May and that on the 1st June when asked to indorse the note of that date, he had it reduced into writing and signed, because in the interval he had become afraid \u201cleast there should be a failure of these people and he being paid by a percentage or promised to be paid by percentage, that might by any means be made out a partnership.\u201d\nIn the view which I take this discrepancy in the evidence is immaterial and the agreement both as to its terms and as to the time of its having been entered into may be taken as stated by the appellant. He says that when first applied to by Starrs and O\u2019Hanly to indorse the paper of the firm for the contract under construction he at first refused; that his recollection is that he refused for a day or two; that he was reluctant to go into anything of the kind that would be dangerous; that although he had before indorsed for Starrs and O\u2019Hanly he had security for such previous indorsations; that to the best of his recollection he held the matter in abeyance for a day or two, but finally, after it was talked over, his objections were overcome by the discussion which took place that there would be no risk; that all the moneys would come into the hands of the bank and that upon that understanding and upon that stipulation he agreed to indorse for them and did accordingly indorse the note of the 23rd May and when asked to indorse the note of the 1st of June he says that he \u201cagain spoke of the assignment to the bank and that it was then stated either that it was done or that it should be done at once\u201d and thereupon he indorsed the note of the 1st June and had the agreement as above set out reduced into writing as he had fears there might be a misunderstanding as to what was the position he occupied. He was afraid that it might be argued, in the event of failure of the firm, that he was a partner, and so for his own protection he had the agreement reduced into writing. Then there is a discrepancy also between the evidence of Mr. O\u2019Gara and Mr. Anderson upon the point whether Mr. Anderson had knowledge that O\u2019Gara had made it a condition of his indorsing the paper of the firm that the moneys coming to the firm should be assigned to the bank. Mr. O\u2019Gara says that Mr. Anderson had such knowledge for he says that they both repeatedly discussed the matter and spoke of the moneys coming into the hands of the bank being the only security which the appellant had whereas Mr. Anderson expressly denies that any such conversation ever took place between him and the appellant, or that he had ever heard that there was any understanding of any sort between the firm and Mr. O\u2019Gara upon the faith of which Mr. O\u2019Gara had indorsed the paper of the firm. In the view which I take it is unimportant also whether Mr. Anderson had or had not any knowledge or notice of the terms upon which Mr. O\u2019Gara indorsed the firm\u2019s paper.\nAt an early period of the progress of the work under the contract it became apparent that the work contracted for could not be performed at the prices fixed in the schedule of prices forming part of the contract, although, at the time the contract was entered into, it was deemed that the contract was a very profitable one. Influence on behalf of the contractors was exercised upon the Atlantic and North-western Railway Co., to try and get them to make alterations in the specifications and prices more favourable to the contractors. The contractors and their friends failed to succeed in the efforts in this behalf during the period limited in the contract for the completion of the work, but on the 7th November, 1887, seven days after the time limited by the contract for its completion, and while the work remained quite incomplete, an agreement was entered into by an indenture expressed to be made between the Atlantic and North-western Railway Co. represented herein by Thomas O\u2019Shaughnessy, the company\u2019s assistant General manager of the one part, and Starrs, Askwith & Co. of Ottawa, Ontario, contractors of the other part, whereby it was mutually agreed that the specifications attached to the contract between the railway company and the firm should be and were altered in certain particulars in the interest of the contractors and whereby the prices named in the contract for certain work were increased and made more favourable for the contractors, and whereby it was expressly stated to be mutually agreed that the original contract should remain in full force and effect in all respects except those to which the alterations made therein in the interest of the contractors related.\nNow the work having been continued upon these altered terms in favour of the contractors after the time fixed by the contract for the completion of the work contracted for, it is obvious that the company could not avail themselves of any of the provisions of the contract relating to the event of the work not being proceeded with with such diligence and such a force as to justify the expectation that the work contracted for should be completed by the 1st of November, 1887, the time named in the contract for its completion; but, whether the agreement of 7th of November had been entered into or not the work subsequently done must be taken to be subject to all the other provisions of the contract and among these to all the provisions of secs. 23, 24 and 27 of the contract and of sec. 101 of the specifications which relate to other matters than the not proceeding with the work with such diligence and force as to justify the expectation that the work contracted for should be completed by the 1st of November. Sections 23 of the contract, and 101 of the specifications which form part of the contract are to the same purport and effect. As regards the work in progress subsequently to the 1st of November, sec. 23 will read as follows, omitting all that relates to the not proceeding with such diligence and force as to justify the expectation of the work being completed by the first of November:\u2014\nIf the manager shall at any time consider that the works are not, or that some part thereof is not, being carried on with due diligence, then in every such case the manager may by written notice to the contractors require them to employ or provide such additional workmen, horses, machinery, or other plant or materials as the manager may think necessary. And in case the contractors shall, not thereupon within three days or such longer period as may be fixed by any such notice in all respects comply therewith, the manager may at the expense of the contractors, provide and employ such additional workmen, horses, machinery and any other plant, or such additional materials respectively as he may think proper and may pay such additional workmen such wages and for such horses, machinery and other plant and materials respectively such prices as he may think proper, and all such wages and prices respectively shall thereupon at once be repaid by the contractors or at the option of the company the same may be retained and deducted out of any moneys at any time payable to the contractors, and the company may use in the execution or advancement of the said work not only the horses, machinery and other plant and materials so in any case provided on the company\u2019s behalf, but also all such as have been or may be provided by or on behalf of the said contractors\nSo, in like manner, sec. 101 of the specifications will read as follows:\u2014\nIf at any time in the opinion of the manager the works are, or some part thereof is, not carried on with clue diligence then the said manager shall have the power to notify the contractors in writing to employ or provide such additional workmen, horses, material or plant as the said manager may think necessary; and in case the said contractors shall not thereupon within three days, or such longer time as may be fixed by any such notice, in all respects comply therewith, the manager shall have power to provide any workmen, horses, material or plant he may think proper and all moneys so expended by the company shall thereupon be paid by the contractors or may be deducted or retained out of any moneys due or to become due to the contractors, and should these moneys be insufficient the balance shall be recoverable in the usual way as a debt due by the contractors to the company.\nSec. 24 relates to the event of the company taking the work absolutely out of the contractors\u2019 hands and need not be here set out. Sec. 27 provides that the company may from time to time \u201cpay all wages of mechanics and men employed in and about the works and charge the contractors therewith, and deduct the same from any moneys then due or afterwards to become due to the contractors.\u201d\nIn the month of February, 1888, Mr. Lumsden the manager in charge of the construction of the railway for the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, being of opinion that the works contracted for by Starrs, Askwith & Co., were not being carried on with due diligence, served the contractors with the notice of the 25th February, 1888. This notice not having had the desired effect, Mr. Lumsden on the 14th of March, 1888, addressed and sent to the contractors the notice of that date.\nThe contractors were wholly unable to comply with these requirements. In the month of February, 1888, the men employed by one of the sub-contractors on the work had stopped working because of their not being paid. Mr. O\u2019Hanly says that the work turned out quite different from what they had expected when the contract was entered into; that at that time they expected to realize a profit of three or four thousand dollars a mile, but that no one of the greatest experience could have foreseen the difficulties they encountered in executing the work; and the consequence was that in March, 1888, after having put all they had into the work, they had become practically insolvent and the contract itself had become their sole remaining asset. In short, not only had the men on the work been ceased to be paid their wages, but the credit of the contractors had become so destroyed that persons with whom they had contracted or were desirous of contracting for the supply of materials and supplies generally, and absolutely necessary for carrying on the works, refused to supply such materials at all upon the credit of the contractors, nor unless they should receive the guarantee of the company for their payment. In fact Mr. O\u2019Hanly was of opinion that the best thing the firm could do, would have been to abandon the contract and he himself, on the 22nd of March, 1888, withdrew from the firm. Such was the state of things, that it was apparent that of necessity the work must have been utterly abandoned by the contractors, or taken off their hands under sec. 24 of the contract, if the company had not, upon the application and request of the contractors, come to their relief, which they did in the following manner: namely, they undertook to assume the payment of the wages of the men employed upon the work and to authorize Mr. Lumsden, the superintendent of construction, to purchase all materials and supplies necessary for the works upon the credit and guarantee of the company. Accordingly, in this manner the work was proceeded with from the month of April until the month of September or October, 1888, when, the work being still incomplete, the company assumed its completion themselves and under this arrangement so entered into for the benefit of and in the interest of the contractors, the company disbursed $79,160 in payment of the wages of the men employed on the work and $24,983 in the purchase through Mr. Lumsden, upon the credit of the company, of timber, lumber, iron, hay, oats and other things which were absolutely necessary for the carrying on of the work, and for this amount the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was authorized by the Atlantic and North\u2011western Railway Company to issue and did issue their cheques in favour of Mr. Lumsden for payment of the materials so supplied. It is admitted by the appellant that $79,160 paid as the wages of the men employed on the work, was properly paid to them under sec. 27 of the contract, but the contention of the appellant is that the contractors were entitled to be allowed credit in their estimates for, and to be paid, the said sum of $24,983 so as aforesaid paid by the company to the persons from whom materials to that amount had been purchased and used in the works, in discharge of Mr. Lumsden\u2019s liability to such persons on behalf of the company; that is to say, that notwithstanding the arrangement between the contractors and the company of the month of March or April, 1888, the company were liable to pay twice for the said materials, namely, to the persons selling the materials upon the company\u2019s credit, and also to the contractors who never did supply the materials in question; and the appellant contends that the bank, in virtue of the contractors\u2019 letters of June, 1887, and so likewise the appellant, as indorser of the notes of the firm discounted by the bank, had a legal claim upon such amount, as being money due and payable to the contractors under their contract, and that, as is further contended, the bank, by the document in evidence dated 27th October, 1888, released and discharged such claim to the prejudice of the appellant, and have thereby discharged the appellant from all liability as indorser of the notes of the firm, or at least to the said amount of $24,983. But the contractors, under their contract, were only entitled to claim payment of certain scheduled prices for certain specified materials furnished by them in the fulfilment of their contract, and it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that the contractors had a perfect right to enter into the arrangement which they did, for their benefit, with the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company in the month of March or April, 1888, in virtue of which the materials for which the said sum of $24,983 was paid were furnished upon the credit of the company, and that the payment of such sum by the company, in the manner in which it was paid, was authorized by section 23 of the contract and section 101 of the specifications, as the payment of the men\u2019s wages was authorized by section 27, and so the amounts of $79,160 and $24,983, amounting together to $104,183, so paid by the company, never became due by the company to the contractors, nor had the contractors any right to have had either of those sums, or any part thereof, allowed to them as being due and payable to them under their contract, and as the bank had no claim whatever upon anything except the amount actually due and payable to the contractors under their contract, and which, as such, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company were authorized to issue their cheques in favour of the bank, the appellant could not be in any respect prejudiced even by a formal release, if any such had been executed by the bank, expressly releasing the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, and also the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from all claim against them for the said several sums amounting to the $104,183, so as aforesaid paid by the company, at the request of the contractors. But in truth no such release was ever executed. It is admitted that the appellant has no defence whatever to the action brought by the bank against him as indorser of the notes sued upon, unless he can establish his contention that the bank has executed a document amounting in law to a release of a legal claim which they had against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, to demand and receive payment of the said sum of $24,983, so paid as aforesaid by the latter company, the effect of such release being, as is contended, to deprive the appellant of a common fund specially assigned to the bank for payment of the notes indorsed by the appellant. The document which is relied upon as such release was signed by the solicitor of the bank, having been first approved by Starrs, Ask- with & Co., who expressly authorized and directed the same, and is as follows:\u2014\nWhereas, on the 23rd of May, 1887, Starrs, Askwith & Co. deposited with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company a certified cheque of the Union Bank of Canada for $15,000, to be held by the railway company as security for the performance of a certain contract by Starrs, Askwith & Co. on the Atlantic and North-western Railway;\nAnd whereas, by orders made in June, 1887, said contractors assigned, and directed payment of all moneys payable under said contract to the said bank;\nApplication, therefore, having been made by the bank to the railway company to return to the said bank the said $15,000, the railway company have consented to do so on receiving from the bank the receipt for the same, it being understood that any payments heretofore made by the company for labour employed on same contract, or for material and supplies which went into the said work, were for the benefit of all concerned and not in conflict with the orders in favour of the bank;\nExcept as above, this receipt is not to affect the order in favour of the bank. Dated Montreal, the 27th October, 1888.\nThis document was signed for the Union Bank by their solicitor, J. Travers Lewis, having been first approved in writing by Starrs, Askwith & Co. as the terms upon which the cheque of the firm for the $15,000 deposit security should be and was given up to the bank, and when given up, the amount was carried to the credit of the contractors\u2019 account with the bank.\nThe payments referred to in the above receipt as having been made by the company for labour and materials and supplies are the payments of $79,160 and $24,983 respectively, already mentioned, and made in pursuance of the arrangement entered into in March or April, 1888, between the contractors and the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, whereby the company abstained from taking the contract absolutely out of the hands of the contractors as they might under the circumstances have done under section 24, and agreed to proceed in the manner in which they did and as they were authorized to do under the provisions of section 23 of the contract and section 101 of the specifications. Now it cannot be disputed that the payments so made were made for the benefit of the contractors and so also of the appellant who was interested to the extent of 12\u00bd per cent of the profits of the contractors, and the payments having been made by the authority of the contractors and in pursuance of provisions in the contract, authorizing them to be made as they were made under the circumstances which arose, they cannot be said to have been made in conflict with the orders of June, 1887, in favour of the bank which orders only authorized the bank to receive whatever sums should become payable to the contractors under the contract. The insertion therefore, in the receipt signed by the bank\u2019s solicitor upon behalf of the bank of a statement which, as appears, was absolutely true and which was expressly authorized by the firm of contractors to be inserted in the receipt, was free from all objection and there is nothing in the receipt so signed which can be construed as being a release by the bank of any claim which the bank in law had against either the Canadian Pacific Railway Company or the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company. The appellant has not been in any manner prejudiced by anything contained in that receipt, nor has he been thereby deprived of any right, if any he had, to compel the payment of these sums or any of them a second time by the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company or by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in liquidation of any part of the moneys due to the bank upon the notes of the firm indorsed by the appellant; and it is admitted by the appellant that he has not and that he does not claim to have any defence to the present action, unless the same can be found in the terms of the said receipt.\nThe utmost right insisted upon by the appellant is that as indorser of the notes of the firm of contractors, he had a right to require the bank to realize the equitable assignment which, as he contends, was executed to the bank as well for the security of the appellant as of the bank, and that the bank have released the railway company from all liability upon such equitable assignment, and have thereby discharged the appellant from all liability as indorser of the notes of the firm of contractors, and the sole question is whether the facts of the case bring it within principle and authorities applicable to such contention, and I am of the opinion that they do not.\nThe cases cited on behalf of the appellant are all distinguishable from the present; that chiefly relied upon as having most resemblance, was Brice v. Bannister[17], but in that case the judgment of Lord Justice Cotton proceeded upon the foundation that the advances made by Bannister to Gough for which the defendant Bannister claimed credit in preference to an equitable assignment made by Gough to the plaintiff Brice of the specific sum of \u00a3100 due or to become due to Gough under his contract with the defendant, were in no way sanctioned by Bannister\u2019s contract with Gough. The learned Lord Justice says:\nThe advances made by the defendant were in no way sanctioned by the contract, and in no sense an equity between Gough and the defendant existing or arising from circumstances existing at the time of the notice to the defendant of the assignment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was the assignee for value of the moneys payable under the contract, without any deduction for cost of materials or other cost of construction. The defendant for his own purposes determined not to complete the ship himself, but to let Gough do it under the contract. To enable him to do so, he, after notice of the assignment to the plaintiff paid money to Gough so as to exhaust the contract price. By so doing, he could not, in my opinion, defeat or prejudice the plaintiff\u2019s right.\nBut in the present case the moneys advanced by the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, in payment of wages and materials and supplies furnished and purchased by the railway company under the arrangement of March, 1888, were, as already shown, made in the interest of the contractors, and so in the interest of the appellant who was interested in the success of the contractors to the extent of 12\u00bd per cent of their ultimate profits, and were also, as also already shown, sanctioned by the original contract between the contractors and the railway company, so that in the present case the element exists, the absence of which, in Brice v. Bannister17, was made the foundation of the judgment of the Lord Justice Cotton. Then the language of Lord Justice Bramwell, who concurred in the result arrived at by Lord Justice Cotton upon the facts of that case, is very applicable in the present case against the contention of the appellant.\nIf, says the learned judge, it were only money payable according to the terms of the contract, the plaintiff would fail, for no money became due according to the terms of the contract.\nIn the present case the order of June, 1887, which is claimed to be an equitable assignment to the bank, had relation only to such moneys as should become due and payable to the contractors under their contract. But the moneys which are under consideration, and which were paid by the order and authority of the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, under the arrangement with the contractors made in March or April, 1888, for wages to the men employed, and for materials, &c., &c., furnished, not by the contractors, but purchased upon the credit of the railway company, and so supplied by them to their contractors, were not moneys which ever became due and payable to the contractors, who, by their contract, were only entitled to certain scheduled prices for such materials, &c., &c., as should be supplied by them. The present case, therefore, is very distinguishable in its facts from Brice v. Bannister17, and the judgment in that case can afford no support to the contention of the appellant in the present case.\nFor the above reasons, I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This action is brought upon four promissory notes amounting in the aggregate to $40,000, made by the firm of Starrs, Askwith & Company, and indorsed by several persons, among others the appellant O\u2019Gara.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson, who gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff bank. This judgment was sustained by the unanimous decision of the Common Pleas Divisional Court, as well as by the Court of Appeal that court being equally divided. The facts would appear to be somewhat as follows:\u2014\nOn the 24th May, 1887, the firm of Starrs, Askwith & Company entered into a contract with the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company for the purpose of constructing a portion of a railway known as the Short Line Railway, through the State of Maine. It was necessary that the contractors should from time to time obtain advances in addition to the moneys payable under the contract, and an arrangement was thereupon entered into by which it was agreed that all moneys payable to the contractors under the contract should be assigned to the Union Bank; that the contractors should deposit with the bank, from time to time, negotiable paper indorsed by Mr. O\u2019Gara and others, which paper was to be discounted in the ordinary way as the contractors might require funds. The trial judge states his finding as follows:\u2014 I find the real understanding and agreement was that the moneys referred to in these papers were to come to the plaintiff\u2019s bank, and that the contractors were to draw out of the same from time to time sufficient money to carry on the contract and that the security in this respect to the bank and to the defendant O\u2019Gara was the fact that the whole of the moneys was to come to the bank, so that any surplus there might be, after the amounts necessary to carry on the work, should be in the bank (the plaintiff\u2019s bank) to meet advances made.\nIn other words, the defendant O\u2019Gara indorsed the notes in question upon the understanding, not only between himself and the contractors, but also with the manager of the bank itself, that all the moneys payable to the contractors under the contract were to be paid, not to them but directly to the bank. After the execution of the contract the contractors signed and sent to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company the following document:\u2014\nPlease make all cheques for work done on our contract on Atlantic and North-western Railway (International Maine Division) payable to the order of the Union Bank of Canada and sent to their Ottawa branch or any other estimates for said work. And we hereby agree that this authority shall be irrevocable on our part without the consent of the said bank.\nOn the same day they gave to the plaintiff\u2019s bank the following document:\u2014\nHaving requested the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to make all estimates for our work on the Maine Division of Atlantic and North-western Railway payable to you and sent to your office, we now hereby authorize you to use such estimates for the payment of any advances made by you to us, and to charge such notes to our account by whichever of us made without notice or protest of any kind, and we hereby waive all such notice or protest and ratify and confirm all agreements in this letter.\nIn reply to the letter sent to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company inclosing the first document that company pointed out that it was not stated that the bank had power to give binding receipts and asked to have it supplemented, when a further document signed by the contractors was sent to the Canadian Pacific Railway which is as follows:\u2014\nThe Union Bank of Canada is hereby empowered by us to grant valid and binding receipts on our behalf to you for moneys remitted by you in payment of our estimates under contract on Atlantic and North-western Railway, as per order given by us dated 30th, May, 1887.\nThe connection of the Canadian Pacific Company with the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company was as follows:\u2014The Canadian Pacific Railway Company had no charter to build a railway through the State of Maine, the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company had. An arrangement was entered into by which the road was to be nominally built by the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company, but was to be paid for and operated when completed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. As a matter of fact, all moneys which went into the construction of the road were moneys raised by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and actually disbursed by them, that company being the agents of the Atlantic and North-western Railway Company for the purpose of paying any obligations which the latter company might assume in connection with the work. The whole transaction having reference to the assignment of the moneys payable under the contract clearly constitutes an equitable assignment of that fund, absolute in its terms and irrevocable without the consent of all parties affected by it. It was not merely an assignment of cheques which might be issued in favour of the contractors, but of all moneys found due the contractors under the estimates referred to in the contract, and it conferred upon the Union Bank the sole right of obtaining from the company all moneys which might under the provisions of the contract at any time become payable to the contractors. The work was proceeded with. The rights of the Union Bank under the equitable assignment were recognized by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and for several months all moneys estimated as due the contractors were paid direct to it. About the month of March, 1888, the contractors, it would seem, were not apparently in possession of sufficient funds to carry on the work with due expedition, and the company was obliged to pay the wages of the workmen employed by the contractors, as it had a right to do under clause 27 of the contract.\nOn the 14th March, however, Mr. Lumsden, the superintendent of construction for the company, purported to give notice in pursuance of clauses 23 and 24 of the contract making certain demands upon the contractors, requiring them, among other things, to provide additional men, plant, machinery and material, and notifying them that in case of default in carrying out that requisition for six days the company would take the work out of their hands and employ such means as it might see fit to complete the same.\nThe evidence as to what was done under this notice is unsatisfactory. It is certain, however, that the work was not taken off the contractors\u2019 hands; they went on as theretofore and completed it. I gather from Mr. Lumsden\u2019s evidence that all that they did was to pay debts which the contractors had contracted either before or after the giving of the notice. In other words, he paid certain of their debts contracted before the giving of the notice, and in respect of other goods purchased by the contractors subsequent to that time he guaranteed the payment. He admits that he paid or guaranteed the payment of accounts which certain parties had for supplying the contractors with butter, beef, pork, hay, oats and other provisions. The evidence does not show the exact amount paid in this way by the contractors. The first payment guaranteed, Mr. Lumsden says, amounted to something like $10,000, and the whole amount guaranteed was largely in excess of that sum. These payments made directly to the contractors or to their creditors notwithstanding the provisions of the equitable assignment, were made possibly without the knowledge, but certainly without the consent, either of the Union Bank or Mr. O\u2019Gara. It is now contended by the bank that these direct payments were payments under the provision of sections 23 and 24 of the contract.\nI think the payment of wages by the company was within the contract, but that the payments for provisions, &c., referred to in the evidence of Mr. Lumsden were not within the contract. Clause 23 of the contract is the only authority for such payment and it does not authorize the payment of money for provisions or food supplies such as those indicated by Mr. Lumsden. The company could under certain circumstances provide and employ such additional workmen, horses, machinery or any other plant or such additional materials respectively as it might think proper and deduct the sum from any moneys payable to the contractors, that is all. It does not, it seems to me, authorize the guaranteeing by the company of any contractors\u2019 debts, even though those debts had reference to horses, machinery and plant, such less does it justify a deduction from the amount due the contractors of any debts which the company might have guaranteed in connection with provisions\u2014\u201cprovisions\u201d not being \u201cmaterial\u201d within the meaning of the contract.\nMatters went on until the month of October, 1888.\nThere had been all along on deposit with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company an accepted cheque of the contractors upon the plaintiffs\u2019 bank for $15,000, that amount having been deposited with the company as security for the performance of the contract, and the bank was anxious to obtain possession of this cheque in order to reduce the amount of the contractors\u2019 liability to it, and made application to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for it. The Canadian Pacific Railway had been, from time to time, paying directly to the contractors, or to their creditors, the moneys above referred to, and were probably doubtful as to whether such payments might not be in violation of the bank\u2019s rights under its equitable assignment of the contract moneys, and thereupon an agreement was entered into between the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the bank and the contractors, of which the following is a copy:\u2014\nMemorandum of Agreement between the Union Bank of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nWhereas, on the 23rd of May, 1887, Starrs, Askwith & Co. deposited with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company a certified cheque on the Union Bank of Canada for $15,000, to be held by the railway company as security for the performance of a certain contract by Starrs, Askwith & Co. on the Atlantic and North-western Railway.\nAnd whereas, by orders made in June, 1887, said contractors assigned and directed payment of all moneys payable under the said contract to the said bank.\nApplication therefor having been made by the bank to the railway company to return to the bank the said $15,000, the railway company have consented to do so on receiving from the bank the receipt for the same, it being understood that any payments heretofore made by the company for labour employed on said contract, or for material and supplies which went into the said work, were for the benefit of all concerned, and not in conflict with the orders in favour of the bank.\nExcept as above, this receipt is not to affect the order in favour of the bank. Dated Montreal, the 27th October, 1888.\nFor the Union Bank (Ottawa).\n(Sgd.) J. TRAVERS LEWIS,\nSolicitor.\n\u201c W. SUTHERLAND TAYLOR,\nTreasurer, C.P.R. MONTREAL, October 27, 1888.\nWe, Starrs, Askwith & Co., of Ottawa, contractors on the Atlantic and North-western Railway, having been consulted by the Union Bank N of Canada with respect to the conditions of the release by the C.P.R. Co. of the $15,000 deposit with that company to the said bank, and having read the memorandum of agreement made this day between the railway company and the bank, hereby agree to and confirm the same, and authorize and direct the bank to sign said memorandum so far as we are concerned.\n(Signed,) STARRS, ASKWITH & CO.\nJ.E.A.\nM. STARRS,\nJOHN E. ASKWITH.\nTo this agreement Mr. O\u2019Gara was not a party, nor did he ever assent to it in any way, and the question now is: To what extent did these documents affect his liability to the bank upon his indorsations? The ratification by the bank in the month of October of all payments made by the company for labour employed or for material and supplies has the same effect as if there had been an agreement between the bank and the company before these payments were made.\nThe transaction was substantially this: The bank said, in consideration of your paying to us the $15,000 which you hold as security for the completion of the contract we authorize you, instead of paying all the contract moneys to us under the equitable assignment which we hold, to pay out direct to the contractors all such moneys as you please for the work, material and supplies in connection with the contract. This was, I take it, a clear variation from the terms of the original understanding between the bank and Mr. O\u2019Gara in regard to the equitable assignment, upon the faith of which he made the indorsement in question. If this is the correct view the principles of law applicable to the case are not in the least difficult.\nAny material variation of the terms of the original contract made between the principal debtor and the creditor will always discharge the surety. The General Steam Navigation Company v. Rolt[18]. Calvert v. London Dock Co.[19] If it clearly appears that the surety became surety on the faith of the original contract he is likewise discharged irrespective of the question of materiality. Sanderson v. Aston[20].\nA fortiori must this be so where, as in the present case, the surety actually stipulates that securities shall be given to the creditor, and the creditor, without the assent of the surety, subsequently relinquishes such securities.\nExecution by the plaintiff company of the document of the 27th October, 1888, being as I think unquestionably a variation of the contract between the principal debtors and the bank to the effect that all the contract moneys were to be paid directly to the bank and not to other parties, absolutely released the defendant O\u2019Gara from his obligations as indorser of the notes sued on. The contention that if there was a release at all it was a release pro tanto only does not, I think, apply. The principle, I take it, is that there is a total discharge where there is any variation by the creditor in a contract upon the faith of which the surety entered into his obligation. Where, however, the creditor has assets or securities in his hands (the surety having no connection with them) which may be applied by the creditor in reduction of the debt secured, any improper or careless dealing in respect of such securities may discharge the surety to the extent of the loss occasioned thereby. If, in the present case, after Mr. O\u2019Gara had indorsed the notes in question, the bank as security for the payment of the contractors\u2019 indebtedness had obtained from them the assignment of their contract without the knowledge of, or apart altogether from, Mr. O\u2019Gara, and if the bank through its negligence had failed in its duty in respect of such assignment so that a loss occurred, Mr. O\u2019Gara would be released only to the extent of the loss, but certainly not to a greater extent. The following authorities may be usefully referred to in support of the above propositions. Wulff v. Jay[21]; Capel v. Butler[22]; Strange v. Fooks[23]; Pledge v.

In 1841, while one M. who had entered on the land was in possession, King\u2019s College conveyed it to G. In 1849 G. conveyed to the wife of M., and M. signed the conveyance though not a party to it. In an action by the successors in title of M.\u2019s wife to recover possession of the land the defendants, claiming title through M., set up the statute of limitations, alleging that M. had been in possession twenty years when the land was conveyed to his wife, and that the conveyance to G., in 1841, the grantor not being in possession, was void under the statute of maintenance, and G. had, therefore, nothing to convey in 1849.\nHeld, that it was not proved that the possession of M. began before the grant from the crown, but assuming that it did M. could not avail himself of the statute of maintenance as he would have to establish disseisin of the grantor and the crown could not be disseised; nor would the statute avail as against the patentee as the original entry not being tortious the possession would not become adverse without a new entry.\nHeld further, that if the possession began after the grant the deed to G. in 1841 was not absolutely void under the statute of maintenance but only void as against the party in possession and M. being in possession a conveyance to him would have been good under sec. 4 of the statute and the deed to his wife, a person appointed by him, was equally good. Further, M. by his assent to the conveyance to his wife and subsequent acts was estopped from denying the title of his wife\u2019s grantor. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action in this case was to recover possession of land to which defendants claimed title through one George S. Marsh, and plaintiffs through his wife.\nIn 1828 the land was granted by the crown to King\u2019s College, who conveyed to one Greenshields in 1841. Greenshields conveyed to Mrs. Marsh in 1849, and Marsh executed the conveyance though a party to it. Marsh had been in possession of the land since about 1831, though defendants claimed, and some of the judges in the courts below held, that his possession dated back to 1823 or 1824.\nThe defence set up was the statute of limitations, founded on possession for twenty years before 1849, and that the conveyance to Greenshields was void under the statute of maintenance, 32 Hen. 8, ch. 9, and the conveyance to Mrs. Marsh was necessarily void also as Greenshields had nothing to convey.\nThe trial judge held that defendants\u2019 claim under the statute of maintenance was valid and gave judgment in his favour. This judgment was reversed by the Divisional Court, and the latter decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nRiddell and Webb for the appellants. As to the statute of maintenance, see Elvis v. Archbishop of York[3]; Johnson v. McKenna[4].\nThe execution by Marsh of the conveyance to his wife cannot be invoked as an estoppel. Doe d. Chandler v. Ford[5]; Doe d. Preece v. Howells[6]; Bigelow on Estoppel[7]. Roaf, for the respondent, referred to Bishop of Toronto v. Cantwell[8]; Kennedy v. Lyell[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am unable to concur in the view taken by Mr. Justice Maclennan in the able judgment delivered by him, though I entirely agree in the statement of the law contained in that judgment. I differ from him, however, in the conclusion at which he arrived as to the evidence. I do not think it is established with sufficient certainty that George S. Marsh was in possession at a date anterior to the crown grant to King\u2019s College in 1828. The learned judge who tried the action, Mr. Justice Rose, says in his judgment that Marsh \u201cwas in possession as early as 1831 and probably prior to 1829.\u201d Abraham Singleton, a witness for the plaintiff, does indeed say that he was at the date of the trial in May, 1891, seventy-three years old and that he could remember \u201cfrom when he was five or six years old and that as long back as he can remember George S. Marsh was living there.\u201d This would carry back Marsh\u2019s possession to about 1823 or 1824. It was for the learned trial judge to say whether or not he considered this evidence entitled to weight. If he had considered it safe to act upon it he would no doubt have given effect to it by placing his judgment on the Statute of Limitations which was pleaded and which was relied on by the defendants\u2019 counsel at the trial. For that it was so relied on appears very clearly from the record before us where Mr. Riddell is reported as saying: \u201cAnd we rely on the Statute of Limitations as well.\u201d Case p. 10 line 2.\nHad the learned judge considered that there had been a possession of upwards of twenty years by George S. Marsh subsequent to the patent and prior to the conveyance by Greenshields to Mrs. Marsh of the 9th of May 1849, as there would have been had Marsh been in continuous possession from a date prior to the patent, we should, I feel sure, have found him fixing the commencement of that possession with certainty in his judgment, and also taking some notice of the defence under the Statute of Limitations to which he, however, makes no reference. I therefore conclude that the learned judge was not prepared to find that there was a possession beginning earlier than 1831. The appellant in his factum before this court insists on the same view of the evidence as that which I have indicated. Paragraph 18 is as follows: \u201cMr. Justice Maclennan in his judgment appears to consider that George S. Marsh went into possession in 1823 or 1824. It is submitted that there is no evidence of this, nor evidence that the entry of Marsh was an intrusion or made before the patent.\u201d The conclusion must, therefore, in my judgment be that Marsh did not take possession until after the patent was issued and that he is not proved to have acquired a title under the Statute of Limitations to the four acres he was originally in occupation of at the date of the conveyance to his wife. Had the evidence and finding warranted a contrary conclusion I should have found it difficult to say that the title he might have so acquired under the statute would have been divested by his affixing his signature and seal to a deed to which he was not a formal party.\nThis conclusion, whilst against the appellant so far as the Statute of Limitations is concerned, is, however, in his favour inasmuch at it displaces the foundation of fact upon which Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s judgment rests. Had the facts in evidence warranted a contrary conclusion I should have entirely agreed with that learned judge in his statement of the legal conse- quences. The law as laid down by him is, I think, clear, and his position is amply supported by the authorities he quotes. In order that a deed operating under the Statute of Uses should be void, either under the Statute of Maintenance or by force of that rule of the common law in affirmance of which the statute was passed, it was essential that the grantor should have been disseised. The crown could not have been disseised; such a thing as a disseisin of the crown is, and always has been, unknown in law. A person entering on the possession of the crown is a mere intruder having a possession which can no more be said to be a disseisin than can that of an over-holding tenant. Then the possession if not originally tortious would not without any new entry have become so against the grantees of the crown, King\u2019s College, nor for a like reason against Greenshields the grantee of King\u2019s College. This proposition is established by the quotation from Bacon\u2019s Abridgement cited in Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s judgment. This however does not apply to the present case for the reason before given that there is no foundation in fact for it; and if there had been the same facts would have established the appellants\u2019 case under the Statute of Limitations, a defence which he insists on in the factum he has lodged in support of the present appeal.\nThe decision of the appeal must, therefore, depend on the legal effect of the evidence showing what occurred at the time of the conveyance by Greenshields to Mrs. Marsh. Marsh who had, however, been previously in possession of only four of the five acres comprised in that deed must clearly be taken to have assented to it; although not technically a party to the instrument he signed and sealed the deed. There could be no presumable object in this unless it was for the purpose of showing his assent to it. Moreover the evidence shows that he actually did assent to the conveyance which was made under an arrangement between Greenshields and himself and which it is a reasonable inference was made to his wife at his instance. Then he allowed Greenshields to covenant for a good title and he not only remained in possession under this deed by virtue of which he took an estate for his life in the lands, but in subsequent conveyances made by him he refers to it as a deed under which he derived title. This, in my opinion, is ample not only to create an estoppel in pais or an equitable estoppel, but also as regards this particular conveyance to take the case out of the law of maintenance. Had the conveyance been to Marsh himself for an estate in fee it would be absurd to say that it was void as against any person and I fail to see why it should be said to be void when with Marsh\u2019s assent it conferred upon him, not indeed a fee but an estate for life. This conveyance from Greenshields to the extent of the four acres comes, in my opinion, clearly within the fourth section of the Statute of Maintenance[10] which both the learned Chief Justices have invoked, and I entirely concur in their observations upon it. I feel quite safe in saying that neither the Statute of Maintenance nor the common law made it illegal to release a right of entry in favour of a person actually in possession or to assign it to a person assented to by him. A contrary doctrine would have been most unreasonable since the provision of the common law as well as that of the statute was designed entirely for the protection of the party so assenting. The statute always received a liberal construction restricting its operation to the obvious mischiefs against which it was enacted. Anson v. Lee[11] and Cook v. Field[12], although cases differing in their facts very widely from the present, illustrate this principle. I also refer to Tapp\u2019s treatise on the law of Maintenance[13] as an authority to the same effect. The observations of Draper C.J. in Bishop of Toronto v. Cantwell[14] also go far in the same direction.\nIt is, however, argued that Greenshields had nothing to convey inasmuch as the conveyance of 1841 by the College to him was void. Upon this ground both the trial judge and Mr. Justice Burton base their judgments in favour of the present appellant. I cannot concur in this view. The deed of 1841 was not absolutely void but only as against Marsh and Devlin the parties in possession. Now, had Marsh and Devlin contemporaneously with the execution of that deed attorned as tenants to Greenshields, nobody could reasonably deny that the effect of their doing so would be to make that conveyance which they alone had a right to impugn perfectly valid and effectual. Then upon what reasonable principle should it make any difference that they did not assent by formally attorning by some contemporaneous act but did so after the conveyance was executed, and if they could have effectually done this a day after the deed was executed why should not the same consequence follow when their assent is proved to have been unequivocally given, not a day, but some eight years after the execution of the deed? I am of opinion, even in the absence of direct authority, that we ought not to give such an effect to a statute and rule of law now obsolete as would defeat an honest title, and that on purely technical grounds, by an application at variance with the spirit and the letter of the law itself. Marsh, before the deed of May 1849, had not been in possession of more than four acres. The additional acre comprised in the conveyance to Mrs. Marsh had with 94 acres more been in the possession of Bernard Devlin. Devlin was examined as a witness in the cause; he swears that he was in possession of this one acre and that he came to an arrangement with Adam Henry Meyers the solicitor acting for Mr. Greenshields in pursuance of which the whole five acres including this one acre were assigned by Greenshields to Mrs. Marsh with Marsh\u2019s assent, the arrangement having in fact been made by Marsh himself, and that in further pursuance of the same agreement the remaining 94 acres were conveyed by Greenshields to Devlin himself.\nWith this evidence before us it is in my judgment impossible to say that those claiming under Marsh are not estopped from impugning the deed of 1841 and the title which Greenshields prim\u00e2 facie took thereunder.\nIn conclusion I would add that I am not at all satisfied that the appellant has established that the possession of Marsh and Devlin amounted to disseisin. An adverse possession amounting to disseisin of the grantor would be indispensable to shew a deed void for maintenance and in a case such as the present the party attacking the deed on such a ground should be held to very strict proof. I do not, however, place my judgment on this ground.\nI would further say that it must be remembered that we have not to deal with this case on strict common law principles but that equitable considerations are open on the record before us. This being so I have no doubt that the facts proved are such as to constitute a binding equitable estoppel. I cannot close my judgment without adding that the case was argued with great learning and ability by the learned counsel on both sides.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER AND TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Assuming it to have been competent for George S. Marsh in his lifetime, or for his heirs, to dispute as against his wife or her heirs the validity of the deed of the 9th May, 1849, procured by Marsh to be executed to and in favour of his wife by Greenshields, as to which I express no opinion, it must be admitted that the onus of clearly establishing the facts asserted by the appellants and relied upon by them as invalidating the deed rested upon the appellants, namely, the onus of establishing that at the time that Marsh was negotiating with Greenshields for the purchase, by and in the name of his wife, of the land by that deed expressed to be conveyed by Greenshields to Marsh\u2019s wife, and that, at the very time that Greenshields, by Marsh\u2019s procurement, executed that deed purporting to convey the lands therein mentioned to Marsh\u2019s wife and to her heirs forever, he, Greenshields, had no title, at least as to four-fifth parts of the land, which he could convey, for that he, Marsh, was then himself in actual adverse possession of such four-fifth parts, having acquired such possession by a previous disseizin of Greenshields or of his predecessors in title, and this the appellants, in my opinion, have utterly failed to establish.\nFrom the facts of Marsh negotiating with Greenshields for the purchase by and in the name of his, Marsh\u2019s, wife, of the whole of the land purported to be conveyed to her by the deed, and of his procuring Greenshields to execute the deed to his, Marsh\u2019s, wife, the reasonable inference to be drawn is that whatever possession Marsh may have had of any part of the land so purported to be conveyed was for and on behalf of his wife, and was by Greenshields\u2019 permission and consent and not at all by a title adverse to the title of Grreenshields.\nI concur, therefore, in the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario and of Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Webb, Hooey & Mills.\nSolicitors for respondents: Roaf & Roaf.\n[1] 19 Ont.

J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL\nLoading of steamer-Accident-Neglect of usual precaution-Liability of employer.\nWhere two stevedores are independently engaged in loading the same steamer and, owing to the negligence of the employees of the one, an employee of the other is injured the former stevedore is liable in damages for such injury.\nThe failure to observe a precaution usually taken in and about such work is evidence of negligence. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, which awarded two thousand dollars damages to the respondent.\nThe respondent, the wife of one Joseph Gravel, who was killed on the 2nd August, 1888, while working on board the steamer \"Alcides\" of the Donaldson line, by falling from the main deck into the hold, brought an action in damages against the owners of the steam-ship, the employer of the deceased and the present appellant, claiming $6,000 damages from them for her husband's death; on the ground that one or all three were responsible.\nBy the evidence given at the trial it appeared that on the day of the accident the appellant, a stevedore, had men engaged in loading the steamer with sacks of flour. The loading of this cargo was effected by means of a steam winch, but at the same time one Lee, another stevedore, had men engaged in loading cattle. While the loading of the flour was going on, and when the time came to fasten the cattle in the compartments near the hatchway No. 2, Lees men asked appellant and his men to suspend the loading of the flour for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but appellant refused.\nThe deceased, Joseph Gravel, one of Lee's men replacing one Jeanette also employed by Lee, was placed at the end of the hatchway No. 2 with a lighted lantern to enable the men Who were driving the cattle on the ship to fasten them in the compartments, and while he was still there in the discharge of his duty a load of flour, to which no rope was attached to guide it in its descent, was allowed to swing over the width of the vessel, and, being lowered outside of the hatchway on the return movement, the load struck him and precipitated him to the bottom of the hold, and six days later Gravel died from the effects of the injury. There was also evidence that Lee's men had notified Gravel that he was in a dangerous position, and that there was no necessity for his standing in such a dangerous position.\nThe Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, held that the appellant alone was liable, and awarded the respondent $2,000 damages.\nGeoffrion Q.C., for appellant, contended that the death of Gravel had not been caused by reason of any fault, negligence or want of skill, but because Gravel had been placed in a dangerous position by his employers while the appellant was loading flour.\nBonin Q.C., for respondent, contended that the evidence fully justified the findings of the courts below, that the accident was due to the want of skill on the part of appellant's employees and the neglect to observe the usual precautions taken in loading flour with steam winches.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was of Opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Cet appel est d'un jugement rendu par la Cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al confirmant le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Montr\u00e9al en date du 11 mars 1890 oui avait condamn\u00e9 l'appelant \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e la somme de $2,000 de dommages, avec frais d'action.\nLes faits suivants out donn\u00e9 lieu inaction. L'intim\u00e9e est la veuve de Joseph Gravel, qui fut tue pendant qu'il travaillait au chargement du steamer Alcides le 2 ao\u00fbt 1888.\nLe soir de l'accident Gravel se tenait sur le pont du steamer avec une lanterne \u00e0 la main, pour \u00e9clairer les hommes employ\u00e9s par John Lee, \u00e0 placer et attacher dans les compartiments places sur le pont les animaux que celui-ci faisait mettre \u00e0 bord du steamer. Bans le m\u00eame temps l'appelant faisait un chargement de fleur \u00e0 bord du m\u00eame steamer.\nLa fleur \u00e9tait prise sur le quai par une grue \u00e0 vapeur pour \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, par l'\u00e9coutille, dans la cale du vaisseau, mais par une man\u0153uvre maladroite une certaine quantit\u00e9 de sacs de fleur fut descendue trop vite en dehors de l'\u00e9coutille, et dans son mouvement de retour vint frapper Joseph Gravel et le pr\u00e9cipita an fond de cale d'une hauteur de vingt pieds. Le malheureux fut relev\u00e9 plus mort que vif et mourut au bout de quelques jours des suites de l'accident. La question est de savoir si la mort de Gravel a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la faute de l'appelant on par celle des personas qu'il employait au chargement de sa fleur.\nIl ne pent y avoir aucune difficult\u00e9 sur la cause imm\u00e9diate de l'accident. L'appelant reconna\u00eet dans son plaidoyer que Gravel a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 et jet\u00e9 \u00e0 fond de cale par les sacs' de fleur qu'il faisait mettre \u00e0 bord. Apr\u00e8s avoir dit que Gravel se trouvait dans un endroit dangereux, il ajoute: \" C'est dans cet endroit qu'il \" aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 par les sacs de farine dans leur \" mouvement de retour vers la dite \u00e9coutille et pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9 dans le fond de la cale du dit steamer.\"\nDe chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9coutille n\u00b0 2 se trouvait des compartiments pour les animaux et lorsque le temps de les y placer fut arriv\u00e9, Lee et ses employ\u00e9s, comprenant l\u00e9 danger qu'il y avait \u00e0 placer ces animaux pendant que se faisait aussi le chargement de la farine, demand\u00e8rent \u00e0 l'appelant de suspendre son chargement pour dix minutes ou un quart d'heure, mais Brown refusa cette suspension de dix minutes pour la raison que le' steamer devait laisser le lendemain matin.\nSi Brown \u00e9tait \u00e0 la rigueur dans son droit en refusant de suspendre son chargement pour permettre l'embarquement des b\u0153ufs sans danger pour les hommes qui v travaillait il \u00e9tait aussi de son strict devoir de prendre toutes les pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires pour ne pas mettre en danger la vie de ceux que le chargement des b\u0153ufs for\u00e7ait de travailler de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9coutille. Il devait alors prendre les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour arr\u00eater le mouvement de balancier des charges de farine qu'il avait jusqu'alors laiss\u00e9 faire sans grand danger. Mais depuis que le chargement des b\u0153ufs \u00e9tait commenc\u00e9 il deviate voir \u00e0 ce que la descente des sacs dans l'\u00e9coutille fut dirig\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas mettre en danger ceux qui travaillaient do chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9. Avec de la prudence et de l'habilet\u00e9 de la part de celui qui conduisait l'engin de la grue, on pouvait facilement \u00e9viter l'accident, mais comment Brown ouvrait-il esp\u00e9rer trouver ces qualit\u00e9s chez un ancien F charretier qui, de l'endroit on ii \u00e9tait place ne pouvait voir Gravel ni ceux qui travaillaient avec lui. Les mouvements de d\u00e9part d'arr\u00eat ou de descente des sacs \u00e9taient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s sur les ordres d'un autre employ\u00e9 qui se tenait sur les ballots de foin plac\u00e9s sur le pont et qui ne pouvait voir cc qui se passait en bas. Les arrangements \u00e9taient certainement imprudents et maladroit\u2019s et ne pouvaient faire autrement que de causer un accident.\nIl ne pouvait y avoir d'accident en prenant les pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires pour faire descendre les sacs de farine directement dans la cale du vaisseau. C'est le mouvement de balancier qui leur \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'accident. Ce mouvement cut pu \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par une amarre attach\u00e9e d'un bout aux sacs et de l'autre bout retenue \u00e0 terre, an moyen de laquelle on aurait dirig\u00e9 la charge jusqu'\u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e au-dessus de l'\u00e9coutille o\u00f9 elle aurait pu \u00eatre descendue sans inconv\u00e9nient. Cette man\u0153uvre est constamment usit\u00e9e dans les ports et c'est une grande faute que de ne pas y avoir en recours surtout dans un temps o\u00f9 il se faisait un double chargement sur cc steamer dont le pont \u00e9tait rempli d'ouvriers presses d'en finir le chargement.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que l'accident n'est arriv\u00e9 que par la faute de Gravel, pour avoir change de place avec un nomm\u00e9 Joinette. Le foreman de Lee Clerany, avait donn\u00e9 l'ordre \u00e0 Gravel de distribuer dans les diff\u00e9rentes stalles les cordes qui devaient servir \u00e0 attacher les animaux. Cet ouvrage fini aucun autre ouvrage ne lui fut assign\u00e9 en particulier. Il devait faire comme les autres prendre l'ouvrage qu'il y avait \u00e0 faire. Apr\u00e8s avoir distribu\u00e9 les cordes ii se mit \u00e0 attacher des animaux, mais devenant effray\u00e9 il alla trouver Joinette qui tenait une lanterne pour \u00e9clairer les hommes et lui demanda de changer de place avec lui. Joinette y consentit. Il se pla\u00e7a \u00e0 l'eudroit on \u00e9tait Joinette et ii y \u00e9tait encore lorsqu'il fut renvers\u00e9 \u00e0 fond de cale. Il devait rester \u00e0 cet endroit particulier pour \u00e9clairer ceux qui attachaient les animaux dans les stalles et aussi le chemin par lequel on faisait entrer le b\u00e9tail dans le steamer. Gravel devait se tenir pr\u00e9s de l'\u00e9coutille, afin de ne pas emp\u00eacher les animaux d'arriver. Joinette dit que c'est l\u00e0 qu'il s'\u00e9tait place lui-m\u00eame et qu'il n'y avait pas de danger l\u00e0. IL \u00e9tait \u00e0 son poste, par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, dans l'exercice de ses fonctions et non pas volontairement lorsqu'il fut frapp\u00e9. Arave \u00e9tait tout aussi qualifi\u00e9 qu'un autre pour tenir la lanterne et son age n'\u00e9tait pas un obstacle \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de cette fonction.\nL'accident est arriv\u00e9 non parce que arvale \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9coutille, mais par\u00e9e que le conducteur de l'engin de la grue avait par inattention, n\u00e9gligence et imprudence fait balancer en rond les sacs de fleur en les hissant trop haut et trop vite et en les abaissant avant qu'ils fussent vis-\u00e0-vis l'\u00e9coutille. C'est l\u00e0 qu'ils devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s an lieu de balayer le pont. Gravel remplissait son devoir et il avait droit de s'attendre que les sacs ne l'atteindraient pas, et ils ne l'auraient pas frapp\u00e9 si le chargement eut \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec la prudence et l'habilet\u00e9 ordinaire.\nPar ces motifs, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred with Fournier J.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I do not think that the appellant can be made responsible in the present action unless it can be shown that the death of the deceased was occasioned by some act or default of the appellant amounting to the neglect of some duty owed by him to the deceased. There was no such duty owed by reason of any relationship existing between the appellant and the deceased. The latter was not ii the employment of the appellant in the work in which he was engaged as a stevedore in loading the steamer \u201cAlcides \u201cwith sacks of flour. While the appellant's men were lawfully engaged in that employment the deceased was placed (not by the appellant nor even with his permission, but on the contrary, against his will, in the dangerous position in which he was when he met with the accident which occasioned his death,) by a person employed to put cattle on board of the same steamer.\nThe position in which the deceased was placed by his employers was known to them to be a place of danger. The only reason for its being a dangerous place which is suggested was the possibility of the occurrence of the very accident which did take place, namely: the possibility of the deceased being struck by a sack of flour swinging round and striking him while in the process of being put on board the vessel. The deceased appears to have been so stricken and to have been thrown into the hold by a sack of flour which not having been caught and stopped by appellant's servants so as to drop directly into the hold, swung outside and so struck the deceased. He was thus killed by the very accident occurring, the possibility of which occurring caused the deceased and his employer to know that the place where the deceased was put by his employers, was dangerous. If it was dangerous to any of the men employed in putting the cattle on board to put them on board while the appellant continued to be engaged at the work for which he was employed, the appellant cannot be blamed for an occurrence consequential upon the so putting the cattle on board and which but for the so putting them on board would not have occurred.\nThe appellant's not having adopted measures (not at all necessary for the safety of the persons employed in ' putting the sacks of flour on board,) but which might have prevented the accident happening to the deceased which caused his death if when the appellant undertook the employment in which he was engaged, he could and should have foreseen that any person would be, or was likely to be, lawfully where the deceased was placed by his employer, cannot in my opinion, constitute a default amounting to neglect of any duty owed by the appellant to the deceased, whose presence where he was when he came to his death was not only not foreseen, so far as appears, but under the circumstances in which the deceased appears to have been placed there, was against the will of the appellant. Under those circumstances I do not think that the appellant can be held to be responsible in this action for the unfortunate occurrence which caused the death of the deceased. This appeal therefore in my opinion should be allowed.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred with the majority of the court that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Geoffrion, Dorion & Allan.\nSolicitors for respondent : Taillon, Bonin & Dufault.\n[1] Q.

About two-thirds of the farm was heavily wooded, and the rest of it was cleared and cultivated. The defendant became the purchaser of the trees and timber upon the land, under an agreement, which provided among other things, that the purchaser should have \u201cfull liberty to enter into and upon the said lands for the purpose of removing the trees and timber, at such times and in such manner as he may think proper,\u201d but reserved to the plaintiff the full enjoyment of the land \u201csave and in so far as may be necessary for the cutting and removing of the trees and timber.\u201d To have removed the timber through the wooded land at the time it was removed, it would have involved an expenditure which would have possibly amounted to a sacrifice of the greater portion of the timber.\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the court below, that the defendants had a right to remove the timber by the most direct and available route, provided they acted in good faith and not unreasonably, and the reservation in favour of the plaintiff did not minimize or modify the defendants\u2019 right under the general grant of the trees, to remove the trees across the cleared land. Gwynne J., dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Boyd C., in the Chancery Division.\nThe appellant (plaintiff) was the owner of a farm of some 500 acres of land, in the 8th concession of Chat- ham. About a third of the whole tract was cleared and cultivated, and the rest was heavily wooded. In 1887 the plaintiff sold under an agreement to one A. Tierce, who afterwards assigned to the respondent, the trees and timber upon the land, except black ash and white oak then standing growing and being upon the said land, with a proviso that it should be removed within a certain period. The deed under which the respondent cut and hauled the timber contained the following way-leave for taking the timber:\n\u201cThe said party of the second part, his agents, servants and workmen, with or without horses, carts, wagons or sleighs, shall at all times within three years from the said first day of March now next, have full liberty to enter into and upon the said lands, and to fell the said trees and timber in such manner as he or they shall think fit, and cut and convert the same into such convenient logs, bundles or stacks as he or they shall think proper, with full liberty to bring horses, cattle, wagons, trucks, carts and sleighs in and upon the said land for the purpose of removing the said trees and timber, at such times and in such manner as he or they may think proper.\u201d And also the following covenant for title: \u201cAnd the said party of the first part for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, covenants, promises and agrees to and with the party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that he has a good title to (sic) fee simple to the said lands, and good right, full power, and absolute authority to sell and dispose of the said timber and trees, and that they are free from all encumbrances of any kind whatsoever.\u201d\nThe deed also contained the following covenant on the part of the purchaser:\u2014\n\u201cThe said party of the second part for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenants with said party of the first part, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that whenever he commences cutting on any portion of said lands he will lumber said lands clean, except said black ash and white oak, and that said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, shall have the full and free use and enjoyment of the said land during said three years, without any interruption on the part of said party of the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, or his or their workmen, servants or agents, save in so far as may be necessary for the cutting and removing of said trees and timber.\u201d\nIn July, 1890, while the respondent had still till the end of the year to cut and remove timber, the appellant sued the defendants for unnecessarily tearing down the plaintiff\u2019s fences and hauling timber over his crops and otherwise injuring his property and causing damage, and obtained an interlocutory injunction. The defendant denied the wrongful acts complained of, and said that he could not remove the timber advantageously without great additional expense and delay without going through the plaintiff\u2019s fields to some extent, and that he did so with as little damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property as possible, and also claimed he had a right to do what he did, and he counter-claimed for the loss suffered by reason of the injunction.\nAt the trial it was shown that the lumber could have been hauled to the public roads without hauling across the cleared land, but at a greater cost and expense, and the Court of Chancery held that the timber under the agreement had to be taken away by the defendant without causing any interruption in the use of the cultivated part by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal on the contrary held that the timber might be taken across the cleared land. M. Wilson Q.C. for the appellant:\u2014At the the time of the institution of the proceedings, there were lumber roads within the wooded land and also cross roads, and we contend that reading the covenant and the grant of way-leave together, the respondent had no right to cross over the cleared lands and growing crops. Under the written agreement we only had to show that it was not necessary for the purchasers to cross our crops, and this question of fact the Chancellor found in our favour, and moreover prevented us from giving more evidence on this question of fact.\nIt was of course necessary to cross the cultivated lands in order to remove a small portion of the timber which was surrounded thereby, but that is not in question in this action.\nBut even if the agreement is to be construed as giving the defendants the right to cross over plaintiff\u2019s crops and interfere with his use and enjoyment of the farm lands in every case where he could not reasonably avoid doing so in their (defendants\u2019) interest, and if the word \u201cnecessary\u201d is to be read as \u201creasonably necessary for the convenient and beneficial removal of his timber,\u201d then we contend that the plaintiff was prepared at the trial to show, and should be now allowed to show that it was not reasonably necessary even in that sense to cross and destroy the plaintiff\u2019s crops at the time and place in question, and that no man of ordinary judgment and prudence would have injured and sacrificed the crops (as defendants were about to do and were restrained from doing) for the trifling benefit that would be gained thereby. In fact there would be no gain even to the defendants thereby because the old existing ways and timber roads were good and convenient for the use of the defendants.\nD. McCarthy Q.C. for the respondent:\u2014The agreement in question is a grant in the most unqualified terms, of all the trees and timber save the two kinds specified, on the appellant\u2019s lands in question, and with this grant there is expressly provided an unlimited lease or license respecting the removal of the timber.\nThere is no restriction, either by express provision or by implication, by which the respondent was limited to any part of the lands comprised in the description, lots 21, 22 and south-west half of 23, either as to ingress, use or egress, for the purpose of removing the timber; and there is, on the contrary, the express provision that all such shall be as the respondent may think proper. The effect of the covenant forming part of the agreement, is merely to provide for the use by the appellant of the lots subject to the interruption necessary for the purposes of the respondent, under the grant, and leave or liberty expressed in the agreement. The covenant clearly must, under the agreement and all the circumstances, be construed as subject to the grant and leave and as bearing the meaning reasonably necessary, and I submit that the proper construction of the portions of the agreement now under discussion is that put upon them by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal.\nWhile submitting that under the terms of the instrument respondent was clearly entitled to pass over any part of the lots mentioned, I also contend that in the case of a more limited construction of his rights herein, he was acting legally, and within his powers, in using the way which the appellant sought to restrain him from using, because it was a way necessary for the most convenient enjoyment of the grant, under the authority of Morris v; Edgington[2]. And especially is the convenience of the grantee to be considered where, as in the present case, an unreasonable amount of labour and expense is required to render any other way available for use, i.e., labour and expense disproportionate and excessive in comparison with the value of the grant, Pettingill v. W. Porter[3]. As to their being a right of way in the case of timber, there is no question; Plowd. Com. 16.\nFurther, on the construction of the instrument, I also contend that to warrant the appellant in placing the restriction he has sought to place on the use of a way by the respondent, he should have made an express provision in the instrument defining the way. \u201cIn the case of a way by grant the language of the instrument can be referred to, and it is of course for the Court to construe that language and in the absence of any clear intention of the parties, the maxim that a grant must be construed most strongly against the grantor, must be applied.\u201d Williams v. James[4].\nWilson Q.C. in reply referred specially to Dand v. Kingscote[5].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU, J.J., concurred with SEDGEWICK, J.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in the month of February, 1887, was seized in fee simple of lots 21 and 22 and the west half of lot 23 in the township of Chatham, which said lots of land were bounded on the north and south by concession roads On the north part of lot 22 adjoining the concession road there, was situate his dwelling house and garden with a farm yard and suitable buildings thereon. He had about 30 acres of land adjoining, cleared, fenced in and under cultivation, of which about one half was situate on the north end of lot No. 22, and the other half on the north end of lot No. 21, which latter consisted of meadow, in the midst of which some few elm trees still remained stand- ing; the residue of the above lots consisted of wood lands wherein was standing a great variety of timber trees. Through this forest part there were several old bush or lumber roads leading from the public highways on either side back into the woods which had been made and had been in use for many years by persons to whom the plaintiff had sold the privilege of cutting down and removing timber trees there growing for the purpose of hauling the timber when cut from the woods to the public highways and so to market. Being so seized of such bush and cleared land an agreement under seal was upon the 19th day of February, 1887, entered into by and between the said plaintiff of the first part, and one Alexander Tierce of the second part, whereby it was covenanted and agreed as follows:\nThe said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the payments hereinafter mentioned to be made to him, hereby grants, bargains, sells and assigns all the trees and timber except black ash and white oak now standing, growing, lying or being in and upon that certain parcel of land and premises situate, lying and being in the township of Chatham, in the county of Kent, in the province of Ontario, containing by admeasurement acres, be the same more or less, and being composed of lots twenty\u2011one, twenty-two and the southwest half of lot twenty-three in the eighth concession of the said township of Chatham, to have and to hold the said trees and timber to the said party of the second part, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, to and for his and their sole and only use; provided, however, that they remove the same within three years from the first day of March now next, after which date all trees or timber not removed shall revert to and be the property of the said party of the first part, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\nThe said party of the second part, his agents, servants and workmen with or without horses, carts, wagons or sleighs shall at all times within three years from the said first day of March now next, have full liberty to enter into and upon the said lands and to fell the said trees and timber in such manner as he or they shall think fit, and cut and convert the same into such convenient logs, bundles or stacks as he or they shall think proper, with full liberty to bring horses, cattle, wagons, trucks, carts and sleighs in and upon the said land for the purpose of removing the said trees and timber at such times and in such manner as he or they may think proper.\nThen followed a covenant by Tierce for payment of a specific sum for the said trees and timber in the manner therein stated; then a covenant by the plaintiff that he had a. good title to the lands whereon the said trees were growing, and full right and absolute authority to sell the said timber; then came the clause following, viz.:\u2014\nThe said party of the second part, for himself, his heirs, executors\u2019 administrators and assigns, covenants with the party of the first part, his heirs, executors, administrators, that whenever he commences cutting on any portion of the said lands he will lumber said lands clear, except said black ash and white oak, and that said party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, shall have the free use and enjoyment of the said land during the said three years without any interruption on the part of the said party of the second part, his executors, administrators or assigns, his or their workmen, servants or agents, save in so far as may be necessary for the cutting and removing of said trees and timber.\nThe residue of the agreement it is unnecessary to set forth, as it has no bearing upon the present case. In or about the month of January, 1889, Tierce assigned all his interest in the said contract to the defendant, Aaron Gordon. In the month of January, 1890, the time for the termination of the contract being then shortly approaching, the defendant, in consideration of the further sum of $500.00, paid by him to the plaintiff, procured from the plaintiff an extention of the time appointed in the agreement of the 19th February, 1887, for the removal of the timber thereunder until the 30th day of March, 1891. In the month of June, 1890, the defendant, for the first time apparently, asserted a right to haul timber which he had cut down in the woodland lying south of the plaintiff\u2019s cultivated land through his meadow to the concession road at the north end, and to pull down the plaintiff\u2019s fences for the purpose, and he accordingly did so, and there- by, as the plaintiff contended, much damage had been done to his meadow, as well by cattle thereby getting into his meadow through the broken down fences as by the hauling of the timber through the meadow. Against this contention and conduct of the defendant the plaintiff remonstrated, but without effect, for the defendant persisted in the assertion of the right which he claimed, and continued to assert it by hauling the timber so cut in the woods south of the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land, not only through his meadow on the north end of lot 21, but also through a crop of beans which he had growing on the north end of lot 22, and so through the plaintiff\u2019s farm yard to the concession road; and for that purpose took down divers of the fences and gates of the plaintiff. In short, the contention of the defendant was, and still is, that he had perfect right by the terms of the contract of the 19th February, 1887, to haul the timber cut by him in the woods south of the plaintiff\u2019s clearance, through any part of the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land that was most convenient to the defendant, qualified only by the condition that he should do no more damage to the plaintiff\u2019s crops on such cleared land than was reasonably and necessarily attendant upon the hauling timber through them to the road.\nUpon the 15th day of July, 1890, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant by a writ issued out of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, by an endorsement upon which writ the plaintiff claimed an injunction and damages upon the ground that the defendant, as assignee of the said agreement of the 19th February, 1887, had unlawfully and without authority, and in a manner which was wholly unnecessary for the removal of timber, cut under the said agreement, entered upon, the plaintiff\u2019s cleared and tilled land with men and horses, &c., and had broken down the plaintiff\u2019s fences, destroyed his crops, left his farm open to cattle, and otherwise greatly and unnecessarily injured the plaintiff and threatened to continue so to do. Upon the 16th July, 1890, the plaintiff obtained upon affidavit, an interim injunction against the defendant\u2019s interference with the plaintiff\u2019s said cleared land until the 18th of said month of July, or until the motion to continue the said injunction to be made on that day should have been disposed of or until the court should make further order to the contrary. At this time the few elm trees which remained standing in the meadow had not been cut down, and the only contention existing between the plaintiff and the defendant was as to the right claimed by the defendant, to haul the timber cut down by him in the forest land, lying south of the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land, through the cleared land to the concession road, and so the interim injunction operated only as it was intended to operate against defendant\u2019s hauling such timber across the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land and the crops growing therein. Upon the said 18th of July the motion to continue the said injunction came up for argument before Mr. Justice Falconbridge, who, after having heard the case argued upon affidavits filed on both sides, in pronouncing judgment expressed his opinion to be that the evidence enormously preponderated in favour of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the brush roads through the woods by which as the plaintiff insisted that all timber cut in the woods south of his cleared land if hauled to the concession road on the north end should be hauled, could have been used by the defendant, and that this was the only way which was in contemplation when the extension of time was granted to the defendant, and that it in fact was but about 50 rods longer than the way taken by the defendant across the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land, however, to prevent serious injury happening to the defendant by his continuing the injunction, he added as follows:\nOn plaintiff undertaking to allow the defendant Aaron Gordon, if he wishes to use the way already offered by plaintiff over that indicated by D.H.K. or D.H.E., on McGeorge and Flater\u2019s plan filed on this motion, and on plaintiff also undertaking if required to grant a further reasonable extension of time for taking off the timber for the sum of $50, the injunction will be continued to the hearing with usual undertaking by defendant as to damages. Injunction dissolved as to the timber surrounded by meadow which defendants can take off by a way which will be convenient for them and do as little injury as possible to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff alleges that he never did give or consent to give, and that he was never asked by the defendant to give any undertaking to grant to the defendant any further extension of time for taking off the timber, and that he never took out an order upon the judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbridge, nor did he accept the terms and conditions thereof, and that in point of fact no order was ever issued upon the said judgment, however, the defendant never did thereafter haul over the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land, any timber cut down in the woods south thereof. The way indicated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Falconbridge by the letters D.H.K. and D.H.E. were ways which the plaintiff had offered to allow the defendant to haul his timber along, and which was across a portion of the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land, but which was in fallow, and where the hauling of timber could do no damage, but this offer of the plaintiff the defendant had declined to accept, insisting upon his claim of right to cross the plaintiff\u2019s clearance wherever was most convenient to the defendant as afore is mentioned.\nThe case was brought down for trial before the Chancellor of Ontario in the month of November, 1890, when the contention on behalf of the plaintiff was: 1st. That under the agreement of the 19th February, 1887, the defendant had no right to cross the plaintiff\u2019s cultivated land, except for the purpose of removing the elm trees growing in the meadow, when they should be cut down, as to which there was no contestation, that timber not having been then yet cut; and\n2nd. That even if the agreement did give the defendant the right to haul out the timber cut in the wood south of the plaintiff\u2019s cultivated land, over such cultivated land the defendant had exercised such right in a wanton, unreasonable and unnecessary manner.\nThe defendant\u2019s contention was the direct converse of both of these propositions. After the plaintiff had produced three witnesses in support of his case, and while he had several witnesses in court which he said he intended to call, the learned counsel for the defendant asked the learned Chancellor to rule upon the construction of the contract before any more witnesses should be called, this the learned Chancellor did, and held that as to the timber cut outside of the cleared land, it was the duty of the purchaser of the timber to haul out that timber through the bush land, without any interruption with the use of the cleared land by the proprietor, and he declined to hear the further evidence which was offered by the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the defendant proceeded to produce evidence upon the part of defendant at great length, and after hearing all the witnesses called by the defendant, twelve in number, the learned Chancellor again pronounced his judgment, affirming his former expression of opinion as to the construction of the contract, adding that as the injunction to which he held the plaintiff to have been entitled had served its purpose, he did not intend to continue it, and he asked the learned counsel for the plaintiff whether, if the season should turn out to be such that the defendant could not remove the timber within the time specified in the agreement for extension of time made in January, the plaintiff would object to its being removed during the dry season in the following summer through the woods, to which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel answered that the plaintiff could not consent thereto, and he again insisted that he had a large number of witnesses in court which he desired to call in support of his contention, to which the learned Chancellor replied that he knew that, and that his intention was to shut out that evidence, as, if his law as to the construction of the contract was right, he did not want to hear it, and that he would rule finally upon the case for the purpose of excluding further evidence. He then gave his reasons at large for the judgment he had pronounced as to the construction of the contract and upon the evidence as it had been taken, and he concluded by expressing the opinion that on the undertaking which, as he said, he understood had been given before Judge Falconbridge, he thought the defendant should have until the termination of the dry season in the following summer to remove the timber, upon payment of $50. To this suggestion and to any further extension of time the plaintiff, through his counsel, refused to consent, whereupon the learned Chancellor said that he considered there had been an acceptance of Judge Falconbridge\u2019s judgment, and an acting upon it for the benefit of the plaintiff, and he pronounced judgment accordingly, which, as formally drawn up, is as follows:\u2014\nDated 26th November, 1890.\nThis action coming on this day for trial in the presence of counsel for both parties, and hearing read the pleadings, and upon hearing part of the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff and all of the evidence adduced on the part of the defendants, but without hearing the further evidence offered by the plaintiff in reply and upon hearing what was alleged by counsel. 1. This court doth order and direct that upon payment of the sum of $50 on or before the 30th day of May, 1891, to the plaintiff or his solicitors, the defendants do have the privilege of going upon the said lands during the months of June, July, August and September, A.D., 1891, for the purpose of removing the timber in the manner and by the ways mentioned in the agreement referred to in the pleadings, the defendants by their counsel undertaking not to interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s use and enjoyment of the cultivated portions of the said lands, save only to such extent as may be necessary for the removal of timber surrounded by cultivated lands which cannot otherwise be reached, and in the removal of the last mentioned timber, undertaking to do as little damage to such cultivated portions as possible, under the circumstances.\n2nd. And this court doth order and adjudge that this action be referred to the Master of this Court at Chatham to inquire and state what damages the plaintiff has sustained by reason of the defendants having unlawfully and without authority hauled timber, logs, bolts and cordwood across the cleared or cultivated portion of the plaintiff\u2019s land and thereby injured the plaintiff\u2019s growing crops, and also what damages, if any, done by the defendants to the plaintiff\u2019s fences, and black ash in the statement of claim referred to, and also what, if anything, is due to the defendant in respect of his counter-claim.\n3rd. And this court doth reserve further directions and the question of costs until after the said master shall have made his report.\nR. O\u2019HARA,\nDeputy-Registrar.\nBoth the defendant and the plaintiff appealed from this judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the defendant insisting, among other reasons of appeal stated by him, that the construction placed by the learned Chancellor upon the agreement is erroneous, and that the rights of the defendant being, as the defendant contended they were, given by express grant over the whole of the lands, the entries made by them (on the plaintiff\u2019s cultivated land) for the purpose of removing the timber were justified, and submitting that upon the evidence he was entitled to have the plaintiff\u2019s action dismissed with costs and the defendant\u2019s counter-claim allowed with costs, with a reference as to the amount and as to the damages suffered by the interim injunction, or in any event that there should be a new trial with costs to be paid by the plaintiff; and the plaintiff insisting, among other things, that the learned Chancellor had no jurisdiction to alter the agreement between the parties by giving the extension of time for removal of the timber purported to be granted by the decree or judgment, for that the plaintiff never had consented to the same, and that the clause purporting to give such extension of time should be struck out of the judgment.\nUpon these appeals the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered and adjudged that the appeal of the defendant should be allowed with costs, and that that part of the judgment of the learned Chancellor, whereby it was adjudged that the plaintiff should have a reference to inquire and state what damages he has sustained by reason of the defendant\u2019s having unlawfully and without authority hauled timber, logs, bolts and cordwood across the cleared and cultivated portion of the plaintiff\u2019s land and thereby injured the plaintiff\u2019s growing crops, should be and the same was thereby reversed, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages in respect of said matters should be dismissed, and that the injunction granted on the interlocutory application therefor by the plaintiff and at the trial should be and the same was thereby dissolved; and it was further ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff should pay to the defendant the general costs of the action forthwith after taxation.\nAnd it was further ordered and adjudged that the said judgment of the learned Chancellor should be further varied by directing that the reference ordered by the said judgment to ascertain what damages, if any, had been done by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s fences and black ash should be confined to acts of negligence wantonly done by the defendants in excess of authority, and shall not embrace injury unavoidably done in felling the timber, unless caused wantonly or carelessly by the defendant, and that the costs of such reference should be reserved until the master shall have made his report.\nAnd it was further ordered and adjudged that the counter claims of the defendant should be the subject of reference to the master, and should include also the claim for timber taken and used by the plaintiff, unless it is established to the satisfaction of the said master that there was an agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff that the same should not be paid for, and shall also include the claim for damages alleged to have been suffered by the defendant by reason of the said injunction; and it was further ordered and adjudged that the costs of the said counter-claim should be reserved until after the said master shall have made his report.\nThe plaintiff had I think just ground of appeal against the first paragraph of the formal judgment of the Divisional Court which ordered and directed that the defendant should have an extension of time until the end of the month of September, 1891, for the purpose of removing the timber. Such a direction was wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the learned Chancellor to make without the express consent of the plaintiff who, as appears by the record, instead of giving such consent expressly objected to any such adjudication being made and to the jurisdiction of the learned Chancellor to make it. The learned Chancellor appears to have considered himself warranted in directing that clause to be inserted in the decree or judgment of the court by reason of what was contained in the judgment as pronounced by Mr. Justice Falconbridge when the matter of the injunction was argued before him in July, 1890. But what Mr. Justice Falconbridge did really amounted to no more than announcing to the parties, that upon the plaintiff undertaking to allow the defendant Aaron Gordon, if he wishes, to use the way which the plaintiff had already offered him, and which was indicated by certain letters upon a map or plan filed on the argument, and upon the plaintiff also undertaking if required, to grant a further reasonable time for taking off the timber for the sum of $50, the injunction should be continued to the hearing. This was announced as a suggestion to the parties by the learned judge, and it does not appear to have been accepted and acted upon by either the defendant or the plaintiff. Aaron Gordon does not appear to have ever expressed a wish to use the way which had been formally offered to him by the plaintiff and refused by him, nor to have asked for any further extension of time for removal of the timber as was suggested by Mr. Justice Falconbridge that he should before the plaintiff should be called upon to give an undertaking for an extension of the time as might be required; and further there is no evidence whatever that the plaintiff ever was asked to give or did give, but on the contrary the plaintiff alleges and he is not contradicted, that he never was asked to give or did give, any undertaking or consent to any further extension of time for removal of the timber being given to the defendant. If indeed the plaintiff had procured an order to issue in the terms of the learned judge\u2019s suggestion and served such order on the defendant, it might perhaps have been competent for the learned Chancellor to have treated such an act of the plaintiff as an undertaking to grant a reasonable time and to have given jurisdiction to the learned Chancellor to direct what would be such reasonable time, but no order ever was made or issued in the matter, and in view of the express refusal of the plaintiff at the trial to consent to any further extension of time and to the learned Chancellor having any jurisdiction as to alter the contract existing between the parties, and to insert in his judgment any order for the extension of time as he expressed an intention of doing, it must, I think, be admitted beyond all question that this clause in the formal judgment of the court, inserted upon the authority of the learned Chancellor, was wholly beyond his jurisdiction and that of the court and was erroneously inserted and should have been expunged from the judgment by the Court of Appeal for Ontario; and as we are obliged to pronounce the judgment which should have been pronounced by that court, that clause must be expunged even now from the learned Chancellor\u2019s judgment as having been ultra vires, whether the plaintiff shall or shall not derive any benefit from its being expunged at this late period when the extended time has elapsed and the defendant has enjoyed the benefit of its having been inserted in the formal judgment of the court. For this reason alone, I think the present appeal must be allowed to this extent and with costs, but the judgment of the Court of Appeal is in my opinion erroneous in other respects and should be reversed.\nIt orders and adjudges that the counter-claims of the defendant shall be the subject of reference to the Master and shall include the claim for timber taken and used by the plaintiff unless it shall be established to the satisfaction of the Master that there was an agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff that the same should not be paid for; and shall also include the claim for damages alleged to have been suffered by the defendant by reason of the injunction.\nWith respect to these counter-claims it appears that the learned Chancellor received all the evidence offered by the defendant in support of them\u2014they were as follows: 1st.\nFor certain elm timber alleged to have been taken by the plaintiff and converted to his own use\n$ 100.00\n2nd.\nEstimated damages caused by plaintiff forbidding defendants and their employees to remove timber and threatening arrest for tresspass\u2014loss of wages.\n100.00\n3rd.\nEstimated loss to logs by reason of injunction\n340.00\n4th.\nEstimated damages to 67 cords by injunction\n83.75\n5th.\nEstimated damages by stoppage of mill at Dresdon owing to want of stock, which defendants were prevented from hauling and by defendants being prevented fulfilling contracts entered into by Aaron Gordon\n1,576.25\nAs to the first of the above items it is to be observed that if ever it was a real claim it had arisen before the plaintiff in January, 1890, granted to the defendant the further extension of time for removing the timber of one year and that never did the defendant assert or pretend to have any claim for such timber until after the plaintiff had commenced the present action; and the learned Chancellor after hearing everything that both the plaintiff and defendant, had to say upon the subject and all the evidence offered by the latter, came to the conclusion that it should not be allowed and in express terms he disallowed it, and this was not an item in any manner depending upon the construction of the contract of February, 1887.\nAs to the 2nd and 5th of the above items they are obviously not claims in respect of which any amount could be allowed by way of damages; and as to the 3rd and 4th items they are claims for damages alleged to have been occasioned by the injunction, all which damages are apart from the counter-claim, expressly referred to the Master by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. In the event of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, to the effect that the construction put by the learned Chancellor upon the contract of the 19th February, 1887, was erroneous, being maintained, as all damages sustained by the defendant by reason of the injunction are expressly referred to the Master there does not seem to be any reason or justice in referring to the Master the claims made in the counter-claim\u2014either under the 3rd and 4th items, (all damages in respect of which are claimed only as occasioned by the injunction) or under items, 1, 2 and 5 which amount to $1,756.25; and of thus reopening anew at great and unnecessary expense matters in respect of which the learned Chancellor received all the evidence offered by the defendant in support of them and after hearing such evidence, exercised his deliberate judgment by expressly disallowing them, and by ordering the counter-claim to be dismissed with costs; a direction which seems to have been overlooked by the deputy-registrar who signed and issued the formal judgment of the court. It is much to be regretted I think, that the learned chancellor said anything in his judgment as to a reference of the counter-claim to the master at all. Having heard all the defendant\u2019s witnesses upon the counter-claim, there does not appear to have been any necessity or reason whatever for referring to the master matters upon which the learned chancellor himself had formed a clear judgment, and upon which it was not only competent for him to have pronounced, but upon which, I think, that under the circumstances he should have pronounced final judgment, so as to avoid subjecting the parties to the great expense of a repetition before the master of evidence taken at great length before the learned chancellor himself. Reading the learned chancellor\u2019s judgment directing the dismissal of the counter\u2011claim with costs on the higher scale, I cannot but think that the direction that either party might if desired have a reference to the master was made inadvertently, and certainly I am of opinion that after the learned chancellor upon hearing all the evidence offered in support of the counter-claim had formed and expressed the deliberate judgment that it should be dismissed, there should not have been any reference of the counter-claim to the master. Even as to the plaintiffs claim, I must say that, in view of the opinion formed by the learned chancellor as to the utterly extravagant nature of that claim, a reopening of it before the master should not in my opinion have been authorized. The learned chancellor, it is true, refused to hear certain witnesses which the plaintiff had in court, and wished to call, but he did hear from the plaintiff himself a very full and particular statement of the nature and character of all the damages claimed by him to have been suffered by him under every item of his claim and from the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence he was satisfied that the plaintiff\u2019s demand was extravagant in the extreme. After attributing the whole contestation to bad temper occasioned by the defendant forcing a way through the plaintiff\u2019s crops notwithstanding his remonstrances, and to angry words which passed between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s son upon the subject, he says:\u2014\nHe, that is the defendant, resolved to force his way through the cultivated land. There has been no denial of what Stephens said upon that point, that he and young Gordon came directly to loggerheads. Young Gordon forced his way through. That is the origin of this unfortunate litigation, unfortunate because there is very little at stake as far as Stephens is concerned except a vindication of his right to have his cultivated land. His damage has been comparatively small, although that will be a matter of investigation afterwards if Mr. Wilson (the plaintiff\u2019s attorney) chooses to pursue it. Then he adds: But this litigation having begun in this way, it seems to me that Mr. Stephens and Mr. Gordon have taken the occasion of raking a great deal into this controversy that does not belong to it. There are four heads of damage claimed by Stephens. There was the drain blocked in May, 1889; I should say he has no case as to that. There is the black ash used for skids and destroyed by bad cutting of other trees. I should say, so far as we have gone, he has sustained no substantial damage on that\u2014claims for fences injured\u2014I should say he was sustained no substantial damage on that head. Then as to the going through the meadow and bean field, he says there is no dispute that the road was pushed there against his will, and I think some damage was occasioned, but his idea of $1,300 is absurd.\nThe defendant admitted that the plaintiff had suffered some damage upon this head for which he was willing to pay, but he contended that it was very small. The learned Chancellor proceeded thus:\nI propose to give $25 with leave to Mr. Stephens to go into the Master\u2019s office to increase his damage.\nIf Mr. Stephens should have exercised this leave he must have done so at the risk of costs, and; as it appears to me, the leave was limited by the learned chancellor to the damages to the meadow and bean field for which alone the $25 was granted. Then as to the defendants counter-claim, the learned chancellor proceeded thus:\nThen, on the other hand, there is the claim for the elm removed for building. It seems to me there is no claim substantially; there was the loose agreement with Mr. Tierce, and it appears that all that elm was removed before the bargain was made for the extension of time. Then was the time to have advanced this claim. So I propose to give no damages in respect of that elm, and on the whole the damages will be limited to $25 with the right to either party to go into the Master\u2019s Office to increase or diminish these if he pleases.\nWhat the learned Chancellor meant by this last sentence I cannot but think was that the plaintiff, if he pleased, might incur the risk of going into the master\u2019s office to increase the $25 allowed by the Chancellor, or the defendant in like manner to diminish that sum, but that in other respects the judgment of the learned Chancellor was final, and final also as to the amount allowed for damages to the meadow and bean crop, unless either party desired to go into the master\u2019s office for the single purpose of increasing on the one side or on the other of diminishing the amount of $25 allowed for such damage. Then, as to the injunction and declaration of right, the learned Chancellor said:\u2014\nThe injunction was directed to the crossing the cultivated land; there is no necessity for a declaration of right now, because no further crop can be put in. I do not propose to continue the injunction for that reason. I do not propose to grant the declaration of right. I think the defendant had no right to cross the growing crops.\nThen, at the close, he gives directions as to the form of the judgment of the court for the guidance of the registrar in drawing up that judgment, as follows:\u2014\nJudgment for $25.00 damages and costs on the lower scale; dismiss counter-claim with costs on the higher scale. Allow, pursuant to undertaking, the defendant the dry season of next summer for removal of timber on payment of $50.00, either party to have a reference as to damages, in which event all costs reserved.\nIf anything was meant by this last sentence other than that either party, if he pleased, might have a reference for the purpose, on the one side, of increasing and on the other of diminishing the sum of $25 allowed by the learned Chancellor for damages done to the meadow and the bean crop, it should not, in my opinion, having regard to the above extracts from the learned Chancellor\u2019s judgment, have constituted part of his directions given for drawing up the formal judgment of the court, nor should the case, under the circumstances, have been thrown at large into the master\u2019s office, as if the learned Chancellor had not himself formed any judgment upon the evidence laid before him.\nUpon the construction of the contract the Court of Appeal has differed wholly from the learned Chancellor, and has adopted the construction contended for by the defendant, namely, that by the contract the plaintiff had granted to the purchaser of the timber growing in the forest land outside of the plaintiff\u2019s cleared land full right, at his pleasure and as suited his convenience, to haul the timber cut down in such forest land across the plaintiff\u2019s growing crops in his cleared land and through his farmyard by the routes by which the defendant did haul such timber, provided that in so doing he did no more damage than was reasonably consequential upon and necessarily attendant upon the hauling of the timber by these routes through plaintiff\u2019s crops. Upon this point of construction the learned Chancellor pronounced his judgment as follows:\u2014\nI should say that as to all the land which is outside the cleared land\u2014in the bush\u2014it was the business of the person buying the timber to take it out without interfering with the use and enjoyment of the. cleared land by the proprietor. If it is impossible to get it out by means of the road to the rear or the shanty road then it becomes necessary to go on another road but until it becomes necessary to encroach (that is on the cleared land) it should not have been done and I should think there was no right to do it. And again he said: \u201cWhat is granted is not land at all, it is trees and timber\u2014in other words it does not necessarily relate to 500 acres but to so much of the 500 acres as relates to the trees being sold.\u201d\nThen as to the 2nd clause of the contract and the last words thereof namely, \u201cat such times and in such manner as he or they may think proper,\u201d he said that in his judgment the meaning of that clause was that the defendant might go on the land where the trees were and fell the said timber and haul away and remove such timber \u201cat such times and in such manner\u201d as defendant might choose, that he did not think the words \u201cin such manner\u201d related to the way of ingress or egress at all but to the manner in which the defendant might handle the timber.\nThen he dwelt upon the covenant that the plaintiff should have full and free use and enjoyment during the three years without any interference, &c., &c., save in so far as might be necessary for the cutting and removing the said trees and timber; and upon this covenant he comments as follows:\u2014\nHe (that is the plaintiff) is to have full and free use and enjoyment without any interruption except in so far as may be necessary, it does not say in so far as may be convenient but uses the word necessary and I think when we look at the locality we find a very clear meaning may be given to these words; while the land is generally composed of timber and cultivated land separated from each other by a fence, there are some parts of the timbered land within the enclosure. There is one clump of trees entirely surrounded by cultivated land so that it is not physically possible to get that timber without crossing the cultivated land and at that point it is necessary to interfere with Stephens\u2019 enjoyment to reach that place. Then as to the timber outside of the cleared land he says: \u201cit is not necessary to cross the cultivated land he (the plaintiff) is to have the free use of that unless it is necessary to interfere with it for the purpose of cutting and removing. As to the timber which abuts on it (the cleared land) there is no necessity. As to the other timber there is the necessity; so that construction, it seems to me, is the one which must govern.\u201d\nWith this construction the Court of Appeal differed entirely and held that by the contract the plaintiff granted to the purchaser of the timber full power, if he found it more convenient or economical, to haul the timber cut in the forest land over the plaintiff\u2019s meadows and bean field, by the route which he did, subject only to the rule sic utere tuo\u2014that under the contract, the defendant had full right to adopt such routes of haul whether over the wood land or over the cleared land as would enable him, from time to time, to get the timber and take it away most beneficially, and that \u201cthe only restriction to which he was subject was the rule sic utere tuo, which would require him to exercise his right in a reasonable manner and without doing any wanton or unnecessary mischief,\u201d that he might carry some of the timber over the cleared land and the rest through the woods, causing no unnecessary injury, and the court was of opinion that the covenant that the plaintiff had good title to the lands confirmed this view, but that title, as its context shows, was inserted simply for the purpose of confirming the vendee in the right granted by the contract to the timber sold; and finally the court held that what he did, in hauling timber cut in the forest outside of the cleared land through the plaintiff\u2019s meadow and through his bean crop and through his farmyard by the route which he did, was not unreasonable, and was quite within his rights, and they therefore dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim upon that head and held that he never had any right to the injunction.\nIn this view I am unable to answer and am of opinion that the construction put upon the contract by the learned Chancellor is the true one. I can add little to what appears to me to be the sound reasoning of the learned Chancellor. In his observations upon the words \u201cin such manner\u201d as they are used in the second clause of the contract I entirely concur. It cannot be contended that by these words a right of way over the cleared land is expressly granted, and if not, there is not a syllable in the contract from which a grant of a right of way over the cleared land for hauling the timber cut in the forest land can be collected. The application of the maxim sic utere tuo, &c., as it has been applied by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, involves the assumption of the whole question which is in issue, namely, whether the vendor of the timber on the forest land granted to the vendee thereof any right of way over the cleared and cultivated land for removing the timber cut upon the forest land? If any such way was granted either impliedly as a way of necessity, or by express grant then only could the maxim sic utere tuo apply; but the question is, was any such way granted either impliedly or expressly? The cases to which reference has been made have no application upon such a question. Thus in Newcomen v. Coulson[6], there was an express grant to the allottees of certain allotments made under an inclosure act of a right of way and liberty of passage for themselves and their respective tenants and farmers, as well on foot as with carts, carriages, horses, &c., from the common highway to their respective allotments, over the east end of the allotments, doing as little damage, &c., and that the way should be always eleven yards wide, but was not to be a right of way to any one but the allottees, their tenants, &c. The owner of one of the allotments commenced building houses on his allotment and was proceeding to lay down a metalled road where there had been only an ordinary cart track, and it was held that the allottees were not confined to the way for agricultural purposes only, but were entitled to make a substantial road way suitable to the purpose to which the land was in course, of being applied. In this state of facts Jessel, M.R., laid down what may be admitted to be undoubted and unquestionable law, viz.: that the grantee of a right of way has a right to enter upon the lands of the grantor over which the way extends for the purpose of making the grant effective, that is to enable him to exercise the right granted to him.\nIf, he says, you grant to me over a field a right of carriage way to my house, I may enter upon the field and make over it a carriage way sufficient to support the ordinary traffic of a carriage way, otherwise the grant is of no use to me.\nSo in Taylor v. St. Helen\u2019s[7], there was an express grant of all water-courses, dams and reservoirs upon certain lands of the grantor, and also all streams flowing into and feeding the said water-courses, dams and reservoirs, all of which were shown on a plan annexed to the grant, reserving liberty to the grantor to use the water or overflow water from the dams and reservoirs, and the question was whether this grant was confined to the water-courses, channels, streams, &c., shown on the plan, and of such water as should find its way by those channels in the condition in which they then were, to the reservoirs; or whether it was a grant of all water which should fall on the land in heavy rains so as to entitle the grantee to deepen the channels, streams, &c., so as to retain all such last mentioned water in the reservoirs, and it was held that that grant was not a grant of all the water so falling upon the land, but of the waters flowing through the channels, &c., in the condition in which they were at the time of the grant.\nIn Cannon v. Villars[8], the case was of an agreement for a lease of a piece of land to which the lessee could have no access, except by a lane and gateway of the defendant, the grantor, and it was stipulated that the plaintiff should not obstruct the gateway, except for purposes of ingress and egress. It was held that the plaintiff, the lessee, had an implied right of way through the gateway for the reasonable purposes of his business. Jessel, M.R. there again states the law, which is not questioned by the appellant in the present case.\nIf, he says, we find a right of way granted over a metalled road, with pavement on both sides existing at the time of the grant, the presumption would be that it was intended to be used for the purpose for which it was constructed. Again, if we find a right of way granted along a piece of land capable of being used for the passage of carriages, and the grant is of a right of way to a place which is stated on the face of the grant to be intended to be used for a purpose which would necessarily or reasonably require the passing of carriages, there again it must be assumed that the grant of the right of way was intended to be effectual for the purpose for which the place was designed to be used, or was actually used. I agree, he says, entirely with the argument on the part of the defendant, that where you find an express right of way granted (for there is no question about a way of necessity), it is a mere question of construction as to what the extent of the right of way granted is.\nIn Bolton v. Bolton[9] it was decided that when a grantee is entitled to a way of necessity over another tenement belonging to the grantor and that there are more ways than one to the tenement granted, the grantee is entitled to one way only and that the grantor may select which.\nIn Dand v. Kingscote[10] the case was of a grant of fee farm land excepting and reserving out of the grant all mines of coal together with sufficient way leave and stay leave to and from said mines and the question was whether under this reservation the grantor had a right to construct a railway for the purpose of carrying the coals from the mines.\nPennington v. Galland[11] was the case of a conveyance of a piece of land together with all ways and roads to the land belonging or appertaining, and the question was as to which of two ways had passed under the grant. There the court said[12]:\nA man having a close surrounded with his land grants the close to another in fee for life or years, the grantee shall have a way over the grantor\u2019s lands as incident to the grant, for otherwise he could not have any benefit from the grant, and this way which would be the most direct and convenient, which we think we may properly assume to be the one in question in the present case. This is founded on the legal maxim, quando aliquis aliquid concedit id concedere videtur, et sine quo res concessa uti non potest, which though bad Latin, is, we think good law.\nIn Espley v. Wilkes[13] the case was of a lease of land described as bounded on the east and north by \u201cnewly made streets\u201d and on the south and west \u201cby the premises of the lessor and his tenants\u201d (through which there was no way). A plan was endorsed on the lease upon which the locus of the new streets was shown and was marked \u201cnew streets\u201d and it was held that under the lease a right of way over the land marked \u201cnew streets\u201d passed to the lessee.\nIt is useless to refer to more, they are all similar and the law of none is disputed: what is contended by the appellant is that they have no application to the present case where the question is, whether any way was granted either by implication as of necessity or by express grant over the plaintiff\u2019s cultivated land for hauling through the plaintiff\u2019s crops and farm yard, timber cut on the forest land that there was no way as of necessity i.e. by implication, is concluded beyond all question by the evidence and the finding thereon of the learned Chancellor. To establish an express grant of such right of way which was so unnecessary and. would be so injurious to the plaintiff the language by which such a grant is shown must, in my opinion, be most unequivocal, and so clear as to exclude all doubt; and the sole question is: whether such an express grant can be collected from the instrument; not (assuming such a grant) what would be a reasonable exercise of the right of way if granted\u2014the question being as to right of way over the cleared land for hauling the timber cut in the forest land, we may consider the case regardless of the fact that there were the few elm trees standing in the plaintiff\u2019s meadow. The first clause of the contract then merely grants all the trees and timber, except black ash and white oak growing and being upon lots 21, 22 and the west half of 23 in the township of Chatham\u2014now the trees and timber so sold were situate upon say 470 acres of forest land, the residue of the lots or about 30 acres in all being in actual cultivation, in the occupancy of the plaintiff. The grant and sale of the timber and trees upon these 470 acres passed an interest in the 470 acres upon which the trees and timber were to such an extent as was necessary to give to the vendee of the trees and timber the full benefit and enjoyment of his purchase and to enable him to enter upon every part of such 470 acres and to cut down and remove the timber there being at such times and in such manner as to the purchaser might seem fit during the specified period named for the cutting and removal of the timber, but such grant passed no interest in, or right of entry upon the 30 acres of cleared land\u2014the grant of timber upon the 470 acres of forest land gave no right of way whatever over the 30 acres unless the situation of the 470 acres where the timber sold was, was such that a way of necessity over the 30 acres must be held to have been granted for hauling the timber from the 470 acres. The evidence shows that the timber cut on the 470 acres could have been and for very many years had been hauled out through the forest land alone without any interference with the cleared land, so that there could not be held to be, nor has there been, any assertion of a right of way as of necessity over the cleared land. I do not understand the judgment of the Court of Appeal to be rested at all, upon the defendant having a way, over the cleared land for hauling timber from the 470 acres outside of the cleared land as a way of necessity\u2014what they hold is that the contract expressly granted to the purchaser of the timber the right to haul the timber cut on the forest land outside of the cleared land across the cleared whenever and at whatever points suited his convenience and presented the most beneficial and cheapest mode for his conducting his business, and that the defendant, as assignee of the contract, had such right; but between a right of way exerciseable as suited the convenience of the defendant and a right of way as of necessity, there is a vast difference. Under the first clause therefore of the agreement I must say that it appears to me to be very clear that no right of way over the 30 acres of cleared land either as of necessity or otherwise has been granted for hauling the timber cut upon any part of the 470 acres. Then the second clause of the contract grants no more right of way over the 30 acres of cleared in relation to the timber upon the 470 acres than was granted by the first clause, unless the words \u201cin such manner\u201d as used in that clause could be construed into a grant of a right of way over the cleared land for hauling the timber cut on the 470 acres of forest land\u2014a construction for which it is in my opinion impossible to contend. The only lands which the 2nd clause relates to, and authorizes the vendee of the timber to enter upon are the \u201csaid\u201d lands in the first clause referred, namely the land situate on the lots 21-22, and the W.\u00bd of 23 upon which the timber was growing and being, and not upon the whole of the said lots, that is to say in so far as the question under consideration is concerned, the 470 acres. The clause, in my opinion, grants no right of entry whatever upon the 30 acres of cleared land save for the single purpose of cutting and removing the few elm trees growing in the meadow. The construction therefore put upon the contract by the learned Chancellor was the correct one. But I think that with the view of preventing the parties continuing this litigation at an expense which if not seriously detrimental to both parties would be enormously disproportionate to any real damage sustained, the judgment in the action should be varied so as to be more in conformity with the learned Chancellor\u2019s view of the damage sustained by the plaintiff.\nAlthough the learned Chancellor did refuse to hear some witnesses which the plaintiff had ready to call, I do not think the plaintiff has been prejudiced thereby, they could not have presented the plaintiff\u2019s claims more favourably for him than he did himself and upon the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence the learned Chancellor had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that all should be disallowed except the damages sustained by the hauling of timber through the hay and bean crops, and that as to these damages the claim of the plaintiff was preposterous in the extreme, and that the sum, which the learned Chancellor said he allowed for that damages, was liberal, and so satisfied does the learned Chancellor appear to have been that the sum of $25 which he allowed for such damage was ample that he was of opinion that the plaintiff should have costs only upon the lower scale.\nThen as the defendant\u2019s counter claim assuming the learned Chancellor\u2019s judgment as to the construction of the contract to be correct, as I think it is, there was no claim cognisable but that for the elm taken by the plaintiff, which claim the learned chancellor, after hearing all the witnesses the defendant had including himself, came to the deliberate conclusion of disallowing. Under these circumstances concurring in the learned Chancellor\u2019s construction, I think we shall best consult the interest of both parties to this litigation if we pronounce the judgment in the action according to the view which, the learned Chancellor has so clearly expressed, would in his opinion do complete justice in this unfortunate expensive litigation; the claims for damages in which, in his opinion, are founded upon temper and not upon any substantial injury beyond what he expressed himself of opinion should be allowed.\nWhile therefore I think we must allow this appeal with costs, I think the judgment in the action should be varied so as to be as follows. Disallow all the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for damages except for the wrongful entry upon and hauling of timber, &c., across the plaintiff\u2019s crops, enter judgment for the plaintiff for $25, in respect of such damages with costs upon the lower scale, dismiss the defendant\u2019s counter claim with costs, but I cannot see that the plaintiff should have the cost of such dismissal upon any higher scale than that prescribed by the learned Chancellor as the scale upon which the costs of the action should be allowed to the plaintiff. In this manner I think the judgment will be, as it should be, according to the views expressed by the learned Chancellor.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 19th February, 1887, the plaintiff, who was the owner of a rectangular block of land containing five hundred acres, in the township of Chatham, in consideration of the sum of $6,000 sold to one Alexander Tierce all the trees and timber, except black ash and white oak, growing thereon, allowing him until the 1st of March, 1891, to remove them. The agreement provided that Tierce should at all times during this period\nHave fall liberty to enter into and upon the said lands, and to fell the said trees and timber in such manner as he should think fit, with full liberty to bring horses, cattle, waggons, carts, trucks and sleighs in and upon the said land for the purpose of removing the said trees and timber, at such times and in such manner as he might think proper; and, further, that the grantor, Stephens, should have the full and free use and enjoyment of the said land during said three years, without any interruption on the part of Tierce, his workmen, servants or agents, save in so far as might be necessary for the cutting and removing of said trees and timber.\nIn January, 1889, Tierce assigned his rights under the agreement to the defendant, Aaron Gordon, such assignment being recognized by the plaintiff, and he, Gordon, for the sum of $500, obtained an extension of one month beyond the time allowed to Tierce, to remove the trees. At the time of the agreement the land in question consisted partly of cultivated land and partly of wood land. The cultivated land was on the northerly and central portion of the block, and was, speaking roughly, bounded on the front by the concession road, and was surrounded on all other sides by the wood land. It was all enclosed by fences. Inside these fences, however, and wholly surrounded by cultivated lands, there was a considerable quantity of grown timber, admittedly sold under the agreement, which it was physically impossible to remove, except by crossing the cultivated fields. Before the agreement in question timber had been taken to some extent from off the land, and through the woods there existed the wood roads or ways which had been temporarily made and used for this purpose, but no other road or way existed. The purchaser of the timber was therefore obliged, in order to its removal, to make roadways for himself, using the existing ways through the woods so far as they suited his purpose.\nAt first there was no difficulty between the parties. The timber for the most part was being cut on the easterly portion of the block, and the convenient way to remove it was to haul it northward through uncultivated land, the land on which the trees were being cut, to the concession road on the north, without touching any portion of the cultivated land. But as the work progressed, as it became necessary to cut and remove the timber which was growing further west and to the south of the plaintiff\u2019s, tilled land, the defendants found that it was not in their interest to haul it by the same way as the timber just cut by them had been, but rather that they should take it direct from where it was cut or skidded to the concession road on the north, involving, however, the necessity of their temporarily removing fences and of their crossing over and damaging, to some extent, the grass and bean fields of the plaintiff. Upon their attempting to carry this design into effect suit was brought and an interim injunction obtained restraining them therefrom. The plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim contained other grounds of action, and sought damages for other alleged breaches of the agreement, but the learned Chancellor before whom the case was tried held, and I think correctly, that the plaintiff had failed to establish some of them and ordered a reference in regard to others.\nAt the trial the Chancellor decided that the defendants, in order to the removal of the timber, were obliged to remove the same through the bush or uncultivated land, and that their attempt to remove it or any part of it (save that part wholly surrounded by cultivated land, as before mentioned) through the cultivated land was a trespass, and he assessed the plaintiff damages at $25, allowing a reference with a view of enabling the plaintiff to prove before the master that his damages were in excess of the amount awarded. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, where the judgment of the learned Chancellor was reversed by a unanimous decision, the appeal court being of the opinion that the learned Chancellor\u2019s view as to the construction of the agreement upon which the action was brought was erroneous, and that the defendants were within their rights under it in crossing the plaintiff\u2019s cultivated lands, as disclosed in the evidence.\nAnd this is the question now before this court. The plaintiff contended from the first that, as a matter of law, the defendants, under no circumstances, had a right to cross the cultivated land; that upon a true construction of the agreement he was under an obligation to remove the timber, if he removed it at all, through the bush land. And the learned Chancellor, during the progress of the trial (and before the plaintiff had finished his case or the defendants had offered any evidence), says:\u2014\nI should say there should be a declaration of right that this timber was to be taken at such times and in such a manner as Gordon might think proper, but without any interruption in the use of the cultivated part by the plaintiff. I shall rule that as a matter of law.\nAnd this ruling he confirmed at the close of the case, but he stated at the same time (and I suppose such statements may be regarded as findings) that the defendants could not remove the timber at the time they were attempting to do so by the old snake road\u2014the road through the bush insisted on by the plaintiffs\u2014without a great expenditure of money, and that Mr. Gordon took the course he did, in crossing the cultivated land, to save the great expense which would probably amount to a sacrifice of the greater amount of the timber were he compelled to resort to the much longer and more circuitous mode of egress through the bush.\nThe rights of the defendants depend solely upon the agreement, and the question involved is as to its true construction. To reach that, resort may I think be had to those principles of law governing cases where there is simply the grant of lands or growing timber in or surrounded by lands of another, without further agreement as to use, or otherwise, considering at the same time whether and to what extent these principles are limited or modified by the express agreement of the parties in the present case.\nIn Rolle\u2019s abridgment[14] it is stated:\u2014\nIf I have a field enclosed by my own lande on all sides, and I alien this close to another, he shall have a way to this close over my land as incident to the grant, for otherwise he cannot have any benefit by the grant, and the grantor shall assign the way where he can best spare it.\nThe grant of a thing passes everything included therein, without which the thing granted could not be had. If a man grant or reserve wood, that implies liberty to take and carry it away. There is some obscurity and perhaps confusion in the cases, which are not numerous, as to the direction of the way. But in Pinnington v. Galland[15], where a number of cases on the question are cited, it was held that the grantee was entitled to a way that would be the most direct and convenient for him. So in Old-field\u2019s case[16], it was resolved that where A had an acre of land which was in the middle and encompassed with other of his lands, and enfeoffs B of that acre, B shall have a convenient way over the lands of the feoffer, and he is not bound to use the same way that the feoffer uses. From this case two points are gained: first, that the way must be convenient for the grantee, and secondly, that though the grantor may have been in the habit of using a particular path, the grantee is not necessarily bound to accept the same, but may have another if that is not convenient.\nIn Pearson v. Spencer[17] the court distinctly recognized the principle that the way must be convenient for the grantee; and in the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators v. Dixon[18], Mellish L.J., after referring to a grant of a right of way, where the way was not defined, says:\u2014\nIf the owner of the servient tenement does not point out the line of way, then the grantee must take the nearest way he can. If the owner of the servient tenement wishes to confine him to a particular track, he must set out a reasonable way, etc.\nIn Hawkins v. Carbines, et al.[19], the question was whether the way used by the defendants was in excess of their rights, and the court held that the question was one for the jury\u2014a question of fact as to what was the ordinary and reasonable use of the way. See also the following authorities:\u2014Hutton v. Hamboro[20]; Clifford v. Hoare[21]; Cannon v. Villars[22]; Cousens v. Rose[23]; Harding v. Wilson[24], and Espley v. Wilkes[25].\nThe result of the cases I think is this, that where no way is specified in the instrument of grant the grantor may assign a way, but that way must be a reasonable one\u2014a way that will enable the grantee to enjoy, in a reasonable manner, the thing granted. If the grantor does not assign a way, or if he assigns a way that is unreasonable, the grantee may select a way, a way that is \u201cmost direct and convenient,\u201d for himself, but one, the use of which will not unreasonably interfere with the grantor in the enjoyment of his rights upon the servient tenement. And, finally, questions of this character are not questions of law, but of fact, to be determined by the jury upon evidence.\nConsidering the agreement in question as a grant of growing timber, and nothing more, it is, in my view, clear that the plaintiff, in attempting to compel the defendants to remove the timber through the bush land and refusing them access to the cleared land, was acting beyond his rights. The defendants had a right to remove their timber to the highway by the most direct and available route, subject, however, to this qualification, that they were acting in good faith and not unreasonably, or in other words, that there was no abuse of the rights which their grant gave them. I think it was unreasonable to insist that they should undergo the extra trouble and expense of removing the fruits of their purchase by an admittedly inconvenient and longer route, when the expense, as the learned Chancellor says, \u201cwould probably amount to a sacrifice of the greater amount of the timber.\u201d If there had been no agreement and no sale, and if the plaintiff, himself, had wanted to cut down and remove and carry to market the timber in question, can there be any doubt that he would have removed it in precisely the same way as the defendants did? Can it be imagined that he, rather than haul it through a hay field or growing bean crop, injuring and even destroying, it may be, the harvest, along the narrow strip necessary for the purpose, would at an enormous increase of expense, remove it by the way he seeks to impose upon the defendants? That, I think, is a fair test as to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and, if so, it fails utterly.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended at the argument, that he was precluded by the Chancellor\u2019s ruling at the trial, from adducing evidence to show that, the defendants\u2019 use of the way they claimed was unreasonable. I think this contention cannot avail. It does not appear that he objected to the ruling, or that during the progress of his own case, he brought forward any evidence on this point, that was excluded. The onus was upon him to show that there was an abuse by the defendants, of the rights which they had under the agreement, that they were claiming to use a way that unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s rights, and the method, the only method by which he undertook to show that was, to prove (as if that was all that was necessary), that they took the shortest and most convenient route for themselves, the short and easy way through the plaintiff\u2019s fields, instead of the long circuitous and expensive one, through his wood lands.\nThe plaintiff had to establish his case in the first instance, and it would not I think, have been proper, after the defendants had concluded their evidence, to allow him to strengthen his original case, by introducing new and cumulative evidence in support of it. The question remains: Are the legal principles above mentioned, applicable to the present case, or have the defendants contracted themselves out of them?\nIn my view they have not.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s contention is in effect, that there is in this agreement an implied stipulation that the defendants shall not remove any of the timber by crossing cultivated land.\nI cannot find that stipulation in the agreement.\nI cannot from the surrounding circumstances as given in evidence, gather that such was the intention of the parties. As regards certain of the trees, the only way to remove them was across these lands. That was known to the parties. They must have contemplated a crossing of the fields, as respects these at least. If that was to be all, why does not the agreement say so? The defendants were at all times to have the right of entry and removal. A convenient method of removal, in winter might be, and was, an inconvenient method in summer but there is no limitation as to the particular season or the particular method. The defendants\u2019 discretion was absolute. Stress is laid upon the stipulation, that during the defendants\u2019 user the plaintiff was to have the full and free use and enjoyment of the land, \u201csave in so far as might be necessary for the cutting and removing of said trees and timber.\u201d That limitation means, and I think can only mean, that the plaintiff was to enjoy his land subject, and subject only to the defendants\u2019 right as created by the agreement. He was to have the use of the whole land uncleared as well as cultivated, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s rights. I cannot understand how the use of the word \u201cnecessary\u201d gives foundation to the argument that the user of the land was confined to the uncleared portion. The defendants necessarily required to use some land in order to remove the trees. Any land used by them for such removal was necessarily used. There is not the slightest indication that the word is used to distinguish one character of land from another, or one mode of egress from another, its object being to prohibit the defendants from using any portion of the property, whether cleared or otherwise, for purposes foreign to the cutting and removal of the growing trees.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the insertion in the agreement of the two clauses referred to, does not in any way minimize or modify the rights which, irrespective of them, the defendants take under the general grant of the trees, and that these rights are as I have above stated.\nThe result is that the appeal fails.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Wilson, Rankin & McKeough.\nSolicitor for respondent: J.W.

S. C. c. 135 s. 68.\nContempt of court is a criminal proceeding and unless it comes within sec. 68 of the Sup. Court Act an appeal does not lie to this court from a judgment in proceedings therefor.

Baird[2], the proceedings against the appellant were continued in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and on report of the clerk of the court, who had been appointed to administer interrogatories to the appellant, containing the answers to such interrogatories the court adjudged him guilty of contempt, but sentence was deferred to admit of an appeal on a bond being given conditional for the appearance of the appellant to receive sentence. From this judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick the present appeal was brought.\nCurrey for the respondent took a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal on the ground that contempt of court such as that in the present case is a criminal proceeding from which an appeal would not lie, citing O'Shea v.

Hakes[6].\nWeldon Q.C. contra.\nJudgment was reserved on the question of jurisdiction and argument on the merits postponed until it was disposed of.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in a proceeding the object of which was to punish the appellant for contempt of court. This proceeding was initiated by a rule nisi granted in Easter Term 1887 in the words following:\nEASTER. TERM, A.D. 1887.\nIt is ordered that John V. Ellis, the editor and principal publisher and proprietor of the \"Saint John Globe\" newspaper, a newspaper printed and published in the City of Saint John, at the next Trinity Term of this honourable court do show cause why an attachment should not be issued against him, or why he should not be committed for contempt of this honourable court for writing, printing and publishing in the issue of the said \"Saint John Globe\" newspaper on the tenth day of March last an article under the caption of \"The Quern's Election,\" and for writing, printing and publishing in the issue of said newspaper of the eleventh day of March last another article under the caption of \"Government by Fraud,\" and for writing, printing and publishing in the issue of said newspaper of the twelfth day of March last another article under the caption of \"Queen's County,\" and wherein are comments, reflections and innuendoes on the applicant George F. Baird on an order of His Honour Mr. Justice Tuck, one of the justices of this honourable court, made on application of George F. Baird for an order nisi for a writ of prohibition to prohibit James Steadman, Esquire, the judge of the Queen's County Court, from further proceeding with or to make a recount or final addition of the votes given for said George F. Baird and one George G. King at the election held on the twenty-second day of February. last of a member to represent the electoral district of Queen's County, in the Province of New Brunswick, in the House of Commons of Canada, and on His Honour Mr. Justice Tuck; and in which said articles the said John V. Ellis has been guilty of a contempt of this honourable court in scandalizing this honourable court, and particularly His Honour Mr. Justice Tuck, one of the justices thereof, in calumniating and vilifying said applicant George F. Baird, and in commenting on the matters of said election, said recount, and said order nisi for a writ of prohibition in a manner calculated to prejudice and that does prejudice the public before the hearing and judicial decision of said matters, and so as is calculated to prevent said applicant George F. Baird from obtaining a fair and impartial disposal of said matters.\nUpon reading the said articles in the newspapers aforesaid, and upon reading the affidavit of George F. Baird, and upon motion of Mr. L. A. Currey.\nBy the Court.\n(Sgd.) T. CARLETON ALLEN,\nClerk of the Crown.\nThis rule was made absolute in Hilary Term 1888. Thereupon regular proceedings according to the established procedure in contempt matters was taken. An attachment was issued upon which the appellant was arrested and brought into court, whereupon he gave bail. Thereafter interrogatories were administered, and exceptions to those interrogatories having been taken and in some instances allowed, and further answers having been put in by the appellant, a final hearing was had, and on the 13th day of August, 1889, the court found the appellant to be guilty of contempt. No other judgment or sentence was, however, pronounced or passed. The minutes of the court of the 13th August, 1889, are set forth in the appeal book as follows:\nTuesday, 13th-August.\nPresent: Allen C. J., and Fraser J.\nThe Queen v. John V. Ellis Re George F. Baird.\nAllen C. J., reads judgment of self and reads judgment of Palmer J. Fraser J., reads his judgment; also reads judgment of King J. Wetmore and Tuck JJ., no part. Defendant found guilty of contempt. Sentence postponed until he has had an opportunity to appeal on entering into a recognizance to appear and receive sentence on the first day of Hilary Term next.\nMr. McLean for defendant asks that the sentence be pronounced and that the execution be stayed until appeal is decided.\nAllen C.J. The court is not prepared to pass any sentence; they have not considered it at all.\nMr. Ellis appeared with his sureties and entered into a recognizance to appear and receive sentence on the first day of Hilary Term next.\nFrom the foregoing minute it appears that the judges were unanimous in the conclusion at which the court arrived.\nOn the hearing of the appeal before this court a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction was taken. It was said that this was a criminal matter in which this court had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal.\nThat a proceeding for contempt is a criminal matter seems to be now well established by authority. By the English Judicature Act[7], it is enacted \"that no appeal shall lie from any judgment of the High Court in any criminal cause or matter save for some error of law apparent upon the record as to which no question shall have been reserved for the consideration of the said judges under the said Act of the eleventh and twelfth years of Her Majesty's reign.\"\nIn the case of O'Shea v. O'Shea[8] a fine had been imposed by the Queen's Bench Division upon the publisher of a newspaper for a contempt of court in publishing comments upon the proceedings in a divorce action. The party upon whom the fine had been inflicted appealed to the Court of Appeal and the preliminary objection to the jurisdiction was taken that a contempt proceeding such as that in question was a criminal matter in which no appeal would lie. The Court of Appeal, although it had previously entertained, heard, and adjudicated upon an appeal in a similar case The Queen v. Jordan[9] gave effect to the objection.\nIn the case of O'SIiea v. O'Shea[10] it was pointed out in the judgment of the court that there exists a distinction between proceedings in civil contempts, which include proceedings to enforce obedience to orders or writs made or issued in civil actions or matters, and proceedings for criminal contempts the object of which is not enforcement of writs, rules or orders, but the punishment of contumacious behaviour. In the late case of the Queen v. Barnardo[11], an appeal from an order granting an attachment for non-return to a writ of habeas corpus was entertained, the distinction being taken that the original proceeding was not for a punitive purpose, and the same jurisdiction was exercised by the House of Lords in the case of Barnardo v. Ford[12].\nThere can be no doubt, upon the authority of O'Shea v. O'Shea (2.), that the case now before us is a criminal matter within the definition of such a proceeding given in that case.\nNext we have to inquire what is the limit of the jurisdiction of this court in criminal causes or matters. It is to be premised that this jurisdiction depends entirely on statutory enactments. By the 23rd section of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act (Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 135) it is enacted \"that the Supreme Court shall have, hold and exercise an appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction within and throughout Canada.\" This general provision is not, however, intended as a definition of the jurisdiction of the court in criminal cases so as to indicate that it has jurisdiction in all criminal cases; the definition of the jurisdiction is left to subsequent clauses of the act. Thus by section 25 of the same act it is enacted that the court shall have jurisdiction in criminal cases as thereinafter provided. By sections 68 and 69 of the act it was enacted as follows: \u2014\n68. Any person convicted of any indictable offence before any court of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or before the Court of Queen's Bench in the Province of Quebec on its Crown side, or before any other superior court having criminal jurisdiction whose conviction has been affirmed by any court of last resort, or in the Province of Quebec by the Court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmance of such conviction; and the Supreme Court shall make such rule or order therein, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary rules and orders for carrying such rule or order into effect: Provided that no such appeal shall be allowed if the court affirming the conviction is unanimous, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney General for the proper province within fifteen days after such affirmance. 38 V. c. 11. s. 49.\n69. Unless such appeal is brought on for hearing by the appellant at the session of the Supreme Court during which such affirmance takes place, or the session next thereafter if the said court is not then in session, the appeal shall be held to have been abandoned unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court. 38 V. c. 11, s. 50.\nThese sections, 68 and 69, were, however, repealed by sec. 2 of 50 & 51 Vic. c. 50, and by the first section of the same act, 50 & 51 Vic. c. 50, the same provisions were in terms re-enacted. The jurisdiction of this court in criminal cases is, therefore, now wholly dependent upon and limited by this section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act. It is manifest that the present appeal does not come within the terms of this enactment. It is questionable whether the contempt of which the appellant has been convicted is an indictable offence, and moreover the court below were unanimous in their opinions. The conclusion is therefore unavoidable that, the English authority before quoted having established that a proceeding of this kind to punish for a contempt of court is a criminal matter, this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nIn the case of O'Brien v. The Queen[13] this objection was not taken. The jurisdiction there was considered to be dependent on section 24 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, which confers a right of appeal from all final judgments, and moreover, had the objection been there taken, it could scarcely have prevailed in the face of the decision of the English Court of Appeal, already referred to, in the case of The Queen v. Jordan[14], in which the jurisdiction had been assumed and exercised, and which was then the governing authority upon the point, the case of O'Shea v. O'Shea[15] not having been decided until some time after the judgment in the case of O'Brien v. The Queen (1.) had been delivered. Further, assuming that contempt of court is an indictable offence, the case of O'Brien v. The Queen (1.) was a proper subject of appeal since the judges of the court below were not unanimous.\nMy brother Patterson has called my attention to a further objection to the present appeal which, in my opinion, is also insuperable. The record appears to be defective. No final judgment has ever been pronounced by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. All we have before us in the nature of a judgment consists of an extract of the minutes of that court of the 13th of August, 1889, already set forth, in which appears an entry in these words: \"defendant found guilty of contempt.\" This is clearly not a judgment, so that even if in other respects the appeal was admissible this objection would be fatal to it upon the record now before the court.\nThe appeal must be quashed. FOURNIES, J.\u2014Le pr\u00e9sent appel est interjet\u00e9 d'un jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick, d\u00e9clarant l'appelant coupable de m\u00e9pris de cour pour avoir publi\u00e9 dans le Globe de St. John, N.-B., certains articles contenant des assertions injurieuses contre la conduite de l'honorable juge Tuck, dans l'exercice de ses fonctions comme juge de la dite Cour Supr\u00eame.\nLes faits qui ont amen\u00e9 la publication de ces articles sont en r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit: Aux \u00e9lections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de 1887, M. Baird et George. G. King furent mis en nomination comme candidats pour l'\u00e9lection d'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 pour repr\u00e9senter le comt\u00e9 de Queens dans la Chambre des Communes du Canada. Il y eut votation. A l'ouverture des bo\u00eetes de scrutin, le jour de la proclamation. l'officier-rapporteur constata que George G. King avait 1,191 votes, et le dit George F. Baird, 1,130. L'officier-rapporteur au lieu de d\u00e9clarer \u00e9lu George G. King, qui avait la majorit\u00e9 des votes, d\u00e9clara que le dit King n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement mis en nomination, et que le dit George F. Baird, qui avait la minorit\u00e9 des voix, \u00e9tait d\u00fbment \u00e9lu membre pour repr\u00e9senter le comt\u00e9 de Queens dans la Chambre des Communes.\nLa raison de cette d\u00e9cision donn\u00e9e par l'officier-rapporteur est, que bien que la nomination de M. King f\u00fbt conforme aux dispositions de l'acte des \u00e9lections, et que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de $200 exig\u00e9 par la loi lui e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 et qu'il en e\u00fbt donn\u00e9 re\u00e7u, cependant ce paiement ne lui avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par l'agent nomm\u00e9 du dit King.\nSur la demande d'un d\u00e9compte des bulletins faite \u00e0 James Steadman, juge de comt\u00e9 pour le dit district \u00e9lectoral, le dit juge fixa vendredi, le 11 mars, \u00e0 10 heures A.M. au palais de justice \u00e0 Gagetown, comme le jour et le lieu o\u00f9 se ferait l'examen des bulletins et l'addition finale des votes donn\u00e9s \u00e0 la dite \u00e9lection.\nLe neuf de mars \u00e0 la demande de G.F. Baird, l'honorable juge Tuck \u00e9mit un ordre nisi ordonnant au juge Steadman, \u00e0 George G. King et \u00e0 T. Medley Wetmore, poursuivant le d\u00e9compte, de montrer cause pourquoi un bref de prohibition n'\u00e9manerait pas pour d\u00e9fendre au juge Steadman de proc\u00e9der au d\u00e9compte des bulletins et \u00e0 l'addition finale des votes et \u00e0 donner un certificat du r\u00e9sultat.\nLe juge Steadman se conformant \u00e0 la loi ouvrit sa cour au jour et lieu indiqu\u00e9s, consid\u00e9rait que le juge Tuck n'avait aucune juridiction pour intervenir dans cette affaire, et que l'acte des \u00e9lections lui imposait l'ordre de proc\u00e9der, mais il f\u00fbt emp\u00each\u00e9 de remplir son devoir par le refus de l'officier-rapporteur de produire les bulletins.\nCette intervention extraordinaire de la part du juge Tuck causa beaucoup d'excitation dans le public, et donna lieu, les jours suivants, \u00e0 la publication dans le Globe de St-John, des articles qui ont servi de base \u00e0 la demande d'arrestation de l'appelant pour m\u00e9pris de cour.\nDans le terme de la Saint-Hilaire cette demande fut accord\u00e9e. Mais un appel de cette d\u00e9cision ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, l'appel fut mis hors de cour parce qu'il n'y avait pas eu de jugement final prononc\u00e9. Plus tard, apr\u00e8s l'interrogatoire de l'appelant et apr\u00e8s les incidents qui s'en suivirent, la cour d\u00e9clara le 13 ao\u00fbt 1889 que l'appelant \u00e9tait coupable de m\u00e9pris de cour.\nCe dernier jugement est maintenant port\u00e9 en appel devant cette cour. L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendant que cette cour n'a pas juridiction pour entendre cette cause, l'audition de la cause n'a en cons\u00e9quence eu lieu que sur la question de savoir s'il y avait appel \u00e0 cette cour dans le cas d'une condamnation pour m\u00e9pris de cour. L'audition sur le m\u00e9rite de la cause n'a pas eu lieu, de sorte que la cour n'a maintenant \u00e0 s'occuper que de la question de juridiction. Cette question d'appel en mati\u00e8re de m\u00e9pris de cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par cette cour, In re O'Brien[16] dans laquelle cette cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit:\u2014\n\"The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province, not only under sec. 24, subsec. (a) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, as a final judgment in an action or suit, but also under subsec. (1.) of sec. 26 of the same Act, as a final judgment in \"a matter or other judicial proceeding\" within the meaning of sec. 26.\"\nL'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend aussi qu'un jugement pour m\u00e9pris de cour, n'\u00e9tant rendu par la cour que dans l'exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sans appel par la sec. 27, ch. 135. Cette pr\u00e9tention a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e dans la m\u00eame cause. In re O'Brien (1.), et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e; voir les autorit\u00e9s au m\u00eame vol. des rapports de la Cour Supr\u00eame, pp. 215, 216 et seq. Il serait inutile de revenir sur ce point.\nLa principale objection de l'intim\u00e9 est que le m\u00e9pris de cour \u00e9tant une offense d'une nature criminelle et la sentence de la cour ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9, il n'y a pas d'appel.\nAvant d'entrer dans la consid\u00e9ration de cette question il faut, je crois, remonter \u00e0 l'origine de la cause, afin de s'assurer du droit de l'honorable juge Tuck d'interrompreles proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de l'\u00e9lection de Queens par l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de prohibition, et du droit de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick de juger la question de m\u00e9pris de cour soulev\u00e9e contre l'appelant \u00e0 l'occasion de ses articles publi\u00e9s dans le St. John Globe, attaquant la conduite de l'honorable juge Tuck pour l'\u00e9mission de ce bref.\nComme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut, le juge Steadman se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 proc\u00e9der, en vertu de la loi \u00e9lectorale, au d\u00e9compte des bulletins qu'il avait ordonn\u00e9 sur demande \u00e0 cet effet, lorsque le bref de prohibition lui fut signifi\u00e9. Il ne put y proc\u00e9der, parce que l'officier-rapporteur, auquel le bref avait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9, refusa de produire les bulletins et d\u00e9clara \u00e9lu celui des deux candidats qui avait la minorit\u00e9 des votes. Ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e9tait inou\u00ef, et jamais jusque l\u00e0, une \u00e9lection parlementaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue par une pareille proc\u00e9dure. La conduite de l'honorable juge Tuck en accordant cette proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait-elle l\u00e9gale? La Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick a soutenu la position qu'il avait prise, et a confirm\u00e9 la sentence qu'elle avait rendue pour m\u00e9pris de cour. Je suis forc\u00e9 \u00e0 regret de dire que je consid\u00e8re sur ce sujet l'opinion de l'honorable juge Tuck, et celle de la cour, comme \u00e9galement erron\u00e9es, contraires \u00e0 la loi et aux d\u00e9cisions des plus hauts tribunaux.\nCe n'est que depuis un temps comparativement assez r\u00e9cent, que la d\u00e9cision des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es, autrefois exclusivement laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la juridiction du parlement, a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e aux tribunaux civils, dans le but d'arriver plus promptement \u00e0 une solution satisfaisante sur les questions au sujet du droit de si\u00e9ger en chambre. Ce n'\u00e9tait nullement l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur de soumettre les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de contestation d'\u00e9lections aux r\u00e8gles qui r\u00e9gissent ordinairement les proc\u00e9dures des cours en mati\u00e8re civile, ni de les soumettre \u00e0 la revision de ces cours par appel ou par les moyens des brefs de pr\u00e9rogative. Au. contraire, toute la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre en pareils cas, est trac\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail d'une mani\u00e8re toute sp\u00e9ciale, et l'on ne peut aller chercher les r\u00e8gles de ces d\u00e9cisions que dans les Statuts qui ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette juridiction, dans les principes constitutionnels, et dans la jurisprudence anglaise au sujet des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es. Cette juridiction est toute sp\u00e9ciale, et n'est point soumise aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires des cours, bien qu'elle soit administr\u00e9e par les juges qui composent ces cours. Cependant une opinion toute contraire a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par l'honorable juge Tuck et la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick.\nL'honorable juge en chef Allen dans son opinion s'exprime ainsi au sujet du pouvoir des juges d'\u00e9mettre des ordres pour bref de prohibition[17]\u2014\nThere can be no doubt about the general power of this court to grant writs of prohibition to restrain inferior courts from proceeding in matters over which they have no jurisdiction, or where, having jurisdiction, they are attempting to proceed irregularly or improperly. In hearing the application for a prohibition against the judge of the County Court of Queen's, and in granting the rule nisi calling upon him to show cause why a prohibition should not issue, Mr. Justice Tuck was acting in his judicial capacity as a judge of this court, and charges made against him, alleging that he was actuated by dishonest and corrupt motives in granting the order which he did, were calculated to interfere with the proper administration of justice, and to bring the proceedings of this court into contempt.\nL'honorable Juge Palmer s'est exprim\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re plus formelle sur cette question. Faisant allusion au jugement qu'il a donn\u00e9 sur l'application pour m\u00e9pris de cour, il a ajout\u00e9[18]:\nI, however, then gave no opinion whether this court had power to restrain any of the courts created by the Controverted Elections Act from exercising powers which the law did not give them, although I can see no reason why such courts should not be restrained. They are the creation of statutes and have only such power as the statutes gave them, and I think should not be at liberty to usurp any other, and that with regard to them this court is not relieved of its duty to see that they together with all other courts do not exceed their jurisdiction, but I am met with the dicta of a very eminent judge in the Centre Wellington Case[19], that prohibition would not lie to such court....... However, one of the judges does say that prohibition does not lie to such courts; but after the most careful consideration, I came to the conclusion on the argument of that point before us in another case that it does lie, and it would be my opinion in the absence of direct authority.\nAinsi, d'apr\u00e8s l'honorable juge, dont l'opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par ses coll\u00e8gues, les proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8res d'\u00e9lections sont soumises au contr\u00f4le des cours provinciales. On va voir par les citations ci-apr\u00e8s, des d\u00e9cisions du Conseil priv\u00e9 que cette doctrine est contraire \u00e0 celle qu'il a promulgu\u00e9e dans les causes de Valin v Langlois[20] et dans celle de Th\u00e9berge v Landry[21]. Sur le caract\u00e8re exclusif de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet des \u00e9lections voir le langage du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Valin v. Langlois (1.). Au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral seul appartient la l\u00e9gislation au sujet des causes d'\u00e9lections.\nIn the present case their Lordships find that the subject matter of this controversy, that is, the determination of the way in which questions of this nature are to be decided, as to the validity of the returns of members to the Canadian Parliament, is beyond all doubt placed within the authority and the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament by the 41st section of the Act of 1847, to which reference has been made; upon that point no controversy is raised.\nOn ne pourrait affirmer plus positivement le principe que la juridiction en ces mati\u00e8res appartient exclusivement au parlement et \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et n'est pas soumise comme le pr\u00e9tend l'honorable juge Palmer au contr\u00f4le des cours provinciales.\nLes deux actes de Qu\u00e9bec de 1872 et 1875, concernant les contestations d'\u00e9lections \u00e0 l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi soumis \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Th\u00e9berge v Landry (2.). On sait que par ces deux actes, de m\u00eame que par les actes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux les contestations d'\u00e9lections \u00e0 l'Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es aux tribunaux. Les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de ces mesures sont les m\u00eames et elles ne diff\u00e8rent que dans les d\u00e9tails. Lord Cairns en parlant de ces deux actes de Qu\u00e9bec, s'exprime ainsi:\u2014\nThese two acts of Parliament, the Acts of 1872, 1875, are acts peculiar in their character; they are not constituting or providing for the decision of mere ordinary civil rights; they are acts creating an entirely new, and up to that time an unknown, jurisdiction which, up to that time, had existed in the Legislative Assembly. A jurisdiction of that kind is extremely special, and one of the obvious incidents or consequences of such jurisdiction must be that the jurisdiction, by whomsoever it is to be exercised, should be exercised in a way that should as soon as possible become conclusive, and enable the constitution of the Legislative Assembly to be distinctly and specially known....... The object which the legislature had in view was to have a decision of the Superior Court, which once arrived at should be for all purposes conclusive.\nBut there is a further consideration which arises upon this Act. If the judgment of the Superior Court should not be conclusive, of course the argument is that the power which is to be brought to bear to review the judgment is the power of the Crown in Council.\nNow the subject matter, as has been said, of the Legislation is extremely peculiar. It concerns the rights and privileges of the electors and of the Legislative Assembly to which they elect members. Those rights and privileges have always, in every colony, following the example of the mother country, been jealously maintained and guarded by the Legislative Assembly. Above all they have been looked upon as rights and privileges which pertain to the Legislative Assembly, in complete independence of the Crown, so far as they properly exist. And it would be a result somewhat surprising and hardly in consonance with the general scheme of the legislation, if, with regard to rights and privileges of this kind, it were to be found that in the last resort the determination of them no longer belongs to the Legislative Assembly, no longer belongs to the Superior Court which the Legislative Assembly had put in its place, but belongs to the Crown in Council, with the advice of the Crown at home, to be determined without reference whether to the judgment of the Legislative Assembly, or of that Court which the legislative assembly had substituted in its place.\nSi, comme le dit Lord Cairns dans son jugement, la l\u00e9gislature en cr\u00e9ant cette juridiction si sp\u00e9ciale avait pour but d'arriver promptement \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision finale et de faire conna\u00eetre distinctement le plus t\u00f4t possible la composition de la chambre, rien ne serait plus contraire \u00e0 son intention que d'admettre que la proc\u00e9dure pourrait \u00e0 tout instant en \u00eatre interrompue et prolong\u00e9e par le recours au bref de prohibition ou \u00e0 d'autres, proc\u00e9dures des droits civils ordinaires. Il est clair que l'admission de telles proc\u00e9dures est tout-\u00e0-fait ill\u00e9gale comme contraire \u00e0 l'esprit de la loi.\nAvant que la juridiction du parlement sur les \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e aux tribunaux, elle \u00e9tait exerc\u00e9e par la. Chambre ou ses comit\u00e9s avec la plus scrupuleuse attention dans le but de maintenir ses droits et privil\u00e8ges au sujet des \u00e9lections \u00e0 l'abri de l'influence de la couronne. Ce serait un r\u00e9sultat extraordinaire, si les lois pass\u00e9es pour mettre la protection de ces droits et privil\u00e8ges sous la garde d'une cour sp\u00e9cialement cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le parlement pour cet objet, pouvaient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 en remettre la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 toutes les vicissitudes et les longueurs des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s civils ordinaires. Tel ne peut \u00eatre le cas ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par l'honorable juge en chef d'Ontario in re Centre Wellington Election[22] \u00e0 propos de la demande d'un mandamus pour obliger un juge de comt\u00e9 de faire le d\u00e9compte des votes en vertu de la 14 Vict. ch. 6, sec. 14. Dans le cas actuel, il est vrai qu'il s'agit d'un bref de prohibition, mais il y a les m\u00eames raisons de d\u00e9cider que les cours n'ont point de juridiction pour l'accorder. Sur l'effet du changement dans le mode de consester les \u00e9lections, l'honorable juge en chef s'exprime ainsi[23].\u2014\nI am satisfied that the legislation which has provided a new mode of trial of controverted elections, transferring such trial from the House to the Judiciary, has in no way affected the question now before us, and that we have to deal with it as if this important change had never taken place.\nThe House retains all powers that it has not expressly given up.\nWhen a petition is presented for an undue return, or complaining of no return, it has to be decided by the judges; and in the course of such inquiry the regularity of proceedings, and the conduct of officials entrusted with the execution of the writs of election, may come in question, just as such matters might have been questioned before the election committee under the old system. But I fail altogether to see what power has been given to a court of law to interpose by mandamus or prohibition so as to affect to regulate the proceedings of such officials in the execution of their duties under the election law.\nIf we can legally do what is asked here, we could with equal right affect to regulate the multitudinous duties prescribed to various persons in the conduct of the election, from the receipt of the writ by the returning officer till its return.\nI think we have no such power. The argument was based on the alleged general right of this court to order any person to perform a clearly defined statutable duty.\nLa demande du bref de mandamus fut en cons\u00e9quence rejet\u00e9e.\nPour les m\u00eames raisons la demande du bref de prohibition adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'honorable Juge Tuck aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nDe toutes ces autorit\u00e9s, il faut n\u00e9cessairement conclure que l'honorable juge Tuck n'avait absolument aucune autorit\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9mission du bref de prohibition; qu'en cons\u00e9quence il n'agissait pas judiciairement lorsqu'il a donn\u00e9 l'ordre qui a interrompu les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s du d\u00e9compte des bulletins.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick dans ses proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour contempt contre l'appelant au sujet de ses articles dans le St. John Globe, \u00e0 propos de l'intervention du juge Tuck l'a au contraire consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant agi judiciairement et a, en cons\u00e9quence, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'appelant coupable de m\u00e9pris de cour. Le but de son appel est de faire relever cette condamnation. L'intim\u00e9 lui r\u00e9pond que nous n'avons pas de juridiction.\nNotre juridiction, il est vrai, n'est pas aussi \u00e9tendue que celle du Conseil priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9, qui, par l'acte 3 et 4 Guil. 4, ch. 41 a pouvoir par la sec. 3, d'entendre \u2014\nAll appeals or complaints in the nature of appeals whatever, which, either by virtue of this Act, or any law, statute, or custom, may be brought before Her Majesty in Council, from or in respect of the determination, sentence, rule or order of any Court Judge, or judicial officer, &c., &c., shall from and after the passing of this Act be referred by Her Majesty to the Judicial Committee of Her Privy Council.\nCes termes sont tellement g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qu'ils comprennent certainement les appels pour m\u00e9pris de cour. C'est en vertu d'une r\u00e8gle de cour que l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 et il est certain que par cette clause l'appel est donn\u00e9. Mais notre juridiction n'est pas aussi \u00e9tendue. Par la 23e sec. de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame cette cour a juridiction d'appel en mati\u00e8re civile et criminelle dans tout le Canada. Cette juridiction est d\u00e9finie et limit\u00e9e par les clauses suivantes:\u2014\nAppeals in New Trials. Appeal in case of conviction of an indictable offence.\u2014Proceedings thereupon.\u2014When appeal shall not be allowed.\n268. Any person convicted of any indictable offence, or whose conviction has been affirmed before any Court of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or before the Court of Queen's bench in the Province of Quebec, on its Crown Side, or before any other Superior Court having criminal jurisdiction, whose conviction has been affirmed by any Court of last resort, or, in the Province of Quebec, by the Court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmance of such conviction; and the Supreme Court shall make such rule or order therein, either in affirmance of the conviction, or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary rules and orders for carrying such rule or order into effect; provided that no such appeal shall be allowed if the Court affirming the conviction is unanimous, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney-General for the proper Province, within fifteen days after such affirmance:\nWhen appeal must be brought to hearing.\n2. Unless such appeal is brought on for hearing by the appellant at the session of the Supreme Court during which such affirmance take place, or the session next thereafter, if she said Court is not then in session, the appeal shall be held to have been abandoned, unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court.\nDans la jurisprudence anglaise le m\u00e9pris de cour est mis au rang des offenses criminelles et, si on a adopt\u00e9 pour sa r\u00e9pression le mode sommaire de proc\u00e9der par attachment, ce n'est pas parce qu'il ne pourrait pas \u00eatre poursuivi par la voie de l'indictement, mais uniquement parce que ce mode est plus prompt que la voie ordinaire. Dans la cause de O'Shea v O'Shea[24] pour m\u00e9pris de cour du m\u00eame genre que celui dont il s'agit l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 sur le principe que l'offense \u00e9tant criminelle la cause ne pouvait \u00eatre port\u00e9e en appel. Cette d\u00e9cision est conforme \u00e0 la sec. 47 de l'Acte de judicature de 1873 (36 & 37 Vic., ch. 66), qui d\u00e9clare comme suit:\u2014\nNo appeal shall lie from any judgment of the said High Court in any criminal cause or matter, save for some error of law apparent upon the record as to which no question shall have been reserved for the consideration of the said judges under the said Act of the 11th & 12th years of Her Majesty's Reign.\nIl est clair que la Cour d'Appel n'avait pas de juridiction dans ce cas-l\u00e0, mais la d\u00e9cision confirme le principe que le m\u00e9pris de cour est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une offense criminelle.\nL'appel \u00e0 notre cour dans ce cas n'est pas prescrit de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que par l'acte de judicature anglais; au contraire il est positivement accord\u00e9 mais \u00e0 une condition. C'est celle d'un dissentement d'opinion dans la cour qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance. Dans la cause re O'Brien cit\u00e9e ci-dessus nous avons entretenu l'appel parce que la condition d'un dissentiment d'opinion dans la cour qui avait rendu le jugement, se trouvait exister. Dans celle-ci, les juges ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes dans leur jugement nous ne pouvons intervenir. Nous sommes sans juridiction. C'est pour ce seul motif que je suis d'avis que l'appel soit rejet\u00e9 (quashed).\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur in the reason assigned by the Chief Justice for quashing this appeal, but would be disposed to give the respondent costs.\nGWYNNE J. concurred in the judgment quashing the appeal.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014At a parliamentary election for Queen's County in New Brunswick, held in February, 1887, the candidates were George F. Baird and George G. King. King received the larger number of votes, but the returning officer, holding that King's nomination was not legal, declared Baird duly elected.\nA recount of ballots was applied for and an appointment was made by the judge of the County Court for proceeding with the recount.\nThereupon Baird obtained from a judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick an order nisi calling upon the County Court judge, and King and the applicant for the recount, to show cause before the Supreme Court why a writ of prohibition should not issue to prohibit further proceedings with the said recount, and in the meantime staying such further proceedings.\nBefore the order nisi was returnable certain articles appeared in a newspaper edited by the appellant Ellis which were alleged by Baird to be calculated to prejudice his application for the writ of prohibition. He accordingly obtained from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on the crown side, a rule nisi calling upon Ellis to show cause why an attachment should not be issued against him, or why he should not be committed for contempt of the Supreme Court for writing, printing and publishing those articles.\nThe rule nisi was issued in Easter Term, 1887, and was made absolute in Hilary Term, 1888, a writ of attachment being issued on the sixteenth of February, 1888.\nAfter execution of the writ of attachment interrogatories were exhibited on the part of Baird and were, after various delays, answered by Ellis who was finally adjudged guilty of the contempt charged against him by the judgment of the Supreme Court, pronounced on the thirteenth of August, 1889, from which the present appeal is brought.\nIn contemplation of this appeal the court below suspended the pronouncing of sentence on the appellant, but required him to have his appeal ready for hearing at the October sittings of this court in 1880. He complied with that condition and is not to be prejudiced by the fact that the case has stood over from sittings to sittings for three full years and has not yet been heard except upon the question of our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nThat is the only question now to be decided and I think it should be decided against the appellant.\nThe contempt of which the appellant has been pronounced guilty is a criminal offence.\nI need not cite authority for that proposition beyond a reference to the opinion certified to Her Majesty by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in In re Pollard[25], and to the recent case of O'Shea v. O'Shea[26].\nNow what is our jurisdiction in criminal cases?\nWe must find the answer to this question in the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act[27], the sections more particularly bearing upon it being 24, 25 and 68.\nSection 24 declares that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in several cases which are enumerated and distinguished by letters of the alphabet from a to g.\nArticle (a) is wide enough in its terms to include criminal cases\u2014specifying all final judgments of the court of final resort in any province of Canada whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, in cases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court\u2014but I do not construe it as intended to include criminal cases. I think it is intended to include only civil cases. The articles (b) to (f) obviously refer to proceedings in civil cases only. Article (g) specified judgments in cases of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, but with the express qualification \"not arising out of a criminal charge,\" and the same qualification applies to certiorari and prohibition which were introduced by a late amendment of the clause[28].\nThen section 25 declares that \"the court shall also have jurisdiction,\u2014(a) in appeals in criminal cases as hereinafter provided \":\u2014The reference is to section 68 under the heading \"appeals in criminal cases.'' That section, as will be noticed when I read it, is not simply an extension of the right to appeal to cases which for some reason, as e.g. because they do not originate in a superior court, could not come within the language of article (a) of section 24. It is, as I think obvious, intended to embrace the whole jurisdiction of the court in appeals in criminal cases. Let us read the section:\nAPPEALS IN CRIMINAL CASES.\n68. Any person convicted of any indictable offence before any court of Oyer and Terminer or Goal Delivery, or before the Court of Queen's Bench in the Province of Quebec on its Crown side, or before any other superior court having criminal jurisdiction, whose conviction has been affirmed by any court of last resort, or, in the Province of Quebec, by the Court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmance of such conviction; and the Supreme Court shall make such rule or order therein, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary riles and orders for carrying such rule or order into effect; Provided that no such appeal shall be allowed if the court affirming the conviction is unanimous, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney General for the proper Province within fifteen days after such affirmance.\nThat section 24 does not apply to give an appeal in indictable cases is very manifest when we consider that under its terms the crown, as well as the person convicted, would be entitled to appeal, which would be inconsistent with section 68.\nBut it may be argued that while indictable offences come under section 68 alone, the construction of section 24 is affected by section 68 only with respect to that one class of cases, and that those dealt with in a summary manner, like contempt of court, may still follow the general rule and be appealable in the same way as a civil case.\nSuch a contention would, in my judgment, misinterpret the statute.\nI have noticed the qualification of the right to appeal in cases of habeas corpus, certiorari and prohibition, or, more properly, the care taken, by expressly excluding applications arising out of a criminal charge, to guard against the idea that section 24 includes criminal cases. I have pointed out that section 25, giving an appeal in criminal cases as provided for by section 68, does so as something that is not given by section 24, and that that appeal, limited as it is to cases where the affirmance of the conviction has not been unanimous, is given to the convict only, and not to the crown or to the prosecutor. There is no indication of intention that in any criminal case there shall be a larger right of appeal, or an appeal in any criminal case that does not fulfil the conditions of section 68.\nThe case of O'Shea v. O'Shea[29] touches this aspect of the statute. Section 47 of the Judicature Act, 1873, enacted that no appeal should lie from any judgment of the high court \"in any criminal cause or matter, save for some error of law apparent upon the record, as to which no question shall have been reserved for the consideration of the said judges under the said Act of the 11th and 12th years of Her Majesty's reign.\"\nThe contempt of court charged in that case was of the same character as that charged in the case before us, and it was held that the fact of the charge being in \"a criminal cause or matter,\" excluded the appeal, no attempt being made to confine the operation of section 47 to cases in which, under the act; referred to in that section, a question might be reserved for the consideration of the judges.\nI think the objection to our jurisdiction to hear any appeal in a criminal case, except under section 68, is well taken.\nThat objection is fatal to this appeal, but independently of it the appeal is not one which, in my opinion, we can entertain.\nThere is no formal ud gment before us, and none has been drawn up.\nWe have a report of the opinions expressed by judges in the court below, and we have the following extract from the clerk's minute book:\u2014\nTuesday, 13th August.\nPresent:\u2014Allen C. J. and Fraser J.\nThe Queen v. John V. Ellis re George F. Baird.\nAllen C. J. reads judgment of self and reads judgment of Palmer J. Fraser J. reads his judgment; also reads judgment of King J. Wetmore and Tuck JJ. no part.\nDefendant found guilty of contempt. Sentence postponed until he has had an opportunity to appeal on entering into a recognizance to appear and receive sentence on the first day of Hilary Term next.\nMr. McLean for defendant asks that the sentence be pronounced and that execution be stayed until appeal is decided.\nAllen C. J.: The court is not prepared to pass any sentence; they have not considered it at all.\nMr. Ellis appeared with his sureties and entered into a recognizance to appear and receive sentence on the first day of Hilary Term next.\nThe vague memorandum that the defendant was \"found guilty of contempt\" may be sufficient, together with the papers in the hands of the clerk, to enable that officer to prepare a formal adjudication, but by itself it is merely a vague memorandum. I apprehend, however, that without what is called the sentence no final judgment can be drawn up. The proceeding by attachment, followed by interrogatories, is concisely and satisfactorily explained in Stephens's Commentaries[30], where, as we may note in passing, the method of making a defendant answer on oath to a criminal charge, which is not agreeable to the genius of the common law in any other instance, is said to have been derived through the medium of the courts of equity. Referring to the answering of interrogatories the commentator says:\u2014\nIf the party can clear himself on oath he is discharged; but if perjured may be prosecuted for the perjury. If he confesses the contempt the court will proceed to correct him by fine or imprisonment, or both, and sometimes by a corporal or infamous punishment.\nIn an earlier part of the treatise[31] it was shown that\nAll courts of record are the King's Courts in right of his crown and royal dignity; and therefore every court of record has authority to fine and imprison for contempt of its authority; while, on the other hand, the very erection of a new jurisdiction with power of fine or imprisonment makes it instantly a court of record.\nThe power of the court is thus to award a punishment for the contempt, and that power has not in this case been exercised. The finding that a contempt has been committed may be an essential preliminary to the exercise of the power to punish, but it is only a preliminary or interlocutory step towards the final judgment and the general rule governing our jurisdiction confines it to final judgments.\nIn the case In re Wallace[32], which was an appeal from an order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia awarding a punishment for contempt of court, the judicial committee agreed that a contempt had been committed which it was hardly possible for the court not to take cognizance of, but allowed the appeal on the ground that the punishment awarded was not appropriate. So in the present case, if we should agree with the learned judges who considered the appellant guilty of contempt, and therefore should dismiss this appeal, it would be open to the appellant, or indeed to the respondent (on the hypothesis of the case being appealable under section 24), to appeal again after the final order awarding the punishment.\nThen there is a further consideration.\nThe power to punish for contempt is a discretionary power. That was expressly so decided by our ultimate court of appeal in Mc Dermott v. The Judges of British Guiana[33] and it is shown by many other cases, among which are Ashworth V. Outram[34] and Jarmain v. Chatterton[35].\nAn appellate court will be slow to interfere with a decision made in the exercise of the discretion of the court of first instance, but such decisions may nevertheless be appealable. That depends on the extent of the jurisdiction of the appellate court. Whether, as a matter of policy, a person aggrieved by an order to commit for contempt, or by the refusal to make such an order, ought to have an appeal, or perhaps a series of appeals, is an abstract question which does not now call for consideration and is not within our province.\nWhat is our jurisdiction?\nSection 27[36] declares that no appeal shall lie from any order made in any action, suit, cause, matter, or other judicial proceeding made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court or judge making the same.\nThis applies, in my opinion, to an order to commit for contempt.\nThere is no good reason for reading the section as intended to except orders which cannot come within any of the enabling sections, or as referring only to orders made as matters of practice in the course of an action, such e.g. as an order to put off a trial, or to amend a pleading, or to produce documents, which last mentioned order was held by Malins V. C. in Lane v. Gray[37] to be discretionary.\nThe wider scope of the language is shown by the latter part of the section which declares that the exception shall not include certain things which are made appealable by section 24 (e), viz., decrees and decretal orders in actions, suits, causes, matters or other judicial proceedings in equity, or in actions or suits, causes, matters or other judicial proceedings in the nature of suits or proceedings in equity instituted in any superior court.\nOn all these grounds I am of opinion that we should quash the appeal.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for respondent: L.

At the trial evidence was given by plaintiff of a survey of the lands, and defendant\u2019s land adjoining, made in 1809, by one Burwell, a provincial land surveyor, in which, as he reported to the Crown Land Department, he had made a mistake owing to abend in the circumference of his compass and which he corrected by moving the posts he had planted as the line was traced. The defendant claimed that the line as first run by Brunwell was the true line. As to possession the evidence was that defendant had cut timber on the land in dispute for many years and also tapped maple trees for sugar, but had not fenced the land until some six or seven years prior to the action.\nThe trial judge found that plaintiffs had respectively proved title to their land and that the acts of ownership shown by defendant were mere acts of trespass committed either wilfully or in ignorance as to boundaries and not such as would enable his possession to ripen into a title. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal in both cases and dismissed the appeals.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nGlenn & Tremear for appellant Horton.\nJ.A.

The action was brought to recover that amount and interest.\nThe facts of the case are not in dispute. The policy of insurance upon the life of Robert McGeachie was issued by the defendants on the 6th day of December, 1889, and he died on the 6th day of November following (1890). The amount of the insurance premium was $31.10 annually. This amount was not paid to the defendants in cash upon the issuing of their policy but by agreement with the plaintiff the defendants accepted instead the promissory note of Robert McGeachie, at six months, for $31.10, with interest thereon at seven per cent per annum. This note became due on the 7th day of June, 1890. It was not then paid by the maker, but by agreement between him and the defendants a renewal note was taken instead, at thirty days, for the amount of the first note with interest added, $32.20, the second note itself bearing interest also at the rate of seven per cent per annum.\nAt the maturity of the second note (10th July 1890), $10 cash was paid by Robert McGeachie upon account and a third note at two months given for the balance ($22.40), this third note also bearing interest at seven per cent per annum.\nThe third note fell due on the 13th September, 1890, when it was renewed at one month by a fourth note, in which the interest was added to the previous amount thus making $22.80.\nThis fourth note became due on the 16th October, 1890, and remained, in defendants\u2019 possession overdue and unpaid up to the death of Robert McGeachie, three weeks after the maturity of the note. Upon the death taking place defendants refused to receive payment of the note.\nThe acceptance of the note in the first place, and of the different renewal notes, was in each case a matter of arrangement and agreement between the parties. During the currency of the second note Robert McGeachie wrote (2nd July, 1890,) to the defendants, asking to have the policy cancelled, but was answered that such a request was unreasonable and could not be entertained. After maturity of the last note defendants, on 5th November, 1890, wrote the maker demanding payment of it.\nThis letter reached St. Catharines on the day on which Robert McGeachie died and was delivered to his brother on the same day. The local agent of the company was at once communicated with and asked if he would accept the money, but refused to do so. On the following Monday, four days later, the amount was formally tendered to the defendants at their head office but was refused.\nAt the trial of the action at St. Catharines in May, 1891, before the Honourable Mr. Justice Street without a jury, judgment was reserved, and afterwards judgment was given in the defendants, favour. From this decision the plaintiff appealed to the Queen\u2019s Bench Divisional Court, and by the judgment of that court, pronounced on the 27th February, 1892, the plaintiff recovered the amount of her claim in this action. Thereupon the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and by the judgment of that court pronounced on the 17th January, 1893, the action was dismissed. The plaintiff appealed from that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe defendant company relied on the following condition in the policy.\n\u201cIf any premium, note, cheque, or other obligation given on account of a premium be not paid when due * * * this policy shall be void, and all payments made upon it shall be forfeited to the Company.\u201d\nAylesworth Q.C. for the appellant. Credit was intended to be given for the premium and under the circumstances the non-payment of the note did not avoid the policy. Miller v. Brooklyn Life Insurance Company[3] The condition is one of which performance could be waived and waiver will be inferred by the court. Universal Fire Insurance Company v. Block.[4]\nThe policy, at all events, was only voidable and the company never elected to avoid it. McCrae v. Waterloo County Mutual Insurance Company[5]. Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company v. French.[6]\nKerr Q.C. for the respondents was not called on.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that it is not necessary to hear counsel for respondents, and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. After hearing the able argument advanced on behalf of the appellant I am not convinced that the policy existed at the death of the assured, if it ever existed. The appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The first condition of the policy was quite sufficient to entitle the company to claim that the policy was void for non-payment of the premium. It was paid by a promissory note which enabled the policy to issue, but it was agreed that if the note was not paid the policy was to be void, or, if not void, voidable and I do not think it would aid the appellant to hold that it was only voidable. I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nKING J.\u2014The note was taken as conditional payment of the premium and until it matured the policy was valid, but when it matured and was not paid it came within the first condition and made the policy void. I think the term void in that condition means voidable. The stipulation was for the benefit of the company who had a right to elect whether it should be void or not. Then, was anything done to show an intention on the part of the company that the policy should continue notwithstanding the breach of the condition? I cannot see that what was done was equivalent to an expression of any such intention. The insured had had eleven months of protection under the policy and I cannot see that the request for payment of the note would operate as a waiver of the forfeiture.\nI agree in the appeal being dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\u2014\nSolicitors for appellant: Rykert & Marquis.\nSolicitors for respondents: Kerr, Macdonald, Davidson & Paterson.\n[1] 20 Ont. App. R. 187\n[2] 22 O.R. 151.\n[3] 12 Wall. 285.\n[4] 109 Penn. 535.\n[5] 1 Ont. App. R. 218.\n[6] 2 Cinn. (S.C.) 321.\n\u2014 On May 22d, 1894, an appeal in the case of Frank v. The Sun Life Assurance Company was argued before the Supreme Court. In that case the policy contained no provision that it was to be void if the premiums were not paid. The first premium was paid by two agreements in the form of promissory notes maturing at different dates and each providing that the policy was to be void if it was not paid at maturity, when the assured died the first agreement was overdue and unpaid and the second had not matured. The court, without reserving judgment, dismissed an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal [20 Ont. App. R. 564] holding the policy void.\n",

The plaintiff appealed from the order for a new trial to the Supreme Court of Canada, but his appeal was not entertained[2]. The second trial resulted in a verdict for the defendant, which was affirmed by the full court, from whose decision the present appeal is taken.\nThe facts of the case are fully set down in the judgment of the court. McLeod Q.C. and Palmer Q.C. for the appellant, referred to Williams v. The Colonial Bank[3]; Barton v. London and North-western Railway Co.[4]; Jones v. Broad hurst[5].\nBlair, Attorney General of New Brunswick, cited McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[6]; Stone v. Marsh[7]; Leather Manufacturing Bank v. Morland[8]; and Viele v. Judson[9].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case, which is an action to recover the sum of $1,000 and interest, may be stated as follows:\u2014The appellant was the master of a vessel in which he and Charles E. Robinson, a merchant of St. John, were jointly interested. Robinson had managed the appellant's private business affairs at St. John. On the 29th September, 1883, the appellant deposited with the respondent $1,000, for which he received a receipt in the words and figures following, namely:\u2014\nBANK OF NEW BRUNSWICK,\nSt. John, N.B., 29th Sept., 1883.\nReceived from Robert Scott the sum of one thousand dollars, for which we are accountable, with interest at the rate of four per cent per annum, on receiving thirty day's notice; interest to cease at the expiration of the notice, and no interest to be allowed unless the money remain in the bank three months.\nTHOMAS GILBERT, President.\nW. GIRVAN, Cashier.\nThe appellant being about to go to sea, and not wishing to take the receipt with him, handed it to Robinson (as he alleges) to place in his \"safe\" for secure keeping.\nThe appellant says he gave the receipt to Robinson in the bank at the time he received it in the same condition it was in when he received it himself, without indorsing his name on it; that he never wrote his name on it, and that the name \"Robert Scott\" which now appears on it is a forgery. Robinson, in his evidence (taken in the United States under a commission), does not state clearly when he received the receipt, but he denies getting it from Scott in the bank, although he admits that when Scott received it he, (Robinson) was present in the bank. Robinson's account of the matter is that Scott gave it to him afterwards in an unsealed envelope, and when he looked at it some days subsequently the appellant's name was indorsed on it. The jury, in answer to a specific question, have found that the appellant's account as regards the indorsement is the true one, and that his name was indorsed without his authority after the delivery to Robinson. They have not, however, explicitly found that the name of the appellant was forged or even written by Robinson, although it may be inferred that such was their opinion.\nRobinson subsequently deposited the receipt with the respondents as a security for an advance, and after it had remained in the respondents' hands for some time it was, at the suggestion of the respondents' manager, exchanged for a new receipt for the sum of $1,044 (being the $1,000 and interest), made directly in favour of Robinson, which receipt the bank retained, and Robinson making default in the payment of the advance to him the respondents subsequently charged the amount of the advance (a note which had been discounted) against the deposit. The appellant did not return to New Brunswick until some time in 1887, about July, when he came to St. John to endeavour to get a settlement with Robinson who was indebted to him on an open account, independently of this transaction connected with the receipt, to the amount of some $2,650. Being unable to obtain a satisfactory settlement he demanded the deposit receipt when, as the appellant swears, Robinson confessed to him that he had used the receipt in the way mentioned, and had applied the money obtained by means of it to his own use. The appellant says Robinson besought him not to prosecute him; and then gave him a draft on one George Bell, of Dublin, for \u00a3250 and agreed to give him and did subsequently give him a mortgage for $2,500 on some interest which, as Robinson stated, he had in his father's property. It does not appear from the evidence and has not been found by the jury that the appellant ever agreed not to prosecute Robinson. The jury have specifically found that this mortgage was taken by the appellant to secure the amount improperly withdrawn by Robinson from the bank. They have also found that the giving of this security by Robinson induced the appellant to leave St. John without notifying the bank of the fraud which had been practised upon him. The jury have further found that the appellant by accepting the mortgage did not intend to waive his claim against the bank. The appellant left St. John in 1887, on getting the mortgage and draft, and did not again go to that city until 1889, when he informed the bank of Robinson's fraud and demanded payment which the bank refused. Robinson had then left the country for some time. In addition to the findings already mentioned the jury found that the bank were not prejudiced by the delay to inform them of the fraud from 1887 to 1889. Further, that the bank when they originally took the receipt, as well as when they changed the receipt, and also when they finally appropriated the deposit by charging against it the loan to Robinson, had reasonable grounds to suspect that Robinson was not the owner of the money and had not the right to control it. Lastly, the jury have found that the appellant purposely avoided informing the bank of the alleged forgery from July 1887 to 1889 on a promise by Robinson to pay.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice Hanington the jury having found as before stated in answer to specific questions left to them by the learned judge a verdict was entered for the respondents, leave being reserved for the appellant to move to have the verdict entered for him. a motion having subsequently been made in term to enter the verdict for the appellant that motion was refused, against which decision the present appeal has been brought.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the court below was entirely correct and is sustained by the highest authority. I do not think the doctrine of estoppel has any application to the case, the decision of which must be governed by legal principles of a different order. The receipt was not a negotiable instrument and although the fabricated indorsement might be by statute a forgery yet, even if genuine, it would of itself have constituted no authority to the bank to pay the money to Robinson as being himself entitled to the money as the transferee of the appellant, but the receipt with the appellant's name written on the back was used by Robinson in such a way as to indicate to the bank that he had authority from the appellant to demand payment of the money specified in it; Robinson's conduct was therefore equivalent to a distinct verbal representation of his authority to receive the money and to deal with the receipt as he did. The case before us is therefore the case of a pretended agent obtaining the payment of money belonging to his assumed principal by false representations and pretenses as to his authority made to the debtor of the latter. Then I think the law is clear that if the payment of money is obtained from a debtor by one falsely representing to the debtor that he is the agent of his creditor, from whom he in fact has no authority, and thereby a fraud upon the debtor is committed, yet if the creditor afterwards ratifies and confirms the payment so made he thereby adopts the agency of the party who has received the money and it becomes equivalent to a payment made by the debtor to a person having proper authority to receive it. And it makes no difference in the application of this principle that by his false pretenses the party receiving the money has committed an indictable offence.\nFor the latter proposition I rely on the judgment of Lord Blackburn in the House of Lords, in the case of McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[10], as a conclusive authority. The difference between the case put by Lord Blackburn and the present is this, that the present case is the ratification not of a feigned contract, which was in itself a forgery, but of an act, the receiving of money, the payment of which was evidenced by fraudulent representations, which amounted to the offence of obtaining money by false pretenses, whilst the case put by Lord Blackburn is the ratification of a pretended contract the fabrication of which constituted the crime of forgery. What Lord Blackburn says in the case cited, is this:\u2014\nBut even though it was not made out that the signatures were authorized originally, it still would be enough to make McKenzie liable if knowing that his name had been signed without his authority he ratified the unauthorized act. Then the maxim omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur et mandato priori cequiparatur, would apply. I wish to guard against being supposed to say that if a document with an unauthorized signature was uttered under such circumstances of intent to defraud that it amounted to the crime of forgery, it is in the power of the person whose name was forged to ratify it so as to make a defence for the forger against a criminal charge. I do not think he could. But if the person, whose name was without authority used, chooses to ratify the act, even though known to be a crime, he makes himself civilly responsible just as if he had originally authorized it. It is quite immaterial whether this ratification was made to the person who seeks to avail himself of it or to another.\nThis is a fortiori applicable to a case like the present, where the doctrine of ratification is invoked, not for the purpose of giving vitality to an assumed * contract which was in truth non-existent and void ab initio, but for the purpose of fixing a party, by reason of his adoption of it, with the legal consequences of an act which, whatever may have been,the circumstances which attended it and brought it about, had a de facto existence. Upon principle there does not seem to be any good reason, upon grounds of public policy or otherwise, why such an act should not be susceptible of confirmation by a party whose conduct is free from any taint of illegality in favour of another party equally blameless, provided the adoption does not involve any agreement or undertaking on the part of either to forbear from a criminal prosecution.\nThe judgment of the Court of Exchequer in the case of Brook v. Hook[11] does, no doubt, contain observations to the opposite effect, but that case, so far as it proceeds on reasons at variance with Lord Blackburn's deliverance in McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[12], must be considered as overruled by the latter case, and the judgment of Martin B., who dissented in Brook v. Hook, (1) must now be taken to be an accurate statement of the law. The decision of Brook v. Hook (1) may, however, be ascribed to a ground which would take it out: of the doctrine enunciated by Lord Blackburn in McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[13], and would also make it inapplicable as an authority to govern the present case. It was there determined that the agreement for ratification itself was based upon the condition that the party receiving the benefit of the ratification would not prosecute the forger, a consideration \"which rendered it illegal and void. Martin B., before whom the action had been tried, reported the evidence to have been as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff said it must he a forgery of Jones and that he would consult a lawyer with a view of taking criminal proceedings against him; that the defendant begged him not to do so and said he would rather pay the money than that he should do so; that the plaintiff then said he must have it in writing and that if the defendant would sign a memorandum to that effect he would take it; and that the defendant then signed the memorandum relied on as a ratification.\nUpon this the Chief Baron says that the verdict could not be sustained:\nAnd this first upon the ground that this was no ratification at all, but an agreement upon the part of the defendant to treat the note as his own, and become liable upon it in consideration that the plaintiff would forbear to prosecute his brother-in-law Jones; and that this agreement is against public policy and void as founded upon an illegal consideration.\nAnd subsequently to this in the same judgment the Chief Baron adds;\nI am of opinion that the true effect of the paper taken together with the previous conversation is that the defendant declares to the plaintiff, \"if you will forbear to prosecute Jones for the forgery of my signature, I admit and will be bound by the admission that the signature is mine.\" This therefore was not a statement by the defendant that the signature was his and which, being believed by the plaintiff, induced him to take the note or in any way alter his condition; but on the contrary it amounted to the corrupt and illegal contract before mentioned.\nThis places the decision in Brook v. Hook upon principles so obvious and plain (always assuming that the court took a correct view of the facts) that there is no need of resorting to the second ground advanced in its support.\nThat second ground is in the language of Chief Baron Kelly as follows:\u2014\nThe paper in question is no ratification inasmuch as the act done\u2014 that is the signature to the note\u2014is illegal and void; and that although a voidable act may be ratified by matter subsequent it is otherwise when an act is originally and in its inception void.\nThis last ratio decidendi is clearly inconsistent with Lord Blackburn's enunciation of the law in McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[14], and can no longer be considered authority. Moreover the reasoning on which it proceeds would be inapplicable here, for granting that the payment of the money for which the receipt in the present case was given was obtained by Robinson by false and fraudulent pretenses, and that any agreement so brought about would be illegal and void, there would still remain the fact that the money was actually paid over to him by the bank, and it is to this payment that the respondents seek to have the ratification, applied. A contract or a pretended contract, like a forged note, may be void in law ab initio or non-existent so that there may be nothing to ratify, but a fact like a payment cannot be got rid of in that way. The payment was therefore clearly a substantial act susceptible of ratification, and the passage last quoted from the judgment in Brook v. Hook[15] does not apply to the facts before us in this appeal. Further it appears from the authorities that the distinction between a void and voidable contract or act does not apply at all to the ratification of the act of a pretended agent.\nI find American authorities emanating from courts of the highest authority, and anterior in date to the case of McKenzie v. The British Linen Co., (1) in entire-accord with the law of ratification as laid down by Lord Blackburn in that case.\nIn the case of Greenfield Bank v. Crafts[16] the Supreme Court of Massachusetts says:\nIt is, however, urged that public policy forbids sanctioning a ratification of a forged note as it may have a tendency to stifle a prosecution for the criminal offence. It would seem, however, that this must stand upon the general principle applicable to other contracts, and is only to be defeated where the agreement was upon the understanding that if the signature was adopted the guilty party was not to be prosecuted for the criminal offence.\nAgain in Bartlett v. Tucker[17] the same court says:\nIf either of those names was that of a real person, then, although no agency was expressed on the face of the note, and whether the signature was affixed under a mistaken belief of authority or fraudulently, or even if it was a forgery, it was, so far as regards the liability to a civil action upon the notes, a mere case of signing without authority, and the signature might be adopted or ratified by that person, and such adoption or ratification would render him liable to be sued as maker thereof.\nIn Wellington v. Jackson[18] Gray C. J. speaking for the court propounds the law in these terms.\nAlthough the signature of Edward H. Jackson was forged, yet if, knowing all the circumstances as to that signature and intending to be bound by it, he acknowledged the signature and thus assumed the note as his own, it would bind him just as if it had been originally signed by his authority even if it did not amount to an estoppel in \"pais.\"\nFrom the judgment in Merrifield v. Parritt[19] I extract the following passage which has particular reference to the question whether an act or contract void for illegality is susceptible of adoption or ratification. The court there says:\nIt was argued that according to that doctrine the act of A was void and then it was said that a void act cannot be ratified. But if it be admitted that A exceeded his authority by writing P's name without more it would not follow that P could not adopt or ratify the act. Whatever may be the meaning and extent of the rule that a void act cannot be ratified the rule does not apply to the acts of persons assuming without authority to be agents, nor to the acts of acknowledged agents which exceed their authority. These authorities, selected from a great number of American cases to the same effect, coming as they do from a court of the highest authority on all questions falling to be decided by the common law of England, are entitled to great weight as regards a question upon which we find English courts at variance.\nThe law therefore appears to be clear that although the obtaining payment by Robinson from the bank was obtaining money by a false pretense it was, nevertheless, susceptible of ratification by the appellant in such a way as to bind him for all the purposes of civil justice and to debar him from recovering the money from the respondents.\nAs I said before our judgment proceeds upon the principle of ratification or adoption and not on the doctrine of estoppel. The distinction between ratification and estoppel is well pointed out by the Supreme Court of Maine in a case of Forsyth v. Day[20] where it is said:\u2014\nThe distinction between a contract intentionally assented to or ratified in fact and an estoppel to deny the validity of the contract is very wide. In the former case the party is bound because he intended to be; in the latter he is bound, notwithstanding there was no such intention, because the other party will be prejudiced and defrauded by his conduct unless the law treat him as legally bound. In one case the party is bound because the contract contains the necessary ingredients to bind him including a consideration. In the other he is not bound for these reasons but because he has permitted the other party to act to his prejudice under such circumstances that he must have known or be presumed to have known that such party was acting on the faith of his conduct and acts being what they purported to be without apprising him to the contrary.\nNext arises the question: Did the appellant ratify the payment to Robinson when, according to the finding of the jury, he accepted the mortgage from Robinson as security, and on the strength of that security left the province and remained away two years without in any way notifying the bank of the fraud which had been practised? Granting that ratification is possible and that no objection on the ground of public policy is sustainable, which I have already shown to be the result of the authorities, I am at a loss to conceive a stronger act of adoption than that here in evidence and established as a fact by the finding of the jury. Surely if a pretended agent, on being charged with the fraud by the creditor, pays over to him money to the same amount as that which he has received from the debtor in assumed discharge of the debt the creditor could not afterwards, whilst retaining this money, compel the debtor to pay a second time. In such a case the receipt of the money from the fraudulent agent would be such a recognition of the agency as to relate back and place the debtor in the same position as if the pretended agent had had authority at the time he received payment from the debtor. This is too clear to need further demonstration. Then what difference in principle can there be between actual receipt of money and accepting security for it as the appellant did here? The answer must be, none that can make any difference in the application of the principle. This is a ground entirely different from that of estoppel upon which I altogether disclaim placing any reliance.\nAny little doubt I had was as to whether the defrauded debtor must not be privy to the ratification. But this doubt is also dispelled by the last paragraph in the quotation I have given from McKenzie v. The British Linen Co.[21]. Lord Blackburn there says:\u2014\nIt is quite immaterial whether this ratification is made to the person who seeks to avail himself of it or to another.\nThis appears to me to be conclusive. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C. A. Palmer.\nSolicitors for respondents: Barker & Belyea.\n[1] 31 N.B. R. 21.\n[2] 21 Can.

Patterson J. dissenting.\nA by-law of the City of Toronto excepting Government institutions from the benefit of a discount on rates paid within a certain time is invalid as regards such exception. Patterson J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the City of Toronto.\nThe sole question to be decided by this appeal was as to the validity of a by-law of the City of Toronto fixing the rates to be paid for water supplied to the inhabitants so far as it discriminated between the Government and other institutions exempt from taxes and the general body of consumers.\nThe by-law in question contained the following provision:\u2014\nAll such half-yearly rates paid within the first two months of the half year for which they are due, shall be subject to a reduction of fifty per cent, save and except in cases of Government or other institutions which are exempt from city taxes, in which cases the said provisions shall not apply.\nThe Dominion Government paid the rates imposed for some years under protest, being refused the discount of fifty per cent, and then brought an action against the city to recover the amount of the rebate which would have been allowed but for the exception in the by-law, claiming that the city had no power to discriminate between consumers as to the rates to be paid.\nThe statutes of the Ontario Legislature bearing on the question are set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nThe case was heard by Mr. Justice Ferguson who dismissed the action, and his decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nReeve Q.C. and Wickham for the appellant.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The question presented for decision by this appeal involves the validity as applied to the crown representing the Dominion Government, of a by-law of the City of Toronto, passed on the 23rd of April, 1888. By this by-law it was enacted that all half\u2011yearly water rates\npaid within the first two months of the half year for which they are due shall be subject to a reduction of fifty per cent, save and except in the cases of Government or other institutions which are exempt from city taxes, in which cases the said provisions as to discount shall not Apply.\nThe crown in right of the Dominion has vested in it certain public property in the city of Toronto, namely: The Custom House and Customs Warehouse, the Post Office, and the Inland Revenue and Receiver General\u2019s Offices; and for several years prior to the institution of this action water had been supplied to these buildings by the Water Works Department of the city of Toronto. From the date of the by-law of the 23rd of April, 1888, the Water Works Department refused to make any rebate on the payment by the Dominion Government of its water rates within the time prescribed for payment by the by-law and the full amount of these rates have been paid under protest. This action has been brought to recover back the amount of the discount or rebate claimed by the crown, equal to fifty per cent, or one-half of the whole amount paid.\nIt has been agreed between the crown and the respondent, as appears by a consent paper which has been filed with the registrar, that the determination of this appeal shall depend altogether on the validity of the by-law. All technical questions as to the right to recover back money paid under protest are, therefore, to be excluded from consideration.\nThe cause was heard on a motion for judgment on the pleadings before Mr. Justice Ferguson who dismissed the action, and this judgment has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The crown has now appealed to this court.\nBy the Ontario act (35 Vict. cap. 79), authority was given to the City of Toronto through the agency of certain commissioners to construct water works in and for the use of the city and its inhabitants. These water works were to be constructed by, vested in and managed by certain commissioners. By the 12th section of this act, it was enacted that:\nThe commissioners shall have power and authority, and it shall be their duty, from time to time to fix the price, rate or rent which any owner or occupant of any house, te\u0144ement or lot, or part of a lot, or both, in, through or past which the water pipes shall run shall pay as water rate or rent, whether such owner or occupant shall use the water or not having due regard to the assessment and to any special benefit and advantage derived by such owner or occupant, or conferred upon him or her or their property by the water works and the locality in which the same is situated.\nAnd after a provision, not material here, the section proceeds thus:\nAnd the water commissioners shall also have power and authority from time to time to fix the rate or rent to be paid for the use of the water by hydrants, fire plugs and public buildings.\nBy 40 Vict. cap. 39, sec. 9, the commissioners were empowered to place meters upon any service pipes or connections within or without any house or building as they might deem expedient.\nBy 41 Vict. cap. 3, the water-works and the powers of the commissioners were transferred to and vested in the Corporation of the city of Toronto.\nBy R.S.O.1887, cap. 192\u2014(the General Water-works Act), it was by section 2 enacted that:\nThe corporation of every city, town or incorporated village, shall have power to construct, build, purchase, improve, extend, hold, maintain, manage and conduct water\u2011works and all buildings, materials, machinery and appurtenances thereto belonging in the municipality and in the neighbourhood thereof as hereinafter provided.\nSection 19 was as follows:\nSubsection 1: The corporation shall regulate the distribution and use of the water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required, and from time to time shall fix the prices for the use thereof and the times of payment, and they may erect such number of public hydrants and in such places as they shall see fit, and direct in what manner and for what purpose the same shall be used: all which they may change at their discretion, and may fix the rate or rent to be paid for the use of the water by hydrants, fire plugs and public buildings.\nBy section 20 of the same act corporations are empowered to make by-laws for the management and conduct of the water-works and for the collection of the water rent, and also for allowing a discount for pre-payment.\nBy the General Municipal Act of Ontario (R.S.O. 1887, cap. 184, sec. 480, subsec. 3), it is made obligatory on a municipal corporation which has con- structed water-works, where there is a sufficient, supply of water, to supply with water all buildings within the municipality situate upon land lying along any supply pipe of the corporation, upon the same being requested by the owner or occupant or other person in charge of the building.\nBoth the courts below were of opinion that the buildings belonging to the Dominion Government, to which water was supplied, were public buildings within the meaning of 35 Vict. cap. 9 section 12, and of section 19 of the general act R.S.O. cap. 192. It was also hold that these buildings were \u201cGovernment institutions\u201d within the terms of the by-law.\nFrom these conclusions I see no grounds for differing and I therefore adopt them as well as the reasons upon which they are founded. I also agree that the by-law is not to be considered as imposing a tax upon the Dominion Government, and I do not understand the appellant\u2019s case to be rested on any such ground. The learned counsel for the appellant, in his factum as well as in the argument at this bar, impugned the decision under appeal not as sanctioning the imposition of a tax upon the Dominion, but as supporting a by-law which contravened public policy in rendering nugatory to some extent the general law and an express provision of the British North America Act exempting the property of the Dominion from taxation, by making that exemption the ground for a discrimination against the crown in the price charged to it for water; that is by refusing to allow it the benefit of the discount. This I consider something very different from an imposition of a tax. It is not to tax the crown but to make the crown pay a higher price for the supply of an element which the city was bound to furnish to it, for the reason that the property to which it was supplied was by law and in the public interest exonerated from taxation. The authority to enact the by-law allowing a discount is to be found in subsection 2 of section 20 of the general Water-works Act of 1887, having originated in the general act of 1882. I consider the authority to pass a by-law to regulate the price of the water is to be derived from section 19 of the general act. This section, it seems to me, supersedes section 12 of the local act of 1871-1872. This is not a matter of much importance. The reason that I refer to it is that the 12th section of the latter act directs that the water rates shall be fixed with a due regard to the assessment of the property supplied, meaning of course the assessment for the purpose of general taxation. Even if we are to treat the special act as being still in force, and are to attribute this by-law to the powers contained in it, this can make no difference as this reference to the assessment and to any special benefit which might be derived from the water-works applies only to the case of private owners or occupants, and has no reference whatever to the case of public buildings, the provision relating to which forms an independent branch of the same section. I am of opinion, however, that the 12th section of the special act is altogether superseded by the 19th section of the general act.\nA good deal has been said in argument, and some allusion was also made to it in the judgments below, about the reasonableness of charging differential rates against persons not paying taxes. I am unable to recognize any force in this argument. The waterworks were not constructed for the benefit of the rate-payers alone, but for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the city generally, whether tax-payers or not. The provision embodied in section 480, subsection 3 of the Municipal Act (which is referred to above) has a most important bearing upon this. That provision makes it a duty obligatory upon the city to furnish water to all who may apply for it, thus treating the corporation not as a mere commercial vendor of a commodity but as a public body entrusted with the management of the water for the benefit of the whole body of inhabitants, and compelling them as such to supply this element, necessary not merely for the private purposes and uses of individuals but indispensable for the preservation of the public health and the general salubrity of the city. It must therefore have been intended by the legislature that the water was to be supplied upon some fixed and uniform scale of rates for otherwise the city might, by fixing high and exorbitant prices in particular cases, evade the duty imposed by this section. In other words, the city, like its predecessors in title the water\u2011works commissioners, is in a sense a trustee of the water-works, not for the body of rate-payers exclusively but for the benefit of the general public, or at least of that portion of it resident in the city; and they are to dispense the water for the benefit of all, charging only such rates as are uniform, fair and reasonable. This obligation is to be enforced by subjecting the by-laws indispensable for the legal enforcement and collection of rates, and which the city council have power to pass, to a judicial scrutiny in order to ascertain whether they comply with the conditions which, as before stated, it is a fair implication from the statute they were intended to be subjected to, and also whether they conform to the requisites essential to the validity of all municipal by-laws in being, so far as the power to enact them is left to implication, consistent with public policy and the general law, uniform in operation, fair and reasonable. A writer of high authority on the law of Municipal Corporations[3], thus states the law on this head: In England the subjects upon which by-laws may be made were not usually specified in the King\u2019s Charter, and it became an established doctrine of the courts that every corporation had the implied or incidental right to pass by-laws; but this power was accompanied with these limitations, namely: that every by-law must be reasonable and not inconsistent with the charter of the corporation, nor with any statute of Parliament; nor with the general principles of the common law of the land, particularly those having relation to the liberty of the subject or the right of private property. In this country the courts have often affirmed the general incidental power of municipal corporations to make ordinances, but have always declared that ordinances must be reasonable, consonant with the general powers and purposes of the corporation, and not inconsistent with the laws or policy of the state.\nAnd this is not new law for we find the same principle applied to the by-laws of a municipal corporation created by Royal Charter in a case reported in Hobart[4].\nThe first objection to this by-law is that it expressly contravenes the general policy of the law in disregarding an express enactment of the paramount legislature as well as a well defined rule of the common law. By the 125th section of the British North America Act it is enacted that:\nNo lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nAgain, by an ancient and well established rule of the common law, the property of the crown is not subject to a tax imposed by a general law, and in no case unless expressly made so liable by statute[5]. I entirely agree that this by-law does not attempt directly to contravene these provisions of the statute and the general law by imposing a tax or anything in the nature of a tax upon the property of the Dominion; but it does, in my judgment, contravene the general policy of the law embodied in this enactment and rule, when it makes the exemption conferred by paramount legislation and lawful prerogative the condition for discriminating against the crown and compelling it to pay an enhanced price for the water required for use in its public buildings. I can conceive no stronger case of a by-law conflicting with the policy of the law.\nThen, a distinct ground for holding this by-law bad, irrespective altogether of the ground before stated, is that it is unreasonable and unfair in making an unwarranted discrimination against a particular consumer of water. In the case of the Red Star Steamship Co. v. Jersey City[6] a by-law of a water board requiring certain consumers of water to put in expensive meters, not making such requirement uniform and general, was held bad on this ground. The cour in its judgment says:\nThe by-laws of a board of managers of city waterworks for the supply of water to the citizens must be consistent with the charter, and they must not conflict with any constitutional, statutory or common law rights of property of the citizen. This I understand to be the meaning of the proviso in section 87 of the charter, that the by\u2011laws, rules and regulations are not to be inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the State of New Jersey or of the United States. They cannot make unwarranted discrimination in particular cases, or arbitrary charges, with the penalty of forfeiture of the right to use the water provided at the public expense for the benefit of all the citizens making a fair compensation for its use.\nIn this case the charter expressed the limitation that the by-laws were to be consistent with the constitutions and laws, but this does not make it any the less an authority in the present instance, for here the same qualification must be implied.\nIn another New Jersey case, Dayton v. Quigley[7] the Chancellor says:\nThe water-works belong to the municipality and are for the benefit of the inhabitants of the city. The inhabitants are entitled to the use of the water on compliance with reasonable regulations. If these cases are correct exponents of the law, and I have no reason to doubt that they are approved as they have been by the distinguished jurist in whose work I find the reference to them, it is impossible that this by-law can be maintained.\nHad the Provincial legislature possessed plenary powers of legislation, unfettered by any provision in the British North America Act, I should have considered that the by-laws which it empowered first the water-works commissioners and then the city to make must have been fair, reasonable and uniform regulations as regards rates. Of course in the case just supposed the exact case presented here could not have arisen, but even so, and assuming that the Provincial legislature could confer unlimited authority to impose arbitrary and discriminating rates for the water they would not be deemed to have intended to do so from a power to make by-laws expressed in general terms. But the power of the legislature of Ontario was not in this respect unfettered; it was bound to have regard to the provision of the British North America Act, and even if it had in so many words provided directly and immediately, without any delegation to the commissioners or to the city to pass by-laws, that the property of the Dominion Government should be excepted from the benefit of any by-law which might be made in exercise of the power to allow a discount such a provision would have been palpably unconstitutional and invalid. The Provincial legislature, however, has not done this and we must intend that they did not mean to attempt to confer any such power upon the corporation, either to assume to delegate a power to do that by by-law which they could not themselves have done directly, or any other power which conflicted in any way with those conditions which in the absence of express words are always implied in a grant of power to a municipal corporation to make by-laws.\nThere can be no practical difficulty now in providing for uniform rates for all public buildings since the corporation have the power at their will to affix meters either in the inside or to the outside of any public building in which water is consumed.\nIt was insisted at the argument that this by-law could not be attacked in a collateral proceeding like this, but that an application should have been made to quash it. Whatever force there may have been in this objection has become immaterial since the parties have consented that the appeal should depend exclusively on the validity of the by-law, and have asked the court to dispose of the case on that ground.\nThe appeal must be allowed and judgment entered for the crown for the amount of the rebate claimed. The crown must also have costs in both courts below.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014That the places mentioned to have been supplied with water and in respect of which the question in this case arises are within the exception contained in the by-law of the City of Toronto under consideration cannot, I think, admit of any doubt and the only question in the case appears to me to be, whether the city council had any power to enact such an exception.\nThere can be no doubt that the corporation had a sufficient supply of water to enable them to supply, for they did supply, the buildings in question with water. They were therefore under the obligation imposed upon them by subsec. 3 of sec. 480 of ch. 184 R.S.O. 1887 to supply the buildings with water. Now that obligation must be construed, as it appears to me, as extend- ing to this, that they must supply these buildings, although they are the property of the Dominion of Canada and are not assessable for city taxes, at the same rate or rent for the water consumed upon the premises as for the like service owners of buildings which are liable to be assessed for city taxes are supplied with water. There are two descriptions of water rates which are quite distinct, the one from the other, the one in the nature of an ordinary tax, and which whether water be or be not supplied for consumption is imposed upon all assessable real property in the municipality for raising a fund for the purpose of receiving payment of debentures issued for a large sum of money, the cost of construction and maintenance of the water-works, the other which is charged as a rent or rate for water actually supplied and consumed upon the premises to which it is supplied, and which is charged for at a rate fixed in proportion to the size of the building to which it is supplied, and to the purposes for which it is required\u2014the number of baths, boilers and such like things for which it is supplied. Now as to the rate imposed upon the assessable property, it must be imposed equally upon all the property liable to such assessment in proportion to the assessed value of such property. With that rate we have nothing to do\u2014there is none in the present case for the property of the Dominion, which the buildings here are, is not assessable for city taxes. The only questions therefore which appear to exist in the present case, are: 1st. As to the water rate charged for water actually supplied and consumed upon the premises to which it is supplied, can the corporation in any manner, directly or indirectly, impose upon one consumer of water whom they are under statutory obligation to supply with water, a greater rate or rent for the water supplied than under like circumstances, that is to say as to water supplied for consumption, they impose upon other consumers? and 2nd. Does a by-law which entitles one consumer to a reduction of the amount of the rate or rent due by him for water supplied to him by payment in advance of a reduced rate, and which denies to another the like reduction of the amount of rate or rent due by him for water supplied to him, constitute such inequality in the rate or rent charged for the water supplied as makes this distinction so made between the consumers of water illegal? By ch. 192, R.S.O. 1887, secs. 19 and 20, it is enacted that the corporation shall regulate the distribution and use of the water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required and from time to time shall fix the prices for the use thereof and the items of payment, and they may fix the rate or rent to be paid for the use of the water by hydrants, fire-plugs and public buildings and for the collection of the water rent and water rate, and for fixing the times when and the places where the same shall be payable, and also for allowing a discount for pre-payment and in case of default of payment may enforce payment, &c.\nNow by this power so conferred upon the corporation the legislature must, I think, be understood to have intended and enacted that the rate or rent charged to consumers of water for the water supplied to and consumed by them must be an equal rate charged to all consumers upon the like principle and just as the rate imposed upon assessable property must be an equal rate imposed upon all liable to assessment and in my opinion the corporation has no power to impose a greater rate or charge for water supplied to a consumer who is not liable for or subject to the assessable rate upon real property than under like circumstances they do impose upon consumers of water who are subjected to such assessable rate; and I cannot but think that a by-law which purports to give an allowance of fifty per cent by way of deduction from the rate or rent due for the water supplied and consumed to consumers who are also assessable rate-payers of the municipality and who shall pay such reduced amount of the half-yearly rate charged to them for water supplied within the first two months of each half year, that is to say so much in advance, but denies and refuses the like abatement for like payment in advance upon the amounts due as half-yearly rent or rate upon the water supplied to other consumers and because they are not subject to assessment for ordinary municipal rates, for that is what the by-law under consideration does, constitutes an inequality in the rate charged for water supplied which is not authorized by the statute.\nIt is idle to say that such an inequality in the amounts payable by such respective consumers of water for the water consumed by them, however equal in other respects the rate may be, is not inequality in the rates charged to such respective consumers of water for the water supplied to them. I am of opinion, therefore, that a by-law which professes to authorize such a distinction is quoad the distinction ultra vires of the corporation and invalid.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I have not been able to see any reason for doubting the correctness of the judgment in this case.\nThe charge for water is not a tax.\nThe Provincial legislature cannot tax Dominion property.\nTherefore, if this was a tax, and if the city is obliged to supply the Dominion officers with water, it would have to be supplied free from any charge.\nThat position is not taken by the appellant. On the contrary it is expressly disclaimed in his factum. Nor is it asserted that in this matter any peculiar duty towards the crown exists.\nThe crown has no more right to insist upon being supplied with water than has the owner of any building in the city.\nIt is the duty of the city[8] to supply with water,\nAll buildings within the municipality situate upon land lying along the line of any supply pipe of the said corporation, upon the same being requested by the owner, occupant or other persons in charge of such building.\nbut it is not its duty to supply it free of charge, or free from restrictions as to the quantity to be used, or the mode in which, or the purposes for which, it may be used[9].\nThe Corporation shall regulate the distribution and use of water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required, and from time to time shall fix the prices for the use thereof and the time of payment * * and may fix the rate or rent to be paid for the use of water by hydrants, fire plugs and public buildings, and from time to time make and enforce necessary by-laws, rules and regulations for allowing a discount for prepayment.\nThe water-works have been constructed at the cost of the ratepayers of the city[10] by levying a rate upon all ratable property in the city of Toronto.\nWe look at the assessment act[11] and we find a formidable list of buildings, institutions, and property of other kinds exempt from taxation.\nBuildings belonging to the Dominion Government are in the general category. The circumstance that they do not owe their exemption solely to this provincial legislation does not distinguish them from churches, schools, hospitals, poor houses, scientific institutions, orphan asylums, or any other of the long list. The common feature is that they are exempt; they are not ratable property and contribute nothing to the costs of the water-works.\nWhen therefore the city, fixing a uniform price for water supplied to buildings, provides that ratepayers may have an abatement if they pay promptly, no principle that I understand to apply to the case is violated by that provision.\nInequality and discrimination are denounced as odious and unjust but the appellant\u2019s denunciation of them is rather an inverted argument. It is in effect insisted that there shall be discrimination in favour of the properties that bear no share of the ordinary municipal burdens. Those properties enjoy the benefit of the municipal outlay to which they do not contribute, in matters which are common to all the inhabitants, roads, lights, police, &c., &c., and it is claimed that in respect of this special service of water they shall be made better off than the ratepayers by receiving the same abatement of price while they pay nothing towards the expenses of the construction of the works.\nWe have no question of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the prices charged. The matter is contested as one of principle, and once we divest ourselves of the notion of a tax and set aside theories on that subject I cannot understand on what principle the claim can be supported.\nI am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Macdonell & Wickham.\nSolicitor for respondents: C.R.W.

E. E. connected with two business firms in Montreal, viz., the firm of W. E. Elliott & Co., oil merchants, of which he was the sole member and Elliott, Finlayson & Co., wine merchants, made a judicial abandonment on the 18 th August, 1889, of his oil business. Both firms had kept their accounts with the Bank of Commerce The bank discounted for W. E. Elliott & Co., before his departure for England on the 30th June, a note of $5,087500 due 1st October, signed by John Elliott & Co. and endorsed by W. E. Elliott & Co. and Elliott, Finlayson & Co., and on the 5th July took as collateral security from Finlayson, who was also W. E. 'Elliott's agent during his absence, a warehouse receipt for 292 barrels of oil and the discount was credited to Elliott Finlayson & Co. On and about the 9th July 146 barrels were sold, and the proceeds viz., $3,528.30, were subsequently, on the 9th August, credited to the note of $5,087.50. On the 13th July Mc Dougall, Logie & Co. failed and W. E. E. was involved in the failure to the extent of $17 000 of which amount the bank held $7,559.00 and on the 16th July Finlayson, as agent for W. E. E., left with the bank as collateral security against W. E. E.'s indebtedness of $7599.30 on the paper of McDougall, Logie & Co., customers' notes to the amount of $2,768.28, upon which the bank collected $1603.43 and still kept a note of J. P. & Co. unpaid of $1,165.32. On the return of W. E. E another note of John Elliott & Co. for $1,101.33, previously discounted by W. E. E., became due at the bank thus leaving a total debit of the Elliott firms, on their joint paper of $2660.53. The old note of $5,087550 due 1st October, and the one of $11001.33 were signed by John Elliott & Co., and on the 10th August were replaced by two notes signed by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. and secured by 200 barrels of oil 146 barrels remaining from the original number pledged, and an additional warehouse receipt of 54 barrels of oil endorsed over by W. E. E. to Finlayson, Elliott & Co., and by them to the bank.\nThe respondent, as curator for the estate of W. E. Elliott & Co., claimed that the pledge of the 200 barrels of oil on the 10th August, and the giving of the notes on the 16th July to the bank week fraudulent preferences.\nThe Superior Court held that the bank had knowledge of \"W. E. E.'s insolvent condition on or about the 13th of July and declared that they had received fraudulent preferences by receiving W. E E.'s customers' notes and the 200 barrels of oil but the Court of Appeal, reversing in part the judgment of the Superior Court, held that the pledging of the 200 barrels of oil by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. on the 10th August was not a fraudulent preference.\nOn an appeal and cross-appeal to the Supreme Court:\u2014\nHeld 1st that the finding of the courts below of the fact of the bank's knowledge of W. E. Elliott's insolvency dated from the 13th July, was sustained by evidence in the case and there had therefore been a fraudulent preference given to the bank by the insolvent in transferring over to it all his customers' paper not yet due. Art. 1036 C.C. Gwynne J. dissenting.\n2nd that the additional security given to the bank on the 10th of August of 54 barrels of oil for the substituted notes of Elliott Finlayson & Co. was also a fraudulent preference. Art. 1035 C.C. Gwynne J. dissenting.\n3rd, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, that the legal effect of the transaction of the 10th August was to release the pledged 146 barrels of oil, and that they became immediately the property of the insolvent's creditors and that they could not be held by the bank as collateral security for Elliott, Finlayson & Co.'s substituted notes. Arts. 1169 and 1035 C C Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) varying the judgment of the Superior Court. The action was taken by the present appellant, Mr. Stevenson as curator to the insolvent estate of William E. Elliott, formerly a wholesale oil merchant of Montreal, against the Canadian Bank of Commerce to set aside certain transactions between Elliott and. the bank as being fraudulent preferences; and to recover the amounts so received by the bank in fraud of the ordinary creditors of the estate\nThe material facts upon which undue or fraudulent preference was charged were as follows:\nWilliam E. Elliott, the insolvent, was connected with two businesses in Montreal l\nFirst there was an oil business carried on by him alone under the style of \" W E. Elliott & Co.\"\nSecondly there was a wine business, in which he and one Alexander M. Finlayson were partners, carried on under the style of \"Elliott, Finlayson & Co.\"\nBoth firms kept their bank account with the respondent bank.\nOn June 30th 1887 W. E. Elliott offered for discount to Mr. Crombie the manager of the hank, a note signed by a firm of John Elliott & Co. (composed of Alfred G. Elliott- a brother of W. E. Elliott) dated June 28th for $5,087500, falling due October 1st, and endorsed by W. E. Elliott & Co. and Elliott, Finlayson & Co.\nOn July 5th, the bank received from Finlayson, who, besides being Elliott's partner in the wine business, was also his agent during his absence, promised security in the form of a warehouse receipt for 292 barrels of oil made out to the order of W. E. Elliott & Co and endorsed by them.\nOn the 13th of July & meeting was held of the creditors of McDougall, Logie & Co., a large oil manufacturing firm of Montreal, which had suspended payment some days previously and it became a matter of public notoriety that Elliott was involved in the failure to the extent Of $17,000 for accommodation paper given by him to the failed firm and of this amount the Canadian Bank of Commerce held $7,559.30.\nOn the same day the bank at the request of Mr Finlayson sold 146 barrels of this oil and on the 16th July the bank got Elliott's customers notes from Finlayson, who was acting as agent for Elliott while in England, as collateral for the general liability of Elliott to the bank.\nOn August 8th Elliott returned and gave the bank an additional warehouse receipt for fifty-four barrels of oil.\nOn August 9th there was at the bank another note signed by John Elliott & Co. to the order of W. E. Elliott & Co. and discounted by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. The amount of this note was $1,101.33; it bore date April 12th, 1887, at four months and was unsupported by collateral security.\nNext day, August 10th, the two old notes of John Elliott & Co. endorsed by W. Elliott & Co and Elliott Finlayson & Co. for the respective amounts of $5,087.00 on which only $1,559,20 was now due and which did not mature until October 1st and the other unsecured note for $1,101.33 were withdrawn from the bank and in their place were put two notes identical in terms with the former ones, bearing only the names of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. as makers, payable to the order of the bank\nOn the substituted note for $5,087.50 was endorsed a memorandum stating that it was substituted for the former one and was secured by the 146 barrels of oil remaining from the original number pledged.\nOn August 16th, two discounts went through the bank's books, to the credit of Elliott Finlayson & Co. These were:\n1. A note for $3,500 bearing only the name of Elliott; Finlayson & Co., secured by 200 barrels of oil consisting of the 146 barrels remaining out of the 292 originally pledged and also the 54 barrels left by Elliott on August 8th with the bank.\n2. A note for $7,263.33 made by John Elliott & Co. to the order of W. E Elliott & Co. by whom it was endorsed as well as by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. This note was nominally unsecured.\nThe proceeds of these discounts paid the balance due on the substituted notes\u2014$2,660.53.\nIn the Superior Court Mr. Justice Loranger gave judgment in the plaintiff's favour for $4,591.44 being the value of the oil pledged after the 13th July, 1887, and the amount realized on the customers' notes and also ordered the bank to deposit in court a promissory note of the face value of $1,174.76, or in default of doing so in the prescribed delay to pay that amount to the plaintiff.\nFrom this \"judgment the bank appealed and the Court of Appeals reduced the condemnation to $1,603.46 and also ordered the deposit of a note still in their possession ([2]).\nD. Macmaster Q.C. and C. Geoffrion Q.C. for appellant cited and relied on arts. 1032 1035 1036 1975 and 1169 C.C.; Delorimier, Code Civil, on arts. 1032, 1034, 1035 and 1036 ([3]); Dalloz Vo. Obligations ([4]); Larombi\u00e8re on Art 1183 ([5]) Laurent ([6]).\nLash Q.C. and Morris Q.C. for respondents cited and relied on arts. 1139 1488 and 1966a. C.C. Leake on Contracts ([7]); Pring v. Clarkson ([8]). THE CHIEF JUSTICE; I have read, the judgment which has been prepared by ray brother Fournier and I agree in the conclusion at which he has arrived, that the judgment of Mr. Justice Loranger was warranted by the evidence and ought to be restored, and, I desire only to add a few observations to the reasons he has given. The fact of W. E. Elliott's insolvency from an early date in July has been established by the evidence of Mr. Stevenson (the appellant) a professional accountant who swears that it is appearent from the books of the oil business and this is in no way contradicted. At all events after the meeting of the creditors of the firm of McDougall, Logie & Co., on the 13th of July, Elliott's insolvency became a matter of public notoriety, and the bank through its agent Mr. Crombie must be taken to have had notice of it. This last fact has been found by both the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench and is no longer open to dispute. From that date Mr. Crombie was bound to know that the assets of W. E. Elliott belonged to his creditors and that he had no longer any right to deal with or dispose of them to their prejudice. Acting on this principle the Court of Queen's Bench have held that the transfer of bills receivable belonging to W. E. Elliott, made by Finlayson at the request of Mr. Crombie on the 16th of July was an invalid transaction, for the reason that these bills were assess of an insolvent debtor which he had no right to abstract from the mass belonging to the general body of his creditors. The 200 barrels of oil, made up of 146 barrels, part of the 292 barrels originally pledged to the bank under an arrangement made in July when the note for $5,087 was discounted, and 54 barrels the warehouse receipts for Which were actually handed to Mr. Crombie by \"W. E. Elliott himself on the 8th of August after his return from England, have, however been held by the Court of Queen's Bench to. have passed out of the reach of the creditors. The reason alleged for this last conclusion is that Mr. Crombie had no notice that this lot of oil was the property of W. E. Elliott, it being apparently the property of another firm that of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. who were wine merchants and in which firm W. E. Elliott was a partner. I cannot agree in this conclusion. Of the 200 barrels 54 were received directly from W. E. Elliott himself, who on the 8th of August, after his return from Europe handed the ware house receipt to Mr. Crombie at first without any specific appropriation. This was certainly notice to the bank that these 54 barrels were Elliott's property and at all events it was sufficient to put the bank on inquiry, and if they had inquired they must have discovered (as the truth was) that the goods were assess which W. E. Elliott had no right to deal with in fraud of his creditors, and not having thought fit to inquire they are in the same position as if they had done so and had, as they inevitably must have done ascertained the truth. My brother Patterson, who is so far of accord with me, considers, however, that as to the remaining 146 barrels the evidence is not sufficient to fix the bank with notice of the actual fraud which W. E. Elliott was perpetrating in withdrawing these goods from his creditors. I am, however, compelled to come to a contrary conclusion. The whole 292 barrels, of which these 146 formed part and which were pledged as. collaterals for the $5,087 note discounted in July before there was any knowledge on the Part of the bank of the actual fact of \"W E. Elliott's insolvency, were arranged to be given to the bank as security for that discount by W. E. Elliott himself, so as to put him or Finlayson, who merely acted as his agent during his absence, in funds for the purpose of the oil business. Th\u00e9n the effect of the transaction on the 10th of August, 1887, in pursuance \u00a1 of which the note for $5,087 which had then been partially paid by crediting the proceeds of the 146 barrels of oil sold, as well as another prior note for $1,001 bearing the same names were satisfied and withdrawn from the bank by substituting\" two other notes of the same amount made by Elliott, Finlayson & Co., directly payable to the bank, was clearly a novation which had the same effect as a payment in money would have had as regards the former notes. The consequence was that the pledge did not attach to the new debt, but reverted to the debtor at that time represented by the creditors of the original, pledgor. Then took place the transaction of the 16th of August under which the whole 200 barrels of oil were pledged anew ostensibly by Elliott, Finlayson & Co., as collateral for a new note for $3500 discounted. All this oil then in truth belonged to W. E. Elliott subject to the rights of his creditors. What right had the bank to suppose it belonged to Elliott, Finlayson & Co.? As regards the 54 barrels which they had received directly from W. E. Elliott I have shown they had such notice as must be held fatal to their title. But I am unable to say that they are m a more advantageous position m respect of the remaining 146 barrels. The bank knew that these were originally also the property of w. E. Elliott, and that they had been pledged for a loan made for his own use for I think the circumstance that the proceeds of the original discount were carried to the credit of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. is a circumstance of little importance. It must have been known to Mr. Crombie when he got the warehouse receipt for the 292 barrels that Finlayson was acting as W. E. Elliott's agent, and held a power of attorney from him. The mere circumstance that the warehouse receipts (which I am convinced by the evidence of Mr. Davis were not deposited with, the bank until after the 12th of July when one of them bears date) were handed in by Finlayson after Elliott's departure makes no difference, for he did this in his capacity of agent for Elliott. Then the very nature of the goods themselves indicated prima facie that they were part of the stock in trade of the oil trading firm and not of the wine merchants. Altogether these circumstances pointed strongly to the fact that W. E. Elliott was pledging his own goods and not those of the wine business, in which he was a partner; and in the total absence of proof of any direct affirmation by Finlayson that the property in the oil belonged to his firm I am of opinion that it must have been apparent to Mr. Crombie at the time of the original pledge that the oil really belonged to W. E. Elliott. At all events the attendant circumstances were such as to be quite sufficient to have made it incumbent on Mr. Crombie to have investigated the matter further when, after the insolvency and on the 16th of August, he again took the same goods in pledge after the property in them had by the transaction of the 10th of August become revested in W. E. Elliott. This unusual and irregular transaction of the 10th of August-by which the novation already referred to was operated. was carried out not only in the interest of the bank. but also in the interest of W. E. Elliott, and there was therefore the additional circumstance to be taken into' consideration that Finlayson, if the oil had been really the property of his firm, would not after it had been once set free from the original pledge be likely again. to pledge it for the benefit of Elliott who was then notoriously insolvent. A little questioning, which I should have thought any careful man of business would have subjected the parties to, would have brought to light the fraud which Elliott was practising on his creditors. I am very far from. saying that Mr. Crombie was consciously a party to any fraudulent scheme, but he did not take proper precautions, and the consequence of his forbearance to make the inquiries which the conduct of the parties ought to have suggested must be held fatal to the security he took.\nIn what I have said I do not of course mean to lay down any proposition of law; all 1. decide is that the circumstances referred to create a prim\u0103tion presumption not of law but of fact that Mr. Crombie knew the oil belonged to W. E. Elliott and that this presumption has not been in any way rebutted. In other words I hold that it is established by sufficient circumstantial evidence that the bank was not in good faith.\nThe appeal must be allowed, the judgment of the Queen's Bench reversed, and that of the Superior Court restored with costs to the appellants in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelant, en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur \u00e0 la faillite de W.

Elliott et Cie, comme marchand d'huiles; il faisait aussi commerce comme associ\u00e9 dans un commerce de vins avec Alexander M. Finlaysons sous les noms et raison de Elliott, Finlayson et Cie.\nDes le premierjuillet, 1887, et avant cette date, W. E. Elliott et Cie \u00e8tait del\u00e0 insolvable. Ce fait est prouv\u00e8 par le curateur qui en parle d'apr\u00e8s la connaianance qu'il en a acquise par les livres de l'\u00e9tablissement, ainsi que par le fait que \"W. E. Elliott et Cie avait beaucoup d'autres dettes qui n'\u00e9taient pas entr\u00e9es dans leurs livres de compte.\nVers le 8 juillet 1887 le dit W. E Elliott et Cie dont les affaires \u00e8taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en mauvais \u00e8tat, pr\u00e8senta \u00e0 M.

Davis courtier et gardien d'entrep\u00f4t, qui a \u00e9mis un de ces re\u00e7us jure positivement qu'il l'a \u00e9mis le 12 juillet et non pas avant.\nLe 8 juillet le dit billet de $5,087.50 est escompt\u00e9 et entr\u00e9 dans les livres de la banque qui en porte le montant au credit d'Elliott, Finlayso et Cie. Le m\u00eame jour ces derniers donnent un \u00e9crit par lequel ils reconnaissent avoir donn\u00e9 les 292 barils d'huile comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale du paiement du billet de $5,087.50.\nPlus tard, vers le 13 juillet ils autoris\u00e8rent la banque \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser sur l'huile qu'elle d\u00e9tenait comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale, et \u00e0 en appliquer le produit en deduction du billet de $5,087500, quoiqu'il e\u00fbt encore plus de deux mois \u00e0 courir avant son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. La banque vendit en consequence pour la somme de $3,528.30 cent quarante-six barils d'huile sur les 292 qu'elle avait re\u00e7us en gage. Elle en porta leprix au compte des dits Elliott, Finlayson et Cie, ce qui r\u00e8duisit le montant du dit billet \u00e0 $1,55.20d d\u00e9uuction faire des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nLe lendemain de cette vente don; elle toicha le prix l'intim\u00e9e fit avec Elliott et Finlayson un arrangement par lequel elle consentit \u00e0 remettre \u00e0 John Elliott et Cie le billet de $5,087500 dont ils \u00e9taient les faiseurs et pour lequel les 292 barils d'hulle avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale et sur lequel il restait encore d\u00fb une somme de $1,559.20. John Elliott et Cie les faiseurs de ce billet \u00e9taient solvables et l'intim\u00e9e accepta an lieu de leur billet celui Elliott et Finlayson pour le m\u00eame montant que le billet originaire de $5,087,50. Ce changement de d\u00e9biteur accept\u00e9 par la banque a eu l'effet d'op\u00e9rer une novation de la dette et par cons\u00e9quent son extinction conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 1169 du Code civil. La banque par cette novation, \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 un paiement, perdit les 146 barils d'huile non vendus. D'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1975 elle ne pouvait retenir le gage que jusqu'au paiement; ce paiement a eu lieu ici par une novation qui a mis fin au gage et a fait retourner les 146 barils d'hulle non vendus \u00e0 W E Elliott et Cie. Ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement mis en gage par ce dernier afin de laisser \u00e0 Finlayson les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour conduire ses affaires en son absence. Le 10 aout, ce but ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint, l'hulle fut d\u00e9gag\u00e9e par la novation du billet qui a mis fin an contrat qu'elle avait fait lors de l'escompte du billet de $5,087.50. Lorsque cette transaction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dout la substitution du billet le 10 ao\u00fbt le dit W. L. Elliott \u00e9tait notoirement en faillite depuis le 13 juillet. De sorte que par la lib\u00e9ration des 146 quarts d.huile op\u00e9r\u00e9e par la notation les dits 146 quarss d'huile redevinrent la \"propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dit W. E. Elliott.\nCes 146 quarts ainsi lib\u00e9r\u00e9s du gage dans lequel ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compris avec 54 autres quarts d'huile restant encore \u00e0 W. E. Elliott formaient avec les dettes actives de son commerce la presque totalit\u00e9 de son actif. Nous allons voir maintenant le d\u00e9tail des operations par suite desquelles la banque de concert avec Finlayson, l'agent de W. E. Elliott, r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 se les approprier an pr\u00e9judice des cr\u00e9anciers\nLe 13 juillet survint la faillite de McDougall, Logie et Cie,manufacturiers d'huile, de Montr\u00e9al, dans laquelle W. E Elliott et Cie se trouyait d\u00e9biteur an montant de $17000 pour des billets d'accommodation fournis \u00e0 cette maison. Cette responsabilit\u00e9 entraina la banqueroute de W. E. Elliott et Cie, qui devint alors notoire et publique, comme l'ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 les deux cours Sup\u00e9rieure et d'Appel qui sont d'accord \u00e0 fixer la faillite 'de W. E. Elliott et Cie an 13 juillet. Finlayson, associ\u00e9 d'Elliott et qui conduisait ses affaires pendant l'absence de celui-ci, a connu le m\u00eame jour, 13 juillet, toute l'\u00e9tendue des responsabilit\u00e9s d'Elliott et Cie envers McDougall, Logie et Cie. Le montant de cette dette qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entr\u00e9 dans, \u00a1ses livres avait l'effet in\u00e9vitable de le rendre absolument insolvable. On va maintenant voir dans cette cause une chose bien rare; c'est que, malgr\u00e9 la banqueroute notoire de W. E. Elliott, la banque continue \u00e0 transiger avec lui par son agent Finlayson et par son g\u00e9rant Crombie, comme s'il e\u00fbt joui de la plus grande solvabilit\u00e9\nLe 16 ao\u00fbt elle escompta les billets suivants pour Elliott, Finlayson et Cie 1. Un billet de $3,500 avec la garantie collat\u00e9rale de 200 barils d'huile. Ces deux cents barils se composaient des cenf quarante-six quarts restant des 292 originairement d\u00f4mes en gage et qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9gag\u00e9s par le paiement dc la dette, an moyen de la substitution de billets comme on l'a vu plus haut\u2014et de 54 autres quarts que Elliott avait laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque le 8 ao\u00fbt, sans en avoir re\u00e7u aucune avance; 2. Un autre billet de $7,263,33 de John Elliott et Cie a l'ordre de W. E. Elliott et Cie endoss\u00e9 par eux et par Elliott, Finlayson et Cie. Le produit de ces escomptes servit \u00e0 payer la balance due sur les billets substitu\u00e9s, $2,660.33, compos\u00e9e, savoir: de la balance de $1,559.20 sur le billet de $5,087500 et celle de $1,101.33 montant d'un billet pour lequel il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 auparavant de garantie. Sur le total de cet escompte se montant \u00e0 au-del\u00e0 de $10,000, $2,660.33 des dettes de W. E. Elliott et Cie seulement furent pay\u00e9es, et la balance au del\u00e0 de $7,000, fut employ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'acquit des $7,000 de billets de McDougall, Logic et Cie, endoss\u00e9s par W. E. Elliott et Cie et d\u00e9tenus par la banque. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9puis\u00e9 tout son actif par ces diverses transactions qu'Elliott et Cie fit cession en faveur de ses cr\u00e9anciers La divergence d'opinion entre les deux cours est surtout quant \u00e0 l'effet l\u00e9gal de la mise en nantissement des deux cents barils d'huile.\nLa Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la banque ne connaissant pas que l'huile mise en gage par Elliott, Finlayson et Cie n'\u00e9tait pas leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le nantissement qu'ils en avaient fait \u00e9tait valable. Au contraire dans la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l'honorable juge Loranger a maintenu que la substitution de billets du 10 ao\u00fbt, en lib\u00e9rant les faiseurs des billets originaires de $5,087.50 de John Elliott et Cie, avait mis fin au contrat fait lorsque le billet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 escompt\u00e9 et que la banque avait alors perdu le droit de retenir les 146 barils d'huile qui avaient fait retour \u00e0 W. E. Elliott, alors en faillite. La mise en gage qui en fut faite subs\u00e9quemment, avec les 54 barils d\u00e9j\u00e0 laiss\u00e9s \u00e0 la banque, le fut \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la banqueroute d'Elliott et Cie \u00e9tait connue de la banque et partant nulle. La diff\u00e9rence de $2,998.00 qu'il y a entre les deux jugements, repose enti\u00e8rement sur la diff\u00e9rence d'opinion entre les deux cours au sujet du nantissement des deux cents barils d'huile.\nD'apr\u00e8s le jugement des deux cours la banqueroute d'Elliott est devenue notoire le 13 juillet, et Crombie, le g\u00e9rant de la banque, en a eu connaissance le m\u00eame jour.\nIl est evident que le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine quant aux 54 barils laiss\u00e9s vers le 8 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 la banque par W. E. Elliott, qui ne re\u00e7ut alors aucune avance de fonds, est erron\u00e9, car il \u00e9tait notoirement en banqueroute depuis le 13 juillet. Il est vrai que plus tard le 16 ao\u00fbt les 54 barils furent joints aux 146 restant du premier nantissement de 292, et furent donn\u00e9s en garantie, mais apr\u00e8s l'ouverture publique et notoire de la faillite de W. E. Elliott le nantissement alors fait se trouve partant nul comme fait en fraude des cr\u00e9anciers d'Elliott et Cie, pendant que celui-ci \u00e9tait en faillite.\nLa mise en gage des deux cents barils d'huile a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour du Banc de la Reine sur le principe que cette transaction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans l\u00e9 cours ordinarre des affaires, et qu'en l'absence de preuve de connivence entre les parties dans le but de commettre une fraude, et de connaissance de la part de la banque que l'hulle n'appartenait pas \u00e0 Elliott et Finlayson, la banque doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant acquis un titre l\u00e9gal \u00e0 la dite quantit\u00e9 d'huile, avec plein droit d'en disposer pour son profit.\nCes transactions seraient sans douie valables s'il \u00e9tait vrai que la banque n'agissait pas de connivence avec Elliott et Finlayson et si elle ignorait que l'huile ne leur appartenait pas. Mais la preuve \u00e9tablit au contraire, bien clairement que l'huile \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e8 de W. E. Elliott. Crombie, le g\u00e9rant de la banque qui connaissait la faillite de W. E. Elliott depuis le 16 juillet, savait aussi que cette quantit\u00e9 d'huile appartenait \u00e0 W E. Elliott, parce qu'il avait eu les re\u00e7us d'entrep\u00f4ts le 8 \"juillet, lorsque les 292 barils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s comme sirot\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale la premi\u00e8re fois il up pouvait ignorer que la balance de 146 quarts avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9gag\u00e9e par le paiement du billet de $5,087.50 et \u00e9tait redevance la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de \"W\". E. Elliott le 10 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 \u00e9tant en faillite il n'\u00e9tait plus possible de la donner comme garantie collat\u00e9rale\nIl n'est pas possible de consid\u00e9rer la banque comme agissant suivant le cours ordinaire des affaires lorsqu'elle retirait le 10 ao\u00fbt le billet de $5087.50 qui n'\u00e9tait d\u00fb que le premier octobre suivant, pour y substituer un autre billet du m\u00eame mitant, portant la m\u00eame date, mais sign\u00e9 par Elliott, finlayson et Cie, \u00e0 l'ordre de la banque, perdant ainsi son recours contre le faiseur originaire, John Elliott et Cie qui \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme solvables. Ce n\u00e8tait pason plus suivant le cours ordinaire des affaires de banque de prendre un billet payable \u00e0 son ordre comme celui qui fut subs titu\u00e9.\nC'\u00e9tait encore moins suivant le cours ordinaire des affaires d'escompter 'pour un failli dont elle connaissait, par son g\u00e9rant Crombie, la faillite depuis un mois et de faire un contrat de nantissement que la faillite rendait nul.\nN'est-il pas \u00e9trange que six jours \u00e2pres avoir fait cette substitution de billets et presque au moment de la faillite de W. E. Elliott, le g\u00e9rant Crombie, avec la participation d'Elliott, Finlayson et Cie, alt eu recours \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9dient de l'escompte d'un billet de $3,500 pour s'approprier les deux cents barils d'huile ? En effet, les 146 barils d'hulle d\u00e9gag\u00e9s par la substitution de billets, avec les 54 livr\u00e9s par W. E. Elliott \u00e0 la banque vers le 8 ao\u00fbt furent donn\u00e9s comme s\u00fbret\u00e8 collat\u00e9rale de ce nouvel escompte fait dans le but de cacher l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des transactions de la banque avec Elliott et Finlayson La mise en gage par Finlayson des 146 barils d'huile en garantie de cc nouveau billet de $3,500 est une reconnaissance compl\u00e8te qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9gag\u00e9s de la garantie du billet de $5,087.50; mais la faillite les avait fait revenir \u00e0 W. E. Elliott. Crombie dit de ces transactions que le jugrement de la Cour du Bane de la Reine a trou\u00e9e faite suivant le cours ordinaire des affaires:\nI do not know what to make out of it\nD'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Crombie, le 16 avril 1887, le produit de l'escompte du billet de $7,263 et de celui de $3500 se trouvait au cr\u00e9dit d'Elliott, Finlayson et Cie et leur donnait une apparence de cr\u00e9dit. Mais un examen de l'emploi de ces argents fait voir que l'escompte de $7,233.33 n'\u00e9tait qu'une man\u0153uvre de tenue de livres de compte, que la banque ne s'est nullement d\u00e9partie de l'argent,\u2014qu\u2019il n'y a eu qu'un changement d'entr\u00e9es dans le grand-livre.\nCe jour-l\u00e0, le 16 ao\u00fbt, la banque poss\u00e9dait pour $7,599.30 du papier d\u00e9shonor\u00e9 de McDougall, Logie et Cie, endss\u00e9 par W. E. Elliott, qui se trouvait entra\u00een\u00e9 dans la dite faillite. Elliott, Finlayson et Cie \u00e9taient aussi endosseurs du papier de McDougall, Logie et Cie au montant de $2,288.11. La banque fit alors volontiers l'escompte des susdits deux billets \u00bfont le produit servit au paiement du papier de McDougall, Logie et \\Cie.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de la valeur des deux cents barils d'hulle que la banque a ill\u00e9galement obtenus par les moyens d\u00e9tourn\u00e9s ci-haut mentionn\u00e9s, elle s'\u00e9tait, en outre, le 16 juillet, fait remettre des billets de pratiques du commerce d'huile de \"W\". E. Eliot au montant de $2,768. Quant \u00e0 ces billets le jugement de la Cour d'Appel a tout-\u00e0-fait confirm\u00e9 celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. il condamne l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 remettre la somme re\u00e7ue sur ces billets et \u00e0 rendre ceux qui lui restent entre les mains. Le consid\u00e9rant de la cour du Banc de la Reine est en ces termes:\nConsidering that the Bank by its Manager, Alexander M. Crombie, had reason to know that the said \"William E Elliott was insolvent on the 16th of July, 1887, when at his instigation the agent of the said william E. Elliott transferred to it the said Promissory to the amount of $2,768.78, as collateral security for bills or promissory notes for which he might be liable and when he was so liable to the -Sank to the extent of $7559 30 for accommodation given by him to the then suspended firm of McDougall, Logie & Co., and his own insolvency had become notorious;\nConsidering that the said transfer was, in effect, a payment by an insolvent to a creditor knowing his insolvency, and that under article 1036 of the Civil Code it must be deemed to have been made with intent to defraud and that the Bank appellant must therefore be compelled to restore the said promissory notes, or their value, for the benefit of the said William E Elliot\u2019s creditors\nCe consid\u00e9rant est fond\u00e9 sur la preuve. D'ailleurs cette partie du jugement n'est pas attaqu\u00e9e. Mais le fait si emphatiquement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la banque, par son agent Crombie, a su qu'Elliott \u00e9tait insolvable le 16 juillet, ne doit-il s'appliquer qu'\u00e0 la remise de billets. N'a-t-il pas aussi ses effets l\u00e9gaux sur la mise en gage des deux cents barils d'huile ? D'aborad, il ne peut y avoir de difficult\u00e9 par rapport aux 54 quarts d'huile qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9s \u00e0 la banciue le o ao\u00fbt \"par Elliott et Cie sans recevoir aucune avance. Ces 54-quarts \u00e9taient d\u00e9gag\u00e9s de tous liens et faisaient partie de la masse en faillite. Ni W. E. Elliott ni son agent ne pouvait plus en disposer. La remise gratuite qui en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 8 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 la banque \u00e9tait nulle \u00e0 cause de la faillite d'Elliott suivant l'article 1034 Code Civil . Les 146 quarts d\u00e9gag\u00e9s par la novation op\u00e9r\u00e9e le 10 ao\u00fbt ne pouvait plus, \u00e0 cause de la faillite \u00e0 l a masse de laquelle ils \u00e9taient rentr\u00e9s, faire le sujet d'un contrat m\u00eame on\u00e9reux, ni par Elliott, ni par son agent, avec la banque, comme le gage qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le of ao\u00fbt par Finlayson, par\u00e9e que d'apr\u00e8s le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine la banque avait connaissance par Crombie de la faillite d'Elliott. D'apr\u00e8s l'artidle 1035 cette mise en gage du 16 ao\u00fbt est nulle.\nIl n'est pas facile de comprendre aussi pourquoi la Cour du Banc de la Reine n'a pas fait application des effets l\u00e9gaux de la faillite \u00e0 la mise en nantissement des deux cents barils d'huile comme elle l'a fait pour la remise de billets de pratiques. La raison qu'elle en donne est que la mise en nantissement a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans le cours ordinaire des affaires, mais les faits cites plus haut prouvent que tel n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas. Cette transaction n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par la banque qu'avec la parfaite connaissance, qu'elle avait par son g\u00e9rant Crombie depuis le 16 juillet de la faillite de W. E. Elliott et dans le but d'obtenir une injuste pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur les autres cr\u00e9anciers. En cons\u00e9quence, l'appelant a droit d'obtenir, en addition au jugement de la Cour du danc de la Reine, la somme de $2998 produit de la vente des deux cents barils d'buile et que la condamnation de l'intim\u00e9 rendue par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure soit r\u00e9tablie avec d\u00e8pens.\nAppel allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e8pens et contre-appel renvoy\u00e9 -avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred with. FOURNIER J.\nGWYNNE J. The plaintiff suet as curator of the estate of one William E. Elliott who on the 18th. August 1887 abandoned all his estate and effects for the benefit of his creditors. At the time of such abandonment he was a partner with one Alexander M. Finlayson doing business together as wine and spirit merchants, under the name, style and firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co., and he himself at the same time was carrying on a business of his own as a dealer in oil under the name of W. E. Elliott & Co. The declaration alleges that for some time prior to the said abandonment he was a customer of the defendant bank as was also the firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co., and that Elliott himself and the firm of Elliott Finlayson & Co, procured advances from the defendants upon negotiable paper, and that he the said William E. Elliott with intent to defraud his creditors made divers fraudulent and preferential payments to the defendants and gave them divers large quantities of oil and bills and notes and other negotiable instruments as collateral security to the defendants for their advances; and that he retired certain notes placed by him and by the firm of Elliott Finlayson & Co. with the defendants for discount and upon which the defendants made certain advances before the maturity of the said notes, and that the defendants, fraudulently and to the prejudice of the creditors of the said. William E. Elliott accepted payments on account of the said notes before maturity and. released, certain \"parties theretofore bound to the said William E. Elliott as parties to the said negotiable instruments and accepted, nominally from the said firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co., but really from the said William Elliott, a large quantity of oil the property of the said William E. Elliott as collateral for the pretended advances made by the defendants to the said Elliott and to the said firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Company; and that at the time the said preferential payments were made the defendants and their manager Alexander M. Crombie were aware of the fact that the said William E. Elliott Was insolvent and unable to pay his creditors in full; and the said payments were made with the object of obtaining for the said defendants a preference over and above the other creditors of the said insolvent and that the amount of such preferential payments exceeded the sum of ten thousand dollars. The defendants met this declaration by a demurrer and a general denial of all the allegations in the declaration and especially by a denial that the defendants ever received from the said William E Elliott any fraudulent and preferential payments and they averred that any collateral security which the defend ants received was legally received\nThe evidence in the case discloses the facts following namely, that on the 8th July, 1887, the defendants through their manager, Alexander M. Crombie, discounted for the firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Company a promissory note for $5,087500 bearing date the 28th of June, 1887, payable three months after date, which was made by a firm styled John Elliott & Co., payable to the order of the said William E Elliott & Co and endorsed by the said William E. Elliott and by Elliott Finlayson & Co. This note was discounted by the defendants upon the hypothecation by way of collateral security of 292 barrels of oil whereof Elliott, Finlayson & Co. represented themselves to be and by certain warehouses receipts produced by them appeared to be tue bona fide owners. The hypothecation of this oil was attempted to be assailed by the plaintiff at the trial but upon no solid grounds; and it is now unnecessary to discuss the grounds upon which it was assailed for the transaction has been maintained by the judgment of the Superior Court and no appeal from that judgment has ever been taken. That transaction, therefore, which lies at the foundation of a considerable portion of the subsequent transactions which are assailed by the plaintiff must now be regarded as absolutely unimpeachable.\nNow upon the 13th July, 1887, a trading firm styled McDougall, Logie & Co. became insolvent and the failure of this firm disclosed the fact that William E. Elliott was liable as accommdation endorser upon the paper of the firm to the amount of about $16,000 or $17,000 of which paper to the amount of $7,559.00 was held by the defendants. In the paper so held by the defendants were two promissory notes which the defendants had discounted for W. E. Elliott the one for $1,441.74, and the other for $1,541.62 amounting together to $2,983.36 made by McDougall Logie & Co., payable to and endorsed by Wm. E. Elliott & Co. At the time of the failure of McDougall, Logie & Co. William E. Elliott was not in Canada he having left for England about the 6th or 7th of July, after the defendants had agreed to discount for Elliott Finlay-son & Co. the above note for $5087.50, with the hypothecation of the 292 barrels of oil as collateral security hut before the actual discounting of that note which took place on the 8th July. When William E. Elliott left for England it appears, as testified by Alexander M. Finlayson, that he left with Finlayson a general power of attorney enabling him to act for Elliott in all matters relating to his private affairs and to the business of William E. Elliott Co. Upon the failure of McDougall, Logie & Co. Finlayson communicated the information by cable to Elliott, who, as Finlayson swears, replied by cablegram that he, Elliott, on his return would settle everything. Finlayson swears that at this time he had no idea that Elliott was insolvent or likely to become so. In consequence of the two notes above mentioned, amounting to $2983.36 having become due by reason of McDougall, Logic & Co.'s failure, Mr. Crombie applied to Finlayson, as representing Elliott, for some collateral security in respect of these notes. Mr. Crombie swears that at this time he had no information whatever of the insolvency of Elliott nor had he until about the 3rd of September upon his return from his vacation upon which he had left Montreal on the evening of the 15th August, and that when he left Montreal upon that occasion he entertained no doubt whatever of the solvency of Elliott He said that when Elliott first did business with the bank, which was in the spring of 1887, he represented himself to be possessed of considerable means, and he presented a statement of his affairs which Mr. Crombie believed to be true and which showed him to be if it had been true perfectly solvent in fact so much so that his liability to the amount o $16,000 or$17,000 upon McDougall, Logic & Co.'s paper did not shake Mr. Crombie's confidence in his solvency, although he says that it made him consider it to be his duty to ask for the collaterals upon McDougall, Logie & Co.'s failure, which he says he would have done if Elliott had been worth $10,000. He acted in that matter as he considered to be his duty to the bank, and he had no knowledge whatever of Elliott's insolvency. That he was then insolvent there can be no doubt, and that he was an unscrupuloss and dishonest man may be admitted, but he appears also to have been a clever concealer of his true character and of the true condition of his affairs, for not a single witness was called who spoke of any doubt as to his solvency having been entertained by any one, notwithstanding his liability as appearing on the paper of the insolvent firm of McDougall, & Co.\nThe material question, however, in the present case, is the knowledge of the defendants or their officer of Elliott's insolvency at the time of the transactions with the defendants which are assailed by the plaintiff. The only officer of the defendants to whom such knowledge is imputed is their manager at Montreal, Mr. Crombie, who swears most positively not only that he had no such knowledge hut that he had not a doubt as to the solvency of Elliott until he heard of his insolvency upon his return from his vacation about the 3rd of September, and nothing has been suggested as bringing home knowledge of Elliott's insolvency save only the fact that he was upon McDougall, Logie & Co.'s paper as an accommodation endorser to the amount of $16,000 or $17,000. Upon the 16th July, 1887, Finlayson, acting under a power of attorney from Elliott, and believing as he swears Elliott to be then perfectly solvent, in reply to Mr. Crombie's request for collateral security for the notes of the insolvent firm of McDougall, Logie & Co., which had been discounted by the bank for Elliott, handed to him the promissory notes of divers persons made payable to W. E. Elliott & Co., but not then yet due, amounting in the whole to $2,768.88, to be held as such collateral security. Upon Elliott's return to Montreal on the 7th or 8th of August Finlayson informed him of what he had so done, of the notes so deposited with the defendants as such collateral security. They subsequently collected the sum of $1533.44 and still have a note of John Paxton & Co. which is not yet paid, amounting to $1,165.32. Upon the 13th of July, 1887, Mr. Finlayson, acting on behalf of the firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Company, requested Mr. Crombie, as manager of the defendants, to sell 146 of the barrels of oil deposited as collateral upon the discounting of the note of the 28th June for $5,077.50, and to credit the firm with the proceeds as against the note. A sale was accordingly made of 146 barrels of the oil through Elliott, Finlayson & Company's broker to a firm named R. C. Jamieson & Co., upon their promissory note for $3,528.80 payable and paid to the bank on the 9th August, 1887, and by the defendants then applied in reduction of the said note for $5.087.50. Upon the return of Mr. W. E. Elliott from England, and on or about the 7th or 8th August, he called upon Mr. Crombie at the bank and deposited with him a warehouse receipt for 54 other barrels of oil as the property of Elliott, Finlayson & Co., with a view to their shortly obtaining an advance thereon from the bank. He spoke of being temporarily put about by the failure of McDougall, Logie & Co., who were largely indebted to him, and he stated that if an arrangement could be made whereby the defendants would give up the note for $5087500 of which John Elliott & Co were makers and also another note dated the 12th April, 1887, for $1,101.33 whereof John Elliott & Co were also makers, and which would fall due on the 15th August, his brother Alfred Elliott, who represented John Elliott & Co., would assist him with a note or money sufficient to enable him to get over the temporary difficulty in which the failure of McDougall, Logie & Co. had placed him. Eventually it was agreed between Mr. Crombie and Elliott, Finlayson & Co., that as the bank still held. 146 barrels of oil as collateral security for the balance which would remain due on the note for $5,087.00 after crediting thereto the proceeds of the 146 barrels sold to R. C. Jamieson & Co the defendants would take notes of Hliott, Finlayson, & Jo. bearing the same dates respectively and for the same amounts respectively, and coming due respectively at the same periods as the notes for $5,087.50 and $1,101.33 which the bank already held, in order to enable them to get the assistance promised by John Elliott & Co. upon their getting the notes already given by that firm removed out of the way and thus giving until the 15th of August when the note for $1,331.66 would fall due to enable the proposed arrangement with John Elliott & Co. to be completed. Accordingly upon the 10th of August, 1887. the defendants gave up to Elliott, Finlayson & Co. the said two notes made by John Elliott & Co., upon receiving from Elliott Finlayson & Jo in substitution therefor their promissory notes as follows:\u2014\nDue 1st October, 1887. MontReal, June 28th, 1897.\n$5,087.50. Three months after date we promise to pay to the order of the Canadian Bank of Commerce at our office in Montreal five thousand and eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents for value received.\nELLIOTT FINLAYSON & CO.\nUpon the back of this note was endorsed the following memorandum:\nThis note is substituted for that of John Elliott & Co for attip amount due 1st October, 1887 removed from the Canadian Bank of Commerce to-day and secured by warehouse receipts for oils, some of which have already been realized by the bank. This note to be returned to us on payment of the balance due 10th August. E, F. & CO.\nMONTREAL, 12th April, 1887.\nDue 15th August, 1887.\n$1,101.33. Four months after date we promise to pay to the order of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, at our office in Montreal eleven hundred and one dollars and thirty-three cents for value received.\nELLIOTT FINLAYSON & CO. On the same day Elliott, Finlayson & Co. together with the above notes delivered, to Mr. Crombie the letter following: \u2014\nMONTREAL, 10th August, 1887.\nTo the Manager of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Montreal.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Referring to John Elliott & Co.'s notes for $1,101.33 due 15th August and $5,087.50 due 1st October, discounted with you and which have been handed to us to-day we now replace them by our notes as per memo, at foot to which please attach the ware house receipts you hold against John Elliott & Co.ss notes and credit us with the amount of cash realized by the sale of linseed oil. As soon as the balance of the loan is paid you we will claim our two notes.\nYours faithfully,\nELLIOTT FINLAYSON & CO.\nMemo Our note 4 months 12th April due 15th August\n$1,101.33\nOur note 3 months 28th June due 1st October\n5087.50\n$6,188.83\nUpon the 15th August when the note for $1,101333 became due, Elliott, Finlayson & Co. brought to Mr. Crombie their own note for $3,500 made payable to the bank and falling due on October 3rd, and a note for $7,263333 dated August 12 and payable five months after date made by John Elliott & Co. payable to W. E Elliott & Co and endorsed by W E Elliott & Co. and by Elliott, Finlayson & Co., and requested him to discount these notes for them with the hypothecation as security for the note for $3,500 of two hundred barrels of oil, namely, the 146 barrels already held by the bank as collateral to the note for $5,087.00 and the 54 barrels the warehouse receipts for which had been left with him on or about the 7th or 8th of August.\nMr. Crombie on the said 15th August before leaving Montreal on his vacation which he did on the evening of that day agreed to discount the two notes for them holding the warehouse receipts for the 200 barrels of oil as collateral security for the note for $3,500 and Elliott Finlayson & Co. undertaking to pay the balance remaining due on the note for $5,087.50 amounting to $1,559.00 and the note for $1,101.33 and he left instructions on leaving Montreal on the 15th with the hank officers that the said two notes should be discounted and the proceeds placed to the credit of Elliott, Finlay-son & Co. which was accordingly done on the 16th August, upon Elliott, Finlayson & Co. hypothecating as agreed upon the 200 barrels of oil as collateral security for the note for $3,500. By the sale of this oil the defendants subsequently realized the sum of $2,998.\nUpon this evidence the learned judge in the Superior Court rendered a judgment by which he adjudged that the defendants should pay to the plaintiff the sum of $4591244 being the amount realized by them from the notes handed to Mr. Crombie on the 16th July, 1887 and from the sale of the 200 barrels of oil hypothecated by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. on the 13th August, 1887, as collateral security for their note for $3,500 then discounted for them by the defendants and that they should give up to the plaintiff the note of Paxton & Co. \"Dayable to W E. Elliott which they had not received payment of. This judgment is based upon a finding by the learned judge as stated in his judgment that the said notes and oil were the property of the said W. E. Elliott and were appropriated by him in fraud of his own creditors for the purpose of duecuring the debts of the firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. when he the said W. E. Elliott was insolvent, and that the defendants had become accomplices with the said W. E. Elliott in the committing the said fraud upon his creditors by accepting his property as security for advances made to the firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. when they knew the said W. E. Elliott to be insolvent. From this judgment the defendants appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench Montreal in appeal which court has varied the said judgment in the manner and for the reasons following as appearing in the judgment of that court\nConsidering that the insolvency of the said William E. Elliott be-came notorious about the 13th day of July, 1887, when it became known at a meeting of the creditors of the firm of McDougall, Logie \" & Co., which had suspended payment, that he was involved to the extent of $17,000 for accommodation paper which he had given to that firm and of which the bank held paper to the extent of $7559.30 and that the said William E. Elliott made a judicial abandonment for the benefit of his creditors on the 18th day of August 1887;\nConsidering that the lot of 200 barrels of oil transferred to the bank on the 16th August, 1887, and held by the firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. under warehouse receipts issued in favour of the said William E. Elliott, but duly endorsed over by him to it, and was ostensibly its property, and that there is no proof that the bank was aware or even suspected that the said oil was not its property;\nConsidering that (under the arts. 1488 and 1966 of the Civil Code) the bank acquired a valid title to the said lot of oil when the said firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. on the 16th day of August, 1887, transferred it to the bank as collateral security for the payment of a promissory note for $3,500 payable on the 3rd day of October, 1887, and then discounted for the said firm and the said bank cannot now be troubled for the said oil or for the said sum of $2,998. being the proceeds of the sale thereof;\nConsidering that the bank, by its manager, Alexander M. Crombie, had reason to know that the said William E. Elliott was insolvent on the 16th of July, 1887, when at his instgation the agent of the said William E. Elliott transferred to it the said promissory notes to the amount of$2,768.78 as collateral security for bills or promissory notes for which he might be liable, and when he was so liable to the bank to the extent of $7,559.00 for accommodation given by him to the then suspended firm of McDougall, Logie & Co., and his own insolvency had become notorious.\nConsidering that the said transfer was in effect a payment by an insolvent to a creditor knowing his insolvency, and that under art. 1036 of the Civil Code it must be deemed to have been made with intent to defraud and that the bank appellant must therefore be compelled to. restore the said promissory notes, or their value, for the benefit of the said William E. Elliotts creditors.\nThe judgment then proceeds to allow the appeal of the defendants against the judgment of the Superior Court as to the said sum of $2998 realized from the sale of the said. 200 barrels of oil but condemns the defendants to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1,603.46, the amount realized from the notes handed to Mr Crombie on the 16th July, 1887, with interest thereon, and to deliver up to the prothonotary of the superior Court of the district of Montreal the John Paxton & Co.'s note for $1,165.32 within a prescribed time, or in default to pay the amount thereof to the plaintiff. From this judgment the plaintiff has appealed and the defendants have entered their cross-appeal.\nAs to the principal appeal which is that of the plaintiff and relates to the $2998 realized by the defendants from the sale of the 200 barrels of oil hypothecated by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. as collateral security for their note for $3,500 discounted for them on the 16th of August there cannot in my opinion be entertained a doubt that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in appeal is well founded and cannot therefore be disturbed\nThat the defendants and their manager Mr. Crombie, when upon the 8th July, 1887, they discounted for Elliott, Finlayson & Co. the note for $5,087.50, did so upon the faith of their having the 292 barrels of oil then hypothecated by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. as collateral security for the advents made to them upon that note and that they had reason to believe and did believe Elliott and Finlayson to have full power to hypothecate the oil as they did as their own property the evidence does not warrant a doubt and the bon\u00e2 fides of the defendants in that transaction is not now a matter in dispute.\nUpon the receipt by the defendants on the 9th of August, 1887, of the sum of $3,528.30, the proceeds of the 146 barrels of oil sold to \u00fc C J.mieson & Co the amount becoming due upon the above note was reduced to the sum of $1,559.20 for which the defendants held the remaining 146 barrels of oil as collateral and they continued to hold those 146 barrels as the property of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. and as security for the said sum of $1,559.00 in virtue of the arrangement made on the 10th August until the 16th of August when Elliott, Finlayson & Co. hypothecated the same 146 barrels together with the other of barrels the receipts for which represented that oil also to be the property of Elliott, Finlayson & Co., as collateral security for Elliott, Finlayson & Co.'s note for $3,500 discounted by the defendants on the said 16th of August.\nNow as to this hypothecation of these 200 barrels of oil on the 16th of August there does not appear to be a \"particle of evidence which would justify a judicial \"ribunal in adjudging that Mr. Crombie the defendant's manager knew or had reason to believe that in true Elliott, Finlayson & Co. had no right to deal with or to hypothecate as they did the oil in question. It is to my mind inconceivable that Mr. Crombie would have sacrificed the favourable position which upon the 10th of August, 1887, the defendant held in relation to the 146 barrels of oil then held by them under hypothecation and have authorized the discount for them of their note for $3500 on the 16th of August if he had not thoroughly believed that the right of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. to hypothecate the said 200 barrels of oil as security for that note as they did was indisputable beyond all doubt and question, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal that there is no evidence justifying an adjudication that the defendants or their manager knew or had reason to know or believe that Elliott, Finlayson & Co. had no such right is in my judgment unimpeachable. The appeal therefore of the plaintiff must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs. Now as to the cross-appeal which, affects the notes handed over to Mr. Crombie by Mr. Finlayson as agent for W. E. Elliott on the 16th of July 1887 as collateral security for the two notes amounting' together to $2983.66 made by McDougall, Logie & Co., and which by the failure of that firm had become due. This transaction is only disputed upon the contention that at the time when it took \"place the defendants through their manager Mr. Crombie knew that W. E. Elliott was insolvent, and that the object of the defendants' manager was thereby to obtain for them a fraudulent preference over W E Elliott's other creditors and that therefore the transaction was void under art 1036 of the Civil Code. The pivotal \"point in the transaction is the knowledge of Mr. Crombie on the 16th July, 1887, that W E. Elliott was then insolvent It is not suggested that there is any direct evidence that Mr. Crombie had such knowledge. The direct evidence is altogether to the contrary effect. He himself was the only witness examined upon the point and he most positively denies upon oath that he had any such knowledge then or at any time prior to his return to Montreal from his vacation on or about the 3rd of September, and he swears that when he left Montreal on the 15th August, after having made arrangements with Elliott, Finlayson & Company for the discounting of the two notes for $2500 and $7263366 respectively, he did not entertain the slightest doubt of Mr. W. E Elliott's solvency. The evidence, therefore, in order to be sufficient to justify the imputing to Mr. Crombie the knowledge required by the terms of art. 1,036 so as to avoid the transaction, must be sufficient to displace wholly this peremptory denial by Mr. Crombie of all knowledge of W. E. Elliott's insolvency. Now what the Court of Queen's Bench in that part of their \"judgment which is the subject of this cross-appeal, proceed upon, is not that any direct evidence of knowledge of W. E. Elliott's insolvency has been brought home to Mr Crombie, but upon this that in their opinion and judgment the insolvency of W. E. Elliott became notorious on about the 13th July (although there was no evidence given of the fact of such imputed notoriety) when it then became known at a meeting of the creditors of the firm of McDougall, Logie & Co., which had suspended payment, that Elliott was involved to the extent of $17000 for accommodation endorsements of the paper of that insolvent firm which the defendants held to the amount of $7559.30 and that therefore the defendants by their manager Mr. Crombie had reason to know that the said W. E. Elliott was insolvent when he received the promissory notes for $2768.88 on the 16th July 1887 at a time when Elliott's insolvency had become notorious, and they therefore concluded that the transfer of these notes to the defendants was in effect a payment by an insolvent to a creditor knowing his insolvency, and that therefore it must, under art. 1036, be deemed to have been made with intent to defraud. This language while it seems to relieve Mr. Crombie the defendants' manager, from any imputation of a positive intent to defraud and from any imputation of falsely denying that he had knowledge of W. E. Elliott's insolvency when the transaction of the 16th July, 1887, took place, rests the judgment of the court upon the foundation that as alleged in the judgment, the insolvency of Elliott was then notorious, and that, therefore, because of the imputed notoriety of such insolvency, Mr. Crombie had reason to know that W. E. Elliott was then insolvent whether in point of fact he did know it or not. The judgment thus seems to introduce into the art. 1036 language not to be found in it, but which was in the repealed Insolvent Act of 1875, whereby contracts made by a creditor with a debtor (whom the creditor not only knew to be insolvent but whom he had probable cause for believing to be insolvent) or after his inability to meet his engagements had become public and notorious, were avoided. But in the present case, as already observed, it is not suggested that there was any direct or positive evidence that upon the 16th July 1887 it was a notorious fact that W. E. Elliott was insolvent not a witness was called to testify to such a fact, and there was no direct or positive evidence whatever offered to that effect. That he was then notoriously insolvent is a conclusion drawn by the court from the single fact that at a meeting of the creditors of the insolvent firm of McDougall, Logie & Co, held on or about the 13th July, 1887, Mr. Elliott appeared to be an accommodation endorser upon their paper to the amount of about $17000 of which the defendants held paper to the amount of $7,559.00. The question therefore is reduced to this Did that fact so appearing constitute in law or in fact such notoriety of the fact that W. E Elliott was then insolvent as to justify the imputation of knowledge that Elliott was in point of fact then insolvent to Mr. Crombie, against his positive denial upon oath of any such knowledge and against his oath that Elliott had impressed him with such a belief in his solvency that his being involved as accommodation endorser on McDougall, Logie & Co.'s paper to the amount of $ 17,000 did not shake his confidence in Elliott's solvency ?\nIf Elliott's insolvency was so notorious a fact upon the 16th July as to justify the imputation of the knowledge of the fact then to Mr. Crombie, of course Elliott could not have taken up any of the notes of McDougall, Logie & Co. upon which he was endorser, nor could any other creditor of Elliott's have then or at any time since accepted payment from him of any debt whatever due by him. In my judgment the fact that Elliott appeared to be a creditor of McDougall, Logie & Co., as accommodation endorser of their paper to the amount of $17000 afforded no evidence of Elliott himself being then insolvent and as there was no other evidence whatever from which it has been suggested that upon the 16th of July, 1887, Mr. Crombie had reason to know or believe and should have known or believed Elliott to be then insolvent, the transaction of that day stands unimpeached. The case of Allen v. The Quebec Warehouse Company ([9]) was appealed to by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, and the rule there recognized that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council will not interfere with the judsrment of two course concurring upon a question of fact unless the finding be clearly erroneous, but neither that case nor the rule therein recognized can apply to a case where the conclusion upon the question of fact involved is drawn from premises which afford no warrant for the conclusions, and the rule moreover is expressly qualified by the condition that the conclusion is not clearly erroneous, and with great deference I must say that it appears to me it would be as reasonable to hold upon the evidence in the case that upon the 15th of August, 1887, when Mr. Crombie agreed to discount the notes for $3500 and $7263.86 he knew or had reason to know that Elliott intended to execute upon the 18th August a judicial abandonment of his estate as to hold that upon the 16th July he must have known or had reason to know that Elliott was then insolvent from the circumstance that upon the 13th July the insolvent firm of McDougall, Logie & Co. appeared to be indebted to him as accommodation endorser upon their paper to the amount of $17,000 for so much of which as the assets of the insolvent firm should be insufficient today he would be liable. In my opinion, therefore, the cross appeal should be allowed with costs and the action in the court below be ordered to be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J. We have an appeal by Stevenson, the plaintiff in the action and a cross-appeal by the bank.\nThe cross-appeal cannot, in my opinion, succeed.\nThere is no room to question the fact that William E. Elliott was insolvent, whether he or anyone else knew that he was, early in July, 1887. On the 13th of that month the fact transpired at a meeting of the creditors of the insolvent firm of McDougall, Logie & Co that Elliott was liable for $17,000 of the debts of that firm From that time the courts below that is to say the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench, agree in holding that his insolvency was notorious and that the Bank of Commerce knew of it. There was ample evidence to sustain that conclusion, and although it may be that evidence would also have warranted the finding that knowledge of Elliott's insolvency was not brought home to Mr. Crombie, the bank manager, until a later date, yet we must, as I apprehend, take the fact to be as found by the courts below.\nElliott had discounted with the Bank of Commerce paper of McDougall, Logie & Co. to the amount of $2,983 and he was further liable on two other notes of that insolvent firm held by the Bank of Commerce, the whole amount being more than $7,500.\nOn the 16th of July Elliott being then absent from Canada, Mr. Crombie asked Mr. Finlayson, who was acting for Elliott for collateral security, and obtained customers' notes to the amount of $2,768.78. These were expressed in the receipt given for them as being security for the general liability of Elliott, although the security seems to have been asked for with particular reference to the item of 2,982. The bank has been held liable under article 1036 of \u2022 the Civil Code to account for these access to the plaintiff as curator of the property and effects of W. E. Elliott.\nThe cross-appeal is against that decision. The complaint I understand to be rather against the finding of the fact that the bank had knowledge of Elliott's insolvency on the 16th of July than against the view of the law on which the court acted.\nI think we must dismiss the cross-appeal.\nIn the direct appeal the curator seeks to recover from the bank the value of 200 barrels of oil as assets of the insolvent W E Elliott in the business of dealer in oil which he carried on under the name of W. E. Elliott & Co., and which oil was pledged to the bank by the wine house of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. of which W. E. Elliott was a member.\nIn the court of first instance the plaintiff sued for 346 barrels of oil and he recovered for part viz. 200 barrels and failed as to 143 barrels. The defendants appealed from that decision to the Court of Queen's Bench and there the decision was against the plaintiff as to the whole of the oil\nOn the 8th of July 1887, the bank discounted for Elliott, Finlayson & Co. a note for $5,087.00, made by John Elliott & Co and endorsed by W. E. Elliott & Co. and by Elliott, Finlayson &.Co. To secure that note Elliott Finlayson & Co. transferred to the bank several warehouse receipts for oil covering in all 292 barrels which had been endorsed to that firm by the oil firm of W. E. Elliott & Co.\nThat transaction was in both of the courts below held to be unimpeachable.\nThe note was dated the 28th of June and was due on the first of October 1887. It was negotiated with the bank on the 8th of July. Familiar as the provisions of the Bank Act ([10]) respecting warehouse receipts may be we may usefully refer to one or two of them. Section 53 subsection 2 authorizes a bank to acquire and hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading as collateral security for the payment of any debt incurred in its favour in the course of its banking business; but, by subsection 4, the bank shall not acquire or hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading to secure the payment of any bill, note or debt, unless such bill note or debt is negotiated or contracted at the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank.\nIn connection with this, and in anticipation of what is to follow we may note that the customer of the bank was here Elliott, Finlayson & Co. The advance of money was to that firm, and, in the essence of the transaction, the other parties to the note were sureties to the bank for the debt incurred by the firm, although of course they became themselves directly liable under the law merchant. The warehouse receipts were security for the debt so incurred by Elliott, Finlayson & Co.\nIt became convenient at a later late in connection with the business of the Elliott firms to relieve the firm of John Elliott & Co. from liability on the note. That was effected by substituting for the note, with the consent of the bank another note similar in date amount aid tenor, except that it was made by Elliott, Finlayson & Co. and payable to the bank.\nI do not see that that substitution affected in any way the security of the bank under the warehouse receipts. The debt was still the debt of Elliott Finlayson & Co. contracted on the 8th of July, in security for which the receipts had been endorsed to and received by the bank.\nThat change in the form of the obligation was made on the 10th of August 1887. Part of the oil viz. 146 barrels, had been sold before that date by the bank at the request of Elliott, Finlayson & Co., and had realized $3,528300. The date of the sale is not proved. The warehouse attendant says the oil was transferred to E the purchaser on the 12th of July, and it seems that one of the warehouse receipts produced in evidence bore date the 13th of July while there is very direct evidence that receipts for 292 barrels were in the hands of the bank manager on the 5th of July, and were formally pledged on the 8th. These apparent discrepancies are scarcely for this court to investigate with a view to find conspiracy and fraud which the courts below have not found.\nThe purchase money of $3,528.30 was received by the bank on the 9th of August leaving $1,559.00 of the original amount of $5,087.50 unpaid, and as security for that balance the bank continued to hold the remaining 146 barrels of oil.\nThen another change of scene takes place. Elliott, Finlayson & Co. paid off the balance of $1,559.00 on the 16th of August and thereby redeemed the pledge of the oil.\nOn the same day, however, or the day before, they procured from the bank the discount of a note made by John Elliott & Co. for $3.500 and secured that advance by warehouse receipts for 200 barrels of oil. Where did they get that oil? For 146 barrels they had the old receipts, and for 54 barrels there was a warehouse receipt made, like all the rest, to W. E. Elliott ' & Co. which W. E. Elliott had himself, a few days before, left with the bank in anticipation of advances being made upon it.\nIt is not made clear either by the evidence or by any express finding of fact, how the ownership of the oil or at all events of the original 292 barrels, really stood as between the oil firm of W. E. Elliott & Co. or more properly Elliott himself, and the wine firm of Elliott, Finlayson & Co. Elliott, as. it would appear from evidence given by Finlayson, had not put into the wine business he agreed amount of capital. His transfers of oil may have been payments on account of his capital. Apart from the imputation of fraud as against Elliott's creditors there is no reason why the transfer of the receipts by Finlayson should not convey a good title to the bank.\nIn the Superior Court it was held that the original transaction of the 8th of July was valid because the bank did not, at that date, know of the insolvency of Elliott and therefore the bank was entitled to retain the proceeds of the sale of the 146 barrels in July but that the pledge of the 200 barrels in August after the insolvency was known was invalid.\nThis reasoning seems to have regarded the transactions as if between Elliott and the bank not laying stress on the intervention of Elliott, Finlayson & Co.\nThe Court of Appeal looked at he matter from a different standpoint, and (referring to the articles 1488 and 1966 of the Civil Code) held that it was not established that the bank when it took the sureties from Elliott, Finlayson & Co., to whom they had been duly endorsed by Elliott, knew that they did not belong to the wine firm.\nOn that ground the bank was held to be entitled to retain the whole 346 barrels of oil.\nI am not prepared to differ upon the question of fact from the court below, at least so far as the original 292 barrels are concerned.\nThe 146 sold in July are out of the question The other 146 which were released on the 16th August by the payment of the debt of $5,087, were pledged again on the same day, and whatever the bank may have\n(1) R.S.C. 120. known at that time of the circumstances of W. E Elliott it had acquired no new information, as far as disclosed by the evidence, respecting the title to the 146 barrels which up to that date it had held as pledge of Finlayson. Treating the transaction, as the Court of Appeal treated it, as between the bank and Finlayson, and not as between the bank and Elliott I do not see sufficient grounds for interfering with the decision as far as the 146 barrels of oil are concerned\nThe other 54 barrels do not stand in quite the same position. The warehouse receipt for the 54 barrels, which was dated the 30th of June, does not appear to have been endorsed to Elliott, Finlayson & Co. On the 8th of August, after the hank knew, as the fact is found to be of Elliott\u2019s insolvency Elliott himself brought that receipt to the bank and left it for the purpose of an advance to be afterwards made The advance was made to Elliott, Finlayson & Co. on the 16th, and the receipt then for the first time endorsed over by Elliott\nUnder these circumstances the reasoning of the Court of Appeal does not seem to apply to the lot of 54 barrels, and as to that lot I think the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored.\nThe 200 barrels sold for $2,998. The proportion for 54 barrels is $809.46.\nI think the appeal should be allowed to that extent and I suppose with costs.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : McMaster & McGibbon.\nSolicitors for respondents : Morris & Holt.\n[1] Q.R. 1 Q.B. 371.\n[2] Q.R. 1 Q.B. 371.\n[3] 8 vol. pp. L.S.E.Q. 66.\n[4] No 3000.\n[5] 2 vol. p. 258, Nos. 41 and 42.\n[6] 28 vol.

Strong C. J. And Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories ([1]) affirming the judgment for defendant at the trial.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the judgments hereinafter published.\nChristopher Robinson Q. C. for appellants.\nFerguson Q.C. and McKay for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am compelled to dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. I therefore only write shortly to indicate the grounds on which I differ, not intending to state folly the arguments and authorities in support of my view. I agree in the facts as found by the court below, and as stated in the judgment of the majority of this court, with the exception of the conclusions arrived at as to the character of the transaction by which the present appellant acquired his title to the note in question. The note was given by MacDowall to Knowles to be used for a particular purpose and not for general use as an accommodation note, and it was actually pledged to the bank by Knowles as a collateral security. The bank acquired the note in good faith as holders for value without notice and was paid off by the appellant with his own money, and this was done in pursuance of an arrangement made between the assignee in insolvency of Knowles, the appellant and the bank. The note came into the hands of the appellant upon the bank being paid off, and after it was due. The appellant had no notice of the agreement between Knowles and the respondent at the time he paid the bank and got the note.\nIf I had to deal with the evidence directly I should take it to be proved that the note was given as an accommodation note generally to be used as Knowles thought fit, but I cannot act upon that view of the evidence in the face of the finding of the court below, based though it is exclusively upon the evidence of the respondent himself. If it had been held to be an accommodation note generally the respondent would have been liable even though the appellant had taken it from Knowles himself after it was due and with notice\nBut assuming as I must on the findings of the court below that the note was given on the particular agreement which the respondent states, it is clear that the appellant had no notice and I do not consider a holder for value who takes a note signed and delivered by the maker upon such an agreement as this, in good faith, without notice, though overdue, can be affected by any collateral agreement controlling the use which was to be made of the note though it may have been negotiated in fraud and in violation of that agreement. It appears to me that the appellant was not entitled to recover the fall amount of the note, but was entitled to stand in place of the bank who were paid off with his money, that is he is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the holder from whom he acquired title. There is no pretense for saying that the bank had notice or was otherwise than a bona fide holder for value to the extent of the sum for which the note had been pledged to it, whatever that might on taking proper accounts be ascertained to be. I understand the law to be that an endorsee or holder for value, although taking a promissory note after maturity, is entitled to the benefit of the title of any prior holder in due course whether the name of such prior holder appears on the paper or not. In other words, an agreement between the maker and payee that a note should only be used for a particular purpose does not, although the note was negotiated in fraud of that agreement, constitute an equity which attaches to the note in the hands of a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value even although he takes it after dishonour.\nBy the Bills of Exchange Act, 1890, section 27 subsection 3, it is enacted that when the holder of a bill has a lien on it arising from contract or implication of law he is deemed to be a holder for value to the extent to which he has a lien. By the 29th section a holder in due course is defined, and that in terms within which the evidence shows that the bank indubitably came. The bank took the note in good faith and for value, and at the time had no notice that Knowles was negotiating it in breach of faith or that there was any defect in his title. It was, therefore, a holder for value and also a holder in due course strictly in accordance with the provisions of the act.\nSubsection 3 of section 29 is as follows:\nA holder whether for value or not who derives his title to a bill through a holder in due course and who is not himself a party to any fraud or illegality affecting it, has all the rights of that holder in due course as regards the acceptor and all parties to the bill prior to that holder.\nIt cannot be pretended on the facts that the appellant was a party to any fraud committed by Knowles in negotiating the note, or that the appellant had when he took the note from the bank any notice of such fraud.\nIt is true that the note was overdue when it came into the appellant's hands but that makes no difference. Section 36 subsection 2 of the act provides that:\nWhen an overdue bill is negotiated it can be negotiated only subject to any defect of title affecting it at maturity and thenceforward no person who takes it can acquire or give a better title than that which had the person from whom he took it.\nUnder this provision the appellant would have been clearly entitled to avail himself of the title of the bank. The bank did not endorse the note but it had been endorsed in blank by Knowles and had thus become negotiable as an instrument payable to bearer, and the appellant upon delivery would have become entitled to the protection assured him by this provision. It is pretended however that the appellant acquired his title to the note not from the bank but from Coombs, the assignee in insolvency of Knowles. The evidence establishes directly the contrary of this proposition. Coombs was, it is true, an assenting party to the arrangement in pursuance of which the bank transferred the notes to the appellant just as a mortgagor is, on a transfer of a mortgage property, made for precaution an assenting party to the transfer, but beyond this the transfer was not a transaction between Coombs and the appellant, but between the latter and the bank. The appellant's money paid off the bank and the securities were handed over directly by the bank to the appellant. Neither the law, business usages nor common sense authorize us to characterize such a transaction as a payment of the note by the maker and its reissue by him. The circumstance that the draft and cheque for the amount paid to the bank passed through Coombs's hands can make no difference; it is clear that the appellant intended to acquire, and supposed, as he had a right to do, that he was acquiring, the title from the bank directly to himself. I am therefore of opinion that by force of the explicit statutory provisions I have referred to the appellant was entitled to recover the amount for which the bank, as pledgee of the note, could have maintained an action against the respondent. The note was dated the 10th November, 1889, and being payable 18 months after date did not fall due until the 13th May, 1891. The statute came into operation on the 1st September, 1890, and it contains no provision restricting its operation to notes made after that date. At this time the note was therefore current; Mr. Duncan McArthur the manager of the bank says it came into their hands \" in the early fall of 1890 \"; granting that this was after the first of September, 1890, the act would not apply to the transfer by Knowles to the bank, though I should have thought it would apply to the subsequent transaction between the bank and the appellant, for I see no reason why the act should not apply to the subsequent transfer of preexisting securities. But it makes no difference whether the act applies or not. The act is an almost literal transcript of the English Bills of Exchange Act of 1883. Judge Chalmers who was the draughtsman of that act, in his digest of the law of Bills and Notes ([2]) certainly says: In so far as the act alters the law it is presumed it does not apply to any instrument made before its date.\nAnd he refers to the cases of McLean v. Clysdale Banking Company ([3]) and Leeds Bank v. Walker ([4]), but in both these cases the transactions which it was held the act did not affect had taken place before the day fixed for its coming into force. I find no decision showing that the act is not applicable to the negotiation of a note made before it came into force but which had been negotiated after it became law. I do not think, however, it makes the least difference whether the statute or the preexisting rules of the common law are to govern in the present case. All the provisions of the act to which I have referred were old law and the statute did not in any of them make the slightest alteration. It merely formulated the law in these respects. I may, therefore, even if the act has no statutory application here, make use of it as Lord Blackburn did in McLean v. Clysdale Bank ([5]) as a text reproducing in precise and convenient formulas the old law on the particular subjects in question. In the case just referred to Lord Blackburn says:\nI do not think the Bills of Exchange Act applies to this case for it did not receive the royal assent until some months after the cheque had been issued; but I do think that the enactments in that act are very good evidence of what had been the general understanding before it was passed, and of what was the law on the subject.\nAs regards the rights of the bank as pledgee of the note, that they were by the general law merchant before the statute was passed precisely the same as defined by section 27 of the act, appears from Ex parle Newton ([6]); the latter case shows that the pledgee of a bill upon which the pledgor being the drawer could not have recovered against the acceptor could only recover the amount for which the bill is held in pledge, but that to that amount he is entitled to recover. That section 29 subsection 3 before set forth is identical with the former law is shown by May v. Chapman ([7]). Section 36 subsection 2 merely gives statutory effect to the law as laid down in Fair clough v. Pavia ([8]).\nIf therefore the evidence fails to establish, as I think it does, that there was a payment by or on behalf of the maker, and a reissue of the note, the law clearly entitles the appellant to recover the amount for which the bank as pledgee was entitled to a lien on it. I do not refer the appellant's title to recover to the general doctrine of subrogation merely, but to those independent rules of the law merchant which I have pointed out, rules founded in commercial convenience, and necessary, not only to protect holders in good faith of negotiable paper but also to ensure the negotiability of such securities. These rules which had previously been well established by adjudged cases have now been adopted and confirmed by the statute. But, whilst I say this, I also think it very material that, as Mr. Robinson argued, these principles are entirely conformable to the very just and equitable doctrine of subrogation to which they most undoubtedly owe their origin.\nSince writing the foregoing I have been referred by the learned counsel for the appellant to the case of Cowan v. Doolittle ([9]). That case was more complicated in its facts than the present, but after having made a careful analysis of it I find that it sustains the propositions of law which I have before advanced to the fullest extent, and decided as it was by a most distinguished court I should not hesitate, if I had no other authority to follow than this case of Cowan v. Doolittle (3), to decide the present appeal in the manner I have indicated. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nFournier J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nTaschereau J.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by the Chief Justice for allowing the appeal and in the conclusions at which he has arrived.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. The sole question in the case really is whether the plaintiff MacArthur purchased the note sued upon from the assignee of the insolvent estate of Knowles, the payee of the note, or from the Commercial Bank of Manitoba. If from the assignee of Knowles the action cannot be maintained, for there can be no doubt that the note was given to Knowles under such circumstances that he never could have maintained an action upon it against the defendant, and the plaintiff MacArthur became purchaser of it after it had become due. I cannot entertain a doubt that the transaction was one of purchase by the plaintiff McArthur from the assignee of Knowles of a whole batch of notes, including the one sued upon, as part of the estate of the insolvent Knowles. MacArthur, it is true, knew that the draft which he gave to the assignee of Knowles for all the notes which he purchased would go to the bank, but that was necessary to enable MacArthur's title as purchaser from the assignee of a portion of the notes which were held by the bank to be made perfect. The oral and documentary evidence is, to my mind, absolutely conclusive upon the question. Joseph Knowles had been in partnership with the plaintiff MacArthur as private bankers, &c., at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,where the defendant resided. The partnership was dissolved and thereafter each of them carried on business separately for himself. Knowles made an arrangement with the Commercial Bank of Manitoba at Winnipeg for advances to be made to him upon notes of his customers to be deposited as collateral security and upon real estate. The arrangement, as testified by the bank manager, was that the bank would advance to him to the extent of seventy-five per cent of the face value of notes to be deposited but that they would allow him to overdraw his account. Upon the note now sued upon the bank in October, 1890, advanced to Knowles $4,100, and he had also been allowed to overdraw his account to some extent. In January, 1891, Knowles failed in business and by an indenture dated the 28th of that month, he assigned and transferred all his estate, effects, choses in action, and his real estate to one Joseph M. Coombs, his executors and administrators and assigns upon trusts following: first upon trust to pay all the costs, charges and expenses, &c., attending the preparation and execution of the said trust indenture, and secondly to pay off the indebtedness of the said Knowles to the Commercial Bank of Manitoba and Katherine W. McLean, a secured creditor, and in the next place to pay and divide the clear residue into and among his other creditors ratably and proportionately and without preference or priority according to the amount of their respective claims, and lastly to pay the residue, if any, to Knowles himself.\nUpon the 25th of February, 1891, the bank inclosed in a letter from Winnipeg to MacArthur at Prince Albert nine of the notes deposited by Knowles with the bank amounting in the whole to $6,912.27, and coming due between that date and the 13th May,\namong which was the note now sued upon. Upon the 8th April the manager of the bank wrote to the plaintiff MacArthur the following letter :\u2014\n(Private.) WINNIPEG, 8th April, 1891.\nJAMES MACARTHUR, Esq., Re KNOWLES,\nPrince Albert.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Referring to our C. S. 46 D. H. Mac Dowall $5,500 due 11th May next, when M. MaoDowall was down here some time ago he led me to understand that he did not intend to pay this note. Please let me know what the prospects of collecting it are and give me what information you can in regard to the matter.\nYours truly,\nR.T.ROKEBY,\nManager.\nTo this letter Mr. MacArthur seems to have replied by a letter not produced of the 14th April, for on the 18th April, 1891, the manager of the bank wrote, addressed and sent the following letter to MacArthur :\u2014\nWinnipeg, 18th April, 1891.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Re C. S. 46, MacDowall $5,500 due May 13th. .\nI have received your letter of the 14th instant and note contents. If the note is not paid when due hand it to Mr. Newlands for immediate suit and get judgment as quickly as possible. Meanwhile New lands can find out quietly all that MacDowall has which may be available to satisfy the judgment.\nYours truly,\nR. T. ROKEBY,\nManager.\nThe note appears to have been sent to MacArthur in February, under the impression that it was payable at Prince Albert where MacDowall resided from the same 18th April. The manager of the bank wrote, addressed and sent another letter to MacArthur directing him to return the note at once to the bank at Winnipeg where the manager had found that the note was payable and not as he had been under the impression at Prince Albert. MacArthur appears to have received from the manager of the bank another letter dated 23rd April (not produced) in relation to Knowles's liability to the bank and to the collateral securities held by the bank therefore; and he appears to have contemplated at that time purchasing from the assignee of Knowles the note held by the bank as collateral security and other property belonging to the insolvent estate of Knowles if he could make an arrangement with the bank to procure funds necessary for that purpose and on the 1st May, 1891, he wrote to the manager of the bank the following letter:\u2014\nPRINCE Albert, Sask., 1st May, 1891. R. T. Rokeby, Esq., Re KNOWLES,\nWinnipeg.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In further reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo and list of notes, it would appear that about $2,000 in notes sent by you to Knowles for collections was collected by him and the proceeds kept. I understand that he is now in Toronto, so that instead of you being short a margin in notes of about $1,100 you are short about $3,000. The best properties to be put on the market now are the following:\u2014\nLot 2, block G., R. L. 78, say\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $ 250 00\nLot 22, block D., R. L. 79, say\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026 750 00\nW 1\/2 lot 5, block C.,R. L. 78, say \u2026\u2026\u2026... 400 00\nLot 11, block B., R. L. 78, say\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.... 500 00\nS. 1\/2 R. L. 79, P. A. S. B., say\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 2,000 00\n$ 3,900 00\nI think the above lots would sell for the amounts set down provided they were sold on easy terms of payment. I have thought of making an offer to the estate for the notes held by you and other property for the amount of your bank's claim, provided I could make an arrangement with your Board regarding payment of same. The amount of your claim you state to be $16,807\u2014taking off the MacDowall note due 11th May, $5,500\u2014$11,307. I propose for the favourable consideration of your Board the following, viz. : that I assume this amount and give my notes to you at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months in equal instalments and furnish together with same collateral notes to the amount of the principal and $2,000 more as a nargin. I may state that I consider at least $1,000 of the notes held by you to be doubtful and at best are all slow. When in consideration of this matter I trust you will inform your Board that I have reduced my own indebtedness to your bank $1,600 since September, and that in the face of the most depressed business season I have ever seen here and without materially reducing the security then given.\nYours truly,\nJ. MACARTHUR. Now when this letter was written, MacArthur well knew that the notes which the bank held and for the purchase of which together with other property he says he thought of making an offer to the Knowles estate were held by the bank merely as collateral security for the debt of Knowles, and what he proposes is not that he should purchase from the bank any of those notes so held as collateral security for the debt of Knowles but that they should accept his offer in extinguishment of the Knowles debt, thus leaving the assignee of his estate free to deal with MacArthur for the sale to him of the collaterals held by the bank, that is to say that they should accept MacArthur's notes for the amount of the Knowles debt payable as proposed in the letter together with collaterals to the like amount to be furnished by MacArthur and $2,000 in addition to be deposited by him by way of margin. To this proposal the manager of the bank replies by a letter dated 6th May, 1891, as follows :\u2014\nJAMES MACARTHUR, Esq.,\nPrince Albert.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Your letter of the 1st instant received and I note contents of same for which I am obliged. I shall write you again in regard to the proposed sale of property. With regard to your proposition to buy out our claim, you of course understand that in the meantime we are practically acting as trustees for the assignee, but if he is willing to make a deal with you in the way you speak of, we are quite ready to sell you our claim as it stands at present\u2014$16,918, payable $2,000 in cash, and your note at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months in equal instalments at nine per cent interest. You to give us collateral note with a margin of $2,000. If the MacDowall note is paid on the 11th instant the amount can be deducted.\nYours truly,\nR. T. ROKEBY,\nManager.\nP.S.\u2014 I saw Mr. MacDowall. I think he may possibly pay $500 or less, if pressed, on account and renew. He will hand over the property as security for the note till paid. Please say if above is satisfactory to you. Now by this letter the manager of the bank informs MacArthur that if he can make a deal, with the assignee of Knowles' insolvent estate in respect of the purchase of the collateral notes which the bank held and for the purchase of which MacArthur by his letter of the 1st May informed the bank that he contemplated making an offer to the Knowles estate, they will take from him in satisfaction of their claim against Knowles $2,000 in cash and his notes for the balance of their claim payable in seven equal instalments at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months with interest at nine per cent, he furnishing collateral note with a margin of $2,000. This proposition so made by the bank in answer to the one made by MacArthur placed him in a position to deal with the assignee of the Knowles estate for the purchase of the collaterals, and so understanding the letter he appears to have acted thereon accordingly, for, as Mr. Coombs the assignee testified, MacArthur spoke to him in the beginning of May as to the purchase of the notes, and offered eighty-five per cent of their face value. Coombs in his evidence says: \" his proposal was to purchase the notes held by the Commercial Bank and also those held by me, the proceeds of auction sales.\" Coombs expressed his approval of the offer and said that if approved by a committee of Knowles's creditors he would accept it and carry it out, and he told MacArthur to put his proposal in writing. Thereupon MacArthur addressed to him the following letter :\u2014\nPRINCE AlBERT, SASK., 12th May, 1891.\nJ. M. COOMBS, Esq., Re KNOWLES,\nAssignee.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014It has occurred to me that to insure more rapid progress in the winding up of this estate, you might be open to entertain an offer for the notes held by you and other property sufficient to wipe out the Commercial Bank claim. I shall he glad to meet with you and discuss the matter at your convenience.\nUpon receipt of this letter Coombs called a meeting of certain creditors of Knowles acting as an advisory board and laid the matter before them; this was at Prince Albert. The meeting was held between the 12th and 19th of May. MacArthur attended the meeting and some mention was made of this MacDowall note. MacArthur pointed out that it did not bear interest, and some remarks were made as to whether it would be met. MacArthur produced a telegram from the bank manager at Winnipeg saying that it had not been paid. At this time the notes held by Coombs for property sold by him as assignee amounted to $2,228.60. There was also another small parcel of notes received by Coombs from the sheriff amounting to about $352, and the notes held by the bank, a list of which was furnished by MacArthur to Coombs, amounted to $13,305; these notes the bank held as collateral security for their debt which then amounted in round numbers to $ 17,634, for which they held security upon real estate of Knowles valued at $20,030. At the close of the above meeting of the creditors of Knowles Coombs, subject to the approval of his solicitor, agreed to sell to MacArthur without recourse against the estate of Knowles the whole of the above notes, amounting in round numbers to the sum of $16,086, for $13,673.56, being eighty-five per cent of the face value of the notes, thus also giving to MacArthur the benefit of all interest accrued and accruing upon them. The transaction was finally completed on the 20th May, 1891, at Prince Albert, by MacArthur handing to Coombs his, MacArthur's draft on the Commercial Bank of Manitoba, at Winnipeg, for the said sum of $13,673.56. and by Coombs handing to MacArthur the notes he himself held and endorsing them \"without recourse,\" and by Coombs and MacArthur respectively signing at the foot of the list of the notes held by the bank and furnished by MacArthur which included the MacDowall note now sued on amounting in the whole to the said sum of $13,500, the receipts following :\u2014 1. Received of J. MacArthur the sum of eleven thousand four\nhundred and seventy-nine dollars and twenty-five cents, being eighty-\nfive cents on the dollar for the above mentioned list of notes.\nM. COOMBS.\n2. Received from J. M. Coombs, assignee of the estate of J.Knowles, the above mentioned notes.\nJ. MACARTHUR.\nCoombs says that he endorsed the notes which he himself held \" without recourse \" in accordance with the agreement upon which he says. all the notes were sold by him to MacArthur, and that he then had a conversation with MacArthur as to this provision in respect of the notes which were at Winnipeg, namely, the notes held by the bank, and that MacArthur said that as to them it was no matter as they were all past due and that he afterwards corrected himself saying that one of Graham & Nelson's was not past due. In fact Coombs says that everything as to the sale of the notes was completed when he received from MacArthur the draft for $13,673.56.\nOn the 20th May, Coombs inclosed to the Commercial Bank the above draft, together with one for $600 on the Imperial Bank, in the following letter:\u2014\nPRINCE ALBERT, 20th May, 1891. DUNCAN MCARTHUR, Esq.,\nManager Commercial Bank of Manitoba, Winnipeg.\nRe estate of JOSEPH KNOWLES.\nSIR,\u2014Inclosed I forward you draft for $13,873.56, drawn by James MacArthur on Commercial Bank of Manitoba and draft for $600 on Imperial Bank, Winnipeg; total $14,273.50, to be applied towards liquidating your claim against this estate.\nIn the interest of the other creditors I am anxious to settle your claim in full and release the real estate, and in order to meet the balance of your claim I would like to dispose of by public auction or private sale, as the case may be, the following portions of the real estate now held by you as security, viz. : .\nLot 22, block D., R.

To indebtedness as perstatement rendered \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $17,534 83\nPaid James MacArthur 2 1\/2 per cent on collection of\n$4,039.75\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026....... 100 00\n$17,634 83\nBy draft of James MacArthur, being amount\nof collateral notes purchased by him from\nestate\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $13,673 56\nBy draft on Imperial Bank\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 600 00\n14,273 56\nBalance due to bank\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $3,361 27\nNow it is plain by this letter that the bank recognized the sale of the notes as having been made by Coombs, as the assignee of Knowles, to MacArthur. Upon receipt from Coombs of MacArthur's draft the bank accepted it and paid and applied the amount, together with the proceeds of the draft for $600 on the Imperial Bank, towards liquidation of the Knowles debt. The amount so applied exceeded the whole amount at of the notes held as collateral security by the bank, and the balance of their debt amounting to $3,361.27 was secured by the real estate held by the bank valued at $20,000. From that moment the notes which the bank had held became, in virtue of the assignment and transfer thereof, involved in the receipt signed by Coombs at the foot of the list of the notes and given to MacArthur, the absolute property of MacArthur and thenceforth the bank could not have or acquire any title or interes whatever in them unless in virtue of a title to be derived from MacArthur, and this is precisely the light in which not only the manager of the bank but Mac Arthur himself understood the transaction, for immediately upon receiving from Coombs his receipt at foot of the list of the notes he on the same 20th May addressed and sent a letter to the defendant, wherein he says:\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I have purchased the notes belonging to the Knowles estate. Your note for $5,500 I find is past due, and as I cannot suppose you would care to have it go to suit I shall be glad to have your draft for payment as soon as possible. I may say that if it is inconvenient to meet the whole amount now I might be able to renew a part.\nYours truly,\nJ. MACARTHUR.\nAnd on the same day he addressed a letter to the manager of the bank explaining why he had not answered his letter of the 6th May, and informing Mr. Rokeby that he, MacArthur, had purchased the notes from the assignee of Knowles. The letter is as follows :\nPrince Albert, Sask., 20th May, 1891. R. T. Rokeby, Esq., Re Knowles,\nWinnipeg.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In further reference to my letter of the 1st inst., and yours of the 6th, I found that upon meeting Mr. Coombs and his committee that I could make a purchase of the notes belonging to the estate, but regarding the balance required to make up the amount due you they thought it would be better to get you to allow a sale at auction in Coombs's name of so much real estate as would pay off your claim.\nAs I had no doubt that this would meet your views, I purchased the notes to the amount of $13,673.56, for which I have issued my draft on you. I inclose my draft for $1,200 in your favour and I have charged your account with $100 being 2 1\/2 per cent for collecting $4,039.75 of Knowles notes (I saw the assignee regarding the rate and he considered it all right). Mr. Coombs will remit by this or the following mail $700, which makes $2,000. I inclose my notes at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months for $1,667.65 each for the balance and a list of notes now held by you assigned by Coombs to me and by me to you. I inclose collateral notes to the amount of $2,268.21. I hold notes named in inclosed list for collection and arrangement. I shall have them all put in current order and forward to you without delay. Regarding the MacDowall note, I have written him by this mail and expect to be able to arrange with him. Both Mr. Newlands and Brewster consider it all right. If you desire me to assume the balance of your account due by the Knowles estate I can do so upon your terms but as Coombs is very anxious to have your amount closed out as soon as possible, I consider it much the best for all parties that he be allowed to sell without a transfer from you to me. He writes you by this mail upon this subject.\nThe list of notes referred to in the above letter as being inclosed therein and as being \"a list of the notes held by you and assigned by Coombs to me and by me to you\" was not produced. It appears, however, that it was a list of notes which had been in MacArthur's possession on collection for the bank before he purchased them from Coombs, for in the next paragraph of his letter he says that he holds the notes mentioned in the list for collection and arrangement, and that he would have them all put in current order and forwarded to the bank without delay. By this he no doubt meant to convey that as soon as he could get them put into current order by renewals he would forward the renewals to be held as collateral for his liability to the bank for their accepting and paying his draft for $13,673.56. That the MacDowall rote was not in that list must be inferred from the fact that it was not then in the actual possession of MacArthur, it was still in the bank at Winnipeg where it fell due on the 13th May, where it remained, but as the property of MacArthur until the 2nd July when he got it for the purpose of bringing an action upon it, since which time the bank, as Mr. Rokeby says in his evidence, has never had any custody or control of the note, and he stated further that the note had never been entered in any of the books of the bank as being held collateral to MacArthur's liability to the bank, and MacArthur in his evidence says that the bank never had any right or title to the note derived from him. His evidence upon this point is as follows:\u2014 I first got it as agent of the bank in February, but sent it to the bank. I first got it again after I purchased it when I wanted to sue on it. The Commercial Bank had nothing to do with it since I bought it, they were to have, it was understood that the bank were to take it and others as collateral security when put in current shape, but this was never so put, the bank has no lien or claim upon it legally.\nMr. Rokeby in his evidence stated that so far as the bank was concerned the whole transaction between him and Coombs and between him and MacArthur was contained in the letters produced, the only one of which not already referred to is the following of the 9 th June, 1891, from Rokeby to MacArthur;\u2014\nJAMES MACARTHUR, Re KNOWLES,\nBanker, Prince Albert.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Your letter of the 20th ult. re your purchase of the collateral notes in this estate was placed before me on my return to business to-day, and I have given instructions that the matter be carried through in accordance with your arrangement. The inclosed statement shows how the matter stands as between the bank and the estate and as between the bank and you.\nWith regard to the amount paid to us direct on account Campbell's $600 note this was applied in reduction of the debt, and our account to the assignee was just so much less so that it will be in order for you to arrange the matter with him. We have authorized Mr. Coombs to sell the properties mentioned in his letter in order to close out the balance ,due us and we will convey to the purchasers when sales are made. Mr. Newlands may as well complete the title re westerly portion of lot 11, block B. R. L. 78, as suggested by the assignee. His account not \"being included in our account, will be chargeable against the estate when rendered. It is distinctly understood that none of our securities are to be relinquished until our account has been settled in full together with interest until paid. With reference to your notes in payment of the balance due by you, I may first say that I trust you will be able to meet them or most of them at any rate at maturity, as two of our directors think that you have made a very good thing of this purchase, and consequently I would like to see the matter well taken care of. As soon as you get the collaterals into shape please forward for registration, as the bank in order to meet your views and to assist you in this deal is parting with the best of its security. I trust you will make quite sure of your ability to meet the notes and to carry the matter through. Please let me hear from you as to this.\nYours truly,\nR. T. ROKEBY,\nManager. The statement inclosed in this letter was the statement already referred to as inclosed to Mr. Coombs, showing the balance due by the Knowles estate to be $3,361.27, and an account opened with MacArthur wherein he is debited with his draft for $ 13,673.56 and credited with $1,300, showing a balance due by him of $12,373.56, against which is placed his seven notes for $1,767.65, each with interest at nine per cent.\nNow upon this evidence there cannot be entertained a doubt that the transaction whereby MacArthur acquired the note sued upon was one of purchase from the assignee of the Knowles estate of the whole batch of notes, amounting in the whole to $16,086 and including the note sued upon, as one purchase for the sum of $13,673.56 for which he gave to the assignee of Knowles his draft upon the Commercial Bank. Upon that draft being accepted by the bank, and the amount being by them applied to the credit of their claim against the estate of Knowles, the bank ceased to have any claim or title to or interest in the note which became the absolute property of MacArthur, but his title, as the note was overdue when purchased by him from the assignee of the Knowles estate, was only such as could be acquired by purchase of a chose in action belonging to the estate of Knowles in the hands of the assignee of that estate for sale, and as the transaction between Knowles and the defendant upon which the note was made by the defendant was such that Knowles could not have recovered against the defendant in an action brought against him, so neither can MacArthur and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nPatterson J.\u2014There are two plaintiffs, MacArthur and the Commercial Bank of Manitoba. I shall not have to refer to the bank as a party to the action and shall for brevity sake use the term \" the plaintiff\" as meaning MacArthur. In my reference to the facts I shall not attempt to discuss the details of the evidence. That has been done with sufficient fulness by my brother Gwynne who has made it very clear that the findings of fact by the courts below cannot be disturbed. The plaintiff bargained with Coombs, the assignee of the estate of Knowles, for the purchase of promissory notes which belonged to the estate.\nThere were three lots of notes. One consisting of forty-seven notes, including the note of the defendant now sued upon and of the nominal amount of $13,505, was held by the Commercial Bank of Manitoba as collateral security for a debt of upwards of $17,000 due by Knowles. Another lot consisted of thirty-six notes, amounting nominally to $2,228.60, which were not in the hands of the bank. The plaintiff bought these notes at eighty-five per cent of their nominal amount.\nLists of these two lots of notes were produced in evidence, each list having appended to it two receipts, viz., one from Coombs, the assignee, for the price, and one from the plaintiff for the notes. The price acknowledged for the one lot is $11,479.25, being eighty-five per cent of $13,505, and for the other $1,894.31, being eighty-five per cent of $2,228.60. These two receipted amounts make $13,373.56. The third lot of notes was bought for the lump sum of $300, making the whole price $13,673.56.\nThe negotiation with the estate of Knowles and the purchase of the notes from the estate was with the concurrence of the bank, and with an understanding between the bank and the plaintiff as to the mode in which the plaintiff was to be supplied with money to pay for the notes. In accordance with that understanding the plaintiff paid Coombs by a draft on the bank, which the bank received from Coombs on account of the debt of Knowles, for $ 13,673.56, and the plaintiff accounted to the bank for that sum partly by giving his own notes for $12,373.56 of the amount, and giving as collateral security for his notes all the notes purchased from the Knowles estate.\nThe transfer of the notes from the assignee of Knowles estate to the plaintiff took place on the 19th or 20th of May, 1891.\nThe defendant's note fell due and was protested for non-payment on the 13th of that month. It was therefore an overdue note when the plaintiff took it.\nThe history of the note, as shown by the judgment delivered at the trial, was that Knowles, who had been partner with the plaintiff in the business of private bankers, and who continued that business after the dissolution of the partnership, wanted to provide a fund on which he could draw in the event of depositors with the dissolved firm withdrawing their deposits. He accordingly arranged with the defendant that the defendant should make the note in question and he conveyed some lands to the defendant by way of security, though by conveyances absolute on their face. The defendant accordingly made the note, payable 18 months after date, with an understanding that it might be renewed for 18 months longer, it being also agreed between the defendant and Knowles that the note was not to be used unless required for the purpose of providing the fund mentioned, and that if it was discounted it should be at the Bank of Ottawa where it was payable, and not elsewhere.\nIt was a violation of the terms of this agreement in both its branches to transfer the note as collateral security for other debts of Knowles, and to negotiate it in that manner with the Commercial Bank. 38 The bank, which took the note without notice of the agreement, could of course have enforced it against the defendant. But the plaintiff does not take the bank's title. He bought from the Knowles estate. The bank would have had no right to sell the note which it held as collateral security unless prepared to account for its full value, and according to the findings, which are in my opinion the correct result of the evidence, the bank did not sell the note. It held the notes, that is to say, one of the three lots of notes, as security for the debt of Knowles, and receiving payment of that debt from Coombs, partly by means of the plaintiffs draft, it freed the notes as assets of the Knowles estate, though it again received them with the other notes as a pledge from the plaintiff.\nThe appeal is ventured on in the hope of displacing that apprehension of the facts. The contention is thus formally put by the plaintiff in his factum.\nThe appellant's contention is on the correspondence and on the evidence, and in regarding the legal effect of the transaction, that the sale was made by the bank directly to the plaintiff MacArthur.\nIt was suggested that the plaintiff might recover what he paid for the note, if not the full amount, under the title of the bank. I do not know what he paid for this or any other individual note, because the eighty-five per cent was on in the whole amount and not on each note, but whatever he paid was paid to the Knowles estate and not to the bank.\nThe transaction between the plaintiff and Coombs is essentially the same as it would have been between the plaintiff and Knowles.\nThe plaintiff took a note which was overdue and which was an accommodation note. The circumstance that it was an accommodation note would not by itself interfere with the negotiation of it after it was due; but, being overdue, the plaintiff could take it only as subject to its equities. An agreement not to negotiate an accommodation note after it was due would be such an equity. We find that asserted in a series of cases from Charles v. Marsden ([10]) downwards. All the cases on the subject, as late as the year 1868, will be found commented on by Malins V.C. in Ex parte Swan ([11]) in a dissertation which may be referred to in place of citing the various cases.\nAfter pointing out that the endorsee of an overdue bill takes it subject to the equities of the bill, not the equities of the parties, and that a setoff is not in general an equity that attaches to a bill, the learned Vice-Chancellor refers to the case of Holmes v. Kidd ([12]) as an illustration of what an equity attached to the bill itself is. I shall read what he says of that case ([13]).\nIn that case the acceptor had accepted a bill of \u00a3300, depositing with the drawer certain canvas which he was to be at liberty to sell as a means of providing for the bill. The bill was indorsed when overdue to the plaintiff, and afterwards the canvas was sold by the drawer, but did not wholly pay the bill. The question was whether the indorsee could recover. Here, Mr. Justice Erle said: \"The question is whether the receipt of the money by the drawer is a bar to the action. The plaintiff took the bill subject to the equities affecting it. In the hands of the drawer the right to sue was defeasible; when he sold the canvas it was defeated, and the plaintiff took the bill subject to that contingency.\" That contingency is the equity which attached to the bill and which bound him, having taken it after maturity. Mr. Justice Crompton said: \"Upon the concoction of this bill it was agreed that it was not to be paid if the canvas was sold. That agreement directly affects the bill, and was part of the consideration for it. The case therefore differs from that of a right of setoff against the indorser, which is merely a personal right not affecting the bill. In the present case the equity attaches directly to the bill. The plaintiff, therefore, got a defeasible title only.\"\nThe statement of the law by Vice Chancellor Malins in Ex parte Swan ([14]) is referred to with approval by Lord Justice Giffard in Ex parte Oriental Commercial Bank ([15]), in which case an officer of the bank misapplied moneys of the bank in the purchase for himself of certain bills of exchange which he endorsed over after they were due. It was held that the equity of the bank to follow its money into the bills that were purchased with it could be enforced against the endorsee who had taken the bills after they were due.\nIn the present case the note of the defendant was made and was intrested to Knowles for the special purpose of aiding Knowles, by providing a fund for the payment of depositors, if that should become necessary, in order to keep his business going. The defendant could have insisted that Knowles should use the note only in the way for which it was intended, and only for the purpose of keeping his business going, and could have restrained him by injunction from using the note after he had given up his business. That was an equity attaching to the note itself in the hands of Knowles and is enforceable against the plaintiff who took the note when overdue.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: H.

J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\n(Quality of plaintiff\u2014General denegation\u2014succession\u2014Acceptation of by minor subsequent to action\u2014Art. 144 G. G. P.\u2014Don Mutuel\u2014Property excluded from but acquired after marriage.\nHeld, 1st., affirming the judgment of the court below, that the quality assumed, by the plaintiff in the writ and. declaration is considered admitted unless it be specially denied by the defendant. A defense en fait is not a special denial within the meaning of art. 144 C. C. P.\n2nd. The acceptation of a succession subsequent to action and pendent elite on behalf of a minor as universal legatee has a retro active operation.\n3rd. Where by the terms of a don mutuel by marriage contract a farm in the possession of one of the sons of the husband under a deed of donation was excluded from the don mutuel and subsequently the farm in question became the absolute property of the father the deed of donation having been resiliated for value, it was held that by reason of the resliation the husband had acquired an independent title to the farm and it thereby became charged for the amount due under the don mutuel by marriage contract, viz.: $5,000; and that after the husband's death the wife (the respondent in this case) was entitled until a proper inventory bad been made of the deceased's estate to retain possession of the farm. Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal said) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action brought by Alva Martindale in his quality of tutor to the minor child James Curtis Martindale, universal legatee of his grandfather Curtis Martindale, and by Eli Martindale in his quality of curator to the substitution of property created by the last will of the late Curtis Martindale, claiming from Susan M. Powers widow of the late Curtis Martindale for the minor child and the substitution a certain farm being cadastral lot no. 2414 of the town ship of Stanbridge.\nSusan M. Powers, the respondent, pleaded 1st. a general denial and 2nd. a special plea that under the terms of a don mutuel by marriage contract she was entitled to retain possession of the land until paid the amount due to her, viz.: $5,000.\nThe facts as disclosed by the pleadings and the evidence are as follows:\nTwo years prior to his marriage with respondent Curtis Martindale, who was then a widower, had made a donation of the farm in question to his son John Martindale, under the usual terms of supporting his father during the remainder of his natural life, and with the condition that in the event of the sonprede ceasing the father the title should revert to the latter. Under this agreement John Martindale and his family went to reside with the father, Curtis Martindale, upon this farm, but some months prior to respondent's marriage with the father, Curtis Martindale, the son, John Martindale, had bought a farm for himself from a Mrs. Whitman, on the opposite side of the highway from the farm in question in this case and had removed with his family to the Whitman farm, and was living on it. On the 11th December, 1869, and prior to the execution of his marriage contract, a notarial document was executed between Curtis Martindale and his son John which recites in the first place the terms of the donation deed and then declares that as Curtis Martindale has proposed to said John Martindale to occupy and cultivate said land (i e. the original home farm) and to take the management of the stock &c., the said John Martindale agrees to pay to said Curtis Martindale $200 yearly in lieu of support, taxes, maintenance, &c, and as security therefor he mortgages his own farm, i. e. the farm he had bought from Mrs. Whitman, and upon which he was then living. The agreement goes on to recite that even if said John Martindale should at any time thereafter be called upon to resume the cultivation of the land he should be exonerated from the care of horses, cows, &c, belonging to Curtis Martindale.\nThen by marriage contract dated the same 11th December, 1869, Curtis Martindale settled upon his wife, (present respondent) the property, real and personal of which he might die possessed to the extent and value of $5,000 s save and except therefrom the farm and personal property thereon now in the occupancy of John Martindale.\"\nOn the 9th December 1870 the deed of donation to John Martindale was for valuable consideration resiliated and $900 were paid to him by Curtis Martindale for improvements, &c.\nCurtis Martindale died 27th March, 1885, having previously to wit, on 10th November, 1888, made his last will whereby he named as his residuary legatee, without designation of any specific property, the eldest of his own four sons who might be living at the time of the testator's decease and his widow took possession of all his property including the farm claimed by the appellants.\nThere was no special plea specifically denying the status of the plaintiff, but oral evidence was given to prove the status which was objected to. It was admitted that no inventory had been made of the deceased's estate.\nRacicot Q.C. and Amyrauld for appellants. The qualities and status of the plaintiffs \u00e9s-qualit\u00e9s and of the minor child James Curtis Martindale as well as the defendant herself as mentioned and described in the writ of summons, and all the other allegations of the plaintiffs declaration, not having been specially denied are deemed by law to be admitted by defend ant. La Banque Union v. Gagnon ([2]); Reinhardt v. Davidson ([3]); Gibeau v. Dupuis ([4]); Bain v. City of Montral ([5]).\nBut moreover there is sufficient evidence in the case of the status of the minor child as the courts below have found as a matter of fact.\nOn the principal question on this appeal viz., as to the farm reserved in the marriage contract, we contend that the intention of the parties as expressed by the \u00a1stipulation in the marriage contract was that the said farm and the movables should he absolutely reserved from the don mutuel, and that as the farm claimed is shown to be the farm reserved from the don mutuel in The marriage contract it is not material whether it came into the hands of the testator by virtue of the r\u00e9siliation of the donation to his son John under some of the provisions of the donation, or by virtue of the voluntary r\u00e9siliation made of said donation as was actually done.\nThe don mutuel in the marriage contract of $5,000 to be taken by the survivor out of the property left by the predeceased is a donation \u00e0 cause de mor\u00ed, assimilated to a particular legacy, and the respondent survivor cannot retain the property claimed as her right is simply to get $5,000 out of the estate. Art. 757 C.C. Respondent at death of Curtis Martindale was left in possession of his whole estate, movable (moneys, claims, goods and chattels, &c.,) and immovable. She has appropriated the whole of the movable estate which was of considerable value without any inventory and she cannot retain the farm claimed by appellant\u2019s \u00e9s-qualit\u00e9s without accounting for what she has got already and irrespective of the amount of the balance due her and of the value of the farm.\nBaker Q. C. for respondent. Having denied each and all the allegations of the declaration the appellants were bound to prove the status of the minor child from the registry o civil statu\nThe exclusion of the property from the don mutuel, if it applies to the farm in dispute, had ifs raison d\u2019\u00eatres only by reason of one of the above circumstances happening; the parties cannot be presumed or held to have contracted with reference to the unforeseen case of a voluntary r\u00e9siliation of the deed of donation, and the acquisition by Curtis Martindale of the property by onerous title.\nOn the 9th December, 1870, after the marriage, the father and son resiliated the deed of donation the father paying the son $900 to indemnify the latter for moneys advanced and labour done and performed in improving the premises and a mutual acquittance and discharge of all obligations up to that date was given.\nThe renunciation by Curtis Martindale of the sum of $200 per annum, and the payment by him of $900 to his son, impoverished and reduced his estate by so much and diminished respondent's chance of being paid her marriage settlement at the time of his decease.\nBy the deed of 9th December, 1870, there was an interversion of title and Curtis Martindale became the proprietor of that farm, not in virtue of any condition of said original donation but by an onerous title, which was not in existence at the date of the marriage contract and stands therefore quoad that contract entirely in the light of a distinct and new acquisition secured at the cost of the estate settled upon respondent by the marriage contract, and must be held liable for the stipulation and effect of that contract.\nThe reasons for the exclusion which existed at the time of the contract have disappeared. The property belonged to Curtis Martindale in the same manner as if he had acquired it from a stranger and passed to respondent in virtue of her marriage contract. If appellants wanted to get possession they should have had made an inventory and until that is done respondent is entitled to retain possession.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Curtis Martindale, a widower, the testator under whose will the plaintiff claims (in the quality of tutor of James Curtis Martindale, a minor) married in 1869 the respondent and defendant Susan Powers, inder a contract of marriage by which community, was excluded, and don mutuel to the ex tent of $5,000 was stipulated. Previous to this, in 1867 Curtis Martindale had made a deed of donation of a farm to his son John Martindale. By the clauses and stipulations of this deed of donation the son John Martindale was to work the land; the donor, Curtis, was to live on it; the produce was to be equally shared, and Curtis, the donor, was to furnish half the seed. On the eve of the marriage, by a deed executed before the same notary as the marriage settlement and dated the same day, 11th December, 1869, the deed of 1867 was modified by providing that Curtis should work the farm himself and that John, instead of working the farm and giving his father half the produce, should pay him $200 a year. For the payment of the annuity thus stipulated for John hypothecated a farm which he had acquired by purchase, not from the testator but from the widow Whitman. The marriage settlement expressly excluded from the don mutuel the farm and personal property described as being \"now in the occupancy of John Martindale, of the said township of Stanbridge, yeoman, one of the Sons of the said Curtis Martindale, which said property both real and personal is not included nor in tended to be included as forming any part or parcel of the said sum of $5000.\"\nThe first question is whether this exclusion or exception applies to the farm which was the subject of the donation by Curtis to John or to the Whitman farm, which John had hypothecated to his father to secure the annuity of $200 under the deed of the 11th December, 1869, varying the original deed of donation.\nMr. Justice Tait held that the exception applied to the farm in the donation deed. Chief Justice Lacoste and Mr. Justice Hall though they decided the case in the respondent's favour upon another and distinct ground, held that the exception did not refer to the donation farm but to the Whitman farm.\nSubsequently the testator made his will which contained this provision under which the plaintiff claims :\nAs to the residue or remainder of my property whether real or personal, movable or immovable, money, notes of which I may die possessed or seized of, I will and bequeath the same and every part thereof unto the eldest of my four sons, Ari, John, Eli and Alva Martindale, who may be living at my demise, and for such son of my said four sons above named to use and enjoy the same during his natural life; and after his death to be transmitted unto his lawful issues from generation to generation, in the direct line as far as the laws of this Province will allow.\nSubsequently to the marriage and on the 9th December, 1870, the testator for the consideration of $900 bought out John altogether as regards the farm previously given him. The present is a possessory action to recover the excepted farm. The pleas were the general issue, and a special plea which however does not conclude to the dismissal of the action but merely prays imposition of terms in the defendant's favour\nThe following points arose:\n1. It was said that the quality of the minor represented by the plaintiff was not proved, in that it was not proved by legal evidence that he was the eldest grandson at testator's death the oral evidence of .Ari not being legal proof. The courts below answer this by holding that the quality not being specifically denied it must be taken to be admitted, the general issue not being a sufficient denial. In this I concur. Then it was said that no acceptation of the succession on behalf of the minor as universal legatee (or legatee by title universal) was proved, and in fact it appeared that there had been no acceptation until after the action. The Court of Queen's Bench answers this objection by showing that the want of acceptation was a relative not an absolute nullity, and that the acceptation subsequent to action had a retroactive operation, for which proposition the Chief Justice refers to authors who establish this to be the law.\n2. The next question is: What property was intended to be excepted as the farm described as being \"in the occupancy \" of John ? Was it the donation farm, the old homestead or was it the Whitman farm ? I cannot agree that it was anything but the former as the first judge, Mr. Justice Tait, held it was; but both the judges whose notes we have the Chief Justice and Mr Justice Hall seem to think the exclusion was intended to apply to the Whitman farm though they do not say this clearly.\n3. Then comes the main point on which the Court of Queen's Bench decided, reversing Mr. Justice Tait. What was the effect of the re-purchase for $900 by the testator from John, carried out by the deed of 9th December, 1870. The Court of Queen's Bench hold that, granting' the exception did refer to the homestead, it was a new purchase, a new acquisition of an onerous title, just as if John had sold to a stranger and the lands had gone through half a dozen hands, and had then been re-purchased by the testator, in which case it would be just the same as if it had been a piece of land in which the testator had never had any previous interest. I think the Court of Queen's Bench were right in this which was their ratio decidendi.\nThe appellants further say that the judgment appealed from is ultra petita as the special plea does not conclude to the dismissal of the action. The plain answer is that the general issue does so conclude.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le 11 d\u00e9cembre, 1869, feu Curtis Martindale avait fait avec Susanne Powers, son \u00e9pouse, intim\u00e9e en cette cause, un contrat de mariage contenant, entre autres conventions matrimoniales, la suivante:\nThat whatever property the said Curtis Martindale and. Susan Powers now have or that they shall or may hereafter acquire, both real and personal, upon decease of one of them, the same shall belong to the survivor of them, for and to the extent of the sum of $5.000. current money of this province, in sole and absolute property forever (save and exempt therefrom the farm and personal property thereon now in the occupancy of John Martindale, one of the sons of the said Curtis Martindale, which said property, both real and personal, is not included not intended to be included as forming any part or parcel of the said sum of $50000, anything herein contained to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding).\nAu d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Curtis Martindale saveuve, l'intim\u00e9e, a pris possession de toutes ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, comprenant la terre et la maison dans laquelle vivait le dit Curtis Martingale lorsqu'il s'est mari\u00e9 et dans laquelle il a v\u00e9cu avec elle jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Curtis Martindale est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 27 mars 1885, ayant pr\u00e9alablement fait son testament le 10 novembre 1883, instituant pour son l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire le fils aln\u00e9 de ses quatre enfants qui serait vivant \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nLa d\u00e9claration en cette cause all\u00e8gue que James Mar tindale, enfant mineur, \u00e2g\u00e9 d'environ sept ans, fils d'Eli Martindale, remplit la condition du testament et se trouve en cons\u00e9quence le l\u00e9gataire r\u00e9siduaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9, et r\u00e9clame par l'action prise en son nom par son tuteur, Alex. Martindale, la terre et la maison dans laquelle a v\u00e9cu Curtis Martindale, et dont sa veuve, l'intim\u00e9e, a pris possession en vertu de son contrat de mariage.\nL'intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cette action qu'elle a droit \u00e0 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en vertu de la clause ci-dessus cit\u00e9e de son contrat de mariage avec le testateur, dans lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 que le survivant des deux \u00e9poux prendrait dans la succession du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res et immobili\u00e8res au montant de $5,000.\nElle a aussi all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'identit\u00e9 du mineur r\u00e9clamant n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment \u00e9tablie et qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 l\u00e9galement qu'il soit le fils l\u00e9gitime de Elie Martindale. Elle a de plus positivement ni\u00e9 que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'elle d\u00e9tient soit celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue du don mutuel par son contrat de mariage.\nIl est vrai que la preuve de la filiation du mineur n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en la mani\u00e8re ordinaire par la production d'un acte de bapt\u00eame. Elle consiste dans un certificat du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier donn\u00e9 en vertu de la 39 Vict c. 20 et de la 50 Vict. c. 7. L'intim\u00e9e n'ayant point soulev\u00e9 d'objections sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 cette preuve il nest pas n\u00e9cessaire de decider dans la pr\u00e9sente cause de la force probante de ce certificat, que les Statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (art. 5784) semblent avoir mis au rang des actes de l'\u00e9tat civil. L'appelant ayant pris dans la d\u00e9clamation la qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 James Curtis Martindale enfant mineur d'Eli Martindale et d'Alma Grardner, cette qualit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre cens\u00e9e admise dans notre pratique, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit sp\u00e9cialement ni\u00e9e. L'art. 144 C. P. d\u00e9clare que tout fait dont l'existence on la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 n'est pas express\u00e9ment ni\u00e9e ou d\u00e9clar\u00e9e n'\u00eatre pas connue est cens\u00e9 admis.\nL'intim\u00e9e a aussi soulev\u00e9 l'objection que le tuteur n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 lors de l'\u00e9manation de l'action \u00e0 accepter le legs pour le mineur. L'autorisation, il est vrai, donn\u00e9e par le conseil de famille, \u00e0 accepter pour le mineur la succession de son grand'p\u00e8re n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e qu'apr\u00e8s l'institution de l'action\nCe d\u00e9faut d'autorisation n'est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une nullit\u00e9 suffisante pour faire renvoyer l'action; il suffit qu'elle soit donn\u00e9e pendant l'instance.\nAu m\u00e9rite la question unique est de savoir si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont l'intim\u00e9e est en possession est la m\u00eame que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9e par le contrat de mariage de l'effet du don mutuel. L'intim\u00e9e croyant que cette clause doit encore avoir son effet s'est efforc\u00e9e de nier que ce fut la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et a pr\u00e9tendu que c'\u00e9tait une autre qu'elle n'a Pu indiquer; mais en d\u00e9pit de ses d\u00e9n\u00e9gations il est clair que c'est li m\u00eame. Par son acte de donation \u00e0 John Martindale Curtis Martindale s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 certains droits sa vie durant avec droit de retour de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 son fils le pr\u00e9 d\u00e9c\u00e9derait. La pr\u00e9tention que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclue serait celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e par John Martindale de la veuve Martindale est insoutenable, par\u00e9e que Curtis Martin dale n'a jamais en de droits sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui ne lui a jamais appartenu et ne lui appartenait pas dans le temps du contrat de mariage. L'exclusion eut \u00e9t\u00e9 une absurdit\u00e9 palpable mais il avait des raisons d'exclure l'autre sur laquelle il n'avait qu'un droit de retour et que d'ailleurs il avait donn\u00e9e \u00e0 son fils. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable de l'exclure ne fut-ce one pour pr\u00e9venir son \u00e9pouse qu'elle ne devait pas compter sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans laquelle il vivait alors.\nIl est evident par le t\u00e9moignage de l'intim\u00e9e qu'elle a parfaitement compris que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quelle occupe est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exelue du don mutuel par le contrat de mariage Mais par suite des transactions faites entre Curtis et John Martindale cette clause d'exclusion n'a telle pas cess\u00e9 de s'appliquer \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question ? Jette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par Curtis \u00e0 son fils John Martindale le ler septembre, 1867, \u00e0 diverses charges et obligations et entre autres, \u00e0 celle de faire vivre son p\u00e8re et de pourvoir \u00e0 ses besoins.\nLe jour m\u00eame du contrat de mariage, 18 d\u00e9cembre, 1869, par acte pass\u00e9 par le notaire qui a fait le contrat de mariage la donation fut modifi\u00e9e en par le donataire consentant \u00e0 payer \u00e0 son p\u00e8re une rente de $200, au lieu des charges et obligations stipul\u00e9es en la dite donation.\nJusqu'\u00e0 present la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e est demeur\u00e9e sujette \u00e0'l'exclusion du don mutuel, mais en est-il de m\u00eame apr\u00e8s l'acte de r\u00e9siliation de la dite donation ?\nLe 9 septembre 1870, durant l'ann\u00e9e qui a suivi le mariage Curtis et son fils John Martindale out, par acte authentique, r\u00e9sili\u00e9 et annul\u00e9 l'acte de donation de la susdite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 annul\u00e9 de m\u00eame que s'il n'avait jamais exist\u00e9 et que la terre y d\u00e9sigu\u00e9e savoir: la moiti\u00e9 sud du lot n 4, dans ledme rang des lots du township de Stanbridge \u00e9tait redevenue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dit Curtis Martindale, ses h\u00e9ritiers et ayant cause.\nCette r\u00e9siliation fut faite pour bonne et valable con sid\u00e9ration, savoir: pour la somme de $900 pour indemniser le dit John Martindale des am\u00e9liorations et r\u00e9parations faites sun la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9, sun laquelle somme il reconn\u00fbt et confessa avoir re\u00e7u celle de $200 des avant l'ex\u00e9cution du dit acte et quant \u00e0 la balance de $700 elle fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e payable en la mani\u00e8re stipul\u00e9e au dit acte, avec hypoth\u00e9qua sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9e au dit acte.\nPar cet acte de r\u00e9siliation Curtis Martindale a obtenu un titre complet et parfait de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il avait d'abord donn\u00e9e \u00e0 son fils et dans laquelle il ne s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 qu'un droit de retour au cas o\u00f9 son fils le pr\u00e9-d\u00e9c\u00e9derait. Ayant acquis un droit absolu \u00e0 la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pendant la dur\u00e9e du mariage, cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est partant devenue sujette \u00e0 l'effet de la clause du don. mutuel qui s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res on immobili\u00e8res qui pourraient \u00eatre acquises par les conjoints pendant la dur\u00e9e de leur mariage.\nL'exclusion a donc cess\u00e9 d'exister et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une nouvelle acquisition faite par Curtis pendant le mariage et se trouve partant sujette au don mutuel.\nIl est vrai cependant que la femme n'a droit \u00e0 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence du montant de $5,000 qui forme le don mutuel. Mais comme il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait d'inventaire il n'est pas possible de d\u00e9cider si les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont l'intim\u00e9e est en possession valent plus que le montant du don mutuel. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. aucune preuve pour \u00e9tablice fait. Le demandeur \u00e9s-qualit\u00e9 avant d'exercer son action aurait d\u00fb plut\u00f4t faire faire inventaire. Il aurait alors pu constater si l'intim\u00e9e avait en sa possession plus que la somme \u00e0 elle due, et la cour aurait pu adjuger en cons\u00e9quence; mais dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 est la cause la cour en lui accordant ses conclusions, courrait le risque de d\u00e9poss\u00e9der inutilement l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 laquelle, probablement, apr\u00e8s inventaire, il faudrait restituer les m\u00eames propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nPar tous ces motifs je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 et l'action renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014The questions raised by the respondent as to the status of the appellant, and as to the want of authority of the appellant's tutor to accept the legacy in question, have been determined against her by both courts below, and relate to questions of practice and pleading upon which we, as a general rule, do not interfere with the rulings of the provincial courts. I would, moreover, add in this case that the respondent's contentions on these two points are unfounded, As to the proof of appellant's status, by the pleadings the only fact put in issue and specially denied by the respondent is the identity of the farm reserved in the marriage contract from the operation of the don mutuel \u00e0 cause de mort therein contained, with the farm left by the late Curtis Martindale at his death and sought to be recovered in this cause by appellant.\nNow, the qualities and status of the appellant and of the minor child, James Curtis Martindale, as well as the defendant herself as mentioned and described in the writ of summons, and all the other allegations of the appellant's declaration, not having been specially denied are deemed by law to be admitted by defendant.\nAs to the acceptation by the tutor of the legacy in question with the authorization of the family council I deem it quite sufficient, if it was necessary at all, though made pendente lite. Demolombe ([6]) is explicit on this point:\nLe tuteur est le mandataire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du mineur, et il a qualit\u00e9 pour agir en son nom toutes les lois qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du mineur qu'on agisse. Les formalit\u00e9s et les conditions auxquelles la loi a soumis ce mandat ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduites dans le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat du mineur et elles ne doivent pas \u00eatre retourn\u00e9es contre lui. Elles ne concernent pas les tiers; ceux-ci sans doute sont fond\u00e9s \u00e0 opposer au tuteur une fin de non-recevoir r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut d'autorisation; ils sont fond\u00e9s a refuser d'aller plus loin et d'engager la lutte judiciaire, mais voil\u00e0 tout La mesure de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat est la mesure de leur droit et il suffira an tuteur pour d\u00e9truire toute objection de la part des tiers d'obtenir du. tribunal un d\u00e9lai afin de se procurer l'autorisation du conseil de famille.\nMais l'autorisation m\u00eame post\u00e9rieure effacerait la nullit\u00e9 ou plut\u00f4t l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures ant\u00e9rieurement faites.\nI am clear, with the two courts below, that the respondent cannot have the appellant's action dismissed upon these two grounds.\nUpon the real merits of the case I am of opinion that the Superior Court's judgment which maintained the appellant's action was right, and that the Court of Appeal was in error in reversing it.\nThe point taken by the respondent upon the identity of the farm claimed by the appellant with the farm excluded from the don mutuel in the marriage contract seems to me untenable. That Curtis Martindale could have intended to exclude the Whitman farm from this donation is a proposition that cannot seriously be con tended for. Why exclude that Whitman farm ? It never belonged to him; he had no claim whatever to it. I have no doubt that, as found by the Superior Court the farm excluded is the farm now claimed. And the Court of Appeal in its formal judgment does not find the contrary but bases its conclusion to dismiss the appellant's action upon the ground that as the farm now claimed by the appellant reverted back to his father by the restitution of September 9th 1870, which the court holds is an onerous title therefore the exception in the marriage contract has no effect, and the farm consequently passed to the respondent. I cannot assent to that proposition. That is reading out of the marriage contract the exception or reservation it makes in clear terms. The respondent may possibly have some rights against her husband's succession. That we have not here to determine, one way or the other. But she has, in my opinion, no title to the home farm itself. A farm was clearly excluded from her don mutuel. That farm I say is and cannot be any other but the home farm. Now this home farm clearly belonged to Curtis Martindale at his death, and consequently by his will passed to his son, the appellant. I have no doubt on the case, and would allow the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By the deed of September, 1867, Curtis Martindale gave and granted, with warranty, to his son, John Martindale, the S. 1\/2 of lot no. 4, in the 4th range of the township of Stanbridge, together with all the live stock and implements of husbandry and all other personal property enumerated in a schedule an nexed to the deed to have and to hold unto and to the sole use of the said John Martindale, his heirs and assigns, forever, subject to certain reservations and conditions therein contained; and first and expressly upon condition that the said John Martindale should till and cultivate the said tract of land during the natural life of the said Curtis Martindale and account for and deliver to the said Curtis the equal undivided half of all the crops which should be raised and gotten from the said land, and one equal moiety of all the butter and cheese that might be made thereon, and one equal moiety also of all the live stock that might be raised from the stock mentioned in the said schedule, yearly and every year during the lifetime of the said Curtis; and upon condition further that in addition to the above the said John Martindale should support and maintain the said Curtis as well in sickness as in health, in all things becoming his rank and condition for and during his natural life; and it was agreed that the said Curtis and the said John should bear and pay, in equal shares all taxes and assessments on the said property and also all costs and charges for keeping the implements of husbandry on the farm in good order; and that each should supply one half of the seed necessary for the cultivation of the said farm from year to year. To the fulfilment of all of the above conditions upon the part of the said John, to be performed during the lifetime of the said Curtis the said John bound himself if he should survive the said Curtis but it was thereby provided, covenanted and agreed by the respective parties to the said deed, that in case of the death of the said John happening before the death of the said Curtis the widow or heirs of the said John should not be held to the performance of anything therein contained towards the said Curtis and that the said tract of land, together with the personal property mentioned in the said schedule should revert to and become the property of the said Curtis, save and except such buildings as the said John might have erected on the said land, which buildings or improvements should belong to the heirs or legal representatives of the said John Martindale. During the year 1868 John Martin dale worked the farm under the terms of the above deed, and lived in the dwelling-house upon the farm with his father who by the deed had reserved to himself during his life certain rooms therein. In the year 1869, and prior to the month of September in that year, John Martindale, together with his wife, moved to a neighboring lot in an adjoining concession on lot 5, in the 5th range of lots in Stanbridge, which he had purchased from his aunt, a Mrs. Whitman. Upon the 6th of September, 1869, he entered into an agreement with one Curtis Murray, with the consent of the said Curtis Martindale, testified by the latter being a party to and signing the said agreement by which it was agreed as follows:\u2014\nJohn Martindale, by and with the consent of his father, Curtis Martindale, does hereby agree to let his farm, known as the south half of lot No. 4 in the fourth range of lots in the township of Stanbridge, to Certes Murray, to work and carry on at the halves, for the term of two years, commencing on the 10th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1870, and to continue two years therefrom, unless one of the said parties should be dissatisfied, in which case said Murray is to leave at the end of one year. Said Martindale agrees to put on said farm eight cows but reserves one of said cows for the use of his father, if he requires it, in which case he, the said John Martindale, agrees to pay the said Murray one half the expense of keeping said cow. Also he agrees to put on five sheep; said Martindale agrees to put on two brood mares, to be used on the farm, with one double wagon and double harness, together with all the necessary implements of husbandry for carrying on the said farm. Said John Martindale agrees to let said Murray have the use, for the first year of one half of fifty acres of land which he owns on lot No. 5, in the 5th range of lots in Stanbridge, for pasturing two horses and building a portion of the line fence on the said piece of land; said Martindale reserves a newly stocked piece of meadow in the south field, said meadow supposed to contain three or more acres for his father to mow. for his own use if he chose to do so. He reserves also the north part of the horse barn (the part for putting the hay in), to put his hay and the south part of the stable for his colt; he reserves the south part of the dwelling-house, known as the old part, for his father Said John Martindale and Murray are each to have two year ling heifers pastured on the farm the first summer, and if said Murray keeps the farm more than one year the two heifers belonging to Martindale are to be wintered on the farm with the cows if they are with calf but not otherwise If the brood mares should have colts the first year they are to belong to Curtis Martindale and John Martindale, but if they should raise colts the second year they are half to belong to Murray and half to Curtis Martindale. Each of the said parties to furnish one half of the seed sown or planted on the said farm, together with one half of the salt for the stock and dairy and one half of the butter tubs. Said Murray is to put on one cow for his family use which is to be pastured on the farm but not wintered. Said Murray agrees to carry on said farm in a good husband like manner, and to deliver to Curtis Martindale one equal half of all crops grown and harvested on said farm by measure or weight together with one half of the butter, pork, and all other products of the farm and dairy. It is agreed between the said parties if the said farm does not produce sufficient hay to winter the stock of the farm that Curtis Martin dale shall reduce the stock by selling such stock as he may think proper. Said Murray agrees that at whatever time he leaves said farm he will leave the buildings and all tools of the farm in as good condition as he finds them, save and except the natural wear of said pro perty Each of the said parties is to pay one haft of all the taxes for which said farm is liable during the two years, and keeping the farming tools in order. Said Murray agrees to move on to the farm on the twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1869, and to take charge of the stock and dairy and to have one half of the profits of the dairy for taking care of the stock up to the 10th day of March, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and seventy.\nEach of the said parties John Martindale, Curtis Martindale and Murray signed that agreement. Now it is to be observed that this agreement does not divest John Martindale of the estate in the lot vested in him by the deed of September, 1867. The agreement of September, 1869, only modifies the provisions of the former agreement as to the personal working of the farm by John Martindale authorizing him to substitute Murray in his place for the limited period and to the extent and upon the terms prescribed in the agreement without in any manner prejudicing John Martindale's title and rights under the deed of September, 1867. It might be that before the 10th of March, 1870, John Martindale and Murray might mutually agree to put an end to their agreement, in which case equally as after the expiration of the two years or one year, as the case may be, as mentioned in the agreement, John Martindale's liability to Curtis for the working of the farm under the deed of September, 1867 would continue in full force. In the interval between the 6th September, 1869, and 10th March, 1870, the only clause of the agreement of the 6th September, 1869, in actual operation was the last whereby Murray agreed to move on to the farm on the 20th September, for the purposes in that clause mentioned, and his possession under that clause until the 10th March, 1870, would be only in right of and as the servant or substitute of John Martindale in whom the estate in the property was still vested by the deed of September, 1867 Now in this state of things the instrument of the 11th December, 1869, by and between John and Curtis Martindale was executed, and thereby after reciting the deed of donation of September, 1867, and the terms therein contained upon which John Martindale had bound and obligred himself to till and cultivate the farm during the life of Curtis, and after reciting further that,\nThe said Curtis Martindale bath proposed and offered unto the said John Martindale to occupy and cultivate the said tract of laud and to take management of the stock belonging to the same with the horses that are mentioned in the said schedule (annexed to the deed of donation) and that said John should pay unto the said Curtis Martin dale yearly, and every year so long as he the said Curtis Martindale shall live, the sum of $200 per annum, in lieu of all support and maintenance as well as payment of taxes and all other obligations expressed to be done and performed by the said John Martindale towards the said Curtis Martindale, in and by the said foregoing deed of donation: And in case the said John Martindale should at any time hereafter be called upon to cultivate the said tract of land and farm mentioned in the said foregoing deed of donation the said Curtis Martindale doth hereby agree to feed the cows and horses reserved in the said foregoing deed of donation out of the undivided crops raised upon the said farm and that the said John Martindale be exonerated from the care of the said cows and horses, in case he may at any time hereafter he called upon to resume the cultivation of the said tract of laud and farm mentioned and described in the said foregoing deed of donation.\nTo all which the said John Martindale did thereby consent and agree to accept the said conditions. It was witnessed that the said John Martindale did thereby promise and oblige himself to pay unto the said Curtis Martindale, for and during his natural life the sum of $200 per annum for each and every year in lieu of support and maintenance as mentioned in the foregoing deed of donation and that the first such annual payments should become due at the expiration of one year from the day of the date thereof and from thence annually during the natural life of the said Curtis Martindale, anything in the said foregoing deed of donation contained to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding. The deed also contained the following clause:\u2014\nAnd for surety for the payment of the said sum of $200 per annum, the said John Martindale doth hereby specially mortgage and hypothecate the west half of lot No. 4, in the 4th range of Stanbridge with all the buildings thereon.\nThere can I think be no possible doubt that the lot here intended to be mortgaged is the lot conveyed to John Martindale by the said deed of donation and that -the word \" west\" half was inserted by inadvertence for the word \" south \" half. The wast half would be composed of the north-west and south-west quarters of which latter John was possessed as part of the south half conveyed to him by the deed of donation; to the north-west quarter he had no title and it is obvious that he intended to mortgage half of lot 4 in the 4th range which therefore must be the south half to which alone he had title. Now in relation to this instrument it is to be observed that it does not divest John Martin dale of the estate in the farm vested in him by the deed of donation. It merely suspends and modifies certain of the conditions and obligations imposed by that deed upon John in connection with his tilling and cultivating the farm and taking care of the live stock, &c, &c, &c. It does not profess to annul these obligations wholly, but merely to suspend and modify them, for the instrument expressly contemplates that John might at some future period be required to resume \"those obligations, in which event certain modifications are agreed upon, and it provides for the annual payment by John to Curtis of $200 in lieu of and substitution for the maintenance and support in sickness and in health, which, by the deed of donation John was obliged to render to his father over and above his share in the crops raised upon the farm and in the produce and increase of the live stock, &c., &c., &c. Johns Tight to erect buildings and to make improvements upon the farm is unaffected, in fact his legal estate as the proprietor of the farm is \"untouched, save in this that Curtis accepts from John a mortgage upon the farm in security for the payment by John to Curtis during his life of the said annuity of $200.\nUpon the same 11th December, 1869, but after the execution of the above instrument of that date, the marriage contract under consideration was prepared by and executed before the same notary who had pre pared the above instrument of that date between John and Curtis Martindale and the said deed of donation. The clause in the marriage contract under which the question in this case arises is as follows:\u2014\nBut it is however hereby expressly declared, stipulated, covenanted and agreed by and between the said parties that whatever property the said Curtis Martindale and Susan Maree Powers now have or that they shall or may hereafter have, both real and personal shall, upon the decease of one of them, belong to the survivor of them for and to the extent of $5,000, current money of this province, in sole and absolute property forever (save and except therefrom the farm and personal property thereon now in the occupancy of John Martindale of the said township of Stanbridge, yeoman, one of the sons of the said Curtis Martindale, which said property both real and personal is not included nor intended to be included as forming any part or parcel of the said sum of $5000 anything herein contained to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding,\nThe contention of the respondent is that the land mentioned in the deed of donation cannot be the farm mentioned in the clause of exception and reservation in the marriage contract, upon the suggestion that it was not then \u201c in the occupancy of John Martindale,\" and so did not conform to the description of the farm mentioned in the marriage contract\u2014that the lot which John was in possession of and living on in the 5th range was the only one in his occupancy, and that it alone answered the description of the farm in the marriage contract; that this must be regarded as the farm intended in the exception and reservation in the marriage contract, or that the exception and reservation must be void for uncertainty. If we should hold that the lot of land in the 5th range which John had purchased from his aunt, Mrs. \"Whitman, was the lot of land or farm which, by the marriage contract, was excepted and reserved from the operation thereof, we must construe the exception as being of property in which Curtis Martindale had then no interest whatever, nor, so far as appears, any contemplation of acquiring, or that he might acquire an interest therein at any future period. So construed, the exception and reservation of that lot would be utterly senseless. It is not possible, therefore, to construe the language used as referring to that piece of land, and as the evidence shows that Curtis had no interest in any land other than that which he had in the south half of lot no 4 in the 4th range, in virtue of the instruments of the 1st September, 1867, and the 6th September and 11th December, 1869, which latter was executed immediately before the execution of the marriage contract, the exception must be absolutely void unless it can apply to that lot of land. The question, therefore, simply is:\u2014 Is the description given of the farm intended under the words \" now in the occupancy of John Martindale\" so inapplicable to the south half of the said lot no. 4 that it cannot apply to the only farm to which it could reasonably apply ? And, in my opinion, it clearly is not, for upon the 11th day of December, 1869, when the marriage contract was executed it is clear that John was the proprietor of the said south half lot subject to the mortgage thereon which upon that day he executed in favour of Curtis in security for the annuity of $200 thereby made payable to Curtis during his life and the possession which Murray then had of the farm under the agreement of the 6th September, 1869, being under John, and for John, and as his substitute, with the consent of Curtis, to fulfil the stipulations and obligations which had been incurred by John in the deed of donation, the draughtsman of the marriage contract, with perfect propriety, might refer to the farm as then in the occupancy of John, who was the proprietor of the land in title, and in occupation of it through his servant and substitute, Murray. I am of opinion, therefore that there can be no doubt that the farm referred to in the marriage contract as excepted and re served from the operation thereof is the farm mentioned in the deed of donation, which was not at all inaccurately referred to as being, on the 11th December, 1869, in the occupancy of John. Neither can there be, in my opinion, any doubt that the land so designated must still be held to be excepted and reserved from the operation of the marriage contract. At the time of the execution of that contract Curtis Martindale could only have acquired the legal estate in and title to that piece of land by one or other of three ways, namely:\u20141st. By foreclosure of the mortgage for non-payment of the $200 per annum, in security for which it was executed; or, 2nd. by surviving John; or, 3rd. by r\u00e9siliation of the deed of donation by mutual agreement, which is the mode by which Curtis Martindale, in December 1870 did become seized of the land. Now, there is nothing in the marriage contract qualifying the mode by which Curtis should acquire title to the farm in order that it should be excepted from the operation of the marriage contract; and it cannot be maintained as a proposition of law that the exception was only to prevail in the event of Curtis acquiring title by survivorship. What is excepted is the farm itself if Curtis should be seized of it at the time of his death, regardless of the mode by which Curtis might acquire title to it. The fact that by the deed of r\u00e9siliation Curtis covenanted to pay John $900 for improvements cannot operate to prevent the exception having effect in accordance with its terms. That sum would seem to be payable to John's estate if the title of Curtis had accrued by survivorship. But however that may be, effect must be given to the exception and reservation of the farm from the operation of the marriage contract under the circumstances in which the title of Curtis thereto has accrued equally as if his title had accrued by foreclosure of the mortgare or by his surviving John.\nIn all other respects I concur in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal, as delivered by the learned Chief Justice of that court. This appeal must, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nAs to the evidence of Mr. Rice to the effect that \u2014\nOn the morning of the day on which the marriage contract was made Curtis Martindale came to him and said he had taken his farm back from his son John that morning so that he could give the defendant security upon it for her contract; that he was going to give her a contract for $5,000, and give her security for it upon the property he had just takenack from his son John\nBesides that this evidence was inadmissible, Mr. Rice would seem to have been labotring under a mis conception of the conversation which he said had taken place eighteen years previously, for it is plain that Curtis had not taken back the farm fom his son on the morning of the day on which the marriage contract was made, but that, on the contrary, he had only suspended and modified the stipulations and conditions in the deed of donation as to John's tilling and cultivating the farm, and had accepted a mortgage on the farm executed by John to secure the $200 per annum thereby agreed to be paid to Curtis in lieu of and substitution for maintenance It was not until the month of September 1870, When the deed of r\u00e9siliation was executed that Curtis took back the farm. These observations, however, have no bearing on the case except in answer to an imputation of bad faith in Curtis in his having, while professing to intend to give the defendant security upon the farm as a marriage portion, in point of fact excepted and reserved that farm from the operation of the contract.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred with Fournier J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Racicot & Amyrauld.\nSolicitors for respondent : Baker & Martin.\n[1] Q.

A conveyance was tendered which the vendee would not accept whereupon the vendor brought suit for rescission of the contract which the court refused on the ground that the conveyance tendered was defective. He then refused to accept the purchase money unless interest from the date of the contract was paid. In an action by the vendee for specific performance:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the vendee was not obliged to pay interest from the time the suit for rescission was begun as until it was decided the vendor was asserting the failure of the contract and insisting that he had ceased to be bound by it, and after the decision in that suit he was claiming interest to which he was not entitled, and in both cases the vendee was relieved from obligation to tender the purchase money.\nBy the terms of the contract the vendor was to remain in possession until the purchase money was paid and receive the rents and profits.\nHeld, that up to the time the vendor became in default the vendee, by his agreement, was precluded from claiming rents and profits and was not entitled to them after that time as he had been relieved from payment of interest and the purchase money had not been paid. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe only questions raised on this appeal were whether or not the defendant, under a contract to sell real estate to the plaintiff, was entitled to interest from the date of the contract or for any part of the time since elapsed, and whether or not the plaintiff was entitled to the rents and profits of the said real estate of which he had not paid the purchase money and was never in possession. The circumstances under which these questions arose sufficiently appear from the above head note and the judgment of the court.\nDonovan for the appellant.\nW. Cassels Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014By the contract dated the 24th November, 1886, the purchase money was to be paid in cash within twenty-one days from that date and on delivery of the conveyance, which was to be prepared by the vendor and delivered free of costs to the purchaser. The vendor was to remain in possession and in receipt of the rents and profits until the payment of the purchase money when the purchaser was to be let into possession. The contract contained the following clause as to interest:\nIf from any cause whatever the said sum of $40,000 is not paid within thirty days from the date hereof together with the said proportion of taxes, interest from the said date shall be paid thereon at the rate aforesaid to the vendor, but this stipulation is without prejudice to the vendor\u2019s right to cancel the sale as above provided.\nThe purchaser never having been let into possession his liability to pay interest depends entirely upon the terms of the agreement. According to these he became liable to pay interest from its date, namely, from the 24th November, 1886, when at the expiration of thirty days from that date he had failed to pay the purchase money. No difficulty arose as to the title; that was perfectly good and accepted as such. It was then for the vendor to take the next step by preparing and tendering a proper conveyance. What was done as to this may be stated in the words of the learned Chief Justice in the case of Elmsley v. Hayes, the action for rescission. The learned Chief Justice says:\u2014\nIn a very few words I will state why I feel compelled to join in allowing this appeal. On July 6th plaintiff\u2019s solicitor sends a draft of conveyance requiring acceptance so as deed can be executed in a week. This draft was fatally defective and impossible for defendant to accept. It was not a mere mistake in writing the word \u201clessee\u201d for \u201clessor\u201d but it required the vendee to covenant for the performance of the covenants on the part of the tenant or lessee, thus emphasizing the mistake. The letter reached defendant next day. He delays answering till the 17th and then sends an amended draft. Plaintiff\u2019s solicitor on same day returns the draft unopened, declares the contract at an end and files the bill for rescission in three days, viz.: from the 20th July.\nIt is a well settled rule of the law of vendors and purchasers of real estate as administered by courts of equity, that a purchaser is relieved against an obligation to pay interest imposed by a clause expressed in the same terms as those which are used in this contract, namely, a clause providing that if there shall be delay \u201cfrom any cause whatever,\u201d after a certain date interest shall be paid, when it can be shown that the delay was caused by the wilful default of the vendor[3].\nAs to what constitutes wilful default on the part of the vendor no exact definition can perhaps be found. It is certainly, however, extensive enough to include what may be called gross negligence to perform obligations which he has imposed upon himself by his contract. It must therefore a fortiori comprehend cases in which the vendor is not merely guilty of inaction and neglect, but in which he actually repudiates his agreement altogether, and also cases in which he makes grossly untenable claims and refuses to complete except on the terms that such claims are acceded to. In both these latter respects was the vendor in the present case in default. First, from the date of the action for rescission begun on the 20th July, 1887, until the 10th March, 1891, when that litigation was terminated by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the vendor, the present respondent, was most energetically asserting the determination of the contract, and insisting that he had ceased to be bound by it. Upon the plainest principles he could not be entitled to claim interest under the contract from a purchaser not in possession nor in receipt of the rents and profits, during the period covered by this litigation. And it makes no difference that during part of this time the purchaser may have been claiming more than he was entitled to; the unfounded claim of the one cannot be set off against that of the other, and it is manifest that during the whole time the respondent was thus seeking a judicial rescission of the contract the appellant was relieved from the obligation of offering to pay the purchase money since the attitude of the respondent in that litigation was a continuous declaration that he would not accept it.\nFrom the termination of the litigation in the first action until the commencement of that for specific performance, now under appeal, the vendor was insisting on terms to which he was not entitled, that is to say, to the payment of interest during the pendency of the action for rescission. This is shown by the course taken by the respondent in his defence of this action and otherwise. He made this specific claim most distinctly, and down to the date of the present judgment he has by his own course of conduct, if not in words and correspondence too, and by his line of defence herein, always insisted on his right to be paid this interest, so that the appellant was justified in assuming that it was useless to offer to pay the purchase money without the interest thus unjustifiably claimed. I am therefore of opinion that there was continuing wilful default from the 20th July, 1887, down to the date of the present judgment of this court, and that consequently the purchaser cannot be ordered to pay interest during that interval. From the 24th December, 1886, to the 20th July, 1887, or perhaps only to the 17th July, 1887, the purchaser is bound to pay interest, for during that time the respondent was not in default.\nThe purchaser is not entitled to any account of rents and profits. He had no right to possession until he paid his purchase money and therefore was not entitled to receive any rents and profits, or to possession, down to 20th July, 1887, when the vendor became in default. Since that date he has been relieved from the payment of interest and he could not possibly be entitled to rents and profits for the time during which the purchase money was unpaid and the vendor is deprived of interest. To give him this would be to take from the vendor the fruits both of his estate and the purchase money and would be little less than confiscation.\nIf the appellant has been damnified by the respondent\u2019s refusal to carry out his contract the remedy for that should have been sought in damages and not in an account of rents and profits. Any claim for damages was, however, renounced by the appellant at the trial of the present action. The appeal must be allowed to the extent indicated. The appellant is to be declared entitled to specific performance upon payment of the purchase money and interest from 24th November, 1886, to 20th July, 1887, and the respondent must pay the costs in all the courts. In default of payment of purchase money and interest by a day to be fixed in the judgment, the contract is to be declared to be rescinded.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Joseph A.

Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nA provision that the purchase money is to be paid as soon as the conveyance is ready for delivery does not alter the rule that the conveyance should be prepared by the purchaser. Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe action in this case arose out of a contract for the sale of land in the following terms.\n\u201cThis memorandum witnesseth that Robert H. Davis, Esq., sheriff, has agreed to purchase from the heirs of R.V. Griffith, deceased, the Griffith homestead in North Gayuga, immediately adjacent to the town of Gayuga, containing about sixty acres, being parts of lots 30, 31 and 32, in the first concession north of the Talbot road, for the price or sum of $2,000; possession to be taken at once by the purchaser, and the purchase money to be paid as soon as the conveyances are ready for delivery; interest to be paid on the purchase money from the date of possession; the purchaser to be paid a fair value for straw and manure taken off the property by R.J. Martin since last autumn, at a valuation satisfactory to both parties.\u201d\nUnder this agreement the defendant Davis entered into possession but the preparation of the conveyance was delayed owing to some of the vendors being infants which rendered it necessary to procure the approval of the official guardian to the conveyance. When it was eventually prepared by the solicitor for the purchaser, but who has been held by the Divisional Court to have been acting for the vendor in preparing it, it was executed and given to the agent of the vendors to deliver to the purchaser who objected to one of its provisions. It was altered, however, to the satisfaction of the purchaser in presence of representatives of both parties and accepted.\nOn entering into possession of the land the defendant had deposited the amount of the purchase money in the bank to a separate fund, the deposit bearing no interest and after a time he changed the deposit so that it would draw three per cent. On accepting the conveyance he refused to pay any larger amount for interest than he had received for this money and the vendors claiming six per cent from the date of the contract brought this action to recover the same.\nThe Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal held in favour of the contention of the defendant. Donovan for the appellants.\nFurlong for the respondent\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action brought by vendors of land against the vendee to recover the purchase money. I am of opinion however, that the rules of decision to be applied, when upon any of the questions arising in such an action there is a difference in the principles heretofore prevailing in courts of law and courts of equity, are to be found in the latter system. This seems to be the effect of the change wrought, not in procedure merely but in the law itself, by section 53, subsection 12, of the Judicature Act.\nWe must therefore be guided by the rules applied by courts of equity in carrying out purchases of real property, both as regards the obligation to pay interest and also as to the preparation of the conveyance.\nBy the contract the purchaser, the respondent, was to be let into possession (which was done), he was to pay interest from the date of possession and to pay the purchase money as soon as the conveyances were ready for delivery.\nThe respondent being in possession and being bound by the contract to pay interest, (reciprocal terms,) he could not according to the established principles of courts of equity be exonerated from his liability for interest so long as he retained the possession, unless he brought himself within two essential conditions. These conditions required first, that the vendors should be in wilful default, a somewhat vague and not very appropriate expression used in such cases. Secondly, that the purchaser should deposit the purchase money in a bank or other proper place of deposit, not to his general current account, but to a separate account, so that he might be in a position to retort, when his objection to pay interest was met by the fact that he was enjoying the possession of the land, that he was losing the use of the purchase money.\nThe second condition the vendor so far complied with when on the 2nd May, 1889, he deposited $1,975 and $87.19 in a bank, of which the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, Mr. Mitchell, had notice. The two sums deposited together exceeded the amount of the principal sum due on account of price, and this, on the authority of Kershaw v. Kershaw[3] would have been sufficient to stop the running of further interest if the first condition I have mentioned had existed, that is if the vendors had been in default. There was not, however, any wilful default on the part of the vendors. Delay was caused in completion by the infancy of some of the vendors and the consequent necessity of obtaining the concurrence of the guardian or officer whose sanction was required to the conveyance. The title in all other respects was perfectly good and there were no objections on that score. It is not suggested that the vendors were guilty of any unreasonable delay in procuring the assent of the officer of the court. And at all events the decision in the case of De Visme v. De Visme[4] has not been followed and delays caused by the state of the title do not, unless there has been in addition some gross negligence or misconduct, amount to wilful default. It is said, however, that the vendor tendered an insufficient conveyance, a deed that had been avoided by alteration, and one to which other objections were made. I have looked into the point about the alteration and have satisfied myself that it was made before delivery and whilst the deed was a mere escrow in Mitchell\u2019s hands, and with the assent of all parties, and therefore that it did not vitiate the deed[5]. I do not, however, dwell on this, nor do I adopt it as a ground of decision.\nI say that the vendors were in no default respecting the conveyance. It was not their duty to prepare the conveyance but the duty of the purchaser according to the general practice in all cases in which the agreement of the parties has not made some other provision. No such provision is to be found in this contract for the clause that \u201cthe purchase money to be paid as soon as the conveyances are ready for delivery\u201d contains nothing militating against the well\u2011established general rule referred to. It is the duty, indeed it may be called the privilege, of the purchaser to prepare his own conveyance; this, however, when ready for execution the vendor must procure to be executed. The reference in the contract does not imply that the vendors were to be burdened with this duty of preparing the conveyance merely because it speaks of the delay of the conveyance, for that refers to their final execution by delivery and to their delivery to the purchaser after having been prepared by him and executed by the vendors. All that the vendors\u2019 agent did then in preparing the instrument which was delivered to him as an escrow signed and sealed by the vendors, was in excess of any obligation of the contract and entirely gratuitous on the part of the vendors who consequently were not, by reason of the mistake and alteration, guilty of any default whatever. The delay in completion was entirely the fault of the purchaser himself, in not first preparing his own conveyance and then calling on the vendors to execute it or to procure its execution.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench was right in all respects save one. I should have thought the plaintiffs entitled to their costs of the action, but that was not and could not have been a subject of appeal. Therefore the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgments of the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal reversed with costs to the appellants in both these courts, and the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division must be restored.\nFOURNIER, and TASCHEREAU JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Joseph A.

R. 2 Q. B. 431) reversing the judgments of the Superior Court which had maintained the contestations of the respondent's claims in each action.\nOn the 10th April 1886 John S. McLachlan, a retired partner from the firm of McLachlan & Bros., composed of the said John S. McLachlan and William McLachlan his brother, agreed to leave his capital, for which he was to be paid interest, in a new firm to be constituted by the said William McLachlan and one William Radford an employee of the former firm, and that such capital should rank after the creditors of the old firm had been paid in full. The new firm undertook to carry on business under the same firms-name up to 31st December, 1889. John S. McLachlan died on the 18th November, 1886. Mrs. Annie McLaren, the wife, separate as to property of John S. McLachlan had an account in the books of both firms. On the 16th April 1890, an agreement was entered into between the new firm of McLachlan Bros, and the estate of John S. McLachlan and Mrs. McLachlan, by which a large balance was admitted to be due by them. to the estate of John S. McLachlan and to Mrs. John. S. McLachlan. The new firm was declared insolvent in January, 1891. Claims having been filed. respectively by Mrs. John S. McLachlan and the executors of the estate of John S. McLachlan against the insolvent firm, the Merchants Bank of Canada contested the claims on the following grounds, inter alia . 1st that they had been creditors of the firm and continued to advance to the new firm on the faith of the agreement of April, 1886; 2nd, that Mrs. John S. McLachlan's moneys formed part of John S. McLachlan's capital and 3rd that the dissolution was simulated. (See also report Q. R. 2 Q. B. 431).\nThe Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, Fournier and King JJ., dissenting, and held, that the dissolution of the partnership was simulated; that the moneys which appeared to be owing to Mrs. John S. McLachlan after having credited her with her own separate moneys were in reality moneys deposited by her husband, in order to confer upon her during marriage, benefits contrary to law, and that the bank had a sufficient interest to contest these claims, the transaction being in fraud of their rights as creditors.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nLafl\u00e1mme Q.C. and Green shields Q C., for the appellants\nHall Q.O. and Geoffrion Q.C, for the respondent.\n",
