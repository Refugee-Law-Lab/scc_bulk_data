G. Code and G. S. Hanington, contra.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an application made to me, in chambers, on behalf of the liquidators of the company for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick of the 5th of January last, allowing an appeal of the Eastern Trust Company from an order made by Mr. Justice McLeod, who had charge of the winding-up proceedings of the company, postponing, for the second time and until the first day of May next, 1906, the sale of certain very valuable property of the Cushing Sulphite Fibre Company, Limited.\nThe sale was to have taken place under a decree of foreclosure made by the Court of Equity of the province prior to the granting of the winding-up order. The sale had been previously postponed by Mr. Justice McLeod, acting as the judge under the winding-up proceedings, to a date in November last and then again by the order made by him in November till May next, and it is from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside this latter order and ordering, in lieu thereof, that the Eastern Trust Company, the mortgagee of the limited sulphite company's property, \"have leave to proceed in their suit as they may be advised,\" that I am asked to grant leave to appeal to this court.\nThe section of \"The Winding-up Act,\" under which it is contended that I have the power to grant the leave asked for is the seventy-sixth. It provides that\nan appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of a judge of the said Supreme Court from the judgment of (inter alia the full court of New Brunswick), if the amount involved in the appeal exceeds two thousand dollars.\nAt the very threshold of the application, therefore, I must be satisfied that this condition, which alone gives this court power to hear an appeal, exists. It is not contended that it does directly or that any amount at all is directly involved. But it is argued that the property to be sold is a most valuable one, amounting to several hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that indirectly it is of great importance whether the liquidators under the \"Winding-up Act\" or the referee of the Court of Equity should have the control of the sale, and that the adverse and contending bondholders hold bonds for sums very much beyond this two thousand dollar limit, and that, consequently, more than that amount is involved in the appeal.\nI am not able to appreciate this argument. I cannot see that any amount whatever would be involved in the appeal sought. All that would be involved would be the power and, conceding that, the judicial discretion of Mr. Justice McLeod in postponing the date on which the sale of the property was to take place. But with respect to neither the power to make the order not the judicial discretion exercised in the making of it, if the power exists, have we been vested with jurisdiction.\nThen again, I do not think the judgment sought to be appealed from a final judgment within the meaning of that phrase in the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. The twenty-eight section of that Act declares that\nexcept as provided in this Act or in the Act providing for the appeal, an appeal shall lie only from final judgments, etc.\nMr. Blair and Mr. Hazen contended that it must be held to be \"provided\" in the section of the \"Winding-up Act\" cited by me above, that an appeal shall lie from all judgments involving more than two thousand dollars. I do not so construe the two sections. I think they must be read together and that, unless otherwise specifically or by reasonable inference \"provided\" in the Act allowing an appeal, it shall lie only from final judgments, and only from them in cases where the amount involved exceeds two thousand dollars.\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is not a final judgment within the meaning of those words as used in the Act. It is simply an interlocutory judgment setting aside an order postponing a sale and giving the plaintiff leave to proceed as he may be advised and it does not involve any amount whatever.\nThe application is refused with costs.\nApplication refused with costs.\n"}

The case is a complicated one, but I would not feel justified in holding that the judgments in favour of the respondents are clearly wrong. The findings of the trial judge, after a careful and patient hearing of the numerous witnesses brought forward by both parties, should not be interfered with.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal involves no principle of law, but a mere question of fact, namely, whether a certain church built by Galicians in the North-West Territories was intended for a Russian Orthodox Church or a Greek Catholic Church in communion with the Church of Rome. After reading the evidence, I think that the least that can be said is, as found by the two courts below, that it is very contradictory. The trial judge, Who saw the witnesses, found it not satisfactory, especially as to the change of religious faith or severance from the Church of Rome. His judgment shews that he believed the plaintiffs' witnesses rather than those of the defendants. He observes:\nIt is impossible for me to believe that they (the Galicians of Star) could have attended the services of fathers Dymytrow, Tymkiewicz and Zacklynski (Roman Catholic priests) extending over a period of four years and have remained during the whole of that period in ignorance of the fact that their services were those of the Uniate (that is Roman Catholic) church and not of the Orthodox (Russian) Church. In appeal, Mr. Justice Wetmore says that the evidence is of a very contradictory character, and he adds:\nIf I had been in his place (Scott J.) my findings would have been of a similar character. But whether they would or not, this is not a case where a court of appeal should, in view of the conflicting character of the testimony and of the conclusions of facts open to be inferred from it, interfere with the trial judge's findings.\nWhen we read the letter dated 1st April, 1900, addressed to the Spiritual Father Zacklynski (one of the respondents, undoubtedly a Roman Catholic priest) in which two of the defendants and some twenty-two co-religionists who signed it declare that they are \"Uniates,\" that is, in union with the Church of Rome, and expressed the following request:\nWe require to have you, rev. father Zacklynski, permanently for our pastor, and we will pay you a yearly salary of two dollars per family. Each half year we will bring the money, besides the revenue from fees. We have a church finished. In the church we have an altar and symbolium and cross and two banners. Of church books we have the gospels and ritual for precentor and viaticum and further the collects. The presbytery is not yet finished, but we shall finish it in a short time, but for the meantime we have a suitable residence 100 paces from the church. We have a very good farm for the spiritual father, the same land on which the church is built;\nwhen we read this and other evidence, it is almost impossible to come to the conclusion that the trial judge was wrong.\nTwo courts, undoubtedly more acquainted with the subject matter than we are, and knowing better the locality and the people interested, their customs, manners, education and intelligence, came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs must succeed. The appellants admit that the evidence is contradictory, in fact hardly one single fact of importance could be agreed to by counsel before us. Is this a case where the findings of two courts should be disturbed? If I were satisfied that it was wrongly decided I would not hesitate to reverse, but I am not satisfied that the courts below were wrong. The very title of the church, rightly or wrongly\u2014that point is not before us, for we are not called upon to correct it\u2014 shews that it was in favour of the \"Greek Catholic Church,\" that is the Roman Catholic Church, to which these people always belonged before coming to this country, and not to the Russian Orthodox Church. I recognize the right of every congregation or individual to change his religion, and adopt any one he chooses not prohibited by law, but that change must be made in no equivocal terms. Here we have no resolution of the congregation; the opinions or consents of individual members taken by one man hired to do so at so much per head cannot change the situation; he did not even obtain the consent of the majority of the congregation. Even if he did the minority is entitled to hold the property, as the nature of the trust cannot be changed or altered except by and with the consent of all parties interested, or an Act of Parliament. The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland v. Overtoun ([1]) is an authority in point.\nThe relinquishment by the Roman Catholic bishop, so much relied upon by the appellants, means nothing as far as the Roman Catholic creed is concerned. There is no law in the North-West Territories or in any part of the country or in the Catholic Church government which requires that the title of a Roman Catholic Church should be in the name of its diocesan bishop; it is usually done in this manner, but there is no law which requires it should be so done. In the Province of Quebec it is not so held, and according to the common law prevailing anywhere in the Dominion, it may be held in the names of trustees (as in this case) for the benefit of any church designated. An ordinance passed in 1898 by the North-West Territorial legislature so provides in express terms. The Greek Catholic Church cannot mean the \"Greek Orthodox Church\" first mentioned in the requisition for the permit to build, and subsequently changed in the title to \"Greek Catholic Church.\" The very fact that the two names are used shews that they cannot mean one and the same church and the evidence establishes that they constitute two different bodies. The letter of the Dominion lands agent to the Department, of the 25th May, 1898, cannot supersede the certificate of title.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This case arose out of a dispute between rival bodies of Galicians residing in a settlement called Star, N.W.T., as to the religious uses and purposes to which the church built by them in that settlement should be dedicated.\nThe plaintiffs, who sued on behalf of themselves and other members of the congregation of the church, claimed an injunction restraining the defendants in whose names, as trustees, the church premises stood, from using or permitting the church to be used for religious purposes and uses other than those in communion with and under the jurisdiction and control of the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe judgment or decree from which this appeal is taken adjudged the lands of the church erected there on to be the property of that branch of the Greek Church and which is united with the Roman Catholic church and which may be properly designated as the United Greek Catholic Church.\nThe defendants contested the suit on the ground that the people who built the church and obtained the patent for the lands had, before or at the time they began to build the church and afterwards when they obtained their formal patent for the lands, severed any connection they may have had when in Galicia with the Roman Catholic Church, and repudiated being subject to the jurisdiction and authorities of that church, claiming to be united with and subject to the jurisdiction of the Greek Catholic Orthodox Church, the bishop of which, in North America, has his seat in San Francisco.\nAlthough the question incidentally arises it is not necessary for us to decide whether the church and premises in dispute are subject to the jurisdiction of the Bishop of the Greek Catholic Orthodox Church or not. The sole question necessary for us to determine is whether or not they are united with and subject to the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church.\nIf they are not the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\nThe facts are very voluminous, and complicated, and rendered more difficult properly to appreciate and decide because of the singular and unique position in which the church to which these people belonged in Galicia stood towards the Roman Catholic Church in that country, and also because the witnesses with rare exceptions gave their evidence through interpreters, many of the witnesses understanding the English language very little, and most of them not at all; while the great bulk of them were almost totally illiterate and ignorant. It is clear beyond any doubt that the Russo Greek Catholic Orthodox Church as such was prohibited for political reasons in Galicia by the Austrian Government, and that the church which was permitted and did exist in Galicia and which may properly be called a branch or offshoot of that church, was subject to the jurisdiction and supremacy of the Pope of Rome, though having a hierarchy and bishop of its own and a \"use\" or form of worship and ritual with vestments similar to those of the Greek Church.\nWhat the official or legal name or designation of that church in Galicia was, is difficult if not impossible to determine under the evidence.\nThe respondent in his factum and argument at bar insisted that it was the Greek Catholic Church, the same designated in the patent of the lands, but admited that it was known as and called by many different names according to the nationality or religion of the person who spoke of it.\nThe Ruthenians themselves call it \"The Ruthenian Church.\" The Poles call it \"The Ruthenian Church.\" The Church of Rome also calls it the \"Ruthenian Catholic Church.\" Catholics of the Greek rite \"The Graeco Ruthenian Church,\" and outsiders in order to give it a description properly describing its relation to the Greek Church and the (Roman) Catholic, call it \"Uniate\" or \"Greek Uniate.\"\nThe Roman Catholic bishop Legal says of it:\nThe Greek Church is the portion of the Christian Church not in communion with Rome which uses the Greek or oriental liturgy. The Greek Catholic Church of Galicia is a portion of the Roman Catholic Church using a liturgy in the Slavonic language. I have heard it called by the name of \"The Uniate Greek Church.\" We also call it \"The United Ruthenian Church\" and \"The United Greek Ruthenian Church.\" I would call them Catholics of the Ruthenian Rite to distinguish them from Catholics of the Latin or Roman Rite. The Greek Catholic Church of Galicia has exactly the same Creed as the Roman Catholic Church but I believe their liturgy is that of the Greek or Eastern Church, which is very different from that of the Roman Catholic Church. The testimony on the other hand of ecclesiastics called on behalf of the defendants was to the effect that the Greek Catholic Church meant the Greek Orthodox or Greek Catholic Orthodox or Eastern Church, as distinguished from the Roman Catholic or Western.\nThe court below in its form of judgment or decree says that it is that branch of the Greek Church which is united with the Roman Catholic Church and which may be properly designated as \"The United Greek Catholic Church.\"\nI am satisfied, however, from a careful perusal and comparison of the evidence of the different witnesses, that the phrase or terms used in the patent, as I gather from the certificate of title, to describe the church in dispute, namely, \"The Greek Catholic Church,\" does not necessarily and legally imply the Roman Catholic Church or a church in union with and subject to its jurisdiction, and that the name and description being doubtful and ambiguous, we are necessarily driven to a consideration of all the facts and circumstances connected with the building of the church, and the patenting of the land, in order properly to determine the meaning of the terms of the trust.\nAs to the difference between the church indifferently called by the witnesses the \"Uniate,\" or \"Greek Uniate,\" or \"Greek Catholic,\" or \"Ruthenian Church,\" or \"Greek Ruthenian,\" or more popularly \"Ruska Church,\" as it existed in Galicia, and designated by the court below in their decree as \"The United Greek Catholic Church,\" and \"The Greek Orthodox Church of the East,\" they are formulated by agreement of parties in the appeal book. The former affirms and the latter denies the following Roman Catholic dogmas or beliefs:\n1. The infallibility and supremacy of the Pope.\n2. The immaculate conception of the Virgin.\n3. Purgatory, and\n4. The double procession of the Holy Ghost.\nThe study I have given to the evidence convinces me that the trial judge, Scott, J., was right in his conclusion that these Galician peasants\ndid not trouble themselves very much over the differences in creed between the two churches (Eastern and Western). Many of them do not understand what these differences are.\nThere is also little, if any, difference in the rites, ceremonies, vestments and ritual of the Orthodox Eastern Church or Greek Orthodox Church, and those of the Galician Church called \"Uniate,\" \"Ruthenian,\" \"Greek Catholic,\" and \"Ruska.\" To the ordinary ignorant Galician peasant such as those of this Star congregation, I would conclude from the evidence there would not be any.\nThe real vital difference present to the minds of these people, as I gather from their testimony, was the supremacy of the Pope and the authority and jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic bishop over them.\nIn their own country, Galicia, these people ecclesiastically and the church to which they belonged, though having bishops and a hierarchy of their own, were beyond doubt subject to the supremacy and jurisdiction of the Pope.\nAs bishop Legal says in his evidence:\nIf Greek Catholics (by which term he meant these very people) go to a place where there is no Hierarchy or Bishop of their own rite they are enjoined to submit themselves to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy there, but they must return to their own rite as soon as an opportunity occurs. When these people emigrated to the North-West they were not only free to follow or accept any form of religion that they wished and determined on, but they knew that was so. Witness after witness testifies to this fact.\nThe question then arises: Did they remain in the church to which they belonged in Galicia owing obedience to the Pope of Rome, and subject to his supremacy or did they unequivocally change and throw off that allegiance?\nI am of opinion that they did the latter, and that amid much conflict of testimony, hard, if not impossible, to reconcile on other points, the evidence on this one point is clear that these Galicians made up their minds on coming to the North-West Territories to repudiate and did repudiate the authority and jurisdiction over them of the Pope and of the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese, and that the church they built was not intended to be, and was not in law, under such jurisdiction.\nEvidence was given in order to shew why they did this. That it was owing to the taxation they had to bear for the church in Galicia and which they feared they would be subject to in Canada. That it was because their hearts were with the church of their brothers in blood in Russia and that they only had submitted in Galicia because the law prohibited there the Greek Orthodox Church. That they really believed the tenets and held the faith of the Eastern Church as distinguished from the Western. These reasons do not concern me. They may be true in whole or false in whole, true in part and false in part, as from the evidence I conclude. But what I am concerned with is the fact itself. Did they for any reason clearly repudiate the supremacy and jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church, and erect a church building intended not to be in communion with it?\nWhether or not they could without such repudiation, and if they had remained subject to the jurisdiction of the Church of Rome, have secured to themselves the right to worship in this country according to the forms, ceremonies, and rights of the Greek Orthodox Church which they seemed to have possessed by law in Galicia, including the right which they also possessed there to have married priests, is a question I do not propose to enter into, as it is not necessary for the decision of this appeal. I will assume for the purpose of my argument that they could. What then are the facts in evidence respecting the determination of these Galicians to establish a church not in communion with or subject to the jurisdiction of the Pope?\nThey are of several kinds. First oral evidence of their acts and declarations when preparing to build and while building their church and obtaining their patent; second, written evidence of their intentions, desires and determination; and third, evidence that the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese appreciated and recognized the facts, accepted them doubtless reluctantly, but acquiesced to the extent hereafter referred to.\nIn 1892 the Galicians first began to come to the present settlement. In 1896, or the winter of 1897, there were about 18 families there, including both settlements, Star and Wostok, and they held a meeting together at Sowka's house and determined to write to the Greek Orthodox bishop Nicola, at San Francisco, for a priest. In April, 1897, reverend father Dymytrow, a Uniate priest in communion with the Church of Home visited the settlements and held three services. In June, 1897, the reverend fathers Kamneff and Alexandroff, two priests of the Greek Orthodox Church, sent by bishop Nicola, came to the colony, held services, administered sacraments and, it is said, received the allegiance to the Orthodox Church of some 60 families to which numbers the colony was now increased. They set about organizing congregations, getting land, permits for logs, etc., the orthodox congregation of the settlement of Wostok being one result of their visit.\nThere is some doubt and dispute as to the number of the families of the Star settlement that took an active part in these proceedings, and I am not inclined to lay too much stress therefore upon these facts. But that many of the leaders of the Star settlement associated themselves with those of the adjoining settlement of Wostok in all that Avas done until the moment when the location for the church came to be decided on seems to me clear.\nIn September, 1897, father Dymytrow returned for a two weeks' visit holding services and administering the sacraments. At this time the project of building a church at Star settlement ripened towards completion. The land in question was procured, a cemetery upon it was consecrated by father Dymytrow and at one of the services held in a school house bishop Legal, coadjutor of the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese, was present and at the close of the service pronounced the benediction. The services were conducted in a language the bishop did not understand, and few if any of the people present understood him, but the bishop was then aware of the desire of the people not to remain in communion with his church, promised them assistance, and sought through an interpreter naturally and properly to retain them in that communion. He afterwards no doubt in the most perfect good faith, but without the knowledge of any of the Galicians, had the necessary entry made for the land in the name of the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese and it was not till some time afterwards they found out the fact.\nThe decision to erect a church having been reached in November, 1897, the three present trustees made application for a permit to cut timber on the Government lands for a church and the Government agent at Edmonton sent to them a form of requisition to be filled out and signed. Not being able to read or write they went to a Mr. Morrison who was accustomed to assist them in any writings they required, taking with them the form of requisition which was partly in blank. At its head in the agent's handwriting was a memo as follows:\nI must know where the church is to be built, on what quarter section, and this requisition must be signed by the trustees for the Church or by the priest in charge.\nThen followed the printed form with blanks for the quantity of timber required, the place where it was desired to cut the timber, and the quarter section where the church was to be built, all of which Morrison filled up. Then followed \"remarks,\" written also by the agent, as follows:\nThis timber is required and will be used in the erection of a church building for the mission of the church and for no other purpose.\nMorrison says he interrogated the three trustees as to the kind of church they required and ascertained it was for the \"Greek Orthodox,\" which words he inserted in the blank by their instructions. These words are entitled to greater importance because in blue pencil beneath the blank left by the agent were writ- ten the words \"State whether Catholic or Greek Orthodox.\" He therefore had to interrogate them on the very point we now have in dispute. Was the church proposed to be built to be a Catholic Church or a Greek Orthodox Church, as opposed to a catholic one, by catholic all parties understanding Roman Catholic? Having got their answer \"Greek Orthodox,\" he wrote in the words and witnessed their marks being put to the requisition. As the document was put in evidence and comes up before us amongst the original records I find the words \"Greek Catholic Church\" written in blue pencil across the face of the requisition, but there is no evidence when or by whom they were written, and Morrison does not remember whether they were there or not when he filled up the document. I attach great importance to this document not only because of its contents, but because of the time when it was filled up, long before there was the slightest sign of any trouble between the members of the congregation. If these three trustees were at that time voicing the desires and intentions of their neighbours and friends by whom they had been appointed, there can be little doubt what kind of church was intended to be built.\nThis was in November, 1897. It was not till January, 1898, that bishop Legal made the entry for the land in the bishop's name.\nThe Galicians that winter went to work getting out the logs for the church, and in April had it partially erected when father Tymkiewicz arrived. Some of these Galicians worked for three winters getting out logs and lumber under this permit, and it was with these logs and this lumber the church edifice was built. The Rev. Father was sent to this country at the instance, as I understand, of the Roman Catholic bishop. He was a \"Uniate\" churchman, in communion with and subject to the Church of Rome and remained with these Galicians as their priest from April till August, 1898. For some reason, doubtless good, his evidence was not given, but the defendants and other members of the congregation gave evidence which was not rebutted that he represented himself to the congregation as an orthodox priest, and told them they should not take anything from the French bishop, that, he, Tymkiewicz, did not belong to the French bishop and that if the people took anything from him he, the priest, would leave them. This it was said he told them every time he held Sunday services. It was during the time he was their priest, and with his full knowledge and concurrence, if not at his direct instance, that the people succeeded in getting the entry made by the coadjutor bishop Legal for the land cancelled and a relinquishment signed by bishop Grandin or the proper officials of the diocese of the lands. This relinquishment was not in evidence either, but it was accepted as satisfactory by the department before issuing the patent to the trustees.\nWhen in April or May the members of the congregation learned that the title to the church land had been applied for in the name of the coadjutor bishop Legal, meetings were held and it was determined to get the title back. Bishop Legal himself had gone to Europe, but several visits were made by the defendants and other leaders amongst the Galicians to bishop Grandin or the officials acting for him, with the result that the bishop finally executed the necessary relinquishment.\nThe formal application by the trustees for a patent was not in evidence, but the letter written by the agent of the department in Edmonton to the secretary of the Department of the Interior, Ottawa, was put in by consent, perhaps to avoid necessity of calling the agent. However, the letter is most important as shewing what the intentions, desires and determination of the people of the Star settlement were at its date, 25th May, 1898, when Tymkiewicz was their priest and before, as far as I can gather, there was the slightest dispute or variance between or amongst the members of the congregation. The letter reads:\nEdmonton, 25th May, 1898.\nSir:\u2014\nWith reference to your file 438627, I beg to enclose herewith what purports to be an assignment from His Lordship Bishop Grandin of L.S. 1 of section 27, 56, 19 W. 4 M.\nIt appears to have been an error asking for a patent in His Lordship's name. This land is not intended to go to the Catholic Church but to the members of the Greek Catholic Little Russian denomination who are settled in this vicinity.\nThe trustees for these people are Mikel Polischy, John Polopovisky and Mikel Melnyk.\nThey were very deeply concerned over the fact it was proposed to hand this land over absolutely to the Roman Catholic Church; they insist on having the entire control in their own hands, and as it is highly desirable to meet their wishes in this connection, I should be glad (if the relinquishment which I herewith enclose is inadequate) if you will be so good as to have an instrument prepared to meet the case.\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\nA. D. L.\nThe Secretary, Department Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIt was in July following the receipt of this letter that the patent of the lands issued to the trustees, defendants\nin trust for the purposes of the congregation of the Greek Catholic Church at Limestone Lake in the said district.\nReverend father Zacklynski, who came to them as priest about the latter end of July, came, therefore, after the issue of the patent. I am of the opinion that the construction of the patent must be determined by the words themselves and if they are ambiguous by the facts and circumstances surrounding and preceding its issue, and that the great mass of testimony as to Zacklynski's engagement by these Galicians as their priest, and doings and sayings while with them, has little or no relevance to the real question to be decided. I hold the same with respect to the subsequent engagement and services of Korchinski, a priest of the Greek Orthodox Church, and who was made one of the defendants in this suit, but disclaimed any desire to enter or be forced into litigation.\nThe trusts existed when each of these priests came there. It only remains to determine what they were. That determination must rest upon preceding and contemporary facts and circumstances and not upon subsequent ones, more particularly those arising after the trouble in the congregation arose.\nReviewing, therefore, these preceding and contemporary facts and circumstances in the light of the declarations contained in the requisition for the timber limit and in the land agent's letter for the patent, enclosing the relinquishment of the lands from His Lordship bishop Grandin, I cannot entertain any doubt that the \"Congregation of the Greek Catholic Church at Limestone Lake\" did not mean a church united with and subject to the jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome, and the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church.\nI think the plaintiffs have entirely failed to discharge the onus of proof which lay upon them and that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the court below reversed and the action dismissed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants obtained from the Crown a grant of subdivision one of section twenty-seven, township fifty-six, range nineteen west of the fourth meridian,\nin trust for the purposes of the congregation of the Greek Catholic Church at Limestone Lake in the district of Alberta.\nThis is evidenced by a certificate of title, dated 6th July, 1899, issued out of the Land Titles Office, for the North Alberta Land Registration District.\nThe grant was led up to by events I will refer to, which took place eighteen months, or more, prior to this date.\nIt is unnecessary, here, to determine the exact trusts upon which defendants hold the property in question.\nIt is only necessary to determine, whether or not that trust was and is, explicitly or impliedly, to serve the purposes of a church, and ail that might be incidental to a church, for the uses of a congregation that recognized and recognizes the jurisdiction of the Pope.\nIf such was not the trust then the plaintiffs' action must fail.\nSuch is the legal issue. Let us not lose sight of it.\nThe learning imported into the case, as to the racial, or linguistic, or ecclesiastical origins of the people concerned, or of their forefathers, matters much less than such an ardent pursuit, as is presented, of that learning might imply. Still less does the name of the faith, or church organization or growth of either matter here. The name Greek Catholic is ambiguous. It has been used as properly designating entirely different bodies.\nA few salient facts relating to the origin and status of that branch of the Roman Catholic Church, that may be known here, in order to avoid any confusion, as Uniates, of Galicia, must be kept in view. As to these facts there is no room for controversy and in truth there is not any controversy.\nThe outcome of ancient strife, national and religious, has left in Galicia, a Province of Austria, three churches recognized by the State and each with a distinctly separate ecclesiastical head, responsible to, and recognizing, the jurisdiction of the Pope.\nBy reason of their original race and creed, which had disavowed the authority of the Pope, the ancestors of the people now in question, when they came to the recognition of the papal authority, were known to learned ecclesiastics as \"Uniates.\"\nIt was an appropriate designation of them. It was so none the less, though it may have been a constrained recognition.\nIt was not, apparently, the name that the people generally called themselves. The very constraint, through which it was brought about, may have tended in the popular mind to the ignoring of the term Uniate. And as a result, they called and continued to call themselves as of the \"Greek Catholic Church\" up to the time now in question.\nIt is to be observed that there seems to have been, notwithstanding all this long recognition on the part of these people and their ancestors of the jurisdiction of the Pope, a tendency to revert to the ancient faith and practice.\nThis kind of atavism, if I may be permitted to use such a word in relation to church matters, is not without precedent or parallel.\nI am quite prepared, therefore, to give credence to the mass of evidence, I may say overwhelming mass of evidence, in this case, that very many of the early Galician settlers in the North-West Territories were animated by a desire to assert, in the first place, what to them was an unwonted freedom of action, and in the next place to ignore the papal authority.\nThis was shewn by the first step that the defendants and others took when they moved in the matter of securing for themselves and others public religious services in the new settlement.\nNow what did they do? Did they go to the Roman Catholic bishop in the North-West and ask him for guidance and assistance? If they had been loyal believers in the authority of the Pope, surely that would have been the first step they would have taken. Instead of doing so they write or one of them writes to the bishop of Alutzk and Alaska, to have him supply the settlement with a priest. Certainly this bishop was not a Roman Catholic bishop. His reply seems to indicate that he had the greatest antipathy to the Pope and papal authority. Yet this letter in reply was read in public meeting to the people whom the appellants represented and claim yet to represent.\nWe hear of nothing to indicate objections thereto on the part of any one.\nThis correspondence had its beginning in a meeting of these people in 1896. And it seems to me to have in it the root of the whole matter.\nA second letter was received. Another place benefited by it and a church there arose out of it as well as this one in question.\nA good many of the people, at first concerned in the movement, went off to this other church which was nearer to them I take it. They were all from Galicia, both those who went to this church and the other one. And many of them in the other church had the same origin as those who are now in question. There is no doubt of the other church being one that does not recognize the papal authority.\nThere is only, in the fact I refer to of some going to that kind of church, this: that it shews the ferment amongst these people had begun and spread as the appellants assert.\nThe next important fact is the visit of the reverend father Dymytrow to the settlement in April, 1897, when he held three services there. He was in truth a Roman Catholic priest. Much stress has been laid upon this fact, and the further fact that some, if not all of the appellants and their friends attended these services. Why should they not have done so?\nIt is beyond my comprehension to conceive why they should, if religious men, feeling the needs of public worship, and of the aids of a priest, abstain from doing so because the priest, in accord with them in other respects, was one who recognized papal authority. He was nearest there, in faith, to what they believed.\nOn the occasion on which bishop Legal appeared, at one of such services, they were held in a school house, and not in this church. What were people like the appellants to do under such circumstances? Keep away, or go and make a nuisance of themselves? It is urged, if I understand the contention on this point, that they should have protested against the bishop's presence. I most decidedly say, decency forbade them doing so.\nFather Dymytrow did not build, or initiate then the building of, the church in question. He said they were too poor to build then. Notwithstanding that, within two or three months afterwards, they followed out what they had previously projected, and still desired, in regard to building this church. They met on more than one occasion to settle this matter of church building and the site thereof. And every appellant has sworn, and is abundantly corroborated by many other witnesses, that they determined to build a church for the uses of those who desired to worship in a Greek or Greek Catholic or Russian or Orthodox Church or church of any other name one pleases, but, most clearly and decidedly, not one over which the Pope would have jurisdiction.\nThey selected the appellants as trustees.\nIn June, 1897, two men, named respectively Kamneff and Alexandroff, came as missionaries and held services according to the rules of the Greek Orthodox, or from a Roman Catholic point of view, heterodox church. Reverend father Alexandroff was then, he says, only a deacon of that church.\nThe reverend father Kamnell, I take it, was a priest in that church.\nThey were sent by the \"Bishop of North America and the Aleutian Islands,\" the same that under another title I have already referred to.\nThese two missionaries served, in the Limestone Lake District, for a considerable time, and chose a church site, and made entry in the land office therefor, and suggested to the people concerned in this to take another selected site. But its being too far away did not meet with approval.\nThere was no church built or started at the place now in question when Alexandroff came. He came in the summer, and the church building started in the fall of the same year. The site in question was selected whilst Alexandroff was there; some say by him or approved by him.\nWasyl Polushie says:\nWe started to get out the logs shortly after father Alexandroff came the first time and were working at it when father Dymytrow came the second time. It seems from some of the evidence that logs were got from private property and this may relate to such contribution.\nBut the next step taken to build was getting a permit from the Government to use timber from Crown lands.\nThis very important piece of evidence shews an application of 29th Nov., 1897, signed by Michailo Melnyk and Michailo Polushie, two of the defendants, and one Fedor Melnyk. All signed this by making their mark. It is a printed form filled up by one who had no interest in the matter, and beyond doubt wrote just what he was told to write.\nIn filling up there appears the following:\nThis timber is required and will be used in the erection of a church building for the mission of the Greek Orthodox Church, and for no other purpose.\nOn this form appears a memo in pencil \"state whether Catholic or Greek Orthodox\" and in pencil across a corner of the form appears words \"Greek Catholic Church.\"\nHow this pencil marking, in handwriting of clerks or officers of Government came about is not explained, and I will not speculate. One thing is quite clear, that at least two of the appellants on the date of this document intended that the church should be built for the \"Greek Orthodox Church\" which, it is conceded on all sides, is not the church for which respondents claim it, but that for which the defendants now claim it.\nAre we to suppose that these men deliberately at that time set about to perpetrate a fraud? Why should they? No doubt the bounty of the Crown was open to any church in that country. No need of fraud. This, it must be observed, was at or about the time father Dyrnytrow was in the neighbourhood for two weeks. Were they acting for him or with him? Can it be supposed that it was the result of anything suggested by him? If so it would, I infer, be more in accord with him as he is presented by the evidence for appellants, rather than what the respondents ask us to infer it was.\nThere is much evidence to shew that he told them not to accept anything from the French bishop or to recognize him. And that is uncontradicted.\nShortly after or about this time it seems bishop Legal, or some one in his name, applied for the lot in question for the purposes of a Roman Catholic Church. We are not enlightened on this point by his evidence. Though he was a witness for respondents, he was not asked as to how this came about, or the purpose of the surrender of claim to it which I am about to advert to.\nIt is quite clear, however, that when this entry was discovered by the appellants, and those they represented, that steps were at once taken to have it set aside.\nThe bishop, or those who represented him, after demurring yielded, and the claim the bishop had made was duly and properly assigned or surrendered to or for the appellants. Thereupon the entry was made in the names of the appellants, with the concurrence of the reverend father Tymkiewicz and a French priest, who, I take it, was there to represent the bishop.\nFather Tymkiewicz is said to have been a Roman Catholic priest, sent from Galicia specially to minister to the wants of these Galicians. Why should he have taken this step? It may have been that he simply de- sired to appease these people whose church property in Galicia had usually been held by their own archbishop, and where that could not be done lay trustees were to be entrusted instead, but yet to hold it for the Roman Catholic Church or those in the fullest sense holding the faith of that church.\nIs the evidence consistent with that? Is it not rather consistent with an entire surrender of all claims of that kind in favour of the appellants and their friends, holding the wellknown views they did hold, on the question of the supremacy of the Pope?\nI cannot conceive how, under all the circumstances, father Tymkiewicz, knowing, as he must have known, the then attitude of these appellants on the point in question, could have intended they should be bound or expected to execute a trust so repugnant to them.\nNor can I understand why, if he did, no record was kept by him or some one else of what the trust was. Again, it is said by many witnesses that father Tymkiewicz had been present at the meeting of the people moving to get the property out of the bishop's hands and, later, told them not to take a single thing from the French bishop. How can that be at all reconciled with the creating of a trust in favour of Roman Catholic authority or of those of the Roman Catholic faith?\nThen we have before this surrender the proper remonstrance of the bishop with these people for leaving or wanting to leave their religion. We have also evidence of his promise, if they would abide by the old faith, to help them build the church. And we have the fact that he never contributed anything to the erection of the church.\nAll that seems to me quite inconsistent with any intention, on the part of those concerned, to impose upon the appellants any such trust as is sought to be enforced in this suit.\nIt seems quite consistent with a desire on the part of those having authority to speak for the Roman Catholic Church not to do anything that would, or might be, inconsistent with future pleasant relations with those who were so much akin to them in faith; that gentle methods would be much more likely to lead them, or some of them, in the desired way than any legal bond.\nThe conclusion seems to me irresistible that once and for all the bishop, on behalf of his church, abandoned all claim and thus ended the matter.\nThe respondents, though calling him as a witness, did not venture to question him on this point. This seems most significant.\nAs to all that followed if the trust was not impressed at the outset it goes for nothing.\nI cannot see why so much has been made of the later occurrences. The evidence as to reverend father Zacklynski is overwhelming that he was telling these people to have nothing to do with the supremacy of the Pope or with his church, and it is not denied. Moreover he ended, as he practicably admits he began, by asking (if Spaczinski is rightly reported) this congregation to abjure both Russian and Roman and keep their own church.\nThis latter incident is reported differently by other witnesses. Who is correct? Why was the plaintiff, Zacklynski, the author, it would seem, of all this disturbance, not brought as a witness to this wonderful thirty-five days' trial?\nSurely he was informed during that time of what was being said about him. It is a remarkable thing that of those who testified for the respondents the lay plaintiff, Petro Melnyk, seems to be the only one of the settlers who had lived there from the time of the earlier meetings to organize a church. Then came in March, 1897, Mr. Spaczinski, the leading witness for respondents. He is sworn never to have contributed anything to building this church, and does not deny it. He is sworn to have recanted with the others, but denies it.\nHe, however, accepted the books of father Alexandroff to act as lay reader, apparently in accord with the recantation. He was recalled in reply and states that reverend father Zacklynski asked them, at the rupture with him at his last meeting, to swear that they would stick to their own religion, not go over to the Orthodox Russian Church, nor to the Roman Catholic Church. Other witnesses differ from this version entirely.\nHe produces a book of which a part is translated. It indicates that \"on the 4th day, 6th month of 1898 subscribers to finishing the church\" appear as follows, etc. The first name, of ten, given is Pavlo Pasempko $15. In the evidence Pasempko states that he came to Alberta in May, 1899. Which date, 1898 or 1899, is correct? Who is to blame for the inaccuracy? Or are there two Pavlo or Paulo Pasempkos? I think not. I refer to this trifling incident as illustrative of the difficulties in this case and doubt one may have as to the accuracy of Mr. Spaczinski. I refer to these matters, relating to him, because upon his accuracy depends the weight to be given to the signing of what I may designate \"the call\" to father Zacklynski, which, though subsequent to the creation of the trust now in question, is a piece of evidence that if the signers perfectly understood when signing, tends to reflect upon their evidence a light leading to discredit them.\nHe testifies that when the appellants and others signed the call to father Zacklynski it was signed by all but four of those who did sign it, in a house he names, and that the paper was read by one Karetz to them. First he said it was written by Peter Stephura and then by Alexander Karetz and explains by saying Stephura had written one just like it. It contains the statement that the signers \"are all Uniates.\" Zacklynski came six months after this was sent by Stephura. This witness, however, tells of one Petro Zwanycz writing Zacklynski to come, but does not say whether before or after signing this paper.\nNone of these alleged writers appear as witnesses.\nA number of the signers deny the reading or hearing it read.\nThe original shews twelve out of twenty signers to have signed by means of a mark. It is difficult to fix the attention of illiterate and even many literate people, though apparently listening, so that they can catch the meaning of what is read, unless sentence by sentence is explained. No one ventures to suggest such a thing was done.\nI would be slow to bind such people by the expression Uniate in such a document as meaning something that in the face of other facts is most improbable as having been at all present to their minds.\nThey had gone for six months without a priest. Why? Simply because they would not recognize the proper authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, at hand. And why not? We are not offered any explanation.\nWe are told that many of them had in the time of the reverend father Alexandroff formally repudiated the head of that church. And they had just after that objected to the land being in the name of the bishop.\nWhen father Zacklynski, who was found through the channels of a newspaper advertisement by him, and not through any application to the bishop, came, he, if the evidence of a great many church members is to be believed, was loud in proclaiming himself as an Orthodox Greek Catholic and not a Roman Catholic. And whenever he proposed borrowing from the bishop to pay a debt for the building of the priest's house those people were up in arms.\nI think one cannot help, in reading the evidence in this case, being impressed with the want of support plaintiffs' case got from those who were there before the building of the church, and how strongly and distinctly those older settlers, who were there, and knew what happened, and who were the most active in promoting it, and the chief contributors to the building, speak on the subject.\nThe circumstances, and the evidence, seem to point nearly all one way, and that way against the establishment of a church that acknowledged the jurisdiction of the Pope.\nIt is not a case of conflict of evidence so much as a case needing to properly appreciate the evidence given and then to disregard the trifling unimportant incidents and matters subsequent to the creation of the trust, when the general scope and purpose of the parties in relation to that trust had already been made clear, and to apply that properly appreciated evidence to the interpretation of the ambiguous phrase in this certificate of title.\nWith every respect I think this evidence was not properly appreciated in the court below, and weight given to the subsequent events that should have been discarded.\nI concur in the brief judgment of the Chief Justice of the court below.\nI would, but for the zeal with which the case has been pressed and the importance attached to it by those interested, have contented myself with that expression of opinion.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014A very careful perusal and consideration of the evidence in this case have led me to the clear conclusion that we ought to allow the appeal.\nIt is clear that at and prior to the 29th of November, 1897, active proceedings had been taken among the Galicians in the vicinity of Limestone Lake for the building of a church. For this purpose land for a site and materials for the building had to be procured. The people were very poor, and it was thought that land might be obtained, and lumber also, from the Government without payment. When a question of site came to be discussed there was a difference of opinion depending upon distances and convenience. The ultimate result of this difference was that two churches were built, I think about six miles apart; one of these was at Wostok, and it is admitted that the Wostok congregation is an undoubted Greek orthodox congregation. I think that is an important fact, seeing that one section of those who were in the first place acting together on the project of building a church, and who had no differences among themselves, have built and are enjoying their property without dispute as orthodox, while the other congregation, without any difference of circumstances, have on hand the present unfortunate dispute. On the date above mentioned, the 29th of November, 1897, a requisition was made to the land office for a permit to cut timber for the church. The requisition specifies the land on which the church was to be built, and declares with special emphasis that the timber was to be used in the erection of a church building for the mission of the Greek Orthodox Church, and for no other purpose. That requisition is signed by three persons, two of them being two of the present defendants. The land specified in this application consists of forty acres of Government land, and it is upon that land the church was built and now stands.\nIn pursuance of this application a permit was duly granted. It has not been produced, but it will be presumed to have accorded with the application. The people immediately proceeded to cut the timber and to erect the church, and it was completed some time in the following year. Now, pausing here, what is the effect of what has been done? They have asked the Crown for a site for the purpose of building thereon a church of a specified character and denomination. They have also asked for a gift of timber for the same purpose. The gift both of the land and the timber is made and the church is built. The object and the purpose of the gifts are in writing. I think it plain that the church when built became and was under those circumstances impressed with the trust stated in the permit, namely, a trust for the Greek Orthodox Church, and for no other, and that if there were nothing else in the case, the appellants would be entitled to succeed.\nBut that is not all. The congregation appointed the three lay defendants trustees to receive and hold the title to the property\u2014in pursuance of the ordin- ance, N.W.T. Cons. Ord. 1898, ch. 28, and after the church was completed, or about completed, those defendants applied to the land agent for a patent. The agent then on the 25th May, 1898, wrote to the Department of the Interior, at Ottawa, in effect asking for the issue of the patent to those trustees. The agent refers to the fact that an application had been previously made by or in the name of the Roman Catholic bishop Grandin for the land, but that he had assigned or relinquished all claim, and that\nthis land is not intended to go to the Catholic Church, but to the members of the Greek Catholic Little Russian denomination who are settled in this vicinity.\nIt is not disputed that these words correctly describe the Greek Orthodox Church, described in the permit for land and timber above mentioned.\nThe patent was issued in pursuance of this request. It does not appear what its date was nor what were its precise contents. All that has been proved is that a certificate of title was obtained by the trustees under the Land Titles Act for the forty acres in question, expressed to be\nin trust for the purposes of the congregation of the Greek Catholic Church at Limestone Lake.\nThe words Greek Catholic Church are ambiguous. There is much testimony that such words might mean either the Roman Catholic or the Orthodox Church. We must gather which is meant by evidence, and the letter of the agent applying for the grant would be sufficient to shew that it was the Orthodox Church which meant. But if that were not sufficient, the fact that the Crown had previously, by its permit to build an orthodox church on this very land, with logs also granted for the same purpose, to my mind make it clear to a demonstration that the land and church in question have from the beginning been held, as was expressly intended by the donor, the Crown, as a Greek Orthodox Church.\nFor these reasons, as well as for the reasons much more fully expressed in the opinions of my brothers Davies and Idington, which I have had the opportunity of perusing, and also for the reasons expressed in the dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Territories, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, and that the action should be dismissed with costs both here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Short, Cross, Biggar & Ewing.\nSolicitor for the respondents: C. DeW. MacDonald.\n[1] (1904) A.C. 515.\n"}

T. Ry. Co., to determine whether or not a street crossed by the railway was a public highway prior to 1857, when the company obtained its right of way. It appeared on the hearing that, in 1850, the Trustees of the General Hospital conveyed land adjoining the street describing it in the deed as the western boundary of allowance for road, and in another conveyance, made in 1853, they mention in the description a street running south along said lot. Subsequent conveyances of the said land prior to 1857 also recognized the allowance for a road.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the said conveyances were acts of dedication of the street as a public highway.\nThe first deed executed by the Hospital Trustees, and a plan produced at the hearing, shewed that the street extended across the railway track and down to the River Don, but at the time the portion between the track and the river was a marsh. Evidence was given of use by the public of the street down to the edge of the marsh.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the use of such portion was applicable to the whole dedicated road down to the river, and the evidence of user was sufficient to shew an acceptance by the public of the highway.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants. This action was brought by the respondents pursuant to a direction or suggestion of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council. The respondents had applied to them for protection at the existing crossing of Cherry Street by the appellant company, and the question of priority became of importance in connection therewith. The action asked to have it declared that Cherry Street:\n(1) Exists across and beyond the right of way of the appellants.\n(2) Was dedicated as and for, and became, a public highway prior to the acquisition and use by the appellants of the said right of way.\nThe first proposition is no longer contested, having been conceded in the Court of Appeal. The second called for the determination of two points, namely: Was the highway dedicated, and if so was it accepted by the public before the right of way was acquired?\nIn giving judgment in the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Maclennan deals with the question of dedication as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe acts or evidence of dedication relied upon by the city are two conveyances made by the hospital trustees, the one made on the 19th, and registered on the 31st of October, 1850, of three lots lying to the west of the street in question, to one Jones, and the other made on the 14th October, and registered on the 2nd November, 1853, of the lots on the east side of the same street to one Jackson; and it is alleged that from and after the making of these deeds, if not before, that part of the street was used as a street by the public, and became in law by dedication a public street or highway.\n\u201cThe description of the land conveyed to Jones is as follows: \u2018All and singular that certain parcel or tract of land situate in the City of Toronto in the Home District, being part of the late Government Park Reserve, and described on the plan of lots laid out by the trustees of the Toronto Hospital Endowment, as lots Nos. 10, 11 and 12 on the south side of Front Street, and which may be otherwise known and described as follows, that is to say: Commencing on the south side of Front Street at the northwest corner of said lot No. 10 on the limit between lots Nos. 9 and 10 on the south side of Front Street; thence south 16 degrees west, six chains eighty links, more or less, to the southern limit of said lot No. 10; thence about south 75 degrees east to the water\u2019s edge of the river known as the Little Don; thence along the water\u2019s edge of said River Don in an easterly direction to the eastern limit of said lot No. 12, being the western boundary of allowance for road, as described on the plan aforesaid; thence along said boundary north 16 degrees west seven chains 30 links, more or less, to the southern boundary of Front Street; thence along Front Street south 74 degrees west four chains 50 links, more or less, to the place of beginning.\u2019\n\u201cThis is an unequivocal declaration by the hospital trustees, the owners in fee of the land, that there was then on the east boundary of lot 12 and adjacent thereto, extending from the River Don to the south side of Front Street, a distance of 7.30 chains, or 495 feet, an allowance for road, as described in the plan of lots laid out by them. No particular plan or copy of plan is specified. The declaration is that upon the plan of lots laid out by them there is a description of an allowance for road lying along the east side of lot 12. Now, at that time, apparently, the original plan was not in existence; it was worn out; but there was one plan, the McDonald plan, which did not unequivocally shew such allowance, while there were two others, the Chewett and the Howard plans, which did so. They were all copies, and I think the proper conclusion from the language of the deed is that the original plan exhibited the allowance as described therein. This is made, as I think, irresistibly probable by the fact that even the McDonald plan shews a sufficient width for a street and a lot, both of the regulation width, at the east side of lot 12. It is also to be noted that the allowance is declared to extend to the River Don, and not merely to the marsh.\n\u201cThe description in the deed to Jackson is as follows:\u2014\n\u2018All that certain parcel or tract of land situate in the City of Toronto, being composed of part of the late Government Park Reserve and described on the plan of lots laid out by the trustees of the Toronto General Hospital endowment as lots Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 on the south side of Front Street, and which may be otherwise known and described as follows, that is to say: Commencing on Front Street at the north-west angle of said lot No. 13, being at the junction of the southern boundary of Front Street and a street running south of said lot; thence south sixteen east to the water\u2019s edge of the River Don; thence along the edge of said River Don in an easterly and northerly direction to a line which would be formed by the continuation of the western boundary of East Street; thence along said line north 16 degrees west to the southern boundary of Front Street; thence along Front Street south 74 degrees west, 10 chains, 50 links, more or less, to the place of beginning.\u2019\n\u201cBy this deed the trustees convey seven lots de- scribed on the plan of lots laid out by them on the south side of Front Street, and the description commences at the north-west angle of lot 13, being at the junction of the southern boundary of Front Street and a street running south of said lot. There could be no street running south of said lot, for that would be at the Don, but the description refers to a street forming the southern boundary of Front Street and running south, and there is no difficulty in construing it as meaning a street running south, not of, but along said lot. The width of the seven lots, 10.50 chains, would make each lot 1.50 chains, and would leave an allowance for a street west of 13 of the same width as the declared and admitted width of Cherry Street, on the north side of Front Street.\n\u201cI think this deed, like the deed to Jones, is a declaration that according to the plan there was an allowance for a road on the south side of Front Street, extending to the River Don, over the site in question. I think that even if the McDonald plan was shewn to be a true copy of the original plan, reading the plan with the deeds, the latter must be regarded as declaring that a sufficient part of the lot marked on the plan lying east of lot 12 was allowed, that is declared to be, for a road, and that such is the meaning of the plan. I think these two deeds were solemn declarations by the trustees of an intention that the land in question was then an allowance for a road and, dedication being always a matter of intention, were acts of dedication.\n\u201cThe trustees have never since that time done any act to revoke or qualify the declarations contained in those deeds, and it is admitted that the land in question is now, and has been for many years, an undoubted highway, and it is clear it can only have be- come so by dedication. The sole question is whether the dedication had become irrevocable before the railway company laid their track across it.\n\u201cIt is in evidence that about the date of Jones\u2019 deed he was in occupation and built upon lot 12, and that between that date and the 29th December, 1855, the land was conveyed by and to successive owners six different times, besides as many mortgagees, in all of which deeds the allowance for road is referred to in the same terms as in the deed to Jones, and on the last mentioned date the then owner conveyed to the defendants a strip across 10, 11 and 12, thirty feet wide, lying 441 feet south of Front Street along the west side of Cherry Street. There was a plan attached to this deed and referred to in the description, which, however, has not been produced; and on the same day, by another deed referring to the west side of Cherry Street as its eastern boundary, Hutchinson conveyed to the defendants the remainder of the said lots.\n\u201cBy another deed made the 22nd October, 1856, Dennis and Julia Riordan conveyed to the defendants a part of lot 9, fifty links in width, according to a plan annexed thereto, for their track, and this plan shews Cherry Street extending across the railway to the River Don.\n\u201cIn like manner by a deed dated the 12th of February, 1858, made by Thomas Galt to the defendants, the seven lots conveyed by the trustees to Jackson were conveyed to the company by the same description as that contained in Jackson\u2019s deed.\n\u201cIt thus appears that all parties interested in the adjacent lands, from and after the 19th of October, 1850, including the defendants, in their dealing therewith expressly recognized the existence of the allow- ance for a road or street extending to the Don, and across what is now the right of way of the defendants\u201d\nHis Lordship then dealt with the question of acceptance and decided that the evidence shewed user by the public sufficient to establish it.\nW. Cassels K.C. for the appellants, referred to London & Canadian Loan & Agency Co. v. Warin[1].\nFullerton K.C. and Johnston for the respondents, cited Gooderham v. City of Toronto[2]; Mytton v. Duck[3]; Rowe v. Sinclair[4].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This case involves no principle of law, but merely a question of fact. The City of Toronto asked to have it declared:\n(a) That Cherry Street extends across and beyond the right of way acquired by the defendants;\n(b) That Cherry Street was dedicated and used as and for and became a public highway prior to the acquisition and use by defendants of the said right of way.\nThe trial judge, MacMahon J., decided in favour of the railway company, but on appeal this judgment was reversed with costs (Osler, Maclennan and Maclaren JJ.).\nI have gone over the reasons for judgment pro and con, and the numerous plans, maps and papers form- ing the case, and I do not see why the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be disturbed. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Maclennan in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal confirmed.\nI would add a few words only because I understand there is a difference of opinion in this court.\nI think the evidence sufficient to shew that there was a dedication of Cherry Street as a public highway from Front Street south to the edge of the River Don in the grants given by the hospital trustees, the then owners in fee, to their several grantees of the lots on the east and west sides of this dedicated highway and in the plans referred to in the deeds.\nI was in doubt during the argument whether there was sufficient evidence given of an acceptance by the public of this dedication.\nA careful perusal of the evidence and of the several plans produced and a consideration of the arguments pro and con have convinced me that the evidence of acceptance by the public was ample. This evidence would, of course, have been ludicrously insufficient from which to presume a dedication of the highway. It was ample to prove acceptance of a highway dedicated by the owner to the public. It was, no doubt, the misunderstanding on the part of the trial judge as to the description in the deeds and plans shewing the dedication which led him to the conclusion that there was no highway there and on the assumption on which he proceeded of the absence of an express dedication I think his conclusion was right. While the evidence was insufficient to shew an acceptance by the municipality as such it was ample as shewing an acceptance by the public.\nIt would, in my judgment, be absurd to hold that all the evidence given by Barnes and others of a user by the public of the dedicated road from Front Street down to the edge of the marsh prior and up to the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway should be limited to an acceptance of that part of the dedicated road only and should not extend to that small piece of the highway dedicated which crossed the marsh.\nI think the evidence of the user applicable to the entire road dedicated, and that it could not be successfully contended that the public by their user intended to accept a kind of cul de sac excluding them from access to the river. I think, also, however, that there was evidence of such user of the road across the few feet of marsh as the nature of the conditions admitted.\nWhen the Grand Trunk Railway purchased their right of way across this marsh bordering the Don, they knew well that the highway dedicated ran to the edge of the river.\nThe plan on Riordan\u2019s deed to them and the description in the deed from Galt to them in 1857 shews this beyond any doubt. They did not get nor attempt to get any deed of the land where the highway is contended to be from the hospital trustees or any one else, nor did the trustees attempt to obtain any compensation from the Grand Trunk Railway Co. for the taking of the lands, all of which is consistent with the understanding of all the parties as to the dedication and inconsistent with any other idea. Some doubt existed at the argument arising out of a discrepancy between the copies of the two plans produced (13 and 16) as to whether the plan in the possession of the hospital trustees and by which they sold the property to purchasers shewed the prolongation of Cherry Street by dotted lines to the edge of the Don. That doubt has been removed by a statement since submitted to us as arranged at the argument, and I have dealt with the case on the assumption that the plan referred to does shew these dotted lines.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014Was that part of Cherry Street in Toronto, running from the northerly line of the appellants\u2019 right of way, to the south thereof, in 1857, a public highway?\nSuch is the issue we have to decide. It is of the utmost importance, in order that we may properly answer this question, that all happenings since 1857 be discarded.\nIn some cases the conduct of the litigants in relation to the issues raised has great weight.\nOne peculiarity of this case, and the issue it raises, is that the conduct of either party to the suit is unimportant.\nThe question is reduced to one, resting on the common law, in relation to dedication and acceptance thereof by the public.\nWe have to find a dedication by the hospital trustees who were owners of the fee and an acceptance by the public prior to the railway crossing in 1857, or not at all.\nThe respondents\u2019 council did nothing that can be held to have constituted, by or through their authority, an acceptance by the public. The evidence of dedication by the trustees, who were the owners, rests entirely upon the grants by them of the parcels of land, of which one was granted to one Jones on the 19th October, 1850, the other granted to one Jackson on the 14th October, 1853. Each of the deeds evidencing these grants describes the parcels thereby respectively conveyed, first by numbers of lots\naccording to a plan of lots laid out by the trustees of the Toronto hospital endowment,\non the south side of Front Street, and then proceeds to further describe the same by metes and bounds. In the first of such descriptions by metes and bounds reference is made to an \u201callowance for road,\u201d and in the other and later one to \u201ca street\u201d which in either case can only refer to the land now in question.\nI put aside for the present possible inferences from descriptions by metes and bounds, instead of resting on the numbers of the lots on an alleged plan, and the observations to which this dual description is here open, and also the difficulties in the description in one deed, and in the meaning to attach to the words \u201callowance for road\u201d in the other.\nSuch grants, with such descriptions, are not necessarily to be taken as an unequivocal dedication. If there were nothing more two such grants, together, might be cogent evidence of and capable of shewing an intention to dedicate. Under the circumstances I am about to advert to, I am unable to find them in in that regard quite unambiguous.\nThe land conveyed to Jones in 1850 had, within the time from that to 1858, a building erected upon it and business carried on therein. But there is no evidence of the parties occupying the same or those doing business with them entering the premises from the alleged Cherry Street side. Obviously there would be no necessity for using this alleged Cherry Street as the front of the lot faced on Front Street, which led to the business part of the city.\nNo fence was shewn to have been erected on the east side of this Jones property until the railway had crossed.\nThere seems to have been an erroneous impression in this regard in the Court of Appeal.\nSo far from a fence being on that side, the witnesses refer to this land as an open field. Of course in later times there was a fence on both sides of the land now claimed to have been a street.\nThis conveyance of land on the west side of the supposed street was, in itself, certainly no dedication. And nothing having been done by those claiming under this grant (save reconveying by the same words of description), to shew a claim to the street as such, we must take it that, at all events until the trustees made on the 14th October, 1853, the grant to Jackson of land on the east side of the land now in question, there could hardly be said to be the vestige of evidence of a dedication.\nThis grantee, Jackson, by deed of 13th March, 1857, conveyed with other lands\nlots Thirteen (13), Fourteen (14), Fifteen (15) Sixteen (16), Seventeen (17), Eighteen (18), Nineteen (19) on the south side of Front Street in the said City of Toronto\nto Mr. Galt. There is no reference in this to the alleged street, no description by metes and bounds, and in short nothing to indicate a desire of preserving any right of way there.\nThat conveyance, without more, terminated all right of user of such a way as incidental to the ownership of lot thirteen. It is not pretended that Mr. Galt or his clients, the appellants, were concerned in the use of, or used this way till after the construction of the railroad.\nThat, and what I have related, reduces the question of dedication and acceptance to the happenings between 14th October, 1853, and 13th March, 1857, a period of three years and seven months.\nBut within this period what do we find the alleged dedicators doing in relation to this land?\nIn June of the year 1846 the Registration Act, 9 Vict. ch. 34, sec. 33, was passed and enacted as follows:\nThat any person, corporation or company of persons, who have heretofore, or shall hereafter survey and subdivide any land into town or village lots, differing from the manner in which, such lands were described as granted by the Crown, it shall and may be lawful for such person, corporation or company to lodge with the register of the county a plan or map of such town or village lots, shewing the numbers and ranges of such lots, and the names, sites and boundaries of the streets or lanes by which such lots may be in whole or in part bounded, together with a declaration to be signed by such person, or by the lawful officer, agent or attorney of such corporation or company, that the said plan contains a true description of the lots and streets laid out and appropriated by such person, corporation or company, and thenceforth it shall be lawful for the register to keep an index of the land described on such map or plan as a town or village, or part of a town or village, by the name by which such person, corporation or company shall designate the same.\nWe find that the trustees had a plan prepared for them, in the next year, 1847, by Donald McDonald. It is not explained why they delayed to register it. The later Act of 12 Vict. ch. 35, sec. 42, for the wider and more pressing purposes of surveyors and surveyings and assessment was enacted with a penalty for each year\u2019s default in registration of plans, shewing subdivisions. Probably this in time wakened up the trustees. They from whatever cause acted, and registered in January, 1855, the plan prepared in 1847, which does not shew any extension of Cherry Street south of Front Street.\nThe presumption of law is that this was regularly done, and that the registrar did not, improperly, register it without the required declaration, but required that, and saw that it was properly registered.\nUnfortunately, as this requirement of the statute escaped the attention of solicitors and counsel in this case, we are left to proceed upon the legal presumption only.\nIt is to be observed, that the plan shews, upon the face of it, a certificate of its correctness, signed by the chairman and secretary-treasurer of the trustees.\nWhat weight should we give solemn acts, such as this declaration, this certifying, and this registration; which, if improperly done, and without a declaration, could not be said to have constituted a compliance with either Act, and would have left the trustees open to prosecution for penalties, and possibly worse if they had made a false declaration?\nThese solemn acts were done within about a year and three months from the execution of the deed which completed that upon which dedication is relied upon in the court below.\nShould we infer these acts were done with criminal recklessness? Or should we not rather infer, that the deeds never were intended by the grantors to have the effect now given them?\nOr in face of all this, and the peculiarity of the dual description, should we not rather infer, that there was an error on the part of the clerks preparing the deeds, or that something tentative or possibly conditional, binding only between the parties to the deed, was what led to their containing those perplexing descriptions above referred to?\nThe least result of any possible answers to these questions must be to reduce this assumed unequivocal dedication to a something rather ambiguous, when we have to find and pass upon it, at this distance of time, in relation to the intention of gentlemen of education and respectability.\nNeed I go further? It seems to be clear law that before the public can take a man\u2019s property it must be clearly made out that his intention was to give it. Or at all events, the public acts claiming it must be of that open and well-known character that it is fair to infer he in truth and in fact assents to the taking.\nIn considering this question or purpose it has been well said, in the passage quoted by Mr. Justice Maclennan in his judgment herein,\nthat a single act of interruption by the owner is of much more weight\nthan user by the public.\nIt seems these acts I advert to, as done by the trustees, ought to be held to have more than outweighed all, if anything, they have done before; and also the evidence of public user.\nWhat is the evidence of public user that can be relied upon here either to support a dedication or an acceptance by the public of one?\nCould the respondents have asked successfully, in 1857, for an injunction to restrain the trustees from withdrawing anything they had done, and enclosing the ground now in question; or could a trespasser have been indicted had he at any time up to the end of 1857 dug a hole in this alleged highway where the waters of the lake or river flowed over it?\nCould any court have been got to listen and en- join or convict on the evidence of such acceptance by the public as we have here?\nThese would seem to be not only fair tests, but the true tests open to any one then complaining of such supposed improper conduct.\nThe person digging could, perhaps, if this supposed dedication was incomplete by reason of non-acceptance, have been sued by the trustees for trespass.\nImagine such an application for injunction then, or such a prosecution by way of indictment then, and it seems to me, that the evidence of Cadieux, with his garrulous tales of hauling marsh hay and ice from the bay, and of Ward as to his going to school with his little boat, and his infirm and confused memory in regard to incidental details thereof as the only evidence of user of this part of the street, would not have supported either case.\nIt strikes me that such a case could hardly be listened to.\nI have read, out of respect to the court that relied upon this evidence, these witnesses\u2019 testimony several times. I quit it each time wondering whether the memory of the old man or the younger one had furnished the most evidence of unreliability.\nBoth witnesses confuse, in several places, the happenings of before and after the making of the railroad crossing, and when one discards that which is not clearly referable to the times before the appellants\u2019 track was built there is little left, and that unimportant indeed. What signifies people hauling hay in ancient times before this street could have had any formation or appearance thereof? Who believes that this Cherry Street was, when an open field or com- mon along with all the land there, sacredly followed by people hauling hay, or ice either?\nThey doubtless went and came by the line of least resistance.\nI refuse to believe that, without fences, marks, or stakes defining it, there was any divinity hedging about this swampy piece of land as that to be chosen for driving over. I could believe it if a man told me he found the creek frozen over and better sleighing on the ice than over the thicket formed by rushes and probably bushes that grow in a marsh. And if the plan is reliable such driving as is alleged would be along the very edges of the frozen marsh and creek, probably the most treacherous (by reason of rising and falling of stream breaking the ice) and dangerous part of the whole place.\nNot until Barnes came there was there any fence on either side. The reference to the docks and other features of later times destroys much of these witnesses\u2019 evidence. It shews that their memories had not clearly retained what they saw before, but confused it with what happened after, the railway crossing.\nI do not wish to cast any reflections upon either witness. Ward repeated time and again from beginning to end his want of confidence in his memory as to the exact time. And the old man Cadieux also says much the same, in places, of his own memory. When some witnesses are led by counsel, even if the process be checked, it weakens the confidence we might otherwise place in frail memories of long past events, in their relation to time and exact place in which they had no interest.\nBut what of the further evidence of James Barnes whose father is said to have owned and had a brickyard on this lot thirteen? I confess this is a puzzle. I have shewn that Jackson\u2019s title passed to Mr. Galt. Where did Barnes\u2019 title come in? I can find no deed to him or from him. No evidence is given of his ever having had any title but that which his son gives of his father\u2019s occupation.\nThere is also written across the plan Exhibit 16 the name Michael Barnes, but there is nothing to indicate what it means.\nIn most of the other cases, when the names are written on this plan across a lot or lots, the date of the deed is given.\nIt might be inferred from that sort of marking that the parties so named had become owners. But here that is not a safe inference and in this case it is precluded by the facts, already given, of the title having passed from the trustees to Jackson and from Jackson to Galt.\nCan it be that Barnes was a lessee of the trustees or had enjoyed under them some temporary title such as a proposed purchaser?\nWhatever it may mean I take it that on these facts his dealings with the lot all go for nothing as of any consequence in deciding truly the issue presented to us.\nIn all probability he was one of the hospital trust\u2019s lessees, who had the right to dig for clay and form brick there or thereabout.\nAnd in the course of his business he possibly used a piece of this alleged Cherry Street extension, for ingress and egress, as part of his rights as lessee.\nIf that surmise be correct of course all that appears in his evidence to support a public user of this road, and that is attributable to such a purpose, is worthless. And it seems to me without any surmise, but without explanation, the same result must follow. I need not, therefore, deal with the son\u2019s evidence. Even if his father had been in Jackson\u2019s place in relation to the title it would be of little value.\nHave we, in the surmise I make, an explanation of the allusion to a road allowance in one of the deeds and a street in the other?\nI return to the main question of dedication to point out that the registered plan makes Cherry Street end at Front Street, whilst in the case of other streets such as East Street on one side and Mill Street on the other running parallel with the northern part of Cherry Street they run by this plan to the water.\nAs Mr. Justice MacMahon points out in his judgment the nature of the plan, by reason of the windings of the Don encroaching upon what would have been the further extension of Cherry Street, forbade the use of it as a street. It would seem also as if the creek or marsh, at least of the east side, was such as to forbid hope of making or preserving the extension of a street to serve usefully the rear end of the lots, in the condition of things at that early day.\nAnd, as the judge I refer to has also pointed out, the width of the stream was such as to take up as much land as a street and then leave only enough of good land for one lot. I may add it was marked on the plan No. 13 by a marking No. 13 in the centre of the entire whole width of what is now presented as thirteen and a street.\nWhy should there be a street there? It was by reason of the Crown owning the land at the extreme south end, and that covered by water not deep enough to be navigable, a sort of cul de sac.\nThe authorities point out that in the case of a cul de sac the inference from acts of travel is not so clear as when over a thoroughfare. Indeed the inference of such a dedication, by user, was held not legally possible, according to very high authority.\nThe later rule is to limit it to cases of clearer intention than requisite in relation to a thoroughfare.\nIn the view that there may have been user, by those owning the lots on either side, coupled with the form of deeds and description therein such as to create a dedication in itself, I would point out that to infer such a user is not open, and if it be open, that it clearly was a right exerciseable only by virtue of the easement that the deeds may have created in favour of those grantees and their assigns who chose to assert it.\nThat was something the public had nothing to do with. It did not rest necessarily upon a dedication to or for the public. It was not necessarily, standing alone, any evidence of dedication.\nSuch right as flowed or might flow from such a state of things could have been extinguished at any moment.\nStreet plans are daily set aside and the statute permitting and regulating that is but what existed before the statute.\nUntil the public has acquired a right by clear acceptance of a preferred dedication it can be withdrawn.\nAll that could have, by any possibility, supervened here in favour of the public to prevent such a withdrawal, must have taken place between the 14th of October, 1853, and such time in 1857 as the appellants\u2019 railway crossing was built.\nWhen on takes into consideration the swampy nature of the ground, the encroachment of the creek, the absence of any need of such a street extension, the enormous expense that, with such a creek covering in parts most of the alleged allowance, it would have cost to make a road of it, we are (unless we attribute it to the owner\u2019s folly or mockery), I think I am bound to say, with the greatest respect, however, forbidden to believe that they must be held by doing and submitting to all that appears in evidence, to have had the intention of dedicating a street here.\nIt is to be observed that what I just expressed as to the nature of the ground may not have been applicable to the small part at the north end. If there had been any room for finding, otherwise than as I view the case, a dedication from evidence of the user alone it would have, even if possible, only extended to the part so used as to give such a right.\nThen as to the plan on the back of the deed the appellants and their omission to expropriate this street in the course of getting right of way, why should we attribute to that any weight?\nWe must test it, if worth anything, by the excellent test of its admissibility as a piece of evidence in the event of a suit or prosecution (with which appellants had nothing to do) such as I have supposed to have been possible to have taken place in 1857.\nIt could not, I think, have been admitted in such a. case, and being inadmissible there, for such a purpose, is of no avail now.\nI repeat we are trying not these litigants, but the possible rights of possible litigants in 1857 when the public right as it existed then must be the test. The exact date of the crossing is doubtful and counsel left it to be taken as in 1857.\nOn the whole I am unable to find that evidence here existed up to 1857, that would, within the cases, constitute such dedication and acceptance of the intended dedication, if such there were, as would in law constitute all or any part of the land in question, from the northerly line of the appellants\u2019 road allowance to the water, a public highway. The inexpediency of having highways for whose repair no one can be held responsible, should in this country prevent any further recognition of the creation of highways by way of dedication than can be avoided, where the municipal councils have not recognized them. See Angell on Highways, pp. 178 to 183.\nThe cases of Wimbledon & Putney Commons Conservators v. Dixon[5]; Cowling v. Higginson[6]; and Selby v. Crystal Palace District Gas Co.[7], illustrate the principles that must be kept in view in weighing acts of user; especially such as may have resulted from occupations like those of Barnes and others, and what user, resting on covenants or provisions in deeds, may be implied as standing for.\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the trial judge be restored, with costs here and in all the courts below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.H.

The Railway Committee may make such orders, and give such directions respecting such works and the execution thereof, and the apportionment of the costs thereof and of any such measures of protection, between the said company and any person interested therein, as appear to the Railway Committee just and reasonable.\u201d\nIn the year 1890 the appellants applied for protection at the crossing of Bloor Street, in the City of Toronto, by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and also at the crossings of Pape Avenue, Logan Avenue and Jones Avenue, by the said Grand Trunk Railway Company, in the said City of Toronto, and the committee made an order dated the 8th day of January, 1891, directing that the crossing of Bloor Street, by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and the crossing of Pape Avenue, Logan Avenue, and Jones Avenue, by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, be protected by being provided with gates and watchmen, and that the cost attending the placing and maintenance of the gates and watchmen at the said crossings be borne, one-half by the City of Toronto, and one-half by the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, which said order of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council was made an order of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, on the 4th day of December, 1903.\nOn the 21st day of April, 1899, the appellants applied to the Railway Committee for an order for the protection of the crossings of the Grand Trunk Railway Company at Dunn Avenue, in the City of Toronto, and on the 9th day of June, 1899, the appellants applied to the Railway Committee for an order for the protection of the crossing of the Grand Trunk Railway Company at Dowling Avenue, in the City of Toronto, and the committee directed that the crossings at Dunn Avenue and Dowling Avenue in the City of Toronto be provided with protection and that watchmen be placed at the said crossings, the wages of the said watchmen to be borne and paid solely by the City of Toronto as appears by an order of the Privy Coun- cil dated the 11th day of March, 1902, which order was made a rule of the High Court of Justice for Ontario on the 4th day of December, 1903.\nIn pursuance of the orders of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council the crossings in question have been protected in the manner directed by the said orders and an account has been kept of the expense of the installation and maintenance of the said gates and watchmen by the said respondents who have from time to time demanded payment of the appellants\u2019 shares of the same, but so far payment has been refused.\nThe appellants at the trial contended that the Parliament of Canada had no power to direct or enable the Railway Committee to charge the costs of the works which are part of a railway, though declared to be for the general advantage of Canada, against a municipality, and they further contended that the Railway Committee had not the power to make the orders in question, charging the cost of the work against the appellants under the statute upon which the Railway Committee purported to act.\nThe appellants further contended that they were not consenting parties to such order and that the orders in question were not made upon their application, but by the Railway Committee in pursuance of its ordinary procedure.\nThe Chancellor, who presided at the trial, gave judgment as follows:\n\u201cThe questions of law argued in this case are settled by authority to which I defer and follow:\n\u201c1. Whether the sections of the \u2018Railway Act,\u2019 (1888) ch. 29, sections 187, 188, are ultra vires?\n\u201c2. Whether the city is a party interested, if the Act is not ultra vires? \u201c3. Whether there was jurisdiction on the part of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council to interfere in this case and direct the apportionment of cost, and as to the different crossings, because of the city making application for different relief.\n\u201cThese were all expressly or by fair implication involved in the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and York[1], and I just follow that authority in directing the proper orders to be made for collecting what is due by the city.\n\u201cThe law as settled by the above case was recognized by Burbidge J. In re Grand Trunk Railway and City of Kingston[2].\n\u201cCosts follow result.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment holding that the case referred to by the Chancellor decided the questions in dispute.\nFullerton K.C. and Johnston, for the appellants. A municipality can only be authorized to expend money by the legislature: Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[3], and neither Parliament nor the Railway Committee can order protection for a municipal purpose. See Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[4]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Therrien[5].\nThe municipality is not a \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of section 188 of \u201cThe Railway Act, 1888,\u201d and as to this In re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and the County of York1, is wrongly decided. H.S. Osler K.C., for the respondents.\nShepley K.C. for the Dominion of Canada.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The questions involved in this appeal have been thus summarized by Chancellor Boyd, in the trial court:\n(1) Whether the sections of the Railway Act (1888), ch. 29, sections 187, 188 are intra vires?\n(2) Whether the city is a party interested, if the Act is not ultra vires?\n(3) Whether there was jurisdiction on the part of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council to interfere in this case and direct the apportionment of costs, and as to the different crossings, because of the city making application for different relief?\nThe learned Chancellor and the judges of the Court of Appeal unanimously answered the above questions in the affirmative. I entirely agree with them. They refer to a decision in Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and the County of York[6], followed by Burbidge J. in Re Grand Trunk Railway Co. and the City of Kingston[7]. Mr. Justice Osler has so correctly expressed my own views on these points of law at pp. 72-73 of the former case that I cannot do better than quote his own language:\nOn the question whether these provisions of the Railway Act are ultra vires of Parliament, in relation to the three municipalities or otherwise, I have little to add to what I said on the general question in McArthur v. The Northern and Pacific Junction Ry. Co.[8] at pages 124, 125 (1890). As provisions relating to the safety of the public in connection with the management of a great Dominion undertaking they would appear to be eminently germane, if not absolutely necessary, to legislation on such a subject, and cannot be held to be invalid merely because in the mode in which Parliament has declared they shall be carried out, they, to some extent, affect property and civil rights. It cannot but be considered reasonable and right that the public, as represented by the municipalities through which the road passes, sharing in the advantages conferred by it and directly benefited by the measure of protection imposed and required, should share also in the cost of maintaining them. Legislation by which such liability may be imposed seems to me not essentially different\u2014regarded as legislation relating to the railway\u2014from that under which the road is created, and the compulsory acquisition of land, and the ascertainment of its price or value, provided for, e.g., the cases of fencing and subtracting benefit derived from increased value of remaining land. It is not, in my opinion, ultra vires and, if not, I agree that the court cannot review the decision of the Railway Committee and declare that those whom they have decided to be interested in and liable to contribute to the cost of maintenance are not interested and liable. It was argued that if the county or township could be treated as interested the Railway Committee might as well declare that any other municipality in the Province, even the most distant, might also be so held, but I do not think that questions of ultra vires can be tested or decided by unreasonable or extravagant suppositions of that kind. It must be assumed that the Railway Committee will exercise the judicial powers which have been entrusted to it in a just and reasonable manner, and there is no reason to say that even as regards the county it has here acted otherwise. Many of the matters urged on the appeal, relating to the status of municipalities, their powers of taxation, etc., are really mere assertions in various forms of the principal objection, for if the legislation is intra vires municipal corporations are in no different position from natural persons, and there is no more difficulty in enforcing compliance with the order of the Railway Committee than in enforcing a judgment obtained against them in an ordinary action.\nA long array of decisions has been quoted by the Attorney General for Canada in support of this judgment and, until our recent decision in Re Railway Act[9], be reversed, we are bound to hold that, in a case like this, the Dominion Parliament may interfere with property and civil rights and impose obligations upon municipalities as being incidents to the subject matter assigned to its jurisdiction.\nAn attempt has been made to distinguish cases in which a railway is constructed across a pre-existing highway. I fail to conceive how this fact can affect the jurisdiction of the Railway Committee. It may be of importance to apportion and determine the burden of keeping gates. But this has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the Railway Committee; it is a matter left entirely with the Railway Committee, who may deal with it as in its wisdom it may deem just and in the public interest, without being subject to review by any court of justice.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The questions to be determined on this appeal are two. First: Had the Parliament of Canada when legislating with respect to railways within its jurisdiction the right to give to the Railway Committee power to apportion amongst parties interested the cost of the carrying out of such protective measures as was by the committee deemed necessary at the crossings of the railway and public highways? Secondly: If so, was the City of Toronto a \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of those words in section 188 of the \u201cRailway Act of 1888,\u201d with respect to the crossings within the limits as to which an order had been made?\nNo question as to the reasonableness or justice of the orders impeached was or could be raised provided the Railway Committee had jurisdiction to make them.\nIt was suggested and argued, however, that the power of Parliament to legislate on the subject matter in dispute might depend upon the priority in existence of the railway or the highway and that while in a case where the railway crossed an existing highway such right might not exist, it might with respect to an ap- plication made by a municipality for leave to cross an existing railway by a contemplated highway.\nOf course such leave might be given upon conditions which if accepted would be binding upon all parties, but apart from that special point I think the statutory powers conferred upon the Railway Committee to apportion the cost of the works ordered cannot, if intra vires at all, be limited or controlled by any question of the priority of the roads crossing each other.\nI agree with Meredith J. in Re Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and the County of York[10], (from the judgment in which case this is practically an appeal) when he says:\nComplete legislative power admittedly exists somewhere. Nothing turns upon the wisdom or unwisdom, or the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the thing, or whether it is precedented or unprecedented; those are matters for legislative, not judicial, consideration.\nThe exclusive power to make laws for the construction and efficient operation, management and control, of such railways as have been by the British North America Act, 1867, assigned to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada being vested in that Parliament, the sole question is whether this section 188 is not necessarily incidental and ancillary, or as put by Osler J. in the case above referred to \u201ceminently germane if not absolutely necessary,\u201d to give full effect to the ample powers given and intended to be given to the Railway Committee for the safety of the travelling public alike by rail or highway.\nLooking at the question in the large and as applicable to the conditions existing in Canada, we find three great transcontinental railways built or being built across our Dominion connecting one ocean with the other. These roads necessarily cross hundreds of highways where there is little if any traffic. As population increases the traffic grows until a railway crossing of a highway on a level which one year required no special protection, in a few years might require watchmen and gates, and in a few years more either an overhead bridge or an expensive subway.\nThe increasing traffic demanding these prudent \u201cmeasures of protection\u201d may be due largely to the operation of the railway, or causes quite foreign to it, or to a combination of both. If Parliament is not justified by the necessity of the case in dealing with this traffic and doing so effectively, what authority can do so?\nThe power to deal, and to do so effectively, with the special conditions arising from a rapidly increasing traffic at a railway crossing of a highway must necessarily be dealt with by some paramount authority.\nThe power which the local legislature possesses of legislating with respect to property and civil rights would be manifestly inefficient and limited. The subject is not one admitting of dual legislation.\nThe only power capable of dealing fully and effectively with such a condition is that of the Parliament of Canada.\nThat in dealing with it property and civil rights are effected is a matter of course, but all interested parties may be dealt with and all interests affected legislated for. It seems to me in the very nature of things this must be so or the legislation would fail to fulfil its object, the public safety.\nBut it is said all this can be accomplished at the expense of the railway, and without assigning any portion of that expense to the municipality. Just so. It can be so. But Parliament having authority over the premises has chosen to say, we think a more equitable plan will be to invest a competent tribunal with the power of apportioning between the railway and interested parties the share of the cost of the protective measures each should bear.\nThe only question then remaining would be whether the municipality was a \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of these words in the section.\nIn the first place by R.S.C. ch. 1, sec. 7, sub-sec. 22, the word \u201cperson\u201d includes any body corporate and politic so that if Parliament had power to do so it has declared municipalities interested as being within the classes liable to contribute to the expenses of the protective measures ordered.\nBy the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act of Ontario, 1892,\u201d ch. 44, sec. 3, the inhabitants of every city, etc., are declared to continue as a body corporate.\nWhile there may be some doubt as to the complete title of the municipality to the soil or freehold of and in the public roads and streets within its bounds, there is none that such roads and streets are vested in it and under its jurisdiction and that it is the virtual owner of the public roads and streets within its bounds and liable to keep them in repair.\nThe practical interest, therefore, of the municipality in the road, and in the manner in which the Railway Committee deals with it whether by deflecting it or carrying it under or over the railway or merely causing gates to be placed across it with watchmen, seems to be indisputable. The municipality in this respect represents its entire population.\nIf its title is only in the surface and another person owns the soil below the surface that may be a good reason for insisting that the varied titles and interests affected should be considered by the tribunal. But that is all.\nOnce you reach the point that the subject matter is one for Parliament to deal with, then it is for Parliament exclusively. There cannot be two conflicting tribunals legislating at the same time upon such a vital subject as the public safety at railway crossings. If for Parliament exclusively the legislation may cover all the ground necessary to make it effective and may in order to do so extend to branches eminently germane and ancillary even if not absolutely essential in the sense in which the appellant contends this legislation is not. And so it may not only affect and embrace interests other than those of the railway, but may do so in such a way as to compel them to contribute to carry out what is deemed necessary and adequate protection to the public under the circumstances in each case, the tribunal vested with the power of so determining being unfettered in the exercise of its judgment within its statutory powers and not liable to supervision or control by the courts.\nThe City of Toronto in its corporate capacity represents all of the inhabitants of the municipality in which the railway crossing is situate at which the protection works were ordered. As such it properly applied to have these protection works carried out. I do not think the mere fact of its application necessarily involved it in liability to pay any part of the cost of these works. But being the virtual and actual owner of substantial interests in the street or highway at and on both sides of the railway crossing and which interests were directly affected by the works asked for and ordered and at the same time the corporate representative of the residents and people directly interested in these works, I am of opinion that it is a municipality or \u201cperson interested\u201d within the meaning of the section of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d under discussion and amenable for the purposes of the order made by the Railway Committee to its jurisdiction.\nI am not able to appreciate the argument that because the municipality is one with powers and rights defined and limited by the provincial legislature it can therefore escape the responsibility which attaches to it as a person or municipality interested under the Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondents sued in this action to recover moneys spent in guarding their railway crossings of streets in the City of Toronto, alleging as the basis of such right of action certain orders made by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, directing said appellants to repay to said respondents moneys spent by them in guarding such crossings.\nThe courts below following the result of a similar case, which is reported in 25 Ont. A.R. 65, gave judgment for these claims, and from that this appeal is taken by the said city.\nThe respondents\u2019 railway was built after the streets crossed had, except in the cases of two of the crossings now in question, been in use for some years.\nThese two exceptions are crossings of Dunn Avenue and Dowling Avenue effected by virtue of the passing of a by-law of the Village of Parkdale, now forming part of Toronto, assented to by the Great Western Railway Company, who were predecessors in title of the respondents, in respect of that part of their road crossing the two streets thus opened across the railway tracks.\nThese two crossings seem to have been the result of a bargain whereby the railway company got rid of a liability to maintain several farm crossings.\nThese railways were built before the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d 1867, was passed, and some thirty to forty years before the \u201cRailway Act\u201d we have to consider was passed.\nNo provision was made, so far as appears from the cases before us, at the time when any of these crossings, which are all level crossings, were constructed, looking beyond the immediate necessities of construction either as to future reconstruction or maintenance.\nNo provision was made in any of them, or likely ever thought of, for the future guarding of these crossings, for the purpose of protecting the travelling public on either highway or railroad.\nAs travel on both increased, and trains became multiplied and by reason of double tracking and increased rate of speed, doubly dangerous, some of these railway crossings, from time to time, became scenes of sad accidents which stirred the appellant\u2019s council to ask the Railway Committee of the Privy Council for some remedy for such a state of things.\nThis resulted in the said committee directing, by orders of 8th January, 1891, that gates and watchmen be provided within two months, and thereafter maintained by the respondents and the Canadian Pacific Railway companies respectively, as the case might require, at four of the crossings in question here. Then the order continued as follows:\nWhere two railway companies use the same crossing each railway company to contribute one-third, and the municipality or municipalities interested, the other third of the said cost. Where one railway company only uses the crossing, the railway company to contribute one-half and the municipality or municipalities interested, the other half of the said cost.\nThenceforward nothing more seems to have been done, until the appellants again applied to the Railway Committee, on the 4th December, 1903, in regard to the above-named Dowling Avenue and Dunn Avenue crossings and the following order was made by said committee on 11th March, 1902:\nThe said committee, on the 21st day of December, 1900, heard counsel for the railway company and the said corporation respectively, and having duly considered the evidence submitted, hereby orders and directs, subject to the sanction of the Governor in Council, that the said railway company shall provide and keep day and night watchman at the said crossings, the wages of said watchman to be borne and paid by the Corporation of the City of Toronto.\nIt is upon these orders that respondents sue for the expenses of keeping such watchmen.\nI do not think, as argued for respondents, that the applications by the appellants were, or that any one of them was, of such a character as to bind them to abide by any such orders as those so made.\nAll the municipal authorities did was to present to the power that possibly had the remedying of such a grievance as existed the facts relative to a public evil, from which some of the inhabitants of the city and others suffered.\nIt is said, however, that these orders were such as the committee, independently of any submission, had power to make by virtue of the following sections of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d:\n187. Whenever any portion of a railway is constructed, or authorized or proposed to be constructed upon or along or across any street or other public highway at rail level or otherwise, the company, before constructing or using the same, or in the case of railways already constructed, within such time as the Railway Committee directs, shall submit a plan and profile of such portion of railway for the approval of the Railway Committee; and the Railway Committee, if it appears to it expedient or necessary for the public safety, may, from time to time, with the sanction of the Governor in Council, authorize or require the company to which such railway belongs within such time as the said committee directs, to protect such street or highway by a watchman or by a watchman and gates or other protection,\u2014or to carry such street or highway either over or under the said railway by means of a bridge or arch instead of crossing the same at rail level,\u2014or to divert such street or highway either temporarily or permanently,\u2014or to execute such other works and take such other measures as under the circumstances of the case appear to the Railway Committee best adapted for removing or diminishing the. danger arising from the then position of the railway; and all the provisions of law at any such time applicable to the taking of land by such company, and to its valuation and conveyance to the company, and to the compensation thereof, shall apply to the case of any land required for the proper carrying out of the requirements of the Railway Committee under this section.\n188. The Railway Committee may make such orders and give such directions respecting such works and the execution thereof, and the apportionment of the costs thereof and of any such measures of protection, between the said company and any person interested therein, as appears to the Railway Committee just and reasonable.\nI express no opinion upon the proper interpretation to be given to these sections 187 and 188, in the adjustment of the relations between a railway company and a municipality, arising out of the construction or reconstruction of a railway at its intersection with a highway.\nBut everything necessarily incidental to the execution of the powers of Parliament in relation to the building or reconstruction of a railway I assume is provided for, and all that might be raised in such case is thus out of the question before us.\nAll that concerns us here is whether these sections authorize orders such as sued upon; and if so, whether or not the Dominion Parliament had power to so enact.\nThe use of the words \u201cpersons interested\u201d in section 188, is what the respondents rest their case upon. The word \u201cperson\u201d by virtue of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d can undoubtedly include a subject corporate and politic to whom the context can lawfully apply.\nBut does the word \u201cperson\u201d necessarily cover the cases of taxation for expenses of watchmen?\nIt appears to me that there may fall within the range of such a comprehensive section as 187 many cases of \u201cpersons interested\u201d whereby an operative effect may be given to that phrase \u201cany person interested\u201d in section 188, without extending the meaning so far as to cover the meaning presented here for our acceptance. Is it not enough to say that full effect may be given to every word of these sections without making them cover pretensions for which prim\u00e2 facie there is no foundation?\nMay not full and proper effect be given to the use here of the words, \u201cperson interested\u201d by its restriction to what is incidental to the cases of building or reconstruction? In either such case an effect is given to it. Individuals and corporations (municipal or otherwise) owning adjacent or adjoining property may need, in regard to building or reconstruction, to be so dealt with in the cases of arches, subways or diversions as to require the exercise of the power of directing costs to be shared according as their respective properties may be benefited. And in that class of cases effect would be given the words. Even the future hiring of watchmen might become a feature of the adjustment of the proprietary rights of such parties, one necessarily invading the other for purposes of construction.\nThat might give effect to every line and every letter of sections 187 and 188, but yet fall far short of supporting the pretensions needed to support these orders. Let us analyze section 187 and its several relations to section 188, and see if it clearly expresses anything more than these possible incidents of construction.\nThe company crossing\nshall submit a plan and profile, etc., and the Railway Committee if it appears to it expedient or necessary for the public safety may from time to time * * * require the company to which such railway belongs to protect such street or highway by a watchman and gates or other protection.\nThis is the first alternative for the protection of the street. In directing it the committee are pointed to the company alone, as the parties to supply watchmen and gates or other protection. It is a separate subject matter and is kept apart and dealt with as entirely different from what follows.\nIn that the section is only dealing with a crossing \u201cat rail level or otherwise.\u201d The word \u201cotherwise\u201d might possibly cover a departure from exact level by grade up or down, yet be within the same general meaning of a level crossing which may need a watchman.\nThere is nothing in this which indicates a duty on the part of any one else than the railway company, but rather the reverse.\nThere are following this subject matter others of an entirely different nature, and three other alternatives, one to carry the highway over or under the railway; another to divert the highway; and a third to execute such other works and take such other measures as appear to the committee best adapted\nfor removing or diminishing the danger arising from the then position of the railway.\nThen we come to section 188 and the committee is empowered to give such directions respecting such works and the execution thereof, and the apportionment of the costs thereof and of any such measures of protection.\nWhat work? Surely not a gate. Clearly, I would say, some of the works contemplated by the three other alternatives. And what \u201cmeasures of protection?\u201d \u201cAny such\u201d must surely be of the same class as has immediately before these words been specified; that is in the last of the three alternatives, or possibly each or any of all three.\nObviously the phrase does not grammatically relate to any measures of protection other than \u201csuch\u201d as are \u201cworks\u201d and the execution thereof.\nExcluding, as I suggest, gates from \u201csuch works\u201d as being of too trifling a nature to so designate, and as a subject apart from manifestly important works contemplated in the latter part of the section, this would be clearly so.\nIt is not necessary to go so far as to hold that this analysis makes it absolutely impossible to apply the words \u201cany such measures of protection\u201d solely to the preceding \u201csuch other works and,\u201d etc., and \u201csuch other measures as under the circumstances of the case,\u201d etc., \u201cappear,\u201d etc., and exclude the possibility of them relating to all that had gone before. It would, however, violate no canon of construction to adopt the restricted interpretation of these words, \u201cany such measures of protection\u201d in the way I suggest. And if that be done there is an end of the respondents\u2019 case.\nI am concerned, however, only to shew this, that privileges given by statute to private corporations must be restricted to what is clearly expressed, and that the remarkable concessions given by these orders, especially the last one, do not rest upon any such clear expression in this statute as the legal principle I invoke requires.\nIt is well we should clearly apprehend what is implied in the maintenance of this last order. To begin with; the statute contemplates only an apportionment of the costs,\u201d but this order directs the whole to be ultimately borne by the municipality. It takes out of the hands of the municipality the police business of protecting travellers on the streets, transfers that to a railway company, and orders the municipality to recoup the railway company thus substituted in control. In the case of this particular order no gates or works of any kind are in question.\nThe crossings in question in this order are the result of a compact between the Village of Parkdale and others concerned and the railway company.\nThis compact relieved the Great Western Railway Company of other burthensome crossings, and it does not seem as if ordinary good faith had been kept in thus shifting the consequent burthen upon the city.\nIt was necessary that the public should be protected. It undoubtedly would be within the power of Parliament to enact anything binding the railway, to take such steps as would furnish such protection. That was done by these orders in directing the erection of gates and the keeping of watchmen at the crossings.\nBut when that was done the imposition of the expenses thereof, upon the municipality, was something unnecessary and in the last analysis is but an assertion of the power of taxation not for the general public benefit, but in one of its most offensive forms, purely for the amelioration of the finances of the railway company. In the carrying on of any business there comes with increased business increased burthens in the way of discharging duties to others. It is in the way of carrying on a highly dangerous business, such as that of the respondents\u2019, natural that the increase renders the carrying of it on more and more dangerous and demands greater care and more expensive machinery to avert these necessary dangers.\nIn every other dangerous business the burthen of protecting the neighbour is cast upon those carrying on the business, and not upon the neighbour. Why should railway companies be exempted from this general rule?\nThe municipality even if it owned the adjacent property, as it probably does not, would by following this general rule be protected but not burthened.\nBut when we reflect that the municipality, in the exercise of its jurisdiction over this adjacent soil, is, amongst other things, only serving the purpose of enabling the customers of this railway company to reach its stations, to do business with it, we see less reason to create or impose upon the municipality a new duty in this regard.\nBy statute the municipality has a duty to keep in repair the road, and see that its physical condition is such that it can be travelled over.\nNo one ever dreamt of this statutory obligation extending to the extraneous dangers such as steam whistles in factories alongside of it, or the result of a train lawfully crossing it or running along it.\nNo one has ever had the temerity to invoke the law to give a remedy for losses caused by the exercise of such powers as those enjoyed by the railway or others.\nThe negligence, if any has ever been found to exist, leading to accidents, has been that of the railway company, and not of the municipality.\nI entirely dissent from the proposition put forth in argument that the fee simple of the land over which a highway has been established necessarily becomes vested in the municipality.\nIndeed, except where the municipality has expressly acquired the fee simple, which it may or may not according to the facts of each case, as incidental to the execution of its powers for opening, assuming, or in any way acquiring, a road for public use, and the cases, if any, covered by section 601 of \u201cThe Municipal Act,\u201d I think the fee simple is not vested in the municipality.\nI am unable to see how, even if it were, it could as in this case, as urged, aid respondents\u2019 position. See Mr. Biggar\u2019s valuable Municipal Manual, pp. 818 and 819, for references that settle presumptions of, and kind of, ownership of highways such as may exist in a municipality.\nAgain the appellant being a municipal corporation possesses only such powers as the \u201cMunicipal Act of Ontario\u201d has given and is subject to such liabilities as that Act expressly or impliedly imposes.\nThere is no power that I can conceive of in the Dominion Parliament to directly add to or take away from the powers of the municipality.\nIndirectly Dominion legislation, as for example, making the omission to observe a duty already existent a crime, may so operate on municipal or other corporations as apparently to conflict with this statement. On consideration there is clearly only apparent conflict. The cases of Valin v. Langlois[11] and Attorney-General v. Flint[12], at first blush suggest an analogous case under the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d conflicting with this proposition\u2014clearly distinguishable, however, I say.\nBut the courts are for the administration of justice generally, and that ought to include dealing with what flows from legislation within the proper competence of the Dominion Parliament. And in the latter case I cite the then Mr. Justice, now Sir Henry Strong, was careful to say that the court might not be compellable to act though it could if Parliament chose to authorize it.\nCan it be said that the protection of the public in relation to the running of a railway rendered it necessary or reasonably necessary to make such orders as those now in question? Necessity may in any case warrant Parliament going far to execute its powers.\nBut I cannot find such necessity, either reasonable or unreasonable, for the part of the order requiring the municipality to refund the railway company expenses incurred in the course of its business.\nPublic convenience or expediency in themselves, without necessity, cannot justify Parliament stretching its supposed authority.\nAnd clearly, where it would as here be quite competent for the legislature to so reduce or abolish the taxing power of any municipality that in no way could Parliament reach them pecuniarily, it is difficult to support a proposal for Parliament to direct levying of rates on such a body.\nThe province has always paid part of the municipal expenses and might if its revenue sufficed go a step further and pay all. To illustrate, further, turn to the plenary powers of Parliament in relation to banks and banking; navigation and shipping; beacons, buoys and light houses; and we can, without difficulty, find as good, if not better, reasons for protecting, in one case by police protection, the banking institutions or, in the others, the travelling public by directing a guarding of the harbour, so as to make it safe for ingress and egress of vessels, and in giving facilities for landing passengers and freight; and by keeping the lights burning to shew the way to the traveller or passing ship.\nWould it be competent for Parliament to cast the burthen of these expenses, or any of them in any one of those several cases, upon the municipality most concerned?\nIt seems to me as if there would be no greater stretch of authority in doing so than we have now under consideration, whenever we go in any one of them, beyond the boundary line of reasonable necessity.\nSuch I conceive the way in which we must approach the consideration of such a question, when, if ever, it becomes necessary to determine as I do not presume to do the limits in this regard of the power of Parliament.\nWhat I am concerned with here is to point out the probably grave consequence of raising such extreme pretensions of power, and the improbability that such an issue was ever intended to be raised, or is raised by the words of the sections I have quoted.\nI think when we get thus to the very root and essence of the matter we are impelled to say Parliament can never have intended, and ought not to be held to have intended, by any such enactment as section 188 of the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d to have conferred on a body constituted for other purposes than imposing local taxation, or enacting police protection, the power to do so, in a case quite unnecessary for the full execution of the powers conferred by the \u201cBritish North America Act.\u201d\nWould Parliament ever have ventured, by virtue of the powers it is given by that Act, to have enacted by express words that each municipality through which a railway runs, and therein crosses streets or roads of the municipality, should protect and pay for the protection of the crossings by an annual rate sufficient for the purpose?\nIf it could do this, why not enact that the railway should be free from taxation?\nWe have had a case presented to this court (I refer to the cases of the Municipality of North Cypress v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[13]), which raised the issue in a different form. That such a question as raised in the last mentioned cases should be thought arguable shews how far beyond Parliament the power of exempting from taxation is generally held to be in the older provinces, that did not get their powers from the Dominion.\nThe converse power to impose a tax is just as far and none the less because indirect.\nConceding to the full that the proprietary rights and all other powers or rights of a municipality must bend before the proper execution of the will of Parliament within its powers, does not uphold the pretension to add to the taxing power of the municipality beyond what the legislature has defined or may define. The possession or the right of the municipality may be invaded, but its limits of the power of taxation cannot be increased by Parliament. Public convenience or protection would, if any basis to rest upon, which I deny, enable the extension of such powers as here asserted to the erection of railway stations and their lighting and policing as within the power.\nThe provisions in the statutes that preceded that now under consideration are, on this point of the relation of the municipal and railway authorities, instructive, both as to the condition of things at the time of confederation, and to see how before that time railway corporations, including respondents, were supposed to be the servants of the public, but since then their growth in wealth has been accompanied apparently (if we contrast these orders with penalizing power on same subject formerly in power of municipality) by a progressive and aggressive attitude compared with that of the ancient times. See 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, secs. 12 and 13; \u201cThe Consolidated Statutes of Canada,\u201d 22 Vict. ch. 66, secs. 12 and 141; 31 Vict. ch. 68, secs. 10, 36 and 37; 42 Vict. ch. 9, secs. 15, 48 and 49; 47 Vict. ch. 11, secs. 3 and 10; 49 Vict. ch. 109, secs. 12 and 48, 183 to 186.\nWe should not lose sight of these former times, as the standard of thought prevailing when the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d was passed, and in the light of which we ought to interpret that legislation, which though in form the work of the Imperial Parliament, was but the reflection of what Canadians desired. That habit of thought must be considered if correct interpretation is to be had.\nI am of the opinion that the municipal corporation is not a \u201cperson interested\u201d in the sense necessary to support these orders for repayment to the company of the expenses indicated.\nAnd if none of the interpretations I have suggested in regard to these words be tenable I am, for the reasons already indicated, of opinion that (in the sense required to uphold these orders) they are ultra vires of Parliament.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the action be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.C.

The lease provided that in case of a temporary stoppage in the supply caused by repairs or alterations in the canal system the lessee would not be entitled to compensation unless the same continued for six months, and then only to an abatement of rent.\nHeld, Idington J. dubitante, that a stoppage of the supply for two whole seasons necessarily and bond fide caused by alterations in the system was a temporary stoppage under this provision.\nThe lease also provided that, in case the flow of surplus water should at any time be required for the use of the canal or any public purpose whatever, the Crown could, on giving notice to the lessee, cancel the lease in which case the lessee should be entitled to be paid the value of all the buildings and fixtures thereon belonging to him with ten per cent, added thereto. The Crown unwatered the canal in order to execute works for its enlargement and improvement, contemplating at the time only a temporary stoppage of the supply of water to the lessee, but later changes were made in the proposed work which caused a total stoppage and the lessee, by petition of right, claimed damages.\nHeld, Girouard J. dissenting, that as the Crown had not given notice of its intention to cancel the lease the lessee was not entitled to the damages provided for in case of cancellation.\nHeld, also, that the lessee was not entitled to damages for loss of profits during the time his mill was idle owing to the water being out of the canal.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (9 Ex. C.R. 287) affirmed, Girouard and Idington JJ. dissenting. Appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] allowing the suppliant $20,000 damages for loss of water-power formerly supplied under lease from the Crown.\nThe suppliant was the assignee of a lease of land near the canal known as the \"Galops Canal.\" The lease is dated the 16th December, 1871, and was assigned to the suppliant in 1883. It was made for a term of twenty-one years, renewable in perpetuity for like terms, subject, at the termination of each term, to a revision of the yearly rent, and constituted a demise of a portion of the canal reserve on which the suppliant erected a flour mill. With the lands demised was granted the use and enjoyment of so much of the surplus water of the canal as should be sufficient to drive and propel, by means of the most approved description of wheel, four runs or ordinary mill-stones equal to ten horse-power for each run. The water was supplied from the canal at a point above what was known as Lock number 25, and was carried to the mill by a flume or raceway constructed by the lessee at his own expense.\nProvision was made by the lease for interruption to the supply as follows:\n\"Secondly.\u2014That in the event of the temporary stoppage of the flow or supply of surplus water, or a portion thereof, hereby leased, by reason of the same being required for the navigation of the said canal, or by reason of repairs, improvements, or alterations being, by the said minister or his successors in office, or his officers in that behalf, deemed necessary or desirable to be made to the same, or for the purpose of preventing damage to the said canal, by means of extreme high water, or by frost or ice, or any other uncontrollable cause or accident, no abatement of rent shall be claimed or allowed, nor the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, have or pretend to have any right to any compensation whatever, on account of the injury or damage that such stoppage of the flow or supply of surplus water may occasion\u2014save and except only in the event of the total stoppage of the said flow or supply of surplus water for and during an uninterrupted period of six calendar months, during the usual navigation season, in which case the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, shall be allowed and obtain, in full compensation for the same, and for any loss or damage that they may thereby sustain, an abatement of six calendar months' rent accruing for any and every such period of continuous interruption in the flow or supply of surplus water hereby leased as aforesaid.\"\nPower was also reserved by the said lease to the Minister of Public Works, on behalf of the Crown, to determine the lease of the said lot and flow of surplus water, or any part thereof, on reasonable notice, namely:\n\"Provided always, that if at any time hereafter it shall be determined by the said Minister of Public Works, or his successors in office, that the said lot and flow of surplus water, or any part thereof, are or is required for the use of the said canal, or for any public purpose whatever, thereupon, on reasonable notice (of not less than three calendar months) being given to the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, by the said minister or his successors, to that effect, this lease or the lease for the term then current, and all matters herein or therein contained, shall cease and be void, and the said minister, or his successors in office, shall pay or cause to be paid unto the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the then value (with an addition of ten per cent, thereon), of all the buildings and fixtures that shall be thereon erected and belonging to the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, according to a valuation thereof to be made by arbitrators, one of whom to be chosen by the said minister or his successors as aforesaid, another by the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and the third by the said arbitrators so nominated as aforesaid before entering on their said arbitration, and the decision of the said arbitrators, or of a majority of them, shall be final.\"\nIn 1898 the Minister of Railways and Canals projected certain works for the enlargement and improvement of the canal upon which the appellant's mill was situated, and these works involved, in the immediate vicinity of the appellant's mill, the construction of what was practically a new canal prism, replacing a portion of the old canal prism from which the power from the surplus water had been supplied under the lease of 1871.\nOn the 12th December, 1898, the old canal, at the point from which the power of the appellant's mill was taken by his flume from the canal to his mill premises, was unwatered to facilitate the construction of the projected works, the unwatering being done by the contractors employed by the minister for the construction of the projected works. The result of the unwatering was, of course, to shut off completely the power from the appellant's mill.\nIt was not immediately apparent that the stoppage was to be permanent, and it would seem likely that the old supply might have been resumed, after the completion of the projected works, but for an alteration in the character and scope of these works determined upon after the date of the unwatering. In the result the works as constructed were quite incompatible with a continuance of the supply of power, subject of the demise, the appellant's flume and raceway being destroyed and his mill being completely deprived of the supply of water granted by the lease of 1871.\nMuch negotiation took place between the appellant and the minister and those representing him during the progress of the work, the appellant being desirous, from the time when it became apparent that the construction of the new works would take away his old supply of power, of obtaining from the Crown a lease or grant of such power as might be developed from the new works, having in view the establishment of an electric power plant for commercial purposes, as an incident of which his mill might have been supplied with electric power.\nAs the result of these negotiations the appellant finally obtained a lease of power from the surplus water passing through the new works to the extent of 200 horse power, this lease, however, as has been determined by the learned judge, not affecting in any way the assertion of his rights under the old lease.\nThe petition of right presented by the appellant was based upon the obligation of the Crown created by the demise of 1871, in respect of the supply of water, subject to that demise. It was not disputed on behalf of the Crown that the appellant was entitled to damages, but the measure and extent of those damages was contested. Shepley K.C. and Hilliard, for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014I think that the last paragraph of clause 6 of the lease disposes of this case. It says:\nProvided always, that if at any time hereafter it shall be determined by the said Minister of Public Works or his successors in office, that the said lot and flow of surplus water, or any parti thereof, are or is required for the use of the said canal, or for any public purpose whatever, thereupon, on reasonable notice (of not less than three calendar months), being given to the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, by the said minister or his successors to that effect, this lease, or the lease for the term then current, and all matters herein or therein contained, shall cease and be void, and the said minister or his successors in office shall pay or cause to be paid unto the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, the then value (with an addition of ten per cent, thereon) of all the buildings and fixtures that shall be thereon erected and belonging to the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, according to a valuation thereof to be made by arbitrators one of whom to be chosen by the said minister or his successors as aforesaid, another by the said lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and the third by the said arbitrators so nominated as aforesaid before entering on their said arbitration, and the decision of the said arbitrators, or of a majority of them, shall be final.\nIt is contended that this clause was introduced into the lease in the interest of the Crown to secure the right to resume possession of the leased premises on giving notice to the tenant. This is true, but only in a limited sense. Suppose the Crown resumes possession of the whole property leased without giving notice. Undoubtedly in such a case the tenant would be entitled to full indemnity as provided in that clause, the notice required being presumed to have been waived. How a different rule can be applied in the case of only partial possession is more than I can understand, as the clause puts partial eviction upon the basis of a total one. The clause is in the interest of both parties.\nIt is admitted that the minister determined that the flow of surplus water in question in this cause was required for the use of the canal, or at least for a public purpose. Then, if I understand the case well, the above clause of the lease comes in and provides for the termination of the same and for the payment of the indemnity due to the lessee. I cannot understand how the Crown by its own default can avoid this consequence, namely, by not giving the notice of three months mentioned in the clause, a notice which evidently was required more in the interest of the lessee than of the lessor. I cannot see how the Crown can prevent the lessee from recovering the value of his buildings and fixtures. Mr. Chrysler K.C. has conceded that that value was about $45,000, and I am not prepared to say that the estimation of $50,000 made by the appellant is exaggerated. I am, therefore, of opinion that the appellant should get this value, plus 10 per cent. and interest thereon since the supply of water was stopped, namely, since the 12th December, 1898, and all costs, and that this action should be dismissed as to any other claims or damages.\nIt has been objected that the action as brought does not justify this conclusion. To avoid future litigation and render full justice to both parties I would permit an amendment, if necessary, to the statement of claim in the terms of the reply of the suppliant. The respondent cannot allege that he is taken by surprise, or even that he is injured. In his statement of defence he sets up the above paragraph of the lease and prays\nthat the damage should be determined on the provisions of the said lease above recited in reference to the determination of the lease, and that the said lease should be cancelled.\nI think this prayer of the statement of defence should be granted on payment of the damages as stipulated in the lease, and established in the case, namely, the value of the buildings and fixtures, plus 10 per cent, thereon. I have the less hesitation in coming to this conclusion, which seems to me to be fair and just between the parties, that the suppliant in his reply to the statement of defence finally says,\nthat he has always been and still is ready and willing, and he hereby offers to agree that, without prejudice to his claim for recovery of damages herein and not in any way waiving the same, the said lease be now cancelled on the suppliant being paid the value of the said buildings and fixtures to be ascertained by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the said instrument.\nAs to the above reservation made by the appellant of his claim for recovery of damages beyond the value of the said buildings and fixtures and 10 per cent., I believe that he cannot set up any such claim. The question is not what profits the suppliant has lost, but whether he has been permanently deprived of his water-power. There is no doubt as to this and he can claim no larger indemnity than is provided for in the contract, that is the value of his expenditure and 10 per cent. thereon in addition. This 10 per cent, represents all the profits and other damages which he may have suffered, but he cannot claim more.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs, cancel the lease, order a valuation of the said buildings and fixtures by arbitration in accordance with the said provisions of the lease, and condemn the respondent to pay the amount found by the arbitrators, and ten per cent, in addition, unless both parties agree to accept $50,000, plus ten per cent., that is altogether $55,000, in full of all claims, with interest in either case from the 12th December, 1898, and all costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by the suppliant in the Exchequer Court against the Crown for damages because of the permanent withdrawal from his mill of certain water-power which the suppliant claimed to be entitled to under a lease from the Crown. The lease was made in 1871 for a term of years renewable in perpetuity for like terms subject at the termination of each term to a revision of the yearly rent, and demised a portion of the canal reserve on which the suppliant had erected a flour mill. With the lands demised was granted the use and enjoyment of so much of the surplus water of the canal as should be sufficient to drive four runs of ordinary mill-stones equal to ten horse-power for each run.\nThe lease contained several important clauses, providing for the stoppage of the supply of surplus water under specified circumstances relating to the navigation, repair, alteration or improvement of the canal by the Government, and that in such cases, if the stoppage was temporary, the lessee was neither to be entitled to abatement of his rent or compensation in damages, but that if the stoppage was total for\nan uninterrupted period of six calendar months during the usual navigation season (the lessees were to be allowed) in full compensation for the same and for any loss or damage they may thereby sustain an abatement of six calendar months rent accruing for any and every such period of continuous interruption.\nThe lease contained another most important pro vision stipulating that if at any time the Minister of Public Works determined that the leased lot of land and the surplus water or any part thereof were required for the use of the canal he could upon giving the lessee reasonable notice cancel the lease and pay the lessee the then value, with 10 per cent. added, of the buildings and fixtures thereon according to a value to be fixed by arbitration as provided.\nNo notice ever was given by the minister under this proviso and I agree with the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that it cannot be invoked in this case.\nThe Government having determined upon some important changes and alterations in the canal system it became necessary to unwater that part of the canal from which the suppliant's mill received its supply of the surplus water.\nAs a consequence such supply ceased and was totally stopped for one or more seasons.\nUnder the terms of the lease this stoppage of water-power, though it resulted also in the stoppage of the mill and of suppliant's business there, was perfectly legal being in accordance with the express terms of the lease. Whether the total stoppage of surplus water lasted one entire season of navigation or several did not matter so long as it occurred bond fide and fairly from any of the causes or for any of the purposes and objects stipulated. It gave rise to no claim on suppliant's part for damages, but it entitled him to an abatement of his rent.\nThere came a time, however, when, as admitted by the counsel for the Crown, the total stoppage of water ceased to be justified under the provisions of the lease and the Crown became liable to the lessee for damages.\nThe trial judge awarded the suppliant $20,000 damages and in this judgment the Crown acquiesced by not appealing. The suppliant alone appealed and the question here is limited to the adequacy of the damages awarded. The contention on the part of the suppliant was that the judgment appealed from was wrong in excluding from the assessment of damages the claim made by the suppliant for the loss of profits in his business from the time of the unwatering till the time when he ought properly to have provided other means than the water provided, and also in allowing inadequate damages on the two other grounds of his claim, namely, the cost of installing new methods and providing the 40 horse-power and the excess in the cost of maintaining such new power.\nI am of the opinion, for the reasons given by Burbidge J., that he was right under the circumstances in excluding the claim for profit submitted by the suppliant, and I am further of the opinion that there was an entire absence of any proper evidence on which damages under this head could have been assessed.\nOn the other two grounds I think the damages allowed were not only ample, but generous. The Crown has not appealed and I, therefore, say nothing more on that head.\nI am of the opinion that where lands are injuriously affected by a public work or undertaking the proper measure of damages is the difference between the value of the lands or property affected before and after and as the result of the injury.\nThe difficulties of applying such a rule to the facts of this case are obvious. The supply of water granted by the lease was only the surplus water not required for canal purposes and the express stipulation for its total stoppage for entire seasons consecutive or otherwise, when improvements, alterations or repairs were being made in the canal system, without any right to damages and compensated for entirely by abatement in rent, rendered the application of the simple rule suggested by no means easy, and necessarily would leave very much to the discretionary judgment of the trial judge. The rule adopted by him was obviously one entirely in favour of the suppliant as it seemed to ignore the contingent nature of his right to the surplus water and treated such right as an absolute one, allowing him as damages what it would cost to install electric power equivalent to the horse-power which he was entitled to from the surplus water, and as if the later right was an absolute right.\nAt any rate the rule for measuring the damages adopted by the trial judge had not been objected to by the Crown, and as it was entirely in the suppliant's favour he did not object.\nHis objections were limited to the exclusion of the alleged business profits and to the inadequacy of the damages awarded on the other heads. His appeal is based upon these objections alone, and as I have shewn should fail on both.\nThe Crown not having appealed must be taken to be satisfied alike with the rules for measuring the damages adopted and with the result considering most probably that the learned judge in applying the rule be adopted did take into his consideration the contingent character of the suppliant's right to the surplus water.\nBeing of the opinion that the damages awarded were, to say the least, fully adequate, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is assignee of a lease, renewable in perpetuity, from the Crown, of certain land adjacent to the Williamsburg Canal. On this land there was and still is erected a flour-mill, which was driven by surplus water from the canal, and the lease gave the lessees the use of such water-power for that purpose.\nThe respondent, by his minister, for the purposes of improving the canal made such alterations as to deprive the appellant of the use of this water in the manner specified in the lease, and provided by the appliances, giving effective use of said water.\nBy the lease, as I interpret the same, it was provided that the Minister of Public Works could for the temporary purposes of repairs, improvements or alterations, enter and make same, without the lessee becoming entitled to abatement of rent, or compensation unless there should ensue a\ntotal stoppage of the said flow or supply of surplus water for and during an uninterrupted period of six calendar months during the usual navigation season.\nIn such event the lessee was to become entitled to be allowed in full compensation for such stoppage an abatement of\nsix months' rent accruing for any and every such period of continuous interruption, in the flow or supply of surplus water.\nIn the course of the making of the alterations now in question, there was a change of plans that involved, in carrying the same into execution, a somewhat longer continuous total stoppage of water supply than this lease provided for, or made compensation for, in respect of the same.\nThere was a time, however, when it became quite apparent to every one concerned that the execution of the works, according to the plans finally adopted, would deprive the lessee for all time of the use of such water.\nThere was contained in the lease a provision anticipating some such event as a possible necessity.\nThat provision gave the Minister of Public Works the right, upon reasonable notice (not less than three months) to the lessee, to determine the lease, and thereupon pay the lessee the then value (with an addition of ten per cent. thereon) of all the buildings and fixtures that should be on said lands erected and belong to the lessee, according to a valuation to be made by arbitrators.\nAs the minister never availed himself of this power, that provision is out of the questions now to be considered.\nIt was contended that the minister's acts in the premises were each and all such as the \"Expropriation Act\" (52 Vict. ch. 13) entitled him to do, and gave a means of providing compensation for those damnified by such acts.\nThe express reservation in this lease of the right to determine the lease, and compensate the lessee, may have been intended to be in substitution of any such methods, and as the only means the Crown should have in the event of any such expropriation becoming necessary in the public interest.\nUnless the case of Saunby v. The Water Commissioners of the City of London[2] is applicable to the \"Expropriation Act,\" which I think doubtful, or the provision in question takes the case out of the Act, the case of Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Ry. Co. v. Anderson[3] would seem to indicate that the lessor and lessee here are in the same position as the parties there. It was sought there to raise an action on the covenant for quiet enjoyment, and it failed because, though the covenant existed and but for the Act there relied on would have been broken, the company were within the power of the Act to expropriate, and compensation had to rest upon the Act.\nThe appellant from whatever causes seems to have yielded, so far, to the desires of the minister and his officers, and so far acquiesced therein, as to render their acts of such a character as probably to make the measure of damages substantially the same (save possibly in regard to the question of interest), whether assessed under the Act or for breach of the demise, and all implied therein.\nThe learned trial judge indicates his opinion to be that the \"Expropriation Act\" is applicable, but expressly says that he considers the result must be the same in treating the case as resting upon that Act or on breach of contract save as to interest and he allows that.\nThere can, therefore, be no reason to complain of any ill results from his holding, in this regard.\nIn suggesting these several questions, and pointing out the considerations they give rise to, I desire to be held as coming to no absolute conclusion on any of them. It is unnecessary just now. It may become necessary yet to consider them in different light from that now presented here.\nWhen, however, the learned trial judge comes to assess the damages, he disposes of the matter as follows:\nI do not pretend to think that such damages can in any case be measured with any great precision or exactness. There is always room for considerable difference of opinion. But taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, the change that was made from the first design of the work in question, the way that change came to be made, the object aimed at in making it, and the giving of a new lease of power to the suppliant for the purpose of manufacturing and selling electric power, the fair way to ascertain the damages would be, it seems to me, to take the cost of developing in that way two hundred horse-power and add thereto a reasonable profit, and then see at what annual cost the suppliant's mill might in that way be supplied with forty horse-power for the purpose of operating it. Then there should also be added an allowance sufficient to indemnify the suppliant for the cost of making any necessary changes in the machinery at his mill, and to cover the increased annual cost of operating the mill by electricity instead of by water-power. From the best consideration I have been able to give to the matter I have come to the conclusion that the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) paid to the suppliant in May, 1901, when the water in the basin above the weir was available for developing power, would have been a full indemnity and compensation for all damages to which he is in any way entitled in the premises.\nIt is to be observed that the parties had agreed that the learned trial judge should dispose of the entire damages and save future actions, if by any chance such might have existed in law, and that such possible actions would be barred thereby.\nThe consent appears on pages 215 and 216 of the case as follows:\nWith reference to some statements made in the opening of the case as to the assessment of damages down to the date of the filing of the petition, and a declaration of the rights of the parties, counsel for both parties are now agreed that the damages should be assessed once and for all, you can add at the same time, not being agreed upon, the principle upon which they should be assessed, but that they are agreed that the damages should be assessed once and for all, and to be an end of the litigation in regard to the matter. That is what I understand to be the position of both parties now, and that is to be entered at the conclusion of the case. Then I think all we have said here need not be extended upon the notes unless you wish.\nKeeping in view this consent and giving to it the widest operation, I am unable to adopt, as elements for consideration in assessing damages here, several factors which obviously enter into the consideration of the learned trial judge in arriving at the result I have just quoted. The change that was made from the first design, the way the change came to be made, the object aimed at in making it, the giving of a new lease of power to the suppliant for the purpose of manufacturing and selling electric power, are all things that should have been left aside. The suppliant may or may not have acquiesced in and been a party to these changes of design and all else that I thus object to, and his acquiescence therein may be a fair matter for consideration when the court comes to deal with the delay in operating the mill and loss of profits by reason of such delay. It cannot enter into, and ought not have been made to appear as having entered into, the contemplation of the learned trial judge when assessing damages for the total deprivation of the forty horse-power the suppliant had a right under the lease to enjoy.\nThe giving of a new lease stands entirely as a separate transaction. It was conceded in argument that it could not be taken by operation of law to have superseded the rights under the old lease or to have created a surrender in law of the old lease.\nOnce it is conceded that these leases are independent transactions, each in force, I cannot comprehend how in law the giving or withholding, if it had been withheld, the second lease, could have anything to do with the assessment of damages for some invasion of the suppliant's rights under the first lease.\nHaving regard to what the learned judge had said, immediately before what I have quoted, it may be that these objectionable elements in truth did not enter into the results he arrived at in assessing the damages, further than to remove any impression of a highhanded wrong having been committed which might have under other circumstances been considered in the way of inflating the damages. However that may be it is unfortunate to have all these factors blended together in the unlimited way in which they are expressed in the paragraph I have just quoted.\nPassing by these possible elements of error in the judgment appealed from, is the proper measure of damages for such a case as this\nto take the cost of developing, in the way the second lease provides, two hundred horse-power and adding thereto a reasonable profit, and then, etc.,\nas above expressed?\nIf I am right in thinking that the two leases and the rights under each lease must be kept for the purpose of assessing damages on anything arising out of the old lease separate and entirely free from anything arising out of the granting of the second lease, the accidental or incidental result of the business relations of the parties concerned, apart from and having no relation to the first lease, ought, I submit with great respect, to have been rigorously excluded from any consideration.\nI say ought to have been rigorously excluded, because in law and in fact they were entirely independent and separate transactions, and by reason of their proximity in point of time and place one is apt to allow the mind improperly to be affected in considering the one by considerations arising from what has taken place under the other, which in law must be excluded. But has there not been an entire misapprehension, not only on the part of the learned trial judge but also on the part of the litigants, in regard to the principles to be applied to measure the damages naturally flowing from the act of the respondent in depriving the suppliant permanently of the necessary water-power to drive his mill? Is it not a case where the proper measure of damages is the diminished value of the property or of the plaintiff's interest in it, and not the sum which it would take to restore it to its original state?\nIt seems to me obviously pregnant with error to lay down any other rule. For, follow up the principle that has been applied, where are we to stop?\nSome of the speculations of future possibilities were wide of the mark, but were in line of the principle contended for by the suppliant as the proper measure of his damages and in great part have been acceded to by the court below.\nI may not, therefore, be right in giving him such consideration as I do in holding that an award of damages, based upon erroneous principles ought to be set aside.\nThere was no obligation on the part of the Crown to restore this mill or this water-power.\nThe water-power was destroyed, necessarily destroyed, as an accident in carrying out a public work. The execution of the work led to the deprivation, and in light of this lease the wrongful deprivation, of the plaintiff of his property., and the Crown was and is bound to answer for such damages as are the result of a diminution of the value of the property and just to the extent of that diminution in value. See Jones v. Gooday[4]; Hosking v. Phillips[5]; Whitham v. Kershaw[6]; Rolph v. Crouch[7]; Child v. Stenning[8].\nSo many misleading elements, leading to great misapprehensions of the actual damage done, are likely to arise from approaching the question on the basis of a restoration of power, that I think it ought to be discarded, and the simple question of the diminution of value be alone kept in view; however that may by the valuers be arrived at, but never necessarily, upon the basis of a new acquisition of power, equal to that lost by what has been done.\nThose valuing should value as of the date when it became known to the appellant that he had lost forever the supply of power granted by the lease.\nOf course, if the valuators think new power an element worth considering, the time to be taken for acquiring that will affect the valuation they place upon the property as it was at the time the power was off forever.\nIf the claim for damages should rest upon the \"Expropriation Act,\" how the market value would be affected would be the test. See Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[9], at p. 253.\nAs to the time lost during the negotiations, it would seem as if the appellant had not pressed his claim in such a way as to indicate he had much right to complain.\nIt seems to me that this phase of the case has been so grouped with the other that it is quite impossible satisfactorily to indicate on this appeal what should be done in relation to any claim the appellant may have.\nI am quite sure the provision in the lease for compensation for periods of six months' total stoppage may, indeed must, apply to successive periods of navigation seasons.\nBut when these come to be so joined together as to make one continuous period far exceeding the period provided for, I doubt whether such a case has been covered by the provision.\nThe trouble I see here is that much of what was done and much of the time lost in running the mill was or may have been the result of agreement between the parties; as when the suppliant assented, relying upon what one of the officers of the department told him, and thereby an agreement was arrived at; or at another time the result of acquiescence, based upon the hopes, possibly founded upon the acts of such officers, or on the bare desires of the suppliant to acquire the other lease, and such desire restraining him from complaint, to such an extent as to justify the representatives of the Crown in assuming that he was satisfied, and so acquiescent as to forbid him making in future any claim for damages. In each of these cases there would be no damages allowed.\nThen, was there ever a continuous period of total stoppage exceeding six months that was wholly free from complication with either of these two causes I have just adverted to?\nIf such there be found, and purely in invitum of the suppliant, on the part of the officers of the Crown, then so much of such a period as exceeded any such six months as I indicate, ought, I think, to be considered as giving a right to damages.\nAs to the measure of those, needless to say they must be based on what would be reasonable, and not on some of the extreme views put forward by the suppliant, based on what may have been an accidental run for forty lucky days.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the case go back for re-trial, or re-consideration. MACLENNAN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the suppliant in a petition of right from a judgment of the Exchequer Court, and the ground of appeal is that the judgment fails to award him adequate damages for land injuriously affected by certain public works constructed by the Government of Canada.\nSome question was made as to the nature of the claim, whether it rested upon covenant, or upon the statutory liability to compensation for land injuriously affected. I think it is clear that the claim must be rested upon the statutory liability. The lease contains a demise of a parcel of land and also of an easement of a certain supply of water, from a canal which is Crown property.\nThe Crown has taken no part of the demised land and has made no entry upon it. What it has done has been done upon the Crown's own land, the effect of which has been to destroy the easement which was demised. In such a case no notice or other formality is prescribed by the statutes in order to. make the injurious act lawful, as was required in Saunby v. The Water Commissioners of London[10] lately before the Judicial Committee. If the destruction of the suppliant's easement had been wanton or unnecessary, or done otherwise than in the execution of a public work, or for the public use, or without statutory authority, then an action would have lain on the covenant for quiet enjoyment implied by law by reason of the use of the word demise. But the public statutes, having authorized the Crown to do what it did, made it lawful to commit a breach of its covenant, whereby the breach became innocent in law, and not actionable.\nThe claim of the suppliant must, therefore, be rested on the compensation provided by the statute, and that is a claim for injury to the suppliant's land, that is to his leasehold.\nI agree with the learned judge's conclusion that until the 29th May, 1901, the cutting off of the water was temporary within the meaning of the lease; and for the injury before that day the provisions of the lease exempted the Crown from liability, except for six months during the season of navigation, and in that case limited it to six months' rent. On the day named the stoppage of the water became permanent, and on that day the injury to the suppliant's leasehold term became complete, and his right to compensation arose.\nI think the learned judge was bound to assess the suppliant's damages just as he would have assessed them on that day. If on the following day the mill and machinery had been destroyed by fire or tempest, or if the adjacent river had overflowed its banks and had swept away, not only the suppliant's buildings, but the very land itself comprised in the lease, the suppliant's damages and compensation due from the Crown must have been the same.\nThat consideration at once excludes profits, as such, as an item of damage. The fact that the business carried on had been profitable, no doubt, is proper to be considered in comparing the value of the leasehold before and after the injury; but the question is how much less valuable the suppliant's property was after the injury, than it was before\u2014for how much less would it sell in the market, having regard to the terms of the lease. Ricket v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[11]; Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[12]; Cripps on Compensation (5 ed.), 144-7. In determining that question, too, the proviso contained in the lease enabling the Crown to terminate the lease at any time, if the land or any part thereof should be required for the canal or any public purpose, on payment of the then value, with an addition of ten per cent., of all the buildings and fixtures thereon, belonging to the lessee, would be proper to be considered. The learned judge has found upon the evidence that the buildings and fixtures may be taken to have been worth $50,000 and that seems to be the fair effect of the evidence, therefore, the whole property was in effect by the terms of the lease under an option of purchase to the Crown for $50,000, plus ten per cent.\nWith that option held by the Crown and the liability to temporary interruption of the supply of water, practically without compensation, it may be a question for how much, if anything, more than $55,000, the property could have been sold, just before the permanent cutting off of the water.\nThen how is the depreciation to be estimated?\nI think the learned judge was bound to look at all the surrounding circumstances in order to come to a just conclusion. That the mill was not rendered permanently useless or valueless was clear enough. It could be operated by steam. The suppliant had done that for a year or more, not to its full capacity, it is true, but sufficiently to shew that operation in that way was possible. Then it could also be operated by electricity, and the necessary power for producing electricity was now available, and in the hands of the suppliant himself. The suppliant had a high opinion of the value of the new concession of power granted to him, five times as much as he had under the old lease, and while he desired and expected a much larger amount of power, he was eager to accept the 400 horse-power which he received, and it is manifest that he had in mind using it for his mill. Of course he is not bound so to use it. Nevertheless its existence, and probable availability, would not be disregarded by any intending purchaser of the dis-watered mill.\nLooking at all the circumstances, as stated in his very elaborate judgment, the learned judge came to the conclusion that the amount of damages proper to be awarded to the suppliant is the sum of $20,000, and he has awarded interest on that sum from the 29th May, 1901, the date on which the water was cut off permanently. The Crown does not appeal, and the question which we have to consider is whether or not the appellant has satisfied us by his evidence that a larger sum should have been awarded.\nI have gone over the evidence both oral and documentary with great care, and I am unable to see any evidence on which we would be warranted in increasing the amount of the judgment.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The \"Albano,\" a German steamship for the same port, approached some miles to the eastward, sailing first, by error, to the north-east, and then changing her course to the south-west, apparently making for the eastern passage to the harbour. She again altered her course, however, and came almost due west towards the pilot station. When about a quarter of a mile from the \"Parisian\" she slowed down, and on coming within eight or nine ship's lengths gave three blasts of her whistle, indicating that she would go full speed astern. The \"Parisian\" then, seeing that a collision was inevitable, went full speed ahead for about 200 feet when she was struck on the starboard quarter and had to make for the dock to avoid sinking outside. The '\"Parisian's\" engines were stopped about six minutes before the collision, and a boat from the pilot cutter was rowing up to her when she was struck. At the time of the collision, about 5 p.m., the wind was light, weather fine and clear, there was no sea running and no perceptible tide.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the local judge that the captain of the \"Albano\" had no right to regard the \"Parisian\" as a crossing ship within the meaning of rule 19 of the Admiralty Rules, 1897; and that the \"Parisian\" having properly stopped to take a pilot on board, and being practically in the act of doing so at the time, the \"Albano\" was bound to avoid her and was alone to blame for the collision. Appeals from judgments of the local judge of the Nova Scotia Admiralty District in favour of the respondents.\nThe collision in question occurred on 25th March, 1905, near Chebucto Head, at the entrance to Halifax Harbour, for which both vessels were bound, coming in from the sea. Cross actions were brought by the owners, The Allan Line Steamship Company seeking to recover damages sustained by their vessel, the \"Parisian,\" against the \"Albano\" and the Union Dampfchiffs Rhereri Actiengesellsschaft, owners of the \"Albano,\" to recover damages against the \"Parisian.\" The local Judge, in deciding that the \"Albano\" was alone to blame described the situation at the time of the collision as follows:\u2014\n\"These vessels were both coming in from sea and both bound for Halifax, when the collision occurred. The charts put in evidence on the trial indicate the positions of the respective ships when they sighted each other and the course respectively taken by them till the accident occurred. There is a pilot station at or near Chebucto Head, and both vessels were, previous to the collision, making for the pilot station with the view of procuring a pilot into the port of Halifax, and the collision occurred when the 'Parisian' had stopped at this station and while the pilot was approaching the ship to board her.\n\"Captain Johnson, the master of the 'Parisian,' in his evidence says: 'It was about 4.30, I think, in the afternoon when I saw the land about Chebucto Head or Sambro and at the same time I saw smoke to the eastward close to the north-eastern land. I was on the bridge, and had been there for some time before. About 4.45 p.m. I made it out to be smoke from a steamer, and I think then she bore north or north by east. I did not take the bearings as she was too far off, but I could see her from the bridge. She was to the north of us. I could see the whole beam of the ship when I first saw her. I did not see her again till she was coming right down on us full speed right straight for the funnel of the ship. The \"Parisian\" was at this time stopped.'\n\"As the 'Albano' approached she blew three blasts of her whistle which, it appears, indicated that her engines were put full speed astern. This, it appears from the other parts of the evidence, took place about two minutes before the collision took place. It appeared to be disputed by the witnesses for the 'Parisian' that the 'Albano's' engines were reversed at all, but while I am disposed to think that the engines were reversed shortly before the actual collision, I am satisfied it was done top late to be effective, even in lessening the force of the impact of the striking ship. According to the evidence of the captain of the 'Parisian,' perceiving this collision was inevitable and that his ship would be struck about amidships, he went full speed ahead, which moved the 'Parisian' forward about two hundred feet with the result, as the evidence shews, that the ship was struck further aft and, as the 'Parisian' claims, this saved the ship and probably the lives of the passengers on board.\"\nThe manner in which the vessels were being navigated \"immediately prior to the collision is described in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nThe nautical assessor, Commander Tinling, R.N., who assisted at the trial, presented a report giving his view of the situation and stating that, in his opinion, both ships were in fault. The local judge found that the \"Albano\" alone was to blame for the collision, dismissed the action by her owners against the \"Parisian\" and ordered judgment to be entered in favour of the Allan Line Steamship Company for the damages caused to the \"Parisian,\" to be assessed by a referee, with costs against the \"Albano\" in both actions. The owners of the \"Albano\" assert the present appeals from both judgments.\nNewcombe K.C. and Morrison for the appellants.\nNesbitt K.C. and W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIES J.\u2014These were cross-actions brought by the respective owners of the SS. \"Parisian\" and the SS. \"Albano\" against each other arising out of a collision which took place between the two steamships outside the mouth of the Harbour of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 29th day of March, 1905.\nThe \"Parisian\" is a British passenger steamer of 3,385 tons net with a speed of about 15 knots. The \"Albano\" is a German freight steamer of 2,423 tons net with a speed of about 9 knots.\nThe time of the collision was about 5 p.m., the wind was very light and the weather fine and clear. There was no sea running and no perceptible tide. The place of the collision was near the inner automatic buoy which marks the approach to Halifax Harbour and is situate near Camperdown overlooking Portuguese Cove. The pilot station at Portuguese Cove is near the place of collision and it was about there where incoming steamers generally take a pilot. The \"Albano\" arrived first off the harbour, but mistaking one of the buoys ran away some miles to the eastward when, on discovering her mistake, she changed her course from N. by E. \u00bd E. sharply to W.S.W. \u00be W., and continued on that course till she came nearly up to and abreast of Rockhead Shoal, when she altered her course to W. \u00bc S., a direction which would take her up to the automatic whistling buoy near by which the pilot schooner was lying, the object being to procure a pilot so as to enter the harbour.\nSomething was said at the argument as to the erratic character of the \"Albano's\" course in approaching this pilotage ground, but we do not think anything turns upon that or that the \"Albano\" is in any way to blame respecting it.\nThe \"Parisian,\" on the other hand, having made a good land fall came in along the western shore, her courses: being N.W. by N. and N.N.W., when seeing the pilot's flag she was steered for the pilot schooner and about 4.56 or 4.57 p.m. as the captain said, she was steering N. by W.\nThe cutter \"Petrel,\" pilot boat No. 4, with pilots for both steamers, was lying to, a little east of the automatic buoy. The \"Parisian\" slowed down as she approached the buoy. The time now becomes most important. Captain Johnson says that at 4.52 he gave the order to \"stand by\"; at 4.57, \"half speed\"; at 4.58, \"slow\"; and at 4.59 he stopped the engines. At about 3 minutes past five, he says, the \"Parisian\"\nwould be thoroughly stopped. The pilot boat would be a little ahead of me and the pilot thought that the impetus of the ship would bring us up to him, but we were so thoroughly stopped that he had to pull down to us.\nThe reference is to a row boat which had left the pilot cutter with a pilot for him. He says it was 2 or 3 minutes after that, or as he put it, \"about 5 o'clock and 5 or 6 minutes,\" that he heard the \"Albano\" whistle and saw her coming down on him, and that about 5.05, when he saw that the collision was inevitable and that he would be struck abreast of his ship's engines, he gave the order to go full speed ahead and his vessel forged ahead about 200 feet and was struck further aft, about the starboard quarter and abreast of No. 5 hatch.\nAccording to the evidence of Captain Johnson and his officers and engineers, the engines of the \"Parisian\" were stopped at least six and perhaps seven minutes before the collision. He himself says he did not see the \"Albano\" more than 2 or 3 minutes before there was danger of collision, and that there was about one or one and a half minutes from the time he saw there might be danger of collision till it actually occurred.\nOn the other hand, Captain Kubenhold says, and as regards his time and orders he is supported by his officers and engineers, that at 4.55 he gave the order to stand by, at 4.57 half speed and slow, and 4.58 to stop, immediately followed by \"full speed astern,\" and the blowing three blasts of his whistle to indicate to the \"Parisian\" what he was doing. He says the \"Parisian\" was then \"about 5 lengths away a little more or less,\" and that for two minutes he was going full speed astern until the collision, which by his time occurred a few seconds after 5 o'clock. There was a difference between the \"time\" of the two steamers of six minutes, which explains apparent discrepancies in the evidence of the two captains. He further says that the course of his ship was not altered from the time it was changed to W. \u00bc S. off Rockhead Shoals; that he saw the pilot row close to the bow of the \"Parisian\"; and that it would not take much over two minutes to stop the \"Albano\" at the rate she was going; and that up to or about the time he whistled, he thought the \"Parisian\" would go either full speed ahead or full speed astern to avoid collision; that he was about \u00bc of a mile away when he noticed she had slowed down and that the \"Parisian\" was moving about 1\u00bd knots \"as far as he could make it out\" immediately preceding the collision. In cross-examination he said he did not think\nat the time the \"Albano\" was put at half speed there would be any collision; there was not much danger then,\nand that then the \"Parisian\"\nmight be 8 or 9 ship's lengths away from him, he did not notice, his object in easing being to take a pilot.\nThat was at 4.57 by \"Albano's\" time, 5.03 by the \"Parisian's,\" or about 3 minutes before collision. He further says that it might be \u00bd or \u00bc mile from him when the \"Parisian\" slowed down and that he believed she slowed down for a pilot and to let him pass, and that was the reason he kept his course and finally that to prevent a collision he would have had to reverse a couple of ship's lengths before he did.\nUnder these circumstances it becomes vitally important to determine whether as a seaman he had, under all the circumstances before him, reasonable grounds for believing that the \"Parisian\" was, at the time he was approaching her and when risk of collision might be avoided, a crossing ship within the 19th rule, having the \"Albano\" on her starboard side and bound to keep out of her way. It seems to me, after listening to the able arguments addressed to us and carefully reading and considering all the evidence, that the determination of this controversy lies in the answer to that question. If the \"Parisian\" was such a crossing ship at the time immediately before the collision when the risk of collision could be avoided, then Captain Kubenhold was right in keeping his speed and course and depending upon the \"Parisian\" obeying the rule and keeping out of the way, nor does it seem to me that by reducing his speed when he did he was guilty of breaking the rules, because at that time he did not believe the risk of collision imminent, and when he reversed he did so at a time when he saw the \"Parisian\" was remaining stationary and a collision was inevitable.\nThe pilot in charge of the cutter was watching both vessels and sent off a row boat first to the \"Parisian\" as he found her approaching the pilot grounds first. The row boat had reached the bow of the \"Parisian.\" Even with the little tide and wind there was carrying the \"Parisian\" towards them the row boat found they had to row to her. The occupants of the boat say they could touch the vessel with their oars and the line was about to be thrown to them at the moment the whistles of the \"Albano\" blew.\nThe engines of the \"Parisian\" had then been stopped either 6 or 7 minutes, probably six, and while I conclude from a careful analysis of all the evidence on the point, and there is much, that there was a slight motion of the ship through the water reaching from \u00be of a knot to a knot, I think it is clear that for at least two minutes and probably 3 minutes before the collision she was without any steerage way whatever and so practically, though not absolutely, without any motion.\nBeing on the pilotage ground without any steerage way for several minutes, two at least, evidently waiting to take up her pilot, with the pilot boat alongside, the line actually being about to be thrown, could the master of the other vessel, which was coming on almost at a right angle, but was at least \u00bc of a mile and probably more away, the weather being calm and clear and nothing to hinder or obstruct the view, say, as a reasonable business or nautical interpretation of the rule, that the \"Parisian\" was still a crossing vessel and subject to the ordinary rule applicable to two steamers really approaching or moving towards and crossing each other so as to invoke risk of collision?\nAre not the special circumstances of the actual stoppage for an appreciable time of the vessel which had first reached the pilotage ground, and the fact that the pilot was alongside of her and about to be taken aboard all in view of the approaching steamer \"Albano\" sufficient to make the regulation inapplicable and justify the captain of the \"Parisian\" in thinking that he would not then be run down?\nIt is true that Commander Tinling, who acted as assessor with the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia who heard the actions, thought the regulations did apply and so advised. But all his advice and findings seem to me to be based upon his main finding that as the \"Parisian\"\nwas under way, having steam up and not being prevented from using the same, it was her duty to keep clear of the \"Albano.\"\nThe Chief Justice thought, I think correctly, that it was his province and not that of the assessor to put a construct ion upon the language of the rules, and to determine their application to the facts. After much consideration I agree with the conclusion he reached, that rule 19 was not applicable to the case of the \"Parisian,\" and that under the circumstances the \"Albano\" alone must be held to be in fault. But then it was argued, that even if it is held that the rules invoked are inapplicable, the \"Parisian\" was in fault in not having kept a better \"look out\" and watched more closely the movements and approach of the \"Albano\" and in not having done something to avoid the blow. Mr. Ritchie strenuously contended that as no such fault was charged in the \"Albano's\" preliminary act, and the issue was not tried out in the court below, it would be unjust that a decision in appeal should be based upon it. But I think it clear that a fault or neglect on the part of one vessel, which cannot be presumed and is not proved to have been known to the other at the time of the fyling of the preliminary act, is not from that circumstance alone to preclude its consideration in determining the liability of the ships. As to the issue not having been tried out in the court below, it would appear that all the evidence possible to be given upon it was given by all of the officers of the \"Parisian,\" and from that evidence it is clear that up to the moment when the \"Albano\" blew her whistle, or at any rate a very few seconds before that, no attention was being paid by the officers of the \"Parisian\" to her movements. The captain and officers of the latter ship had lost sight of the \"Albano\" and evidently had not the slightest idea of incurring any danger from her movements. We have not the advantage of being advised in this court by skilled assessors or of asking questions from them with regard to points of seamanship or what nautical skill or prudence required to be done under given circumstances. The assessor's finding of \"gross neglect\" on the part of the \"Parisian\" with respect of her \"look out\" depends entirely upon his main conclusion or finding that under the circumstances it was the duty of that ship under the rules to keep out of the way of the \"Albano,\" from which conclusion I differ. But apart from that, from the best judgment I have been able to form, I cannot see that there were any measures of precaution which the \"Parisian\" ought under the circumstances to have taken, and which her officers failed to take. The \"Parisian\" was justified in coming to a stop for her pilot and had no reason to anticipate danger of collision from the \"Albano\" when she did so stop. It is said she should either have reversed her engines and gone astern or gone full speed ahead. It appears to me that either course would have only increased the risk of collision. I think that under the circumstances already detailed Captain Johnson had a right to assume either that the \"Albano\" would have stopped her speed, or if maintaining her speed would have either ported or starboarded her helm so as to have passed either astern or ahead of the practically motionless steamer in front of her, and that any attempt on his part, from the time when he should have seen that there was a risk of collision, to avoid it by forging forward or going back would only be likely to increase the danger. Not having steerage way on he could do very little while, on the other hand, the steamer approaching at the rate of 8 or 9 knots an hour controlled the situation. The \"Parisian's\" strength under the circumstances lay in \"sitting still,\" and unless it could be held that his coming to a practical standstill to take up his pilot was in itself negligence under the circumstances I do not think, assuming the \"Albano\" to have been guilty of negligence as above held by me, that the \"Parisian\" could, by the exercise of the ordinary care, skill and diligence her officers were bound to bring to bear, have avoided the mischief which happened. With regard to the construction and application of the regulations for preventing collisions at sea, the rule seems to be correctly laid clown by Brett M.R. in The Dunelm[1], that they are to be construed,\nif possible, not according to the strictest and nicest interpretation of language, but according to a reasonable and business interpretation of it with regard to the trade or business with which it is dealing,\nwhich I take to mean that they ought to be construed as they would probably be understood by the class of men, masters of vessels, for whose guidance they are prepared.\nThe same learned judge said in The Beryl[2]:\nAnother rule of interpretation of these regulations is (the object of them being to avoid risk of collision) that they are all applicable at a time when the risk of a collision can be avoided\u2014not that they are applicable when the risk of collision is already fixed and determined. We have always said that the right moment of time to be considered is that which exists at the moment before the risk of collision is constituted.\nSee also The Banshee[3].\nAs to the application of these rules, the same judge in the same case of The Beryl (2), at pp. 138 and 139 (in language quoted and expressly adopted by Lord Herschell in The Theodore H. Rand[4] said:\nWhen you speak of rules which are to regulate the conduct of people, those rules can only apply to circumstances which must or ought to be known to the parties at the time; you cannot regulate the conduct of people as to unknown circumstances * * * Therefore the consideration must always be in these cases not whether the rule was in fact applicable, but were the circumstances such that it ought to have been present to the mind of the person in charge that it was applicable.\nSome observations made by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in \"The Pekin\"[5] are, I think, in point in the case before us. They had reference to article 22 of the then regulations, now article 19 of the existing ones, and as to the effect to be given the words \"crossing so as to involve risk by collision,\" as regards vessels navigating the open sea and those passing along the winding channels of rivers. After pointing out that with regard to the latter vessels whether they are crossing vessels or not \"depends upon their presumable courses\" their Lordships go on to say:\nThe question therefore always turns on the reasonable inference to be drawn as to a vessel's future course from her position at a particular moment and this greatly depends on the nature of the locality where she is at that moment.\nThese later observations I understand to be general in their character, and not confined alone to vessels following the winding channels of rivers.\nWe were pressed with the case of The Ada v. The Sappho[6], affirmed in appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[7].\nWhen examined, however, that case, which in many respects is the converse of the one before us, will not be found to be a controlling guide for our decision in this case. The main question of fact in the case (as stated in the report of the hearing before Sir Robt. Phillimore) was as to which of the two vessels came up first to the pilot cutter, and the judgment of the learned judge proceeds upon the conclusion he reached from the evidence that\nthe lights of the \"Sappho\" were first seen from the pilot boat and she being the inside vessel the senior pilot ordered that she should be the first vessel to which the pilot should be sent and accordingly the boat was first sent to her.\nThe \"Ada\" was, therefore, held to be solely in fault for not stopping soon enough to have avoided the accident, the vessels being crossing vessels, the \"Sappho\" having the right of way and the circumstances not of themselves sufficient to take the case out of the rule.\nIt is to be observed that the answer made by the learned judge to the contention that the \"Sappho\" which under ordinary circumstances had the right of way should have avoided the collision because she should have foreseen that the \"Ada\" would stop about where she did for her pilot, was not that such circumstances had nothing to do with the case and that the \"Sappho\" had nothing to do but obstinately adhere to the crossing rule; but the answer was that the \"Sappho\" had herself got first to the pilot grounds and that the pilot was coming to her and not to the \"Ada.\"\nSir J. W. Colville delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee concurring with the court below in holding that there was nothing to relieve the \"Ada\" from the ordinary rule which required her to keep out of the way, and from his judgment it will be seen that it was not contended in that case that the \"Ada\" had not a right to stop at a suitable point for a pilot, but the contention was that she had approached too near to the pilot cutter in view of the position of the \"Sappho,\" and he says:\nOn the other hand, if the vessels were crossing vessels as their Lordships think they were, and, as their Lordships also think, and the event has shewn, vessels crossing so as to involve risk of collision, it seems to their Lordships that it was the duty of the \"Ada\" to become absolutely motionless at a far earlier period that that at which she is said by some of the witnesses to have stopped, and thus, when it did, or ought to have become clear that the \"Sappho\" was coming inside the pilot vessel, and therefore would be the first to take the pilot, to have had the means of reversing her engines and keeping out of the way. In the case before us, however, the \"Parisian\" had clearly first reached the pilotage grounds, had slowed down till she was practically motionless, without steerage way, was, it may be said, in the very act of taking aboard the pilot who had come alongside of her from the pilot cutter in a row boat when the risk of collision first arose, and although so lying that the \"Albano\" was on her starboard side was not, in my humble judgment, from these circumstances, all of which must be held to have been present to the eye and mind of the \"Albano's\" captain, a crossing ship within the rule.\nThe appeals should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I think no one can dispute that, for some time before any risk of collision in question, the lines of the courses of these vessels being prolonged would intersect.\nThey were thus within Marsden's definition of crossing vessels.\nThere were such distances, thus respectively sailed by each in its course, immediately preceding the collision, as to have involved the risk of collision within the meaning of article 19.\nOnce within the operation of this rule it became the duty of the officers in charge of the \"Parisian\" to keep out of the way of the \"Albano.\" Why did they not?\nClearly, I think, because they failed to see, where they clearly should have seen, the \"Albano.\"\nI think the excuse given, of the \"Parisian\" having stopped for a legitimate purpose, is not to the point at all. The steps necessary to keep out of the way ought to have been taken some time before she was stopped, and considered in relation to the purpose of stopping and a proper place therefore selected.\nI have no doubt that had the captain and others responsible for the navigation of the \"Parisian\" seen what was taking place in broad daylight, as they ought to have seen, they would have realized the risk involved as and when it became so, and when the risk could have been avoided; before, in the language of Brett M.R. in the case of The Beryl[8] it had become \"already fixed and determined.\" True, that was said of a different rule, but one calling for similar interpretation.\nThe fact is clear on the evidence, that if the effort the \"Parisian\" made, when the risk had become thus fixed and determined, had been made two minutes earlier she would have been clear of the \"Albano.\"\nShe had no right to stop just in front of the \"Albano,\" or in the line of the course that the \"Albano\" was running, and had run, long enough for the \"Parisian\" to have found out the course being so run, and to have observed the rule of the road laid down for her in article 19.\nIt is idle to say, as has been urged, that if the \"Parisian\" had ventured ahead or to stop further back, clear of that line, the \"Albano\" might have done something else. The rule bound the \"Albano\" under such circumstances to have so continued her course and speed that the \"Parisian\" could confidentially act on her doing so. The \"Albano\" departing from this would have to suffer the consequences, if any.\nAs the judgment of this court, about to be given, is that the appeal be dismissed I need not labour with the conflicting evidence on this and many other points. I accept, for the present, as sufficient to know here, though contradicted, what Captain Johnson says as to the stopping of the \"Parisian\" in. the following evidence:\nQ\u2014After 4.59, how long was it before the vessel was still in the water? A.\u2014At about three minutes past five she would be thoroughly stopped. The pilot boat was a little ahead of me, and the pilot thought that the impetus of the ship would bring us up to him; but we were so thoroughly stopped that he had to pull down to us.\nQ.\u2014How long after that was it that you heard the whistle and saw the vessel coming down on you? A.\u2014It would be about five o'clock, and five or six minutes.\nThe preliminary act of the \"Parisian\" fixes the collision as taking place at six minutes and thirty seconds past five.\nTwo to three minutes is the length of the stopping there was of the \"Parisian,\" according to the respondents' captain, who cries out about the \"Albano\" coming down upon him whilst lying still.\nI assume as true that which the captain and officers of the \"Albano\" say as to the course of their vessel. I cannot see reasonable grounds for doubting it.\nShe had continued in what, generally speaking, was the same course for a good many miles. In that course slightly varied she had continued for the two or more miles she had sailed immediately preceding the collision.\nThat this distance was two or more miles may be verified in many ways either by computation based on times and rates of speed Captain Johnson gives, or on what Captain Kudenhold and others respectively state, as to the distance the \"Albano\" was from the pilot boat or cutter.\nIt was quite far enough off to have enabled the \"Parisian\" to have got out of the way, and quite near enough, I should say, to have then or thereabout involved the risk of collision before the \"Parisian\" slowed at all.\nThe case of The Ada v. The Sappho[9] disposes of the contention, rested on the facts, about each of the vessels going to take a pilot.\nThat case shews that such purpose does not dispense with the need of the observation of this article 19, and I would say especially so when a pilot might be taken on thereabout; not at a fixed point that could accommodate only a single vessel at a time, but at a place where this operation might have taken place within a field of possibly two miles or more in width and also in breadth.\nMy conclusion is, therefore, entirely different from that reached in the judgment of my brother, Sir Louis Davies, which I have read.\nAnd if article 19 were not to govern, and the questions raised by article 27 had to be considered, I would not even then exonerate the \"Parisian,\" and hence cannot concur in the results arrived at by the rest of the court.\nThe cases, I think, should be decided in favour of the \"Albano.\"\nMy only doubt is as to whether or not the captain of the \"Albano\" ought not to have had more regard to article 27, and if blamable for not doing so his vessel might have to share the loss. But in my humble judgment the \"Parisian's\" officers had not regarded either rule until too late, and were guilty of negligence that caused the accident.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Alfred G. Morrison.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Henry C. Borden.\nNote.\u2014Upon the application of the appellants, on 30th March, 1906, to the full court, for an order to fix the bail on appeal to His Majesty in Council, it was contended by the respondents that there was no appeal de piano.

VIL c. 158 (D.)\u2014Public policy.\nSolicitors and counsel retained in proceedings for the sale of property are not within the classes of persons disqualified as purchasers by article 1484 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada.\nThe Act, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 158, directed the sale of certain railways separately or together as in the opinion of the Exchequer Court might be for the best interests of creditors, in such mode as that court might provide, and that such sale should have the same effect as a sheriff's sale of immovables under the laws of the Province of Quebec. The judge of the Exchequer. Court directed the sale to be by tender for the railways en Hoc or for the purchase of each or any two of the lines of which they were constituted.\nHeld, that the judge had properly exercised the discretion vested in him by the statute in accepting a tender for the whole system, in preference to two separate tenders for the several lines of railway at a slightly increased amount, and that his decision should not be disturbed on appeal.\nAppeal from the decision of the judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, rendered on the 8th of November, 1905, accepting the tender of the respondent B\u00e9ique for the purchase of the railways authorized to be sold under the provisions of the Act, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 158 (D.), for the sum of $1,051,000.\nIn giving the reasons for acceptance of the tender of the respondent B\u00e9ique for the purchase of the railways in question, en bloc, the learned judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, His Lordship Mr. Justice Burbidge, said:\n\"By an Act of the Parliament of Canada, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 158, respecting the South Shore Railway Company and the Quebec Southern Railway Company, it was among other things provided that the Exchequer Court might order the sale of the railways mentioned and their accessories as soon as possible and convenient after the passing of the Act, and that such railways and their accessories respectively should be sold separately or together as in the opinion of the Exchequer Court would be best for the interests of the creditors of the said companies. The order for such sale has been made and tenders have been received in accordance therewith as follows: \"First.\u2014A tender of $105,000 for the East Richelieu Valley Railway;\n\"Secondly.\u2014A tender of $503,000 for the South Shore Railway;\n\"Thirdly.\u2014A tender of $1,006,000 for all the said railways together;\n\"Fourthly.\u2014A tender of $551,000 for what was formerly known as the United Counties Railway and the East Richelieu Valley Railway together; and\n\"Fifthly.\u2014A tender of $1,051,000 for all the said railways together;\n\"And the question now is which tender or tenders it is for the best interest of the creditors to accept? That is a question that the statute leaves to the opinion of the court.\n\"In answering that question it is not necessary to consider the first tender or the third tender mentioned. Obviously it would not be in the interests of the creditors to accept either of these. The question lies between the acceptance of the second and fourth tenders which would give a price of $1,054,000 for the whole property, or of the fifth tender which would give therefor the somewhat smaller sum of $1,051,000. By accepting the second and fourth tenders the property would realize for the creditors $3,000 more than would be realized therefor by accepting the fifth tender. That course would have another advantage. It is easy to foresee that in the distribution of the moneys arising from the sale of the property in question, and probably in other connections, it will be necessary to attribute a portion of such moneys to each railway, and if the second and fourth tender is accepted, that question, so far as the South Shore Railway interests are concerned, will be eliminated, leaving only the question as to the distribution of the sum of $551,000 between the United Counties Railway interests and the East Richelieu Valley.\nIt is suggested that the latter question ought not to present any serious difficulty, seeing that the value of the East Richelieu Valley Railway may be taken to be determined by the bid of $105,000 made therefor. But if that view is correct, then equally it might be contended that the value of the South Shore Railway is determined by the bid of $503,000 made for that railway and its accessories, and that would leave the balance, whatever it might be, for the United Counties Railway. For example, if the second and fourth tenders were accepted we should have:\n\"The South Shore Railway\n1503,000\nThe United Counties Railway\n446,000\nThe East Richelieu Valley Railway\n105,000\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTotal\n$11,054,000\n\"and if the fifth tender were accepted we would have on the basis of division above mentioned, for\n\"The South Shore Railway\n$503,000\nThe United Counties Railway\n$443,000\nThe East Richelieu Valley Railway\n$105,000\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTotal\n$1,051,000\n\"In that way the difference of $3,000 would fall upon the United Counties Railway interests.\n\"But whether in case the one tender rather than the two were accepted, the whole difference should fall upon the United Counties Railway or be equitably distributed between the three railways is a question that need not now be determined. The matter may be left for future consideration, but upon the main question I see no reason to doubt that a fair distribution of the total price may be made between the three railways without any considerable expense.\n\"There is, however, another consideration. If the property is sold and part sold to one purchaser and part to another, two new and diverse interests will at once arise, and it will be necessary to divide the property both real and personal and to make two transfers. It is also to be seen that these interests may be adverse and perhaps hostile, and the expense of determining any controversies that may arise between them is likely in the main to fall upon the funds that will be brought into court as the price of the several railways. What the amount of that expense may be it is of course not possible to foresee, but experience suggests that it may very easily exceed a sum of three thousand dollars. I am therefore of opinion that it is better for the creditors of the said companies, and in their best interests, not to create any such diverse interests, but to avoid that difficulty by accepting the single tender of $1,051,000 for the whole property.\n\"So far I have dealt with the matter wholly from what, in my opinion, is the best interests of the creditors of the said companies, as I agree that under the statute that is the proper test to apply.\n\"But we cannot overlook the fact that it is a question in which the public have a large and direct interest. That interest in the present proceeding is represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, and counsel for the minister has stated that in the minister's opinion the public interest will be best served by a sale of the whole property to one person or company. The interest of the public is that the several roads be kept open and be duly operated for the public convenience, and it seems reasonable to conclude that that is more likely to happen where the property passes into the hands of one person or company, than where it passes into the hands of two persons or companies. If in this case the public interest and the best interests of the creditors of the several companies were opposed, I should think that, in accordance with the statute under which the sale is made, the interests of the creditors should prevail, but in my opinion they are not opposed. It appears to me to be both in the best interests of the creditors and in the public interest, that the highest tender for the property as a whole should be accepted.\n\"That brings me to another matter. There has been filed with the registrar of this court a letter or notice purporting to come from the Atlantic & Lake Superior Railway Company protesting against the sale of the properties in question here. It purports to be signed by the secretary of the latter company and has been read in open court so that all parties interested may have notice of it. There is also an opposition filed on behalf of the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company against including in the sale of the property of the several companies mentioned its interest in the equipment of the telegraph system along their said lines. I do not propose at present to deal with the question raised by the letter or notice mentioned, nor with the petition of the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company; neither do I think that I should delay action with respect to the tenders. I shall leave these matters largely with the purchaser, and he must satisfy himself as to what weight or consideration is to be attached to the communication of the Atlantic & Lake Superior Railway Company. If in that respect there should be any defect in the title that the court can give under the statute, the loss, if any, must fall upon the purchaser and not upon the creditors of the said companies. I shall also expect the purchaser to give a satisfactory undertaking to protect the creditors and the receiver and registrar and those acting under the authority of the court from any just claim of the telegraph company mentioned. There was, I am sure, no intention on the part of any one to include in the sale any property of the Great Northwestern Telegraph Company, nor am I aware that any of its property has been so included. But there may be some questions as to what its real interests and rights are in the matter, and as to that the purchaser must in the first instance satisfy himself. If under these circumstances he wishes to withdraw his tender and deposit rather than go on with the purchase, leave is given him to make an application for such withdrawal. If, however, notwithstanding the notice and petition he is willing to go on with the purchase on the terms and conditions I have mentioned, I ought not, I think, under all the circumstances of the case to defer action.\n\"Subject to the terms and conditions I have mentioned the order and direction of the court will be that Mr. F. L. B\u00e9ique's tender of $1,051,000 for the property as a whole be accepted, and that the several railways mentioned with their accessories, be sold to him for that price, and that steps be taken to give effect to and to carry out such sale.\"\nThe present appeals have been asserted by the Rutland Railroad Co., a creditor of the South Shore Railway Company and of the Quebec Southern Railway Company, Frank D. White, a creditor of the same companies, and Edward A. D. Morgan, a creditor and bidder for the property of the South Shore Railway Company. On the 20th of February, 1906, motions were made on behalf of the said respondents to quash the appeals with costs on the grounds:\n(1) That the Exchequer Court judge, acting in the matter in question, was a special tribunal designated by Act of Parliament and was not a court of record, but a functionary named for a special purpose, whose discretionary order was final for those purposes and not appealable. Parliament having reserved to itself the power of finally deciding as to the title of the purchaser to operate the road;\n(2) That mere bidders at the sale of the road had no standing in court to maintain an appeal;\n(3) That unproved claimants and creditors could have no standing in court;\n(4) That these persons were not parties to any suit in which a judgment had been rendered; and\n(5) That in no case could any creditor or other party have an interest exceeding $500 limited for appeals from the Exchequer Court, as the difference between the bid accepted and. the combined amounts of the several separate bids for the several portions of the road separately (only $3,000) when distributed, could only leave a few dollars to each of the creditors; and\nFinally, that the discretion of the Exchequer Court judge was a commendable discretion as it avoided diversity of interest in the operation of the system of railways and was in the general interest of the public by thus placing the whole control with one corporation.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C., Lafteur K.C., and Parent K.C. appeared for the motions. The sale in question was conducted under a special statute, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 158 (D.), and is not a proceeding in the ordinary sense in the Exchequer Court or under the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" but before a curia designata, not a court of record. The functions vested in the officer are of a special character to be exercised in the interest of the public as well as of the parties more directly concerned and the statute contemplates, by its terms, that the exercise of these powers and the discretion thereby given should be final and not subject to any appeal.\nBidders at the sale can have no status to assert an appeal; neither can unproved claimants. The railway companies now appearing as creditors cannot, in any case, have any interest amounting to the value of $500, as limited for appeals from the Exchequer Court of Canada, as the whole controversy is concerning the division of the difference of $3,000 between a great number of interested parties, none of whom can have nearly as much interest as $500 in the distribution of this amount. None of the appellants were parties to any of the proceedings in regard to the sale and, consequently, have no locus standi before this court.\nWe refer to The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Fleming[1], at page 36, per Strong C.J.; Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements de Qu\u00e9bec[2]; The Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia v. The Attorney-General of British Columbia[3]; The Ottawa Electric Co. v. Brennan[4]; and Birely v. The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.[5].\nChrysler K.C., J. E. Martin K.C., Morgan and Beulac appeared to oppose the motions on behalf of the various appellants. After hearing counsel on the motions and without calling upon the appellants, the court reserved the further argument of the questions submitted until the hearing of the case upon the merits.\nOn the first of March, 1906, the appeals were heard upon the merits.\nChrysler K.C. and J. E. Martin K.C. for the appellants, the Rutland Railroad Company; Beulac for the appellant White; Morgan for the appellant Morgan. The respondent B\u00e9ique, in all the proceedings in this matter, appeared for and represented the receiver appointed by th\u00e8 Excheqeuer Court, both as solicitor and counsel; he virtually had charge of the sale of the railways, and, consequently, could not legally bid and become a purchaser thereof by reason of the position he occupied in respect to the proceedings.

Re Alger and The Sarnia Oil Co.[11] and cases cited in the judgment in that case. The French jurisprudence is to the same effect.\nThe interest of the several appellants cannot be questioned as claims aggregating many hundreds of thousands of dollars have been filed against the railways offered for sale and it is doubtful whether or not the price realized by the sale attacked will be sufficient to pay the creditors. All the appellants are interested in the marshalling of the assets and a ventilation according to the principles laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure (arts. 805 et seq. C.P.Q.).\nOn the question of jurisdiction we refer specially to The North British Canadian Investment Co. v. The Trustees of St. John School District[12]; The City of Halifax v. Reeves[13].\nNesbitt K.C. and Lafleur K.C. appeared for the respondent B\u00e9ique, and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the Minister of Railways and Canals, but were not called upon for any arguments.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J. (oral).\u2014The objection now taken for the first time on this appeal, that the respondent, B\u00e9ique, could not legally bid or become a purchaser of the railways by reason of the position occupied by him as solicitor or counsel, ought not to prevail.\nHis position in regard to the proceedings does not bring him within the class of persons disqualified under the provisions of article 1484 of the Civil Code, but, even if it did so, the position he occupied would not involve absolute disqualification and render his acts null. There were no objections raised or steps taken to impeach his position before the judge of the Exchequer Court and none can now be taken on this appeal.\nWe have unanimously agreed that all the appeals should be dismissed with costs. We believe that the learned judge of the Exchequer Court has properly exercised the discretion vested jn him by the statute, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. ch. 158, and that we should not disturb his judgment or order.\nThe appeals are dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the. Rutland Railroad Co., appellants: J. E.

Jackson by the said H. D. Helmcken and H. B. W. Aikman, who admit and allege, testified by their signatures hereto, that the sum of $16,595.10 is (except as to the moneys (if any) in which they were indebted to him in respect of an account known as the Drake and Jackson rental account or rent of offices and of a certain promissory note dated the 3rd day of June, 1893, made by them the said H. D. Helmcken and H. B. W. Aikman and one B. H. T. Drake for $2,000 payable to the order of the said R. E. Jackson at the Bank of British Columbia, Victoria, on demand with interest at 7 per cent. per annum) the amount in which they were indebted to him the said R. E. Jackson on the 1st day of January, 1903. And the said R. E. Jackson, for the sake of peace and quiet and to avoid friction and bother, is willing to waive investigation of the books of the firms of Drake, Jackson & Helmcken, of which the said H. B. W. Aikman was or is a member, and to agree that the said sum of $16,595.10 shall (except as aforesaid) be deemed to be the amount which was payable by the said H. D. Helmcken and H. B. W. Aikman to him on the said 1st day of January, 1903, for balance of account.\nDated this 19th day of March, 1904.\nH.DALLAS HELMCKEN.\nH. B. W. AIKMAN.\nROBT. E. JACKSON.\nThe appellant, in August following the signing, desired payment of the amount fixed as above at $16,595.10, and in default of payment sued for said amount as due on an account stated.\nThe defences set up in the pleadings were numerous, but on this appeal rested upon (1) a denial of the account stated; (2) what was claimed to be a collateral contract, and; (3) upon mistake or mistakes in the account to such an extent as to render void the account stated.\nThe document itself, by its wording, seems to us to be as complete a reply as possible to all that was said on the first point. We do not see any other meaning that can be attached to the first part of the document than that of an account stated, and to the last of it, which relates to the first part, a promise to pay the amount, or at least an admission of such a liability to pay the amount that the law implies a promise to pay.\nAs to the second point taken there was alleged to be an agreement that the appellant would not sue upon such a document if given. The contention was also set up that the document if given was only to be used as evidence of the amount the plaintiff was entitled to receive when, but not until, there had been received by defendants, from the debtors owing the partnership the accounts that entered into the calculations upon which the balance was found due, money to pay this balance.\nThe evidence in support of these contentions was entirely oral.\nIt certainly was of a character to contradict in one of these alternatives or to vary in the other of them the plain language of the document.\nSuch evidence must be excluded from our consideration.\nNeither alternative set up under this head can be rightly said to be in the nature of a collateral agreement of which parol evidence would be admissible.\nEither such alternative is not only inconsistent with the written document, but seems to contradict, or vary, and indeed absolutely to nullify it.\nThere is no such evidence in support of either proposition as would entitle defendants to ask for reformation of this document as the result of a mutual mistake.\nThe alleged promise not to sue is one of those vague, indefinite sorts of expression often used in negotiations such as this and if taken literally contradicts the document.\nIf taken in a more reasonable sense it means little or nothing, possibly a promise of forbearance, as was shewn here, for a short time; or more extended than that, yet so vague that no reformation can be made to give effect to it. Reformation can only be granted when it is clearly and explicitly shewn, not only that there has been a mutual mistake, but also what the definite terms of the agreement were intended to have been.\nThe evidence fails to support any such case.\nThese remarks as to mistake apply in part to the third ground taken. We are, perhaps, unable to comprehend, correctly, any further contention under that head. The alleged mistake of adopting as the basis of settlement accounts due and owing but unpaid seems to be the only one upon which there is tangible evidence. It would seem to be covered by what I have said. Clearly, appellant never for a moment intended to bargain on any other basis than treating all the accounts carried in the books as good down to the time of treating for this settlement.\nHe, by accepting this stated account, abandoned any claim to receive from doubtful accounts that were dropped out of this reckoning in previous years, pursuant to what we are told was part of the system.\nPreferring an acknowledgment, by the defendants, of liability to him for what had been carried forward as good assets, to the doubtful benefit of awaiting collection of the last dollar that might possibly be got, he can now get no more, and defendants must give no less, than a balance so arrived at. If the defendants find their judgment of the results was mistaken that is not a mistake they can claim now to be relieved from.\nIf, however, for example, a clear error in the computation had been shewn, of course relief could have been given. No such clear error appears here.\nWe think the appeal must be allowed with costs of appeal here and in the court below, and judgment be entered for plaintiff against the surviving defendant Helmcken for the amount sued for with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. J. Prior.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Moresby & O'Reilly.\n"}

The manager, who was a creditor of the company, was to have his debt secured and to receive an allotment of shares in the new company proportionate to those held by him in the old company and he agreed that he would not reveal this understanding to the other shareholders.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (11 B.C. Rep. 466) Sedgewick J. dissenting, that the agreement could not be enforced as the consideration was illegal and a breach of trust by which the other shareholders were defrauded.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment of Martin J. and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs. The action was to recover 12,500 shares, being one-eighth of the capital stock in the Thistle Gold Mining Company, under the following circumstances:\u2014\nIn 1899 and 1900 the plaintiff was manager and owner of 62,500 shares, being one-eighth of the capital stock, of the Sutherland Gold Mining Company. A Mr. Sutherland was president of the company, was largely interested therein, and had induced some residents of Minneapolis, Minn., also to become largely interested in the company. The defendant Hannah was a banker in Minneapolis, and it was through his influence that a large number of persons had been induced to become shareholders in the undertaking. Largely through mismanagement by Sutherland the company got into difficulties and became discredited and embarrassed. Towards the end of 1900 Hannah, in order to rehabilitate the company's credit and to secure everyone interested therein, including the creditors, conceived the idea of re-constructing the company. After discussing the matter with Sutherland and his attorney he was advised to adopt the following plan:\u2014 He was to advance a sufficient sum for the purpose of acquiring all the outstanding obligations of the company, except $1,600 due to the plaintiff, to obtain judgment on one of these obligations for $3,000, and, after purchasing the company's properties at sheriff's sale, to organize another company and distribute the shares of the new company, in proportion to the shares held by them, to such of the shareholders of the old company as were entitled to them.\nAt this time the plaintiff was a creditor of the old company to the extent of $1,600, and owned one-eighth of the capital stock, 62,500 shares. He was at the mines in Cariboo, B.C., and Hannah and Sutherland were in Minneapolis. On 16th November, 1900, Hannah wrote to the plaintiff setting out his views regarding reconstruction, and the method by which he proposed to accomplish that end, and asked the assistance of the plaintiff, at the same time promising to protect his interests. On 28th November he sent him a telegram stating that he had already written him, explaining everything. A few days later the plaintiff instructed his solicitor to commence an action against the company for $1,600 due to him, but as he then contemplated leaving British Columbia he assigned his claim to a Mr. Wendell, as a matter of expediency and convenience only, Mr. Wendell being the nominal plaintiff. Hannah had also commenced an action against the company to recover a sum due on notes which he had purchased with the intention of re-constructing the company. Hannah's action having been served upon the plaintiff as manager of the company, he immediately travelled to Minneapolis for the purpose of informing and consulting with Sutherland, the president of the company. There they discussed the position of the company's affairs, and Hannah reiterated the request to refrain from pressing his claim, but to keep the arrangement secret and to speed the proposed sale of the company's property for the purpose of re-construction. To this the plaintiff agreed, upon consideration of receiving a proportion of shares in the new company equivalent to those he then held in the old company, as well the assurance of payment, at a deferred date, of the $1,600 due to him.\nThe plaintiff thereupon stood by and permitted Hannah to proceed with the sale, assisted him therein, abandoned the proceedings to recover the $1,600 and took no steps in respect of his own shares in the old company. Hannah sold the property of the old com- pany under execution, purchased it himself, organized the Thistle Gold Co. and conveyed the assets of the old company to the new company issuing to himself, inter alia, the shares which he had promised to transfer to the plaintiff. All the debts of the old company were paid and discharged, including the debt due to the plaintiff, but Hannah did not deliver the shares as promised.\nOn these facts the trial judge ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for 12,500 shares in the Thistle Gold Company, or their value, and the action against the Thistle Gold Company was dismissed. An appeal to the Full Court was allowed, Mr. Justice Morrison dissenting.\nWilson K.C. for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. and George A. Morphy, for respondent.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Martin, was right in maintaining the action in respect to the allotment of shares claimed by the plaintiff for the reasons then stated by him; I also agree with the view taken by Mr. Justice Morrison, who dissented from the majority of the court below. For these reasons I think that the present appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court below and that the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Chief Justice Hunter.\nDAVIES J.\u2014A careful perusal of the evidence and correspondence between the parties satisfies me be- yond any reasonable doubt: (1) That there was no sufficient evidence of any such contract having been entered into between the parties as that sued upon; (2). That if it was possible to spell out or infer the existence of such a contract from the letter written by defendant to plaintiff wherein he stated\nI purpose to take care of you and to take care that your interests are properly protected,\nit seems decisive that such letter was not received by plaintiff or its contents known to him until long after he had his interview with defendant in Minneapolis when he alleged he made the contract sued on.\nI think that, apart from this letter, the correspondence between the parties after the Minneapolis meeting is conclusive against such an agreement having been come to orally at such meeting; that such correspondence is also conclusive that there was no consideration for such alleged agreement arising in any way whatever out of the debt which the Sutherland Gold Mining Co. owed plaintiff; that if there was any consideration whatever for the alleged promise or agreement it was an illegal one, namely, that plaintiff, who was superintendent and manager of the Sutherland Gold Mining Co., should conceal from the directors and others of the company interested the proceedings which the present defendant for the benefit and on the behalf of Sutherland, the president of the company, had instituted for the purpose of obtaining judgment against the company, and selling all its assets and property and then re-organizing the company under a new name with the result of \"freezing out\" those shareholders who were objectionable to Hannah, the defendant, and Sutherland, on whose behalf he was acting. It was argued by Attorney-General Wilson that there was nothing illegal in what Hannah had done to sell out the assets of the Sutherland Gold Mining Co., and leave it a company in name only. Mr. Ewart did not controvert that position by itself, but submitted that Hannah by his own statement to the plaintiff Lassels was avowedly acting in the proceedings he took for and on behalf of, and for the benefit of the president, Sutherland. That he knew and so informed Lassels, the superintendent and general manager of the company, that absolute secrecy was an essential element of the success of their plans, and \"in order not to give Mr. Sutherland's claimants any advantage,\" and that \"rapid action was actually necessary.\"\nIn fact on the 6th December, 1900, Hannah writes to Lassels from Minneapolis, the headquarters of the Sutherland Gold Mining Company, saying:\nIt has evidently got out that you have been here. Should there be any leak about the proceedings we are taking, we might be caused considerable trouble and the affairs of the company would again fall back into the quagmire in which they were before.\nIt simply came back to this, that proceedings were being taken against the company by Hannah for Sutherland, the president's benefit, and the general manager and superintendent on whom the writ was served and who, of the company, alone knew of the proceedings, was to maintain absolute secrecy, and not let the secretary or directors know anything about them until the sale had been completed and the company's assets sold.\nIf this was the construction, and I see no other possible, then I agree with the Chief Justice in the court below that the agreement was a fraud on the part of the plaintiff as superintendent and general manager of the company, as against the company, and its shareholders, which the courts will not lend their aid to have consummated.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think, for the reasons assigned by Chief Justice Hunter in support of the judgment appealed from, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilson, Senlder & Bloom-field.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George A.

M., at the request of and for the accommodation of R., had indorsed the notes for $10,000 and deposited certain shares and debentures as collateral security on his indorsement. K. and R. deposited further collateral securities on negotiating the second loan, but K. remained in ignorance of M.'s indorsements and collateral deposit until long after the release hereinafter mentioned. These judgments remained unsatisfied for over six years, but, in the meantime, the corporation had sold all the shares deposited as collateral security, and placed the money received for them to the credit of a suspense account, without making any distinction between funds realized from M.'s shares and the proceeds of the other securities and without making any appropriation of any of the funds towards either of the debts. On 28th February, 1900, after negotiations with K. to compromise the claims against him, the agent of the corporation wrote him a letter offering to compromise the whole indebtedness for $15,000, provided payment was made some time in March or April following. This offer was not acted upon until November, 1901, when the corporation carried out the offer and received the $15,000, having a few days previously appropriated the funds in the suspense account, applying the proceeds of M.'s shares to the credit of the notes he had indorsed. The negotiations and the final settlement with K. were not made known to M., and K. was not informed of his continuing liability towards M. as a surety.\nHeld, per Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies and Idington JJ. (reversing the judgment appealed from (11 B.C. Rep. 402) ) that the secret dealings by the corporation with K. and with respect to the debts and securities were, constructively, a fraud against both K. and M.; that the release of the principal debtor discharged M. as surety, and that he was entitled to recover the surplus of what the corporation received applicable to the notes indorsed by him as money had and received by the corporation to and for his use.\nHeld, by Maclennan J. that, on proper application of all the money received, the corporation had got more than sufficient to satisfy the amount for which M. was surety and that the surplus received in excess of what was due upon the notes was, in equity, received for the use of M. and could be recovered by him on equitable principles or as money had and received in an action at law.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J. and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe action was brought, in May, 1903, for a declaration that the plaintiff was discharged from any liability to the corporation as indorser and surety for the amount of four promissory notes for $2,500 each, made by one James Cooper Keith in favour of Rand Brothers, indorsed by them and on which the plaintiff had become a second indorser, at the request of Rand Brothers and for their accommodation, at the time they were discounted, in 1892, by the said corporation.\nThe circumstances material to the issues raised on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAylesworth K.C. and Deacon, for the appellant.\nDavis K.C. for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This appeal is allowed with costs. I concur in the reasons stated by my brother Idington.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Idington.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree generally in the reasoning and conclusion of Duff J. in the court below and concur in the judgment prepared by my brother Idington. I desire only to add a few words.\nThe relation in which the parties stood towards each other and towards the principal debtor Keith at the time the offer of compromise was made by the defendant corporation to him in February, 1900, was this. Keith owed the corporation about $33,527.94. The corporation held in their hands the proceeds of certain collateral securities which Milne, the appellant, and a surety for the payment of $10,000 forming part of the $33,527.94, had deposited with them. These proceeds had been carried by the corporation to the credit of a suspense account opened in Milne's name, or earmarked with his name, but had not been appropriated by them to the credit of the notes which Milne had indorsed as surety. Milne was a second indorser of the notes and his indorsement was unknown to Keith as was also the fact of the former having deposited the collateral securities with the respondent and that their proceeds were then standing to the credit of the suspense account.\nIn August, 1900, some months after the offer of compromise had been made to Keith, he obtained and deposited in a bank in Victoria the $15,000 which the corporation had offered to accept in full discharge of his indebtedness and notified it of the facts of his readiness to carry out their offer. The manager, however, did not at once absolutely accept, but intimated that he would probably do so. It was not, however, until the beginning of November or the last of Octo- ber, 1901, that the corporation actually executed the papers carrying out the offer of compromise and received the $15,000 bargained for, although the papers are dated as of August, 1900, when Keith deposited his money and notified the corporation of the fact.\nThe reasons for the delay appeared to be the corporation manager's hope of obtaining from the sureties of Keith\u2014Milne and one Rand, who had each deposited collateral with the corporation\u2014the full amount of the debt due to them.\nMilne, however, was kept in ignorance of the negotiations and agreement respecting the compromise with Keith and never had any knowledge of them until long after they were finally completed.\nKeith, on the other hand, up to the time of his discharge had no knowledge that Milne had indorsed his notes for $10,000 and was surety for their payment.\nIn March, 1901, the corporation gave a memorandum to Milne shewing a large amount as due from him on his suretyship contract and, in the following May, they brought suit against him to recover the amount. It was not, however, until March, 1902, long after the receipt of the $15,000 from Keith and the assignment over to his nominees of the judgments and mortgages they held from Keith, that the corporation proceeded with their suit against Milne. They then delivered their statement of claim in the action to which Milne pleaded the Statute of Limitations, and the release of the principal debtor. Upon this the corporation discontinued that action and in giving his evidence on the trial of this suit the manager swore that he was only \"running a bluff\" upon Milne in filing the statement of claim.\nA day or two before receiving the $15,000 from Keith and handing over to his nominees the assign- ment of the mortgages and judgments they held, the corporation respondent made the entries in their books transferring the amount standing to the credit of Milne in the suspense account in respect of the shares and debentures they had received from him as collateral, to the credit of the notes he had indorsed for Keith.\nBut even then, in November, 1901, when getting as he thought his full discharge, Keith knew nothing of Milne having indorsed his notes or deposited any collaterals with the corporation as security for them. He thought he was being absolutely discharged, while if the respondent corporation's contention was to prevail, he would, as a matter of law, be still liable to Milne his surety for the monies the latter paid into the suspense account and which the corporation on the day before executing the papers appropriated to Keith's indebtedness. A legal fraud was, therefore, being perpetrated on Keith if that appropriation was held to be good and he became liable to his surety Milne for the amount.\nLooking, therefore, at the substance of the agreement made between the corporation respondent and Keith their principal debtor for his absolute discharge, in the light of the correspondence and exhibits produced in evidence as well as the oral evidence of the manager of the corporation and of Keith and Milne, and remembering the relative positions the parties occupied towards each other and the ignorance of the principal debtor Keith of Milne's suretyship or deposit of collaterals to secure payment of the amount, or of the appropriation of the proceeds of those collaterals by the corporation towards the specified debt which he thought he was discharging for $15,000, it seems to me, that the offer of the corporation made to Keith and subsequently carried out must be construed as having reference to the time when the parties intended the discharge to take effect.\nNo appropriation of the amount now in dispute had then been made by the respondent, and any subsequent attempt to do so secretly and without Keith's knowledge and so to impose a liability upon him from which all parties thought he had been discharged would be a fraud.\nIn discharging Keith no reservation of the corporation's rights as against sureties was made and his discharge, of course, operated as a discharge of his sureties.\nIf the secret appropriation after the offer and its practical acceptance was illegal as against Keith it must also be so as against Milne, who had no notice or knowledge of Keith's discharge and who from the time when that discharge must be held to relate to the date of the assignments to Keith's nominees, was entitled to have his collateral securities returned to him or their proceeds paid over to him.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant indorsed four promissory notes made by one Keith to Rand Bros. for $2,500 each. This indorsement was for the accommodation of Rand Bros. and renewed in November, 1892. Rand Bros. and Keith each transferred to the respondents by way of security for payment of these renewals, collaterals consisting of stock in the Vancouver Gas Company.\nThe respondents sold by arrangement with appellant this stock to the wife of the appellant and the money received from such sale was placed by respondents to the credit of a suspense account to be held in lieu of the stock to await the results of time, either in the way of payment by Keith of these notes, or the realization of hopes Keith had of an improved financial condition.\nThis was done in 1894 and the accounts meantime stood in the same position till after the 28th February, 1900, save that certain accretions of this stock came to the hands of respondents as the holders of the stock, or having been such were by virtue of the arrangements respecting the same entitled to receive and hold such accretions.\nIt is not now necessary to repeat the story of the dealings of all these parties and amplify all that was done with these collateral funds. It is sufficient to say, that on the said 28th of February the part of such funds now in question had never been appropriated by the respondents to the payment of these promissory notes or the judgment which had been recovered against Keith thereon, on 1st October, 1893.\nThere was another claim of respondent's against Keith in respect of which they recovered judgment about the same time for $21,180.23.\nUpon this judgment there was received by respondents from various collateral sources money applicable to its payment. Apart from these payments there was nothing done in respect of said judgment, until in February, 1900, when Keith found himself in a position to negotiate for a compromise of all these claims against him.\nThe respondents' agent then wrote as the result of these negotiations the following letter:\nVANCOUVER, B.C., 28th Feb., 1900.\nJ. C. Keith, Esq., City.\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to our negotiations and conversations in connection with your indebtedness to this corporation, amounting to $33,527.94, as per annexed statement, if you can make arrangements to pay me some time in March or April the sum of not less than $15,000, I will transfer to you or your nominee the following securities and free you from all liability to this corporation, viz.:\nJudgment 2nd October, 1893\n$21,180.23\nJudgment 1st October, 1893\n10,634.23\nMortgages and interest amounting to $30,339.32, covering lots 612, 615, 616, south half of lot 620,614, all in North Vancouver.\nBlocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of District lot 367.\nLots 14, 15, 16 and 17, Block 67, subdivision 185, City of Vancouver; also Anglo B.C. Packing Co. 50 preference shares, and Anglo B.C. Packing Co. 50 ordinary shares.\nYours faithfully,\nI have said that up to this time at least there was nothing done to appropriate the funds now in question and lying at the credit of the suspense account.\nIt is, however, urged that inasmuch as this letter states the total sum due for both claims at $33,527.94, we ought to infer that this amount is the result of some such prior appropriation of these funds as I have said was not made.\nThe able counsel for respondents was not able to shew any such calculation resulting from this supposed appropriation he contended for as could shew to my mind any semblance of results therefrom that could be made in any way the approximate equivalent of this sum of $33,527.94.\nThe \"annexed statement\" referred to in this letter was not produced. No attempt was made at the trial or on the reference to shew how it was made up or how this result of total was arrived at.\nIf such a statement ever existed and was shewn to Keith when negotiating for this compromise, as would have proved an appropriation then or theretofore upon the said notes or judgment to Keith's knowledge of the fund now in question, then the respondents could by using that in evidence have removed any ground of complaint on the part of Keith and de- stroyed the slightest hope of appellant succeeding in his present suit. Yet not only is there no proof of such a statement or such knowledge thereof on Keith's part, but also an entire absence of any attempt on trial or reference or in any way to shew such facts.\nThe commercial honour of respondents was at stake as well as the money. The plain palpable consequences of such proof being produced would have spurred up the respondents' intelligent agent to have fully demonstrated this alleged appropriation if possible.\nNot only is he silent on the point, but the application of the other credits on the larger judgment and the computation of the interest thereon when these credits are properly reckoned with, results in a sum which when added to the sum of $10,634.23 (stated in this letter as amount of the judgment on the notes in question here) produces almost the identical total of $33,527.94.\nWhat is the proper inference to be drawn from such a finding? Clearly to my mind that in respect of the larger judgment there was from time to time an appropriation of the moneys received from collateral sums applicable thereto.\nAnd there was this further that the products of the collaterals applicable to the smaller judgment had been kept as placed originally in suspense and unappropriated.\nIn consequence of this condition of things, the respondents' agent in writing this letter and using the material before him counted the smaller judgment at its face value and the larger one at its proper value. He either hesitated as to what was to be done with the suspense account, failed to observe it or did observe it and stated incorrectly the amount due on the smaller judgment. Whatever he did or whatever caused him to do what he did, he certainly did not apply this suspense account to liquidate the judgment to which in certain events it was intended to have become applicable.\nI assume, therefore, that there was not any appropriation of these funds until after the negotiations had so advanced that common honesty required the implementing of the agreement arrived at between Keith and the respondents whether the law bound them or not.\nThe obvious purpose of the placing of these funds in a suspense account was to await the final condition of the relations between the creditors and their principal debtor.\nPenetrating, as far as one can, through the war of words and discarding the improbable contentions put forward by either side on this point, that condition or that period had arrived when the funds in this suspense account had to be dealt with.\nCandour and that good faith a surety is entitled to, and an over-burthened debtor is also entitled to, required that both should have been told exactly what the facts then were, and what the creditor proposed doing.\nClearly, failure to do this by the surety was a breach of the spirit of the arrangement between the creditors and surety whereby this suspense account was created to secure the debt.\nIt is idle to refer to the assignment, to Cooper & Smith, of these judgments and all the securities therefor, as if a sale thereof had been made to strangers.\nThey were but the nominees and trustees of Keith for whose benefit the whole negotiations were conducted by him and not by them. The sole purpose of the dealings in question was to obtain the entire and final release of Keith from his obligations to the respondents.\nThe agent of the respondents, who carried on for them these negotiations, plainly admits this.\nThe desired result failed, if respondents can retain the appellant's money and drive him to a suit against Keith, and Keith in turn be driven to follow the respondents to complete his release.\nI, with great respect, think that the majority of the court below failed to keep in view the purpose of Keith and the relation of Cooper & Smith to Keith instead of treating them as strangers, and thereby failed to reach the correct result.\nI do not think that the question of whether the bargain made was binding until carried out has much to do with the matter.\nI doubt if it can be said in law that all that transpired up to the delivery of the assignment could have prevented the respondents from receding from the negotiations.\nI think, however, that there is a great deal of force in the view that the assignment duly executed in September, 1900, ready to be delivered upon the payment of the consideration therefor, immediately upon its delivery related back to the time of its execution when all the negotiations had been completed and everything done except delivery and payment.\nThe result of that view would be to leave the appellant's money in respondents' hands unappropriated and owing him as he was in such case freed from obligation by the release of his principal.\nI would leave the matter there, but for a doubt I have, whether or not the law of relation back, in the case of escrows, can properly be applied to this assignment, when all the facts are borne in mind.\nI prefer to rest upon this; that the surety can at all times appeal to the equitable jurisdiction of the court to have his principal as soon as the debt becomes due, and without any payment of the debt, ordered to pay the debt and relieve the surety; and that such right, if exercised now by bringing an action of that sort against Keith and joining the respondents and their assignees, could only have one result, and that would be that the respondents here would, upon Keith shewing that they had discharged him, be ordered to pay over to appellant the money now in question.\nSee Wolmershausen v. Gullick[2], where there is a most exhaustive and instructive judgment of Mr. Justice Wright dealing with the first proposition put forward as to the rights of a surety.\nThe case of Law v. East India Co.s[3] shews the power the court can exercise to protect a surety and adjust the rights of him and his creditors.\nThe money now in question could no doubt be ordered, as there, into court to abide the result and be paid out as and where the court found the same ought to go.\nThe rights of sureties in this regard are so much the outcome of the growth of equitable principles that one finds often the test of what would or might be done in case of resort to a court of equity as the best way to find the rights of sureties.\nI merely put forward the possible proceeding I indicate to furnish this illustrative test.\nI think it is clear that the money in question is, under the facts I have dealt with, money in the hands of the respondents which in justice and equity belongs to another, and is recoverable as money had and received; or at all events the court can direct it to be paid to the plaintiff under the plain, palpable facts of the case, once it finds, as I do, no appropriation of it was made until, on the eve of handing over the release of the principal debtor, what looks not unlike a fraudulent appropriation was made.\nThe case of Litt v. Martindale[4] may be referred to for illustration of the principle upon which, in a case of fraud, an action for money had and received may rest. A contract is implied rather than to let improper conduct, fraudulent conduct if such you will, prevail.\nIf there could be said to exist any technical difficulty I would allow the principal Keith to be added as a defendant, for conformity sake, and then grant relief against a dealing of the company that cannot be permitted to stand.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Morrison be restored.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, reversing a judgment of Morrison J. which awarded to the plaintiff two sums of $1,600 and $1,329.95 and interest, and dismissing the action.\nThe plaintiff, as surety, sues the defendants as creditor, to recover the two sums in question, as having been deposited with the defendants by the plaintiff, or received by them from him, to answer the suretyship, and as now recoverable on the ground that the debt has been paid or satisfied by or released to the debtor, without resort to and irrespective of the sums paid by the plaintiff; or on the ground that the debt was satisfied and discharged in full, partly by the debtor and partly by another surety, who was liable to the plaintiff.\nIn the year 1892 the defendants discounted for Messrs. Rand Brothers' four promissory notes of even date and tenor, amounting in all to $10,000, made by one J. C. Keith and indorsed by Rand Brothers, and the plaintiff. The plaintiff's indorsements were made at the request and for the accommodation of Rand Brothers, as was well known to the defendants. About the same time the defendants made another loan to Rand Brothers, to the amount of $20,000, on securities held by them from the same debtor Keith; but this other transaction was unknown to the plaintiff.\nThe notes having been dishonoured at maturity, and the loan of $20,000 not having been paid, actions were brought by the defendants and two judgments were recovered against Keith on the 2nd of October, 1893, one on the four notes indorsed by the plaintiff, for $10,634.23 for debt and costs, and the other upon the other loan made to Rand Brothers for the sum of $21,180.23.\nThe action on the four notes was brought against Rand Brothers and the plaintiff, as well as against Keith, and judgment was recovered against both Keith and Rand Brothers, but the defendants did not then or at any time proceed to judgment against the plaintiff. This forbearance towards the plaintiff, in the first instance, was in consideration of his depositing with the defendants, as security for his liability as indorser, two hundred and fifty shares of Vancouver Gas stock, which was done some time early in the year 1894. Rand Brothers had made a deposit with the defendants of five hundred shares of the same stock as further security when applying for the discount of the notes indorsed by the plaintiff; and they also, when subsequently entering into the $20,000 transaction with the defendants, made a similar deposit of other five hundred shares of the same stock as security for that transaction, in addition to the securities held by them from Keith. Keith, therefore, was the principal debtor, and the person ultimately liable to pay both judgments. Rand Brothers were also liable to the defendants for both, while the plaintiff was only liable for the $10,000 judgment, and was entitled to look to both Keith and Rand Brothers for his indemnity.\nIn the year 1894, after the deposit of those gas shares with the defendants, the Vancouver Gas Company issued to its shareholders certain debentures, by way of dividend or bonus, and the defendants, having received their proportion in respect of the twelve hundred and fifty shares held by them, sold the debentures and received the following sums therefor: On the 9th May, $3,241; on the 18th of June, $3,225; and on the 17th July, 1894, $178.54, amounting in all to $6,646.54. These sums they had a right to appropriate, at the respective times they were received, in due proportion, in satisfaction of the respective judgments recovered by them, that is, two-fifths to the larger judgment and three-fifths to the judgment for which the plaintiff was liable. There is no evidence that they did not so appropriate those sums, and it must be presumed that they did so.\nAfterwards, on the 31st December, 1894, the plaintiff procured the defendants to sell to the plaintiff's wife all the shares held by them as above stated, namely, twelve hundred and fifty shares, for the sum of $8,000, and that sum was received by the defendants and, by arrangement with the plaintiff, was placed to his credit in a suspense account. The plaintiff's evidence of what passed between him and the defendants on that occasion is not very clear, but it is apparent that the money was agreed and intended to be held by way of security in the same manner as the shares had been. Inasmuch as the defendants might have sold and converted the shares at any time and have applied the proceeds upon the debt, they could also, at any time, have done the same with the money deposited in the suspense account. See Commercial Bank of Australia v. Official Assignee of the Estate of John Wilson & Company[5].\nIt is to be observed that although the second deposit of gas shares made by Rand Brothers was made as security for their second loan, the defendants chose to place the proceeds of the whole to the plaintiff's credit in the suspense account. It may be that the defendants might lawfully do that, if they chose so to do, and that neither Keith nor Rand Brothers could object or complain, for they were both debtors in both judgments to the defendants, and the defendants could hold all the securities received by them for one of the debts from either Keith or Rand Brothers until both were paid; and, moreover, not only Keith, but Rand Brothers also were bound to indemnify the plaintiff against his whole liability.\nMatters remained in this position from the 31st December, 1894, until the 28th of February, 1900, except that the defendants had received some payments and dividends from the Keith securities amounting to about 6,000, which they had applied on the larger judgment. In the meantime Rand Brothers had failed and nothing had been received from them. Under these circumstances the defendants, on the 28th day of February, 1900, wrote a letter to Keith, the principal debtor, in both judgments, upon which the plaintiff places great reliance. He says that this letter and what was afterwards done by the defendants and Keith in pursuance of it discharged him, the plaintiff, from all liability as surety and that, as a result, he is entitled to recover from the defendants the proceeds of the sale of the two hundred and fifty shares deposited by him as security, and also a proportionate part of the proceeds of the sale of the gas debentures, and these are the two sums for which he obtained judgment in the first instance, namely, $1,600, the purchase money of his two hundred and fifty shares, and $1,328.90, one-fifth of the proceeds of the debentures.\nThe letter of the 28th of February, 1900, so far as material, is as follows:\nWith reference to our negotiations and conversations in connection with your indebtedness to this corporation, amounting to $33,527.94, as per annexed statement, if you can make arrangements to pay me some time in March or April the sum of not less than $15,000, I will transfer to you or your nominee the following securities and free you from all liability to this corporation:\u2014\nJudgment 2nd October, 1893\n$21,180.23\nJudgment 2nd October, 1893\n10,634.23\nMortgages and interest amounting to $30,339.32, covering certain lots, etc., etc.\nYours faithfully,\nThe statement here referred to is not produced nor was any evidence of its purport given.\nNow this proposal, on the face of it, is to accept a less sum in satisfaction of a greater, and, I think, it is not pretended by any one that, at that date, the whole debt owing by Keith to the defendants did not very largely exceed $15,000, the sum offered to be accepted in discharge of his whole debt. The promise would, therefore, on that ground alone, be nudum pactum, and void. Not only so, but the time for payment was limited to the following months of March or April, and nothing was done in the way of providing the money until long after these months had elapsed. That proposal, except as to the time of performance, is what was ultimately carried out, and that was not done until the 6th November, 1901, when, by separate instruments executed on that day, but dated the 20th August, 1900, the two judgments of 2nd October, 1893, and the other securities in their hands belonging to Keith were assigned by the defendants to nominees of Keith and they received a sum exceeding $19,000, the excess over $15,000 being for advances made by the defendants to Keith to pay arrears of taxes.\nWhile it is proved orally that both judgments against Keith, as well as the other securities held by the defendants from him, for those judgments were in fact assigned to Keith's nominees on the 6th of November, 1901, the only instrument relating to that transaction which has been produced is an assignment by deed of the $10,634.23 judgment, as already mentioned.\nIt bears date the 20th of August, 1900, and it recites the judgment and the sum for which it was recovered and proceeds thus:\nAnd whereas the party of the first part has agreed to assign the said judgment and all benefit to arise therefrom, either at law or in equity, unto the said parties of the second part in manner hereinafter expressed; Now this indenture witnesseth, that, in pursuance of the said agreement and in consideration of the sum of $10,634.23 of lawful money of Canada to the said party of the first part in hand well and truly paid by the said parties of the second part at or before the execution hereof, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, the said party of the first part hath granted, bargained, sold, etc. * * * to the parties of the second part all the said judgment and the money due or to grow due by virtue thereof for principal, interest and costs.\nIt was contended very strongly that, although the transaction was not carried into effect until the 6th November, 1901, it must be construed to relate back to the date of the letter of the 28th February, 1900, and although the deeds were dated the same day as the letter, and although the transaction finally carried out was substantially what was proposed by the letter written nearly two years before, I think that during the interval there was no agreement between the parties, and that there was no moment, during all that time, during which the defendants were legally bound to do what they ultimately did. It was argued that this transaction of the 6th November was merely an assignment of securities to third persons and had no effect in discharging Keith's indebtedness. I think, however, upon the whole of the evidence, that it was in fact and in law a settlement between the defendants and their debtor, Keith, although, in form, it was an assignment of the debt to third persons.\nBut the proceeds of the debentures, as I have pointed out, had been applied upon the debt when received in 1894 and the proceeds of the plaintiff's shares had been so applied, at latest, on the 31st October, 1901.\nIf, therefore, this appeal depended on whether the proceeds of the plaintiff's shares and relative debentures had or had not in fact been appropriated to the debt, before the settlement with Keith, I should have thought the plaintiff could not succeed.\nBut, I think, he is entitled to succeed on another ground. I have already described the form of the transaction between the defendants and Keith in relation to the judgment in question. It is proved that at that time they actually received from him, or on his behalf, the sum of $15,000, and they acknowledged by deed that what they received for this particular judgment was the sum of $10,634.23. The defendants had a right to appropriate that sum to that extent to that judgment and there could be no more solemn or effectual appropriation of so much of the money received to that particular judgment debt. I think the defendants cannot be heard to say, as between themselves and Keith, that they did not, either on the 20th of August, 1900, or on the 6th of November, 1901, actually receive from him, as and for a payment of that judgment against him, the sum of $10,634.23. Keith was the principal debtor. He owed the whole amount of the judgment to somebody. So far as he knew, the only persons to whom he owed it all were the defendants. There is no evidence that he knew that the defendants had either sureties or security, except what he had himself given, for the debt or any part of it, or knew that they had received any payment on account from any one. Under these circumstances, Keith paid that sum of $10,634.23 to the defendants, and they received it as and for a payment on that judgment debt.\nNow, it follows, in my opinion, that, if at that time, by reason of the payments which they had received from Rand or the plaintiff, or from the securities received from them for that judgment debt, there was not so much due as $10,634.23, whatever was received more than was due was in equity received for the plaintiff and Rand Brothers, according to their respective rights as between themselves, and was money clearly recoverable from them on equitable principles, or as money had and received in an action at law.\nThe plaintiff has a right to recover his money from somebody. If he were to sue Keith, his answer would be that he had paid the debt himself to the extent of $10,634.23, without knowledge that the plaintiff had anything to do with it.\nThe question then is: What sum was due to the defendants on the judgment in question when they received the payment? It may be that the plaintiff has a right to regard the payment as made on the 28th February, 1900, but, in any view, as made on the 6th of November, 1901.\nI have made a computation, allowing interest at four per cent. on the judgment from date of recovery to the 23rd of July, 1894, when the rate was changed by statute to six per cent., and, applying the payments received from seven hundred and fifty shares of gas stock and the relative debentures at the dates when the same were received, and I find that the sum due on the judgment was only $3,314.61, or the defendants received $7,321.38, out of which to repay the plaintiff what they had received from him. Or, if we compute what remained due on the judgment by applying there on the sums received from Rand Brothers five hundred shares and debentures alone, and as if they had never applied the plaintiff's shares or debentures at all, but held them for him, they would still have received $3,081.39 more than was due. The defendants have received from the debtor, in my opinion, more than enough to repay the sums received from the plaintiff and for which he, in the first place, recovered a judgment, and, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment should be restored. For the satisfaction of the parties I append my computations.\nComputation applying the sums received from plaintiff's two hundred and fifty shares and Rand Brothers five hundred shares and relative debentures:\nJudgment, Oct. 2, 1893\n$10,634.23\nInt. to 9 May, 1894, 219d, at 4%\n255.22\nPaid 9 May, 1894\n$10,889.45\n1,944.60\nInterest from 9 May, 1894, to 18 June,\n40 d. at 4%\n8,944.85\n39.20\nPaid 18 June, 1894\n8,984.05\n1,935.00\nInt. 18 June to 11 July, 23 d at 4%\n7,049.05\n17.76\nPaid 11 July, 1894\n7,066.81\n107.12\nInt. 18 June to 11 July, 23 d at 4%\nInt. at 6% 23 July to 31 Dec. 157 d\n6,959.69\n9.15\n179.59\nCash on sale of 750 shares\n7,148.43\n4,800.00\nInt. 31 Dec., 1894, to 6 Nov., 1901,\n6y. 10m. 6d\n2,348.43\n965.18\n$3,314.61 Computation applying only to Rand Brothers' 500 shares and relative debentures:\nJudgment, Oct. 2,\n1893 Int. to 9 May, 1894\n$10,634.23\n255.22\nPaid 9 May\n10,889.45\n1,296.40\nInt. 9 May to 18 June, 40d. at 4%\n9,593.05\n42.05\nPaid 18 June\n9,635.10\n1,290.00\nInt. 18 June to 11 July, 23d. at 4%\n8,345.10\n21.28\nPaid 11 July\n8,366.38\n70.40\nInt. to 23 July, 12d. at 4%\nInt. 23 july,\u201994, 157d. at 6%\n8,295.98\n11.04\n216.68\nCash on sale of 500 shares\n8,523.70\n3,200.00\nInt. to 6 Nov., 1901, 6y. 10m. 6d\n5,323.70\n2,229.14\n$7,552.84\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

A. Ry. Co. and the Ottawa Electric Ry. Co. By an agreement between the Electric Company and the city the company was given the right to run its cars along Bank Street and over the railway crossing, paying therefor a specific sum per mile. The company appealed from that portion of the order, making them contribute to the cost of the subway, contending that the city was obliged to furnish them with a street over which to run their cars and they could not be subjected to greater burdens than those imposed by the agreement.\nHeld, that the Electric Co. was a company \"interested or affected\" in or by the said work within the meaning of sec. 47 of the said Railway Act, and could properly be ordered to contribute to the cost thereof. Held, further, that there was nothing in the agreement between said company and the city to prevent the Board making said order or to alter the liability of the company so to contribute.\nAppeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, by leave of said Board, directing that a subway be made under the track of the Canada Atlantic Railway Co. where it crosses Bank Street in the City of Ottawa and that the cost thereof be apportioned among the city, the Canada Atlantic Railway. Co. and the Ottawa Electric Railway Co.\nThe order of the Board was made on the application of the City of Ottawa. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted the Ottawa Electric Railway Co. as follows:\n\"THE BOARD OF RAILWAY COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA.\nMEETING AT OTTAWA.\nTuesday, the fifth day of September, A.D. 1905.\n\"Present:\nA.

Whether the Ottawa Electric Railway Company was entitled under said agreement, to have the City of Ottawa furnish to the Ottawa Electric Railway Company, for the use of the said company in the exercise of its running powers, a street or highway known as Bank Street, including that portion of the said street where it is crossed by the tracks of the Canada Atlantic Railway Company (either with the existing grade or with a changed grade as proposed), upon terms as to payment or compensation as laid down in the said agreement, and whether, if such was the effect of the said agreement, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company should have been ordered to contribute to the cost of the work thereby ordered to be constructed.\n(Sgd.)

Whether by reason of the terms of the agreement between the Ottawa Electric Railway Company and the City of Ottawa, dated the 28th day of June, 1893, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company should have been ordered to contribute to the cost of the work thereby ordered to be constructed.\n2. Whether the Ottawa Electric Railway Company was entitled under said agreement to have the City of Ottawa furnish to the Ottawa Electric Railway Company for the use of the said company in the exercise of its running powers a street or highway known as Bank Street, including that portion of the said street where it is crossed by the tracks of the Canada Atlantic Railway (either with the existing grade or a changed grade as proposed), upon terms as to payment or compensation as laid down in the said agreement, and whether, if such was the effect of the said agreement, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company should have been ordered to contribute to the cost of the work thereby ordered to be constructed.\nThis appeal is, therefore, to be determined by the construction of the said agreement of the 28th day of June, 1893, and unless there is something to be found therein entitling the Ottawa Electric Railway Company to exemption from contribution to the cost of the construction of the said subway the appeal must fail.\nMr. Henderson in a lengthy argument contended that the Board of Railway Commissioners had not on a proper construction of sections 186 and 187 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" jurisdiction to make the order appealed from at all.\nWe were unable to appreciate the force of Mr. Henderson's reasoning on this point, and considered the provisions of the Act referred to broad and ample enough in their terms to enable the Board to act, although that point was not within the terms of the order allowing the appeal. Mr. Henderson's contention on the agreement was that by its terms the Electric Company could not be obliged to contribute anything to the cost of any work ordered by the Board of Railway Commissioners for the protection of the public at the crossings of the city streets by the Canada Atlantic Railway and the Ottawa Electric Railway, and that it was entitled to have the street in question provided for it without the imposition of any additional burden.\nThe clause in the agreement on which Mr. Henderson mainly relied was the 30th. It reserves to the corporation the right to take up the streets traversed by the railway for the purpose of altering the grades thereof or for any purpose within the powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the corporation without any compensation to the company and\nwithout being liable to the companies for damages occasioned thereby to the company or the works connected therewith.\nThe argument then was that inasmuch as the application to the Board of Railway Commissioners for the construction of this subway was made at the instance of the city it must be taken to be such action relating to the alternative of the grades of the street as is contemplated in and provided for in the agreement, and that the terms of the agreement with reference to these works and alterations preclude the imposition upon the electric railway company of any of their cost.\nWe did not entertain any doubt whatever on the point at the argument, and did not deem it necessary to call on the other side.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners under the 187th section does not in any way depend upon the person or company making application under it. We think the Board could, on giving proper notice, invoke that jurisdiction of its own mere motion in the public interest and without waiting for the intervention of any one.\nThe construction of the subway ordered cannot be said to be an alteration of the grade of the street within the municipal power of the corporation as provided for in the 30th section of the agreement.\nOn the contrary it is a work in the interest and for the benefit of all parties concerned, ordered by a paramount authority having the fullest jurisdiction over the subject matter, whether invoked by \"any party interested or affected,\" or whether acted on of its own motion without application.\nThe two railways, the Canada Atlantic and the Ottawa Electric, were under the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament as works declared to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nIn a case lately before us, City of Toronto v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5], we decided that the municipality was a \"party interested\" within the meaning of the Act there in question, and liable to pay the proportion of the cost of the protective works directed by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council to be paid by it.\nThe words \"party interested\" have by the present Act, section 47, been amended to read \"party interested or affected,\" and we have no doubt whatever that in the case before us the Board had full jurisdiction to act, that its order binds alike the corporation and the two railway companies affected, and that there is nothing whatever in the agreement between the city and the electric company which can in any way alter the liability of the company to pay its share of the cost of this work ordered by a paramount authority to whose orders as such the company was subject.\nWe, therefore, answer the first question in the affirmative, reading the words \"should have been ordered\" as \"could have been ordered,\" which seems to us to cover both questions submitted.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCracken, Henderson & McDougal.\nSolicitor for the respondents, City of Ottawa: Taylor McVeity.\nSolicitors for the respondents, C.

The co-trustee replied concurring in said reasons and consenting to the proposed sale. The Toronto trustee afterwards had negotiations with the solicitors of G. and at their suggestion offered to sell the same property to G. for $13,000 but without further notice to his co-trustee. The offer was accepted by the solicitors whereupon the party who had offered $12,000 raised his offer to $14,000 and the trustee notified the solicitors of G. that the sale to him was cancelled. In a suit by G. for specific performance:\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (9 Ont. L.R. 522) that the letter written by the co-trustee in St. Mary\u2019s contained a consent to the particular sale mentioned therein only and could not be construed as a general consent to a sale to any person even for a higher price. Even if it could there were circumstances which occurred between the time it was written and the signing of the contract with G., which should have been communicated to the co-trustee before he could be bound by said contract.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court and restoring that given at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nT.F. McMahon and William Walsh, of Toronto, and Louis P. Walsh, of St. Mary\u2019s, Ont., were trustees of an estate and on Sept. 1st, 1903, McMahon wrote the following letter to Louis P. Walsh:\nMy Dear Lou:\u2014\nAccording to the terms of the will of the late Mary Furlong, we are obliged to sell all her property on or before February, 1905. As times are so good here at present and as there is a possibility of further temperance legislation Mr. Walsh and I thought it wise to sell the hotel only now. We advertised the hotel for sale early in August, but received only one bid, namely, from the present tenant, William Hammill, for $11,500. We interviewed all the brewers and have not succeeded in getting another bid. H.H. Williams made a valuation and valued it at $9,600 as a going concern having a license, or $6,600 without a license. Hammill will give us $12,000, and we think it is a good price and think of accepting the offer. Of course, the property is paying better at present, as we now get $1,100 a year. We tried to get permission to hold it until the youngest heir is of age, but both our solicitors and the official guardian tell us that no judge would relieve us of responsibility, and that if any loss resulted from holding it we might be held responsible. Mr. Power objects to selling it, but he has no authority in the matter, and we think his judgment is bad, in fact we think we have an excellent offer, and there is danger of not getting nearly so much a year or more from this time. Will you kindly let me know your opinion at once? Are you willing that we should accept $12,000? Hoping to hear from you promptly, and with kindest regards.\nOn the 7th of September, 1903, Louis P. Walsh replied as follows:\nDear Doctor:\u2014\nYours received re the Furlong estate. Taking everything into consideration I think that it would be wise to accept Hammill\u2019s offer. As you say that further temperance legislation is possible, that house is as likely to be cut off as any, in which case, as you say, it would not be worth nearly as much. Another proof of its value is the fact of your having advertised it and receiving no offers, even from the brewers; if there was a snap in it they would soon grab it. Under the circumstances I think it would be better to accept. The reason that I did not answer sooner is that there was a friend of mine, living in this neighbourhood, who, a while ago, thought of going to Toronto to buy out a hotel. I saw him Saturday and he has changed his mind.\nThe third trustee, Wm. Walsh, was a consenting party to the above and to what was done by his co-trustee McMahon afterwards.\nBefore these letters were written an agent of the appellant Gibb had made some inquiries about the Wheat Sheaf Hotel from McMahon, and on Sept. 14th the latter, having ascertained by telephone that Gibb would consider an offer for the property, wrote the following letter to his (Gibb\u2019s) solicitors:\nGentlemen:\u2014\nIn reply to your request to quote for your client our price for the property, known as the Wheat Sheaf Hotel, corner King and Bathurst Streets, we beg to say that we are prepared to accept thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000) for the same.\nThis offer lapses after 24 hours.\nThis offer the solicitors accepted by letter, which was personally delivered to McMahon on the same day.\nMcMahon did not notify his co-trustee Louis P. Walsh of his intention to make a sale of the property to Gibb, but relied on the letter of Sept. 7th as his authority to sell to any person for $12,000 or more.\nOn Sept. 19th the solicitors of the trustees wrote the following letter to the appellant\u2019s solicitors:\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nDr. T.F. McMahon, of Bathurst Street, has called on us with regard to this matter and instructed us to write you. When he wrote you on or about the 14th inst. offering to take $13,000 for the property he acted in good faith and still desires to do so, but unfortunately the devisees to whom the property belongs have entered a very strong protest against the property being sold, on the ground principally, that the income from the purchase money would not amount to half of the income from the property itself by way of rental. It appears that Mr. Hammill has agreed to rent the property for a number of years at $1,100 per year and he pays the taxes. The result is that our client\u2019s co-trustees have refused to join in the deal with him, and hence he is powerless, as you know one of several trustees cannot act alone in a matter of this kind.\nOur client regrets very much the position matters have assumed as above related, but there is no help for it. Our client is, therefore, obliged to declare the deal off, which we hereby do on his behalf.\nYours very truly,\nHearn & Slattery.\nP.S.\u2014Under the circumstances our client feels that he should pay you your taxable costs which you have lawfully incurred in this matter. If you will kindly let us have the bill of these costs we will have them paid at once.\nH. & S.\nThe appellant then brought an action for specific performance of the contract by McMahon to sell to him. The trial judge dismissed the action holding that the letter of Louis P. Walsh only authorized a sale of the hotel property to the person mentioned therein and was not an authority to sell to any other. The Divisional Court reversed his judgment and decreed specific performance. The Court of Appeal restored the judgment at the trial.\nC.H. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nAylesworth K.C. and Delamere K.C. for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal involves only a question of fact settled by two courts. Did the three trustees agree to sell the land in question? Two certainly did so, but has the third, Louis Walsh, also consented? There may be reasons for doubt upon this point. But I am certainly very far from being clear that he did not consent. For that reason, I do not feel disposed to disturb the judgment appealed from. DAVIES J.\u2014This is an action to enforce specific performance of an agreement alleged to have been made by the three defendants, who were trustees for certain infant children, with the plaintiff for the sale to him of an hotel property in Toronto for $13,000.\nThe agreement was in the form of a letter to the plaintiff from and signed by one of the trustees. It was common ground that the offer had been made with the authority of another of the trustees. It was at once accepted by the plaintiff and if the two trustees making it did so with the authority of their co-trustee it would, of course, be binding. This third trustee lived at St. Mary\u2019s, in Ontario; the other two in Toronto.\nThe authority to the Toronto trustees to act for the trustee living in St. Mary\u2019s was, it was contended, contained in a letter written by the latter to one of the former in answer to one asking his opinion and judgment on a proposed sale to the tenant of the property, one Hammill.\nThe questions to be decided are whether that letter contained a general authority from Walsh, the trustee living in St. Mary\u2019s, to his co-trustees to sell for $12,000 or anything they could get over, or whether it was to be limited to the facts and conditions set out in the letter to which it was an answer; and, secondly, whether any new facts or circumstances happened after the 1st September when Louis Walsh was asked for his opinion as a trustee which should have been submitted to him before any new contract was entered into with other parties by his co\u2011trustees purporting to bind him.\nThe Court of Appeal, unanimously reversing the unanimous decision of the Divisional Court and re- storing that of the trial judge, dismissed the action, and I agree with that disposition of the case.\nThe letter from Louis Walsh to his co-trustee must not be construed as a letter from a principal to his agent would be and the case of Ireland v. Livingston[2], in 1872, relied on by the Divisional Court has therefore no application to the facts before us.\nThese letters were those of consultation between independent trustees, the judgment of each one of whom the cestuis qui trustent had a right to. Louis Walsh\u2019s letter of the 4th Sept. to his co-trustee, which is relied upon as authority for the agreement alleged to have been entered into with plaintiff, must be construed with strict reference to the facts contained in the letter of his co-trustee to which it was an answer. He expresses his opinion that in view of the facts and circumstances stated to him the offer of Hammill for $12,000 should be accepted. These were \u201cthe possibility of further temperance legislation,\u201d the call for tenders resulting in only one being put in, namely, the tenant Hammill for $11,500, the fact that his co\u2011trustees had \u201cinterviewed all the brewers without succeeding in getting a bid,\u201d the valuation by Williams (a real estate valuator) of the hotel as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d at $9,600 and Hammill\u2019s advance upon his tender to $12,000, which the Toronto trustees thought should be accepted.\nNow looking at the two letters together as a written consultation between two trustees as to the exercise of an independent judgment or discretion vested in each of them I cannot construe Louis Walsh\u2019s letter as in any sense an attempt to delegate such a trust as he held.\nThat, of course, he could not do unless in cases of moral necessity arising from the usages of mankind to employ an agent.\nSpeight v. Gaunt[3] at page 19; Re Gasquoine[4]; Re Weall[5].\nNeither reasonableness nor necessity required any such general delegation or even such limited delegation as is contended for in the present case. The trustees in Toronto were in a position directly to communicate with their co-trustee in St. Mary\u2019s by either telephone or telegraph, and when circumstances occurred which satisfied them they should not sell to Hammill, but to another person for a higher sum, they were bound to submit these circumstances to him for his consideration.\nA material change of circumstances occurred which convinced the two resident trustees that there were other and better probable purchasers, one of whom at least was considering an offer of $13,000 made to him by William Walsh, one of the trustees, He was the now plaintiff, a person described as \u201cone who was accustomed to buy and sell hotel property.\u201d\nWithout consulting their co-trustee they make him a written offer which he, through his solicitor, promptly accepts and now seeks to enforce a specific performance of on the ground that Louis Walsh\u2019s previous letter of 4th Sept., with reference to the facts submitted to him re Hammill\u2019s offer of $12,000, bound him to agree to this subsequent sale.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal and the trial judge that it did not and that the changed circumstances demanded that he should be consulted and should concur before another sale was made or the estate as such bound to another sale. The first intimation Louis Walsh had of any negotiations or attempted sale subsequent to those with Hammill for $12,000 was when the latter and a friend waited upon him urging his ratification of an agreement they had made with Wm. Walsh, his co-trustee, for $14,000. He afterwards learned of the alleged sale to plaintiff for $13,000. He promptly and properly refused to do anything until he had time for inquiry and consideration and so far as he is concerned it is agreed he is without blame.\nThe plaintiff knew that Dr. McMahon, who wrote him the offer of sale and signed on behalf of the estate, was only one of several trustees. He took the risk of his being authorized to make the offer. It now turns out that he was not so authorized to act for Louis Walsh, who never was consulted with regard to it, and who before he knew of it knew also that others were willing to give more money. Unless Louis Walsh, therefore, was bound by his previous letter he would be guilty of a breach of trust in selling for a less price to the plaintiff than he knew others were willing to pay. Not being so bound, in my opinion, the action must fail and the appeal be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the Court of Appeal rightly restored the judgment of Mr. Justice Street. I accept his reasons. I share his regrets. The defendant McMahon and William Walsh treated plaintiff unfairly. McMahon\u2019s action deserves stronger language to describe it. Plaintiff\u2019s solicitor explained to him that plaintiff refrained from making an offer lest it should be hawked about to raise the price on another, and he asked for an offer which his client could accept or reject and end the matter. McMahon made an offer which he now says he had no authority to make.\nGibb, trusting his good faith and that he had not neglected his duties as a trustee to be armed with authority before offering, accepted, and McMahon thereby got just what Gibb desired to withhold from him and no doubt used it.\nHe neglected to inform his co-trustee, Louis Walsh, of all this, when the plain duty of one in McMahon\u2019s position was not only to have informed his co-trustee, but also to have got from him, if he were willing to give it, his assent to the proposal. It is not often a man can accomplish so much within so narrow a compass.\nIf I could see my way clear to the application here of the purely agency case of Ireland v. Livingston[6], at page 416, I would, considering these peculiar actions of McMahon, be much puzzled to find or to be assured of the element of good faith in McMahon\u2019s conduct so necessary as an essential part of the legal proposition formulated in that case.\nHad McMahon lost instead of gained by the course of events he would have had to make good such loss to the estate. It would not mend matters, however, as I construe Louis Walsh\u2019s letter to McMahon, to declare as law that such a letter is such possible authority to any man in the position McMahon was in as co-trustee or co-owner as to enable him to enlarge its effect beyond what it says. The indirect motive in a future case might be found operating the other way to the detriment of honest men. It would, I say it with great respect, be better not to add another to the long list of hard cases making bad law. I think the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ritchie, Ludwig & Ballantyne.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hearn & Slattery.\n[1] 9 Ont.

T. Ry. Co. but, at the request of the latter, imposed the condition that the masonry work of such under crossing should be sufficient to allow of the construction of an additional track on the line of the G. T. Ry. Co. No evidence was given that the latter company intended to lay an additional track in the near future or at any time. The James Bay Co., by leave of a judge, appealed to Supreme Court of Canada from the part of the order imposing such terms contending that the same was beyond the jurisdiction of the Board.\nHeld, that the Board had jurisdiction to impose said terms.\nHeld, per Sedgewick, Davies and Maclennan JJ., that the question before the court was rather one of law than of jurisdiction and should have come up on appeal by leave of the Board or been carried before the Governor General in Council.\nAppeal by leave of a judge from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada granting an application of the appellants for a crossing under the Grand Trunk line and directing that the substructure be made sufficient to support a second line if thereafter laid. The order of the Board was as follows: \u2014\n\"In the matter of\n\"The application of the James Bay Railway Company, hereinafter called the 'applicant company,' under section 177 of the 'Railway Act, 1903,' to the Board for an Order authorizing an undercrossing of the tracks of the Midland Division of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, at a point near Beaverton, Ontario, in Lot 13, Concession 7, Township of Thorah, County of Ontario, as shewn on plan on file with the Board under reference No. 16908, file No. 1455;\n\"Counsel having been heard, for the applicant company and the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and upon the evidence adduced, and the report of the Chief Engineer of the Board\u2014\n\"It is ordered\n\"That the applicant company be, and it is hereby authorized to construct and carry its proposed line of railway under the track of the Grand Trunk Railway by means of an under-crossing, at the point shewn on said plan on file with the Board under reference No. 16908, file No. 1455, said under-crossing and drainage facilities in connection therewith to be constructed in accordance with plans to be submitted by the applicant company to and approved of by the Chief Engineer of the Board.\n\"That, for the purpose of such crossing, the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada shall, at the expense of the James Bay Railway Company, raise the tracks of the former mentioned company at the point of crossing aforesaid, and for such distance on each side thereof as shall be considered by the Chief Engineer of the Board necessary to provide a proper grade, to such a height (not exceeding two feet) over the present level of said tracks as the Chief Engineer of the Board shall require; and upon completion of the work of so raising such tracks and restoring the roadway to as good a condition as that in which it now is, the James Bay Railway Company shall pay to the Grand Trunk Railway Company the whole cost of such work.\n\"That the masonry work of the said undercrossing shall be sufficient to allow of the construction of an additional track on the line of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the superstructure of such additional track to be supplied by the Grand Trunk Railway Company at its own expense when it constructs a double track.\n\"That the cost of all works in connection with the construction and maintenance of the said undercrossing, save and except the superstructure provided for in the immediately preceding paragraph, shall be borne by the applicant company.\n\"That the said works are to be carried on under the direction and supervision of an Engineer to be appointed by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, who is to receive a reasonable remuneration for services rendered; and that all works directed to be done under this Order shall be subject to the supervision of the Chief Engineer of the Board.\"\nBarwick K.C. and G. F. Macdonnell for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondents.\nA. G. Blair, Jr., for the Board.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I agree in the reasons stated by my brother Davies. GIROUARD J.\u2014I am for dismissing this appeal with costs. The Board had jurisdiction, and even if their decision is wrong we cannot interfere.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This appeal comes before us on permission granted by Idington J. upon a question as to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners in making an order allowing the appellant railway to cross the track of the respondent railway to direct that the masonry work of the under-crossing should be sufficient to allow of the construction of an additional track on the line of the respondent railway.\nThe only question for our determination is that of jurisdiction and the argument at bar resolves itself into this, that there was nothing on the face of the record to justify the part of the order appealed against. It was, of course, conceded that over the whole subject matter in dispute the Board had complete jurisdiction, and Mr. Barwick admitted that if any evidence had been given on the part of the respondent company of an intention to build the second track within a reasonable time no objection could be raised to the order.\nA perusal of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" under which the Board is constituted will shew how very careful Parliament was to invest the Railway Board with the most complete powers over the persons, companies and subject matter placed under its jurisdiction.\nSection 41 enacts that\nno order of the Board need shew upon its face that any proceeding was had or given or any circumstance existed necessary to give it jurisdiction to make such order.\nAnd section 42 that the finding or determination of the Board upon any question of fact within its jurisdiction should be binding and conclusive upon all courts.\nFrom the statute creating the Board it would seem that there are three modes in which its orders can be attacked. One is by way of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on a question of law when permission so to appeal is granted by the Board. A second is the mode adopted here of appealing to such court on a question of jurisdiction when permission so to appeal is granted by a judge of this court; and the third is the right of review vested in the Governor in Council in his discretion either upon petition of any interested party or on his own motion.\nThe point raised here is a very nice one, but from the best consideration I can give it I have reached the conclusion that it is not so much a question of jurisdiction as it is one of law which could only come before us by leave of the Board or one involving the merits of the order made\u2014which can only be reviewed by the Governor in Council.\nThe question is: Was the term or provision objected to a reasonable one to impose upon the granting of the order asked for by the appellant company? And that is a matter over which the Board had jurisdiction, and the objection simply is that the Board acted on insufficient evidence.\nIt would seem, therefore, to be more properly either a matter for review before the Governor in Council or one for determination as a matter of law on a reference by the Board.\nAt any rate there is not, in my opinion, such a manifest defect of jurisdiction in the Board in the imposition of the provision complained of that justifies our setting it aside. The objection is not founded on the absence of any essential preliminary or in the nature of the subject matter. It is simply that the Board has made an order in the absence of definite evidence which it was competent to make had proper materials been before it. It assumes that having general jurisdiction over the subject matter the Board properly entered on the inquiry, but miscarried in the course of it, a miscarriage which a court of appeal alone could rectify.\nSee The Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan[1] at page 443.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for leave to construct their road across the respondents' road and this was granted; but it was made a term of the order\nthat the masonry work of the said under-crossing shall be sufficient to allow of the construction of an additional track on the line of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the superstructure of such additional track to be supplied by the Grand Trunk Railway Company at its own expense when it constructs a double track.\nThe question raised is whether or not this term was ultra vires.\nThe limit of authority given to the Board in dealing with the questions of such railway crossings is that in sub-section 2 of section 177 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" which is expressed by the words\nthe Board may by order grant such application on such terms as to protection and safety as it may deem expedient * * * as under the circumstances appear to the Board best adapted to remove and prevent all danger of accident, injury or damage, etc.\n\"Protection and safety\" from \"danger of accident, injury or damage\" would seem to cover all that the Board is entitled in this regard to aim at. All other provisions on the subject of such crossings in other sections and in this sub-section are but means to the ends of \"protection and safety.\" Are \"protection and safety\" directly or indirectly secured by the requirement in this order? No evidence was taken. No statements, as admissions, were put before the Board. Statements were made to which I will presently advert.\nIn some cases that come before the Board the nature and very essence of the questions raised are such, are so clearly part of what the Board was constituted to pass upon, that formal evidence is not called for to establish a jurisdiction in the Board. There often needs nothing more than the statement of the case for the purpose.\nThere are other cases, however, in which the questions raised may not be of this character and, for the purpose of finding out whether or not jurisdiction does exist, evidence of a more or less complicated character must be heard and considered. The question raised here is of this latter character.\nThe distinction between the two kinds of cases is well illustrated by the case in hand. The permission to one railway to cross another is of the first named class. The incidental power of fixing the terms upon which that may be done may be of the secondly named class.\nIn determining the issue here raised it is not self-evident just how far the Board may go. The questions of \"protection and safety\" must depend on evidence. The jurisdiction to deal with such questions must rest more or less on evidence shewing that the case comes within the meaning of the phrase as used in the subsection I have referred to. In every such case, the Board must, in the first place, determine whether the facts have brought the matter within their jurisdiction or not.\nThe Board is so far master of the situation that, if there be any evidence to support a. case of jurisdiction, this court cannot interfere with the finding of fact that the Board has made. If upon the evidence, however, this court should be of opinion that there was no evidence to support the jurisdiction or no jurisdiction given upon the facts as determined by the Board, it would become the duty of this court to interfere.\nLet us apply these principles to this appeal. It appears upon the case before us that the Grand Trunk Railway had no double track, but only a single track at the point in question.\nIt was admitted in argument that the charter of the Grand Trunk Railway Company gave power to build a double track. The exercise of that power (it is suggested by paragraph 8 of the case) is subject to leave not yet given. I am unable to find such restriction. Even if it exist, I think that the question is: Can the Board of Railway Commissioners look beyond existing conditions of structure and anticipate what is soon to happen?\nI think, although it was not, as I understood, conceded by Mr. Barwick, that there may exist cases of prospective double-tracking, in its relation to a crossing by another railway, that have to be considered in making the order allowing the crossing. Where it is clearly the purpose of the senior road immediately to lay a double track I think such a case must fall within this class.\nTake the case of a declared intention to proceed with double-tracking, perhaps extensive preparations made, and where it was quite apparent that the work of double-tracking would within every reasonable probability, arising from the surrounding facts and circumstances, be done before the crossing works could be finished. Can it be that, in such a case, the bare chance of which may have moved a few days earlier than the other in announcing a purpose or in beginning to execute it, must determine the whole question of jurisdiction?\nIt seems to me as if all the facts must be considered and, if the senior road shew a bond fide present intention to proceed with double-tracking, it might well be said to have shewn a case that fell within the needs of \"protection and safety\" from \"accidents,\" etc.\nClearly the doing of the work one month in one way, as if for a single track, and next month supplementing the work, or by doing it again in another way, would be doing that which might, I imagine, be in entire disregard of the \"protection and safety\" of either the travelling public or those engaged in such construction work.\nIt might be that an immediate purpose of the kind might be simulated. In such a case it would be for the Board to determine what the facts really were. Thorough investigation would make that plain.\nThis case is presented in a most unsatisfactory way. It seems to me that the appellants, when before the Commissioners, could hardly have had any idea of raising the issue they are now raising, else it would have been made apparent on the record. So far from raising the question of jurisdiction, it was assumed by all parties, as a matter of course, that whatever order in regard to providing for double-tracking might be made, was wholly within the discretion of the Board.\nIf, notwithstanding the impression of the parties, there was, in fact, no jurisdiction, we are not relieved from all responsibility.\nThe case of Farquharson v. Morgan[2] shews that, where want of jurisdiction is made clear, it is the duty of the court to prohibit, even though the parties had acquiesced.\nThere is not, in any case where evidence is necessary to shew how the jurisdiction arose, any legal presumption in favour of jurisdiction. The question to be answered here must be: Is there any evidence in support of the jurisdiction?\nThat must be determined by the sense in which we take the statements made at the hearing.\nIt was stated that the Grand Trunk Railway Company intended to put down a double track. Was this said as, and is it to be taken as meaning, an intention to do so within such time as clearly and beyond per-adventure would give jurisdiction to the Board of Commissioners to deal with the claims springing out of such an intention, when disposing of the application for a crossing?\nIt was expressly conceded, when the statement was made before the Board, that it was made in good faith. It was argued that, notwithstanding that, there should not be imposed upon the appellants any such terms.\nStatements and arguments were blended together by the parties in their respective support of, or repelling of, the propositions submitted to the Board, and that is the kind of record now presented to us upon which to pass upon one of the most difficult questions of jurisdiction likely to arise. The very unsatisfactory condition of the evidence, for such statements and their acceptance as fact by those concerned are to be received as evidence, makes the case more difficult than it need have been.\nI am, in the light I have presented the matter, inclined to think that the statements before the Board are rather a slender basis for the inference necessary to support the jurisdiction.\nI do not wish to assent to the proposition that, if the question of jurisdiction be doubtful, we must refrain from exercising the duty imposed upon us by the Railway Act. Where the jurisdiction is a matter of doubt, and the doubt appears in the construction of the statute, I think it clearly our duty to interfere. We lay down for this court the line (for the exercise of our jurisdiction) beyond which we cannot pass at where there is a doubt, whether this court have jurisdiction or not.\nWe hold, then, that we have not.\nThe same rule must apply in interpreting the \"Railway Act\" in relation to any question arising thereunder as to the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nWhen the doubt arises, however, from the interpretation of the evidence to be considered and determined by the Board of Commissioners, we may be relieved to some extent from interfering.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners may have read the facts which give the jurisdiction in a more liberal sense than we would do in such a case, but, as long as there is any evidence upon which reasonable men might say that the facts are thus and so, we cannot say, then, that there is no evidence and interfere. I cannot say, here, that there is no evidence; the doubt is as to whether the purport or effect of it is as shewing present intention to double-track or a mere prospect in the remote future. I have confined my opinion to a present existing purpose as giving the limit of jurisdiction in this regard, and I assume the statements I have adverted to as possible evidence of that intention.\nWe are not concerned, therefore, here to answer the question as to a more remote purpose. When such a case arises, I would desire to be free from the embarrassment of any present expression of opinion. I, therefore, express none.\nI may be permitted to express the hope that, when parties go before the Board hereafter, they will, as they ought to, if intending to raise a question of jurisdiction, do so before the Board, and have the matter there thoroughly threshed out.\nProhibition, for which this proceeding before this court has in relation to the Board of Railway Commissioners been substituted by the \"Railway, Act, 1903,\" has been refused upon the ground that the objection to jurisdiction was not raised in the court trying the cause.\nIn Moore v. Gamgee[3] it was held that the right to object might be waived. I do not wish to express any final opinion upon the point as to whether or not this may be applicable to cases arising under the \"Railway Act\" in question. I rather incline to think that the purpose of the legislature in this Act was to impose an imperative duty on this court in relation to the jurisdiction of the other.\nBut if, in similar cases upon which the question of jurisdiction depends upon whether there is evidence to support it or not, parties have failed to thresh the matter out in the way I have suggested they may find a difficulty in getting leave to appeal.\nI adhere to the opinion I entertained in granting leave that it should be granted, as a general rule, where there is, as I think there was here, a fairly arguable case. Yet if it should turn out, on further investigation, that we have any discretion in such a case, I think it would be well exercised in refusing leave to appeal in a similar case.\nThe novelty of the practice introduced by the \"Railway Act\" allotting to this court the power we are now called upon to exercise is the only excuse for the matter having been left in the way the parties chose to leave it, and is also the only reason for adverting, at such length as I have done, to some of the principles that must be considered in administering this new jurisdiction.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree for the reasons stated by my brother Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: G. F. Macdonnell.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W. H. Biggar.\n[1] L.R. 5 P.C. 417.\n[2] [1894] 1 Q.B. 552.\n[3] 25 Q.B.D. 244.\n"}

Act, 1867, s. 91, s-s 12\u2014Sea-coast fisheries\u2014R.S.C. 94, ss. 2, 3, 4.\nUnder the provisions of the British North American Act, 1867, sec. 91, sub-section 12, the Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction to legislate with respect to fisheries within the three-mile-zone off the sea-coasts of Canada.\nA foreign vessel found violating the fishery laws of Canada within three marine miles off the sea-coasts of the Dominion may be immediately pursued beyond the three-mile-zone and lawfully seized on the high seas. Girouard J. dissenting.\nThe judgment appealed from, (11 B.C. Rep. 473) was affirmed.\nAppeal from the decree of Mr. Justice Archer Martin, local judge in admiralty for the British Columbia Admiralty District, in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], condemning the ship \"North,\" her goods, boats, tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores and cargo as forfeited to His Majesty for violation of the \"Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels,\"[2] with costs.\nOn the 8th of July, 1905, the Dominion Government cruiser \"Kestrel\" sighted the American schooner \"North\" on the fishing grounds in Quatsino Sound within the three-mile-zone off the coast of British Columbia, having four dories out and evidently engaged in fishing for halibut contrary to the provisions of the Act, R.S.C. ch. 94. On being chased by the cruiser, the schooner picked up two of her dories and stood out to sea. The cruiser kept up a continuous chase (picking up one of the dories on the way) overhauled and seized the schooner on the high seas, some distance outside the three-mile-zone, and towed her into port at Winter Harbour, B.C., where she was properly attached and libelled in the Admiralty Division of the Exchequer Court of Canada. At the time of seizure freshly caught halibut were lying upon the deck of the schooner and there were other evidences present shewing that she had been recently engaged in fishing.\nThe action was brought on the information of the Attorney General for Canada and the present appeal is from the above mentioned decree made on the 25th of August, 1905.\nThe questions raised on the appeal are discussed in the judgments not reported.\nWilson K.C. (Attorney General for British Columbia) for the appellant. The ship \"North\" was, at the time of the seizure, on the high seas and was part of the territory of the United States of America. See Reg. v. Anderson[3], per Blackburn J. at page 163; Reg. v. Lesley[4]; Reg. v. Carr[5]; Marshall v. Murgatroyd[6]; Cranstoun v.. Bird[7]. Consequently, she could not be lawfully seized there by the officers of a foreign state for violation of a municipal regulation. In any case, the territorial waters known as the \"three-mile-limit\" off the sea-coast of British Columbia form part of that province and are not subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada nor can the present controversy come within the jurisdiction of a Dominion court.\nThe doctrine of pursuit rests on the opinion of Mr. Hall and other writers on international law, and is contrary to the law of England, which maintains the territoriality of the ship. The doctrines of international law are only to be applied as between nations. Even if the doctrines of international law are to be applied, then they must be expressed in some proclamation or statute of the nation desiring to give effect to them. No statutory authority exists in Canada to pursue or to seize beyond the three-mile-limit. If the right to pursue beyond the territorial limits of a state exists without statute, then it is the exercise of sovereign power pursuant to international law, and this power has not been conferred on Canada. Canada has no jurisdiction beyond her territorial boundaries \u2014in this case, the three-mile-limit. See Low v. Routledge[8]; Reg. v. Brierly[9], at page 534; Reg. v. Keyn[10]; Re Smith[11]; McLcod v. Attorney General for New South Wales[12]; and The Lord Advocate v. Weymss[13], per Watson L.J., at page 66.\nThe attention of the court is directed to an article entitled: \"Is International Law part of the Law of England?\" in the January number of the current Law Quarterly Review,[14] by J. Westlake K.C.\nNewcombe K.C. (Deputy Minister of Justice) for the respondent. In the case of a crime a seizure may be made where the pursuit is continuous. This case involves a violation of the law which constitutes a crime, and as such it would be regarded by the law, not only of this country but by that of England and by that of the United States of America. This is no question of municipal or local laws or regulations, but involves the rights of the Crown particularly in international relations. It is essentially sovereign legislation and the jurisdiction of the Crown is not limited to a distance of three miles from the coast.\nThe statute, R.S.C. ch. 94, does not absolutely prohibit fishing by foreigners, but only provides that they shall not do so without a license. The exclusive rights in fisheries within the territorial waters of the sea-coast are not strictly property, but are interests respected by foreign nations and form an appanage of the state. These rights, whether territorial or of jurisdiction, cannot be vested in the province the authority of which is confined to the bounds of the province. There is, however, no question of property involved in the present case.\nThe Dominion alone represents the country quoad transactions, with parties outside the state. This is particularly the case so far as the territorial waters are concerned, the principle of the recognition of which is the need for provision for the security of the state. All matters affecting defence belong to the Dominion.\nThe Dominion, under the express provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, has alone the power to legislate with regard to sea-coast fisheries, and to prescribe the terms, if at all, on which foreigners shall be permitted to fish therein.\nThe court is referred to the following authorities: The \"Appollon\"[15]; Woolsey on International Law, pp. 27, 69, 71, 365; 5 Revue de droit international (2 ser.), 82; Moore on Extradition, pp. 292 to 302; Westlake International Law, pp. 172-4; The \"Interpretation Act,\" R.S.C. ch. 1, sec. 7, par. 37; The \"Marianna Flora\"[16];\" 59 Geo.

Scott[17].\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014For the reasons given in the court below, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of carefully perusing the opinion of my brother Davies, and were it not for our own statute in the matter, An Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels, R.S.C. ch. 94, I do not think I would have dissented. I cannot agree with him that section 4 alone determines the jurisdiction of the court. I think sections 2, 3 and 4 must be considered together. True, section 4 refers to seizure, that is to say, I presume, the warrant of the Admiralty Court served on a vessel; if that section stood alone the conclusions arrived at by the majority of the court would undoubtedly be correct.\nSections 2 and 3, although not referring to seizure, mention certain steps which are conditions precedent to the seizure and the jurisdiction of the court. Section 2 declares that the officer in charge of the government cruiser\nmay go on board of any ship * * * within any harbour in Canada, or hovering in British waters within three marine miles of any coast;\nand then section 3 adds that the said officer\nmay bring any ship * * * within any harbour in Canada or hovering within British waters within three marine miles of any of the coasts * * * into port, etc.\nIt seems evident to me that the government officer cannot go on board of any ship violating our fishery laws except within three marine miles of any coast, and that, likewise, he cannot bring any such ship into port except within the three-mile-limit. Of course, I understand that if the officer boarding any such ship within the three-mile-limit is taken outside of it by force of circumstances, in such a case he would probably have the right to pursue, but this is not the case before us. The seizure, properly so called, was made in port and is not generally executed otherwise, for it is done by issuing a warrant out of the Admiralty Court and serving it on board the vessel in default after she has been brought into port.\nBut whether it be so or not, I look upon the boarding of a vessel and taking it into port within the three-mile-limit as conditions precedent which must be complied with to give jurisdiction to the court and make the seizure legal. I think the language of section 4 has made that proposition still more clear, for it declares that\nall goods, ships * * * liable to forfeiture under this Act may be seized, etc.\nThis forfeiture cannot take place except as provided for in sections 2 and 3, and, without complying with the requirements of these sections, I say again that the court had no jurisdiction.\nMuch reliance has been placed on the decision of the Queen's Bench Division in The Queen v. Hughes[18], and on a late decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, In re Walton[19], but in both these cases the courts had not before them a statute like the Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels, R.S.C. ch. 94, and which to my mind affects the very jurisdiction of the court. Had the jurisdiction of the court been involved in these cases, I am inclined to think that the conclusion would have been very different. Lopes J., speaking with the majority in The Queen v. Hughes (1), said:\nI think the warrant in this case was mere process for the purpose of bringing the party complained of before the justices, and had nothing whatever to do with the jurisdiction of the justices.\nHawkins J., quoting Erle C.J. with approbation, said:\nIn my opinion, if a party is before a magistrate, and he is then charged with the commission of an offence within the jurisdiction of that magistrate, the latter has jurisdiction to proceed with that charge without any information or summons having been previously issued, unless the statute creating the offence imposes the necessity of. taking some such step. As I have already remarked, our Canadian statute has imposed the necessity of boarding the fishing vessel and taking her into port within the three-mile-limit before the seizure can be made, and for that reason, and only for that one, I believe the appeal ought to be allowed with costs, and the seizure quashed, except as to the two small boats actually caught within the three-mile-limit.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The \"North\" was an American Fishing schooner and was found by the Dominion fishing cruiser \"Kestrel\" on the 8th July, 1905, fishing off the coast of British Columbia within the three-mile-limit or zone.\nOn being discovered the poaching schooner immediately endeavoured to escape into the high seas beyond the three-mile-limit. She was at once pursued by the \"Kestrel\" and two of her boats, which were out fishing and which she was unable to pick up while endeavouring herself to escape, were captured. The schooner was not overtaken till she had passed out beyond the three-mile-limit into the high seas. She was, when overtaken, taken possession of for illegal fishing, brought into port, libelled in the Admiralty Court and after trial condemned.\nSome questions were raised on this appeal by Mr. Wilson as to the legality of the condemnation on the ground that the fisheries along the coast belonged to the province and not to the Dominion and that the legislation for their protection should have been provincial and not Dominion. The simple answer to such objections is that the British North America Act, 1867, conferred upon the Dominion the exclusive power of legislation with respect to seacoast and inland fisheries and that the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of Attorney General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Ontario[20], determines affirmatively the exclusive right of the Dominion Parliament to make or authorize the making of regulations and restrictions respecting the fisheries of Canada.\nThe \"North\" being a foreign schooner was charged with the offence of fishing within three miles from the sea coast without a license, against the provisions of the Dominion statute, R.S.C. ch. 94. Though not formally abandoned on the appeal it was not contended that the evidence of the vessel's guilt was defective or insufficient. The appeal was rested solely on the ground that when the schooner was actually overtaken and seized she had passed out of the three-mile-limit on to the high seas and that the officers had no right under the statute, under the circumstances, to make the seizure and bring her into port and that the subsequent condemnation of the schooner was, therefore, illegal.\nThe ground taken by Mr. Wilson was that a true construction of the Dominion statute did not authorize any of the officers clothed with authority to seize fishing vessels poaching in the territorial waters of Canada to follow such vessels outside of the three-mile-limit, although found committing the offence within that limit, and that any seizure made outside of such limit, even when made in hot pursuit of the offender, was without authority and illegal.\nTo confer such a power Mr. Wilson contended that two things must exist: a treaty between the nation whose ship was charged with the offence and the nation whose ship seized the offender authorizing the seizure on the high seas beyond territorial waters and municipal legislation in furtherance of that treaty.\nI am quite unable to agree with these contentions. I think the Admiralty Court when exercising its jurisdiction is bound to take notice of the law of nations, and that by that law when a vessel within foreign territory commits an infraction of its laws either for the protection of its fisheries or its revenues or coasts she may be immediately pursued into the open seas beyond the territorial limits and there taken. As Mr. Hall observes in the Book upon International Law (4 ed.) at page 267:\nIt must be added that this can only be done when the pursuit is commenced while the vessel is still within the territorial waters or has only just escaped from them. The reason for the permission seems to be that pursuit under these circumstances is a continuation of an act of jurisdiction which has been begun or which but for the accident of immediate escape would have been begun within the territory itself and that it is necessary to permit it in order to enable the territorial jurisdiction to be efficiently exercised.\nThis clear terse statement of the law and the reason for it is amply sustained by the array of authorities cited by Martin J. the local judge in admiralty in his judgment. The right of hot pursuit of a vessel found illegally fishing within the territorial waters of another nation being part of the law of nations was properly judicially taken notice of and acted upon by the learned judge in this prosecution.\nThe language of our statute does not limit the powers of the officers entrusted with the protection of our seacoast fisheries to their exercise within the three-mile-limit. That language is, I think, quite broad enough to cover such a case as the one before us, and the fourth section of the statute, so far from negativing the doctrine of immediate or hot pursuit of a poacher by its broad and general language, may be said impliedly to adopt it. I do not agree that any special treaty is necessary to enable a nation to protect its fisheries within the zone prescribed by the law of nations or that unless such a treaty exists embodying the doctrine of hot pursuit of a vessel found illegally fishing within territorial waters such vessel is immune from seizure once she passes beyond those waters into the high seas.\nThe laws of a state can only, as Mr. Hall says, run outside its territorial waters against the vessels or subjects of another state with the express or tacit consent of the latter. Municipal legislation embodying the doctrine of the law of nations with respect to seizure of foreign vessels beyond territorial jurisdiction would not confer any additional authority as against a foreign ship to that embodied in international law from which alone the right to seize a foreign vessel beyond territorial waters for infraction of municipal law within these waters can be obtained. No such legislation as that contended for as necessary by Mr. Wilson exists, as far as I am aware, in the British dominions, nor did he cite any precedent from the legislation of any foreign country. I am quite satisfied that the existing legislation of the Dominion is sufficient and that the seizure of the \"North\" under the facts of this case as practically admitted was legal.\nBut even if there was a reasonable doubt as to the power of the officers of the cruiser to seize the schooner on the high seas beyond the three-mile-limit, under the circumstances before us, I am of the opinion that such irregularity could not affect the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court to hear and determine the offence charged against the schooner. That offence being within the jurisdiction of the court and the vessel being also within such jurisdiction and properly attached and libelled could not plead an alleged irregularity in the node of her being taken on the high seas as a defence.\nThe manner in which she was brought into port and within the jurisdiction of the court was, if wrong or irregular, matter for diplomatic protest at the instance of the country to which she belonged or for civil action by the owners of the ship. If that country does not complain of any offence against its honour and dignity the ship libelled cannot do so. If the poaching schooner had escaped into the territorial waters of her own country and had been chased there, captured and brought back the government of that country might well justify intervention. But short of such intervention I think the ship charged with illegal fishing within the three-mile-limit being within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court and properly libelled there for an offence committed within its jurisdiction proceedings cannot be defeated or the jurisdiction of the court ousted merely by an irregularity in the taking of the ship.\nThe principle underlying the decisions relating to persons kidnapped and brought before magistrates having jurisdiction over the offence with which they are charged are, I think, in point. These cases shew that the remedy for the illegal arrest and the kidnapping of the prisoner is by proceedings at the instance of the government of the foreign country whose laws or territory has been violated or at the suit of the injured party against the trespasser.\nSee In re Walton[21] where many cases in point are cited. Se also The Queen v. Hughes[22], where a very strong court of ten judges held, with one dissent alone, that a person being before justices and charged with an offence over which they had jurisdiction in respect of time and place no irregularity in his arrest or bringing before the court could avail to impeach their jurisdiction to try him.\nThe remedies of the prisoner for illegal arrest or detention remained unimpaired, but the jurisdiction of the court was unquestionable and unaffected by the manner in which the prisoner was brought before it.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the condemnation of the appellant in the Exchequer Court. The learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Martin, sitting in the British Columbia Admiralty district found that the appellant ship had become liable to forfeiture under the provisions of the \"Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels,\" ch. 94 of the Revised Statutes of Canada.\nThe ship was fishing within the three-mile-zone on the coast of British Columbia. When observed and pursued she fled and was captured outside the three-mile-zone.\nThere seems to be no real contention about the findings of fact though not admitted to be absolutely correct. The appeal raises several questions of interest and some of them of considerable importance.\nThe appellant's counsel did not rest the appeal upon a contestation of the facts, but upon a denial of the right of pursuit according to international law and claimed that\neven if the doctrines of international law are to be applied then they must be expressed in some proclamation or statute of the nature desiring to give effect to them.\nWithout assenting to this proposition as being one of universal application I assume that for the purposes of this case the judgment must be rested upon the statute.\nWhether or not this was present to the mind of the learned trial judge does not appear.\nThe general, though not universal, principle that municipal legislation is necessary to give effect to the doctrines of international law may have been assumed by him, and I think probably was assumed. These principles would not in themselves be effective or become operative in cases of this kind without municipal legislation.\nParadoxical as it may seem, the recognition of a right that international law gives should precede the municipal legislation. No prudent sovereign power would willingly, in these modern times, invite conflict with a neighbour by enacting a statute directing that to be done which international law had clearly forbidden or that which had been denied as an inherent right.\nThis statute now in question must be read in light of the well known, recognized, customary or international law that has preceded it, and is yet in force, and receive interpretation thereby.\nThe meaning of this statute when so read seems to be beyond all doubt.\nThe right of search is first given in the case of vessels in Canadian waters.\nThen section 3 describes what may be done, or so done as to cause a forfeiture of the vessel.\nThen section 4 enacts that vessels so liable to forfeiture may be seized and secured by any officers mentioned in the second section.\nThe right to seize must have originated and the attempt to seize must have begun in Canadian waters.\nThere is nothing in the statute itself expressly limiting the attempt to seize or seizure to the Canadian waters. Where is the limitation to be found? Certainly not in the words of the statute.\nIn the absence of words of limitation it might be urged that power was intended to be given to seize on the high seas wherever the offending vessel might be found, so long as no other state was invaded.\nIt would be unsafe to assume, that any such intention existed in the mind of Parliament in using such comprehensive and unlimited language as used here.\nWhy so? Clearly because by the customary law or international law or established usage, call it which you will, the right to rove anywhere and everywhere over the ocean and make seizure of vessels is not recognized by the general opinion of civilized men or by the sovereign powers of later times as a thing that should be done or permitted to be done in cases such as this.\nThe wide, general nature of the words used must, by observing these considerations, therefore, be restricted within what all men, having to do with such matters, understand as reasonable.\nThis understanding we find in the expositions of text writers, the judgments of courts, and the treaties, of nations. We must assume it was present to the minds of the legislators using this wide language, and intended by them to lend it a reasonable meaning.\nIt seems to be conceded by counsel that such is the almost universal modern understanding, derived from such sources, that what is known as the three-mile-limit might be considered as within these words relative to seizure, if they mean anything, but not beyond.\nI am unable to comprehend why we should adopt the one part of this recognized, customary, or international law and discard all else.\nThe sole question raised here seems to be whether or not the authority given by section 4 does not imply that the seizure may be made where and under such circumstances as international law would permit.\nI think clearly that this is the meaning of the statute. It gives the widest authority that international law, or in other words, established usage, may justify.\nIt is just as if a statute authorized in like words a sheriff to seize goods or person. That would be read as meaning, though not expressly saying so, within his county.\nThe case of McLeod v. The Attorney-General of New South Wales[23], I think, well illustrates what I am trying to explain as my view of this statute.\nThe interpretation of the Act in question there, in which the words used were capable of an unlimited sense, was held to be that it must be read as meaning, and only in force, so far as the legislature of New South Wales had power to legislate.\nThe authority to seize here is to be restricted as within the limits that international law recognizes, a seizure can be made.\nThe seizure is not to be frustrated by the wrongdoer's attempt to escape. The right of pursuit is recognized by international law. It-springs from the necessity of the case. It rests upon what in the last analysis is the base of so much international law in many analogous cases, the necessities of self-defence and protection.\nThe growth of that body of custom known as international law has, only in modern times, found recognition of hard and fast lines in some cases. In its still growing condition it must be tested in regard to the questions here raised by what appeals to all men as reasonable, where the occasion arises for the protection of the coast-line of the land, the three-mile-zone recognized as quasi appurtenant thereto, and the fish therein. This implies all else that demands the exercise of sovereign power, beyond the land, to make that protecting power efficient within it.\nThe counsel for appellant took three other points which may be looked upon as subsidiary and are covered perhaps by what I have said, but summed up in the last one taken by him, which is thus stated:\nCanada has no jurisdiction beyond her territorial boundaries, in this case the three-mile-limit,\nand which I should perhaps briefly notice.\nIn so far as this objection rests upon the absence of special statutory enactment relative to that part of the ocean beyond the three-mile-limit, it is answered by the interpretation already given the statute. If, however, the objection is intended to distinguish between the authority that may exist in the Imperial Parliament and that more limited authority that the Canadian Parliament as a mere colonial legislature may possess, different considerations may arise. In this way of putting the objection it seems to be covered by section 91, sub-section 12 of the British North America Act, 1867, and the case of \"The Fisheries Act\"[24]. This section 91 was intended to and does, I think, confer upon Canada as full power in every respect in relation to the sea-coast and inland fisheries of Canada as was possessed by the Imperial Parliament itself. It seems to be beyond doubt that such delegated authority would carry with it the right to pass such an Act as that now in question. The Act was upheld in the case just referred to.\nThe right to legislate in respect of the right of pursuit so far as it existed, in relation to the necessity for protecting the sea-coast and fisheries thereon, would be thus impliedly if not explicitly conferred.\nThe right of pursuit is expressly recognized by such eminent authority as the late Mr. Hall and others. The exact points involved in the case now in hand have not been passed upon by any of the decisions cited to us or any that I can find. But clearly the principles underlying the decision in the case of Hudson v. Guestier[25] support a seizure on the high seas, even for breach of a municipal regulation, though the seizure took place beyond the three-mile-limit and even beyond the two leagues that the regulation there in question specified for a seizure to be made. If taken as authority for us here it would support: First, the case of the forfeiture by reason of a breach of our municipal law: and; Secondly, the adjudication by reason of the vessel having been brought when seized within the jurisdiction of the court which had to adjudicate upon the offence, and determine whether forfeiture had taken place or not.\nThe decision in the case of Church v. Hubbart[26] did not turn upon the principles asserted by Chief Justice Marshall as quoted by the learned trial judge in his judgment. The case turned upon the reception of what was held to have been inadmissible evidence and for that reason a new trial was granted.\nBut clearly the principles enunciated by Chief Justice Marshall and the holding in Hudson v. Guestier[27], if correct, shew that the fundamental right existed to so legislate that a foreign vessel might become forfeited for non-observance of a municipal regulation, and be seized beyond the three-mile-zone. This right has been repeatedly asserted by legislation relative to breaches of shipping laws, neutrality laws, and customs or revenue laws, as well as the case of fisheries. In each case the reasonable necessity seems to have been the basis for such legislation and the reason for its recognition in international law.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree in the reasons stated by my brother Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The case was removed into the High Court by order.\nThe will was prepared by William Connell, one of the plaintiffs, at the testator\u2019s house where he was confined to his bed and apparently very ill. William Connell testified that it was signed by the testator in the presence of the two subscribing witnesses, both of whom, however, swore positively that it was not. The trial judge believed the latter and held that the will was not properly executed.\nWilliam Connell, who prepared the will, received a legacy of $1,000 and a large portion of the estate was left to Martin Connell, the other executor. The evidence was conflicting as to whether or not the will was read over to the testator before execution, but the Court of Appeal, which reversed the judgment at the trial as to the execution, held, also, that the fact of the testator living for sixteen years longer without revoking or altering it satisfied the onus on William Connell to establish that he knew and approved of its terms.\nWatson K.C. for the appellants. This case turns almost entirely on the credit to be given to the respective statements of the witnesses concerning the circumstances attending the preparation and execution of the will. As to this the ruling of the judge at the trial should not have been disturbed. Village of Granby v. M\u00e9nard[1]; Kirkpatrick v. McNamee[2]; Royal Electric Co. v. Paquette[3]; Montgomerie & Co. v. Wallace-James[4]. Whiting K.C. and Middleton (French K.C. with them) for the respondents.\nA.A. Fisher watched the case for the widow.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Mr. Justice Maclennan and would dismiss this appeal.\nThe two points argued at great length before us were, first, non-compliance in the execution of the will with the statutory requirements, and, secondly, that the substantial benefits alleged to be conferred upon William Connell, the draftsman of the will, raised an onus upon him of satisfying the court that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the instrument.\nWe have had occasion very lately to consider the latter question very fully in the case of The British & Foreign Bible Society v. Tupper[5], and there can be no doubt that the rule as contended for by Mr. Watson as laid down in Barry v. Butlin[6]; Fulton v. Andrew[7]; and Tyrrell v. Painton[8], is the correct rule. But I concur with the Court of Appeal in thinking that such onus, if applicable here, has been satisfied by the evidence given and the facts that the testator after executing his will recovered his usual health, lived for sixteen years afterwards, on several occasions spoke of having made his will and never revoked nor altered it.\nI desire also to say that the benefit which gives rise to the onus embodied in the rule laid down by Baron Parke in Barry v. Butlin[9] must be a substantial one and that a small bequest or one made to the draftsman in common with others of a class to which he belonged and which owing to his relationship to the testator he might naturally expect would not necessarily give rise to the onus mentioned in the rule. And so in this case having regard to the value of the testator\u2019s estate at the time he made the will, and to the fact that he had no children, I would greatly doubt that the $1,000 bequests to his brother William and to William\u2019s daughter by themselves would, considering the other bequests, give rise to the onus contended for.\nSo far as the residuary devise is concerned declaring that such residue\nshould be placed in the hands of my executors hereinafter named and to be disposed of by them as they might think proper,\nit is, I think, not an absolute gift to the executors as individuals, but one simply in trust and must fail because the trust is so indefinite. It does not contain any express words of gift, but simply a disposing power with directions to the executors as to such disposition which directions fail because of their indefiniteness, and for want of adequate expression of the trust intended. Yeap Cheah Neo v. Ong Cheng Neo[10]. at pp. 390-2, seems to be conclusive on the point.\nThen with respect to the execution of the will the only point upon which the evidence of the witnesses to the will and the two Connells, William and Martin, is at variance is the signing by the testator of the will in the manner they describe in the actual presence of the witnesses.\nOf course such signing was not absolutely neces- sary. A previous signing with an acknowledgment by the testator in the presence of the two witnesses would be sufficient. It seems to me that this was probably what took place, and if so it would go far to reconcile the apparently conflicting testimony. That the signature is that of the testator there is no question, and it is equally true that it was there signed when the witnesses signed their names. It may have been so signed by the testator in the manner William and Martin describe, but just before the witnesses entered the room, a theory quite consistent with every word Mr. McFadden, the witness, swore to and which would reconcile the conflicting evidence.\nThe crucial point would be then: Was James, the testator, fully conscious of what was being done at the time the attestation clause was read to the witnesses and when they signed and was this done at his request?\nLooking at all the evidence I have no difficulty in agreeing that he was so conscious and that there was a legal acknowledgment by the testator in the presence of both witnesses of the signing of the will by him.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014The late James Connell died on or about the 30th day of May, 1903.\nOn the 9th day of January, 1887, he signed a document now propounded as his last will. The learned trial judge held that this was not executed in presence of two witnesses as required by law and therefore void. He also held that by reason of the executor, William Connell, who drew the will, being a beneficiary, and the other circumstances attendant upon the execution being such as to arouse suspicion, the executors had failed to satisfy the conscience of the court as required in such cases by the rules laid down in Barry v. Butlin[11], and the application of the same principles as lie at the foundation of these rules as illustrated by the case of Tyrrell v. Painton[12].\nI quoted in the recent case of British and Foreign Bible Society v. Tupper[13], decided in this court last term, the rules in Barry v. Butlin11. In Tyrrell v. Painton12, at page 157, Lindley L.J. says:\nThe rule in Barry v. Butlin[14]; Fulton v. Andrew[15]; and Brown v. Fisher[16], is not, in my opinion, confined to the single case in which a will is prepared by or on the instructions of the person taking large benefits under it, but extends to all cases in which circumstances exist which excite the suspicion of the court; and whenever such circumstances exist, and whatever their nature may be, it is for those who propound the will to remove such suspicion and to prove affirmatively that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the documents, etc.\nThe deceased was a farmer who at the date of the document in question was worth from forty to fifty thousand dollars. He had six brothers and three sisters; his father, still living, a very aged man; and his wife, to whom he had been married and with whom he had lived happily for fifteen years, still living.\nHis will was not spoken of by deceased until, when very ill, suffering from pneumonia, the doctor in attendance advised the summoning of any relatives the now deceased might desire to see. Three of his brothers, Richard, William and Martin, in consequence of messages thus received visited the deceased on the evening in question. The daughter of Richard was also in attendance. The brothers, William and Martin, who are named as the executors of this alleged will, were with the deceased in his bed-room from some time between nine and ten o\u2019clock in the evening until two o\u2019clock next morning. Richard had been recommended to retire to rest about ten o\u2019clock. No one came into the room during this period except deceased\u2019s wife, on one or more occasions, for the purpose of attending to her duties as his nurse. She was not told of a will being made. She was not consulted by either of the brothers. They received paper, pen and ink from some one in the house between nine and ten, and were using writing material when she passed into the room. When she entered conversation ceased. Being an intelligent woman she drew the inference that the business going on was the making of the will for her husband. Some time after midnight on one of the occasions of her going into the room the husband asked her whether she would like money or property, and she replied she would be satisfied with whatever he determined in that regard. Nothing more was said to her.\nThe document now propounded as the last will was the product of the labour of the four or five hours thus spent.\nThe wife was only given a lot of trifling value in Prescott, the household furniture, the privilege of keeping a portion of the dwelling house as long as she wished, and the sum of three hundred dollars annually in lieu of dower, as long as she remained a widow. The daughter, and I think the only child of William Connell, a girl about ten years of age, was to receive one thousand dollars; the daughter of Martin another one thousand dollars; a sister of deceased one thousand dollars; William himself one thousand dollars; the brother Richard, who was a labouring man, one hundred dollars a year during the term of his natural life; and the father was to be taken care of. Subject to these charges all his real estate, except the Prescott lot, was devised together with chattels and farm implements to his brother Martin. And then, after making these provisions, the residuary bequest was made as follows:\nIt is also my will that the residue of my property, heretofore not disposed of, such as mortgages, notes, moneys or security for money, after paying my just debts out of the same, be placed in the hands of my executors hereinafter named, and to be disposed of by them as they may think fit and proper.\nThe real estate then consisted of 400 acres of lands worth, according to William Connell\u2019s very conservative estimate, $20,000. Making allowance for the narrowness of view such men as the deceased sometimes have upon such a subject, one cannot reconcile the provision made for the deceased\u2019s wife as in accord with the dictates of ordinary human feeling. It was not what the deceased a few months afterwards told his wife he had left her; she tells the story as follows:\nWhat did he say? A. He said I left you a home here so long as you wish to stay, and all that was in the house, or all that is in the house, and the best horse and carriage that is on the place, and if I wished to live there, the best cow\u2014and if I wished to leave there they were to build a good house for me on a lot that we owned in Prescott, they were to build a good house for me, and I was to go there, and I was to get my firewood and my provisions, such as butter, cheese, eggs, just what a farm would produce, pork and beef and all such things, just what a farm would produce, my provisions, what I needed off the place, and $300 a year, and he said\u2014I may not have it all\u2014I wanted to leave you more, but Will. said that was plenty for you, and he says anyway I did not will my money at all. Then he told me three different parties that he was going to leave money to, but there is no need of mentioning their names. He told me three different ones, and he said anyway that will is no good, and he says now I will destroy that will or have it destroyed\u2014destroy that will\u2014that is what he said at that time, and I don\u2019t know whether he said at that time that he never would make a will\u2014whether it was at that time or whether it was another time. It may have been that time and it may not. We are asked by these brothers Martin and William to believe that the deceased not only was a meaner man than this statement of his understanding of the supposed will would lead us to believe him, but they also ask us to suppose that he wilfully mis\u2011stated to his wife what the will contained. Is that possible? Is it probable? I certainly do not think so. It would do more honour to the name of Connell, of which and the perpetuating of it we have heard so much, to refuse to impute to the deceased all that we are asked thus to impute.\nIf he understood, when he heard the will read, what was read he could not imagine that it contained all the additional provisions this statement of the wife shews. If he did not understand the reading of the will then the plaintiffs are not entitled to have this document established as his will. The very suspicions that the principles governing such a case require to be removed have not been removed, and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 case must fail.\nPassing from that to the other provisions of the will, we find no reason for leaving entirely out of his consideration his other brothers and sisters, save in the case of his brothers Thomas and John, with whom he, it is said, had had differences, the effect of which may not possibly have been removed. Can it be said that the explanations given with regard to the absence from home for such a length of time and the supposition that the others were amply provided for removed all suspicion that one may have in regard to their not sharing in his large estate?\nThen let us consider the residuary bequest. We find that the bequest implies a trust.\nBy reason of the uncertainty of the trust as expressed it is void. The law implies another trust and that is that the executors as such receiving property in this manner must hold it for the benefit of those who under the statute of distributions would be entitled to share therein.\nThe executor who drew the will as a result of this accident or design had thus given to him a share in the testator\u2019s estate that has in law the effect of making him in addition to his bequest of one thousand dollars, a very substantial legatee. The duty is, therefore, still more imperative than the first bequest would have made it to make clear that the testator understood what he was doing in this regard.\nWe find from the following evidence of Martin Connell that what the deceased desired to have done was to provide that the residue should be divided amongst the most needy ones of the family.\nQ. Then when you were examined before you did not recollect anything about leaving it to the discretion of you and your brother to divide. Your words were \u201cHe said for us to divide it amongst the most needy ones of the family.\u201d A. That is all right.\nQ. That is the only thing you said? A. That is all right.\n* * *\nQ. You are asked here as to what had occurred and you say the way you understood it, he said for us to divide it amongst the most needy ones of the family, that is the way I understood it. A. That is the way I understood it at the time after I asked him the question.\nQ. Was that the way you understood it at the time of your examination? A. Yes.\nThis statement he alleges was made whilst William, after receiving instructions, had retired to an adjoining room, to extend his draft notes and complete the preparation of the will. Both are agreed that after the document had been finished it was read over carefully to the deceased. It is quite clear that it did not purport to carry out any such intention as was thus expressed. Had it been expressed in these very words it mlight or might not have been any more effective in executing the purpose of the deceased than as it stands.\nIt might, however, have been then held as honestly written. That is what concerns us here. So written and so read it might have been in accord with the testator\u2019s purpose and be held as known and approved by him.\nIf any intelligent effort had been made to express the clear purpose of the deceased these executors (the most prosperous instead of the most needy of the family) would have been excluded from the possibility of hoping to share in the benefits of the residuary bequest. Now they stand to secure a share of the residue in addition to other benefits if this is upheld as the will of deceased.\nBut did the testator not tell William as well as Martin of what his purpose was? It took four or five hours to prepare this short document. What were these three brothers discussing during that time? We are left to speculate. Martin persistently says he did not express any opinion upon any subject relative to dispositions to be made in this proposed will. William, on the other hand, states that on two or three occasions during the discussion Martin did venture an opinion, but he fails to enlighten us upon what points such opinions were expressed.\nIf Martin were the almost dumb man that his evidence would lead us, if implicitly believed, to say he was, during all this time, there would seem to be more need for explanation of what consumed the time. The deceased was not likely in his then condition to have taken up much time with the comparatively simple matters involved in the provisions of this will, except those for the wife and those in the residuary bequest. Only these exceptions involved the necessity of prolonged discussion.\nWilliam Connell was an experienced draftsman; he was a ready penman; he was an intelligent man and one of quick apprehension.\nThe two subject matters that required a good deal of consideration are those that give rise to much suspicion. If we are to believe William\u2019s story, that regarding the provisions for the wife did not give rise to prolonged, if any, discussion. This residuary bequest involved the disposition of ten to fifteen thousand dollars worth of personal property, and according to the wife possibly twenty thousand dollars of personal property. She knew his affairs. She was an honest witness. She placed his personal estate at from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars. Making every allowance for possible mistake or bias on her part, no matter how honest, I think we are quite safe in saying that the estimate just made of from ten to fifteen thousand dollars would be a fair one to act upon. Counsel in the argument did not seriously gainsay this estimate. It seems to me almost incredible that neither in regard to the amount nor the mode of distributing this amount should there have escaped any remark or discussion when such ample opportunity existed for mention thereof in William\u2019s presence. It was almost impossible he could accept such a trust without asking how the proposed testator might desire it to be executed.\nCan we say that the evidence given has removed all ground for suspicion that something of the kind was said or referred to, and that the deceased did not in this regard know or understand the contents of this document? As if it were not suspicious enough already upon the bare statement of the purpose and effect of the kind of clause which should have been in the will as contrasted with that which is there, we find Martin Connell when giving his evidence on the trial attempting to put a new gloss upon the statement made by the deceased to him in William\u2019s absence.\nHe says:\nQ. Then did he say that was to be intended for you yourselves? A. Well, while William was writing the will in the dining-room I asked him when I found out I was to be an executor\u2014asked, for my own information says I, after your just debts are paid, what is your wish to be done with the residue of your property, and he said to give it to the most needy ones of the family, or do with it as you see fit.\nQ. What did he say again? A. He said to give it to the most needy ones of the family, or do with it as you see fit, to dispose of it rather, he said, as you see fit.\nHe repeats twice over, immediately after the evidence just quoted, the same expression of dividing money amongst the most needy ones of the family or do with it what you see fit, and it is only when a little later he is reminded of what he had sworn to in his examination for discovery that he gives the evidence I have first quoted. Why did he change the statement? Which is the true version? Can there be any doubt upon the whole of this evidence that the purpose and intention of the testator was as Martin Connell first stated it? Can any one believe that he failed for two hours or more of giving instructions, as William\u2019s evidence suggests, to give utterance to so simple a thought?\nCan we be quite free from the suspicion that instead of having such a provision appear on the face of this document, it was excluded, not by the intended testator, but by the mind and hand of William Connell? Can we doubt that if the will had gone un- challenged William would have given himself a share and that share not the smallest?\nLet us see so far as his prevaricating evidence will enable us to see what he did think.\nQ. Did you think that was intended for your benefit and his benefit as your own property? A. No, sir, I did not.\nQ. Did you know that it was not? A. Well, I supposed that if I took a share of it, I did not think there would be much fault found with me.\nQ. Did you know from what he told you that that was not intended for you yourselves? A. No, I did not know, because I believed that he intended part of that for me.\nQ. You believed he intended part of it for you? A. Yes.\nQ. How much? A. A share.\nQ. With whom? A. With the rest, the rest of the family.\nQ. Is that what he told you? A. Yes.\nQ. Then, why didn\u2019t you draw the will that way? A. He did not tell it that way. I drew it as he told me.\nQ. But you say you knew from what he told you that he intended that to be divided equally amongst the brothers and sisters? A. He never told me what he intended.\nQ. You said he did? A. No, I did not tell you.\nQ. But at all events you knew at that time that he intended that to be divided equally amongst the brothers and sisters? A. I intended it at any rate if it came into my hands.\nQ. Did he intend it? That is another question. I cannot answer you.\nQ. Did you ask him? A. I did not ask him, but I told you.\nQ. Did you have any idea of what he wished about that? A. I had no idea any more than my own view. I never asked him, but I can tell you who did, if you like me to tell you.\nQ. Who did ask him? A. My brother, when I was writing that document, he asked him, not in my presence; I did not know he asked him; you ask him. He will come to the stand.\nHIS LORDSHIP:\u2014You do not know what he asked him? A. Only what he told me.\nQ. You were outside writing? A. I was outside writing, and my brother, I understood, asked him this question, but I never asked him.\nMR. WATSON:\u2014But you understood that when you went in again? A. No, I did not understand it at any time; I never understood it.\nQ. Not from your brother? When did your brother tell you? A. Here since this row commenced.\nQ. You were examined about this? A. Yes. Q. What did you say? A. I don\u2019t remember. I said before just about as I said now, as near as I can remember.\nQ. See if this is true, \u201cHe did not, I think, intend the property in the residuary clause for myself and my brother Martin or either of us?\u201d A. Not altogether.\nQ. Is that answer true or not? A. It is if it is put in a little fuller.\nQ. It is not true without a qualification? A. It just wants a little qualification.\nQ. Then this answer as it reads here is not correct? A. It is correct so far as it goes.\nQ. The one I read was, \u201cHe did not, I think, intend the property in the residuary clause for myself and my brother Martin, or either of us?\u201d A. I consider I deserve part of this as much as any man.\nThese two brothers chose to put themselves in the position they are of having no one to corroborate them.\nThey have not given such evidence as to my mind should enable us to say either were so absolutely honest as to constrain us to accept as undoubted fact all that they have said. Their evidence is of the most unsatisfactory character. They were discredited as witnesses by the learned trial judge, and reading the evidence impresses me with the correctness of his judgment with regard to the unreliability of them as witnesses.\nI am driven to conclude that the suspicions still exist which the rules and principles I have adverted to required these executors to remove.\nIf that memory for detail, evinced by them in relation to the execution of this document, had been as serviceable in regard to everything connected with its preparation, suspicion might have been dispelled. Conviction might have been substituted for suspicion, but that conviction might still have supported the results the learned trial judge arrived at.\nThe Court of Appeal does not seem to have enter- tained the opinion that if James Connell had died at the time the document in question was prepared it could have been upheld upon such testimony.\nThe judgment of that court seems rather to be that the onus is satisfied by the fact that the testator soon recovered his usual health and lived for sixteen years afterwards and allowed his will to stand without taking any steps to alter or revoke it. I am, with the greatest respect, entirely unable to accept this conclusion. I am unable after giving the matter the very greatest consideration to comprehend that mere lapse of time can dispel the suspicions that surround this transaction. The will, so called, remained with William Connell, and never was seen nor read nor any of its contents, in relation to its vulnerable points, mentioned directly or indirectly during all these sixteen years to the testator.\nThe Court of Appeal gives no reason why mere lapse of time should operate as they find.\nCounsel for respondents were unable to give any reason in support of such a view, save this, that a testator or any one who had been defrauded when once free was entitled to rescind the bargain induced by fraud or to revoke a will which did not represent what its maker intended. I know of no law that restrains a man after the lapse of many years from complaining of a fraud immediately he has discovered it, if there be a reasonable explanation of why, by concealment or otherwise, he was prevented from sooner asserting his right. I apply the same doctrine to this will. The testator assumed, as his wife\u2019s evidence shews, that the provisions for her were entirely different from what they are. As he put them in telling her, they are just such provisions as men like him are apt to make. First, they provide a home; then the provisions for daily food and maintenance, without going into the market to buy it, and then the annuity to provide for clothing, medical attendance and general expenses.\nAssume that deceased believed what he was saying he had provided, he would with his narrow views of life and regard for a woman\u2019s position, possibly be content to leave her in that way. He might not feel urged to reconsider that. Had he been told, however, that the provision was of the character it really was and stands in this will it is inconceivable that either he or his wife would have let the matter rest there. The same is true in regard to the residuary bequest. If the testator believed, as I have no doubt he believed, that his residuary estate would go amongst the most needy ones of the family as he expressly desired, then I might conceive him being satisfied. But had he been told that the residuary bequest was in an entirely different sense so that William Connell and Martin Connell would share therein and the brothers with whom the deceased had differed and who were also wealthy, would share therein equally with the most needy, he would undoubtedly have taken steps to see the will. All this assuming that the will had in his mind any existence as a will.\nPossibly his inconsistent statements in that regard related to the failure to name those whom he thought most needy.\nIt is unnecessary in the view I adopt of the case to express any opinion upon the issue regarding the execution and attestation of this document, but I would in any such case be disposed to abide by the judgment of the trial judge on such a point.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.

Simon, (1906) 37 SCR 422\nDate: 1906-04-14\nJane Gilmour (Plaintiffs)\nAppellants\nAnd\nCelestin Simon (Defendant.)\nRespondent.\n1906: April 9; 1906: April 14.\nPresent:\u2014 Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies, Idington and MacLennan J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH FOR MANITOBA.\nPrincipal and agent\u2014Sale of land\u2014Authority to make contract\u2014 Specific performance.\nThe defendant gave a real estate agent the exclusive right, within a stipulated time, to sell, on commission, a lot of land for $4,270, (the price being calculated at the rate of $40 per acre on its supposed area), an instalment of $1,000 to be paid in cash and the balance, secured by mortgage, payable in four annual instalments. The agent entered into a contract for sale of the lot to the plaintiff at $40 per acre, $50 being deposited on account of the price, the balance of the cash to be paid \u201con acceptance of title,\u201d the remainder of the purchase money payable in four consecutive yearly instalments and with the privilege of \u201cpaying off the mortgage at any time.\u201d This contract was in the form of a receipt for the deposit and signed by the broker as agent for the defendant.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (15 Man. Rep. 205) that the agent had not the clear and express authority necessary to confer the power of entering into a contract for sale binding upon his principal.\nHeld, further, that the term allowing the privilege of paying off the mortgage at any time was not authorized and could not be enforced against the defendant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba ([1]) reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Perdue, at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiffs action with costs. A real estate agent named Egan had an interview with the defendant, who had for sale a lot supposed to contain 106.63 acres of land, and asked him if he would take forty dollars per acre for it. The defendant replied that Egan could \u201csell it\u201d for $4,270, $1,000 cash and the balance in one, two, three and four years, interest on the deferred payment to be at the rate of six per cent, per annum, and that he would give Egan $125 commission to sell it, with the exclusive right of sale until the third following day. Egan arranged for the sale of the property to the plaintiff, received from her a cheque for fifty dollars and set out the terms of sale in a receipt therefor as follows:\nWINNIPEG, Dec. 5th, 1903.\n$50,00.\nReceived from J. Gilmour the sum of fifty dollars, deposit on sale to her of the inner two miles of lot 15 in the Parish of Saint Vital, Manitoba, containing 106.63 acres more or less. Price, $40.00 per acre. Terms, $950.00 to be paid on acceptance of title, mortgage for about $1,300.00 to be assumed, balance payable in 1, 2, 3, and 4 years in equal payments with 6 per cent, interest, privilege to pay off at any time, taxes to be adjusted to date.\nE. C. EGAN, Agent\nfor C. Simon.\nEgan then told defendant he had sold the lot, gave him the cheque and a copy of the receipt. The defendant said that there was not 106.63 acres in the lot, but only about 104, but wished to get the even $4,270. The cheque and receipt remained in the defendant\u2019s possession for a couple of days when Egan reported that the plaintiff would not pay for more land than was in the lot, whereupon the defendant handed back the cheque and the copy of the receipt to Egan and refused to carry out the sale.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s action for specific performance was tried before Mr. Justice Perdue, who maintained the action, rendering his decision as follows:\n\u201cI find that Egan had authority from Simon to make the sale in the pleadings mentioned. If there were any variations in the terms, the defendant raised no question concerning them when they were communicated to him on Saturday evening. Simon simply wished to vary the price so as to get $4,270 instead of the $40 per acre, which he had asked when speaking to Egan on the 3rd, and giving the terms on which he would sell. I think Simon assented to what Egan had done but wished him to get Gilmour to vary the contract simply as to the price and pay the increased amount.\n\u201cI believe the testimony of Egan to be substantially correct. I attach no credibility to the defendant\u2019s testimony.\n\u201cI give judgment declaring that: (1). The agreement in the pleadings mentioned should be specifically performed and carried out; (2). That the plaintiff is entitled to have the agreement specifically performed, and do order and adjudge the same accordingly; (3). Abatement in price for deficiency in acreage; (4). Reference if desired by either party as to the title; (5). Liberty reserved to either party to apply to a judge as to any question that, may arise in carrying out the relief given or in working out the provisions of the judgment; (6). On payment of purchase money, defendant to convey to plaintiff; (7). Defendant to pay plaintiff\u2019s costs.\nThe full court reversed this decision by the judgment now appealed from.\nNesbitt K.C. and Coutlee K.C. for the appellant.\nAylesworth K.C. and Affleck for the respondent. SEDGEWICK J. and GIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The question to be determined is whether, upon a reasonable construction of the plain tiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant gave Egan an exclusive right to enter into a binding contract with any purchaser for the sale of the defendant\u2019s real estate, or whether such right was a limited one, confined to procuring intending purchasers and submitting their names and offers for approval.\nIn deciding this question the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence must be considered. In his main examination and cross-examination I understand Egan to relate the conversation between him and the defendant exactly as it took place and, as nearly as he could recollect, in the very language used. When afterwards recalled and re-cross-examined I understand his repetition of the conversation to be rather a statement of his own conclusions of the result of his conversation than an attempt to amplify or enlarge what he had already twice sworn to.\nReading his evidence as a whole, I am of the opinion that the authority given was a limited one and did not confer the power, without further consultation, of entering into a binding contract.\nI am also of opinion that the additional term incorporated in the contract entered into by the agent giving the purchaser the privilege of paying off at any time that part of the purchase money to be secured by mortgage was unauthorized and could not be enforced in this action against the principal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I do not find in this case that clear, express and unequivocal authority given by the respondent to Egan, which would enable me to hold the appellant entitled to the specific performance claimed herein.\nI think, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper, Phippen, Tupper, Minty & McTavish\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bradshaw, Richards & Affleck.\n[1] 15 Man.

The court overruled this objection to its jurisdiction, but suo motu raised the question as to whether or not $2,000 was involved in the appeal and called upon counsel for the appellants to support their right to appeal in that respect.\nPowell K.C., and Eanington K.C., for the appellants.\nPugsley K.C., Hazen K.C., Currey K.C., and Ewing, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The only statutory provision by virtue of which we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal is contained in the Winding-up Act. R.S.C. ch. 129, sec. 76, which is as follows:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by leave of a judge of the said Supreme Court (from a judgment under the Act in any province) if the \"amount involved\" in the appeal exceeds two thousand dollars.\nWe are, I think, all of opinion that in the present case there is no amount involved, and, therefore, that we have no jurisdiction. This view is rendered, it seems to me, perfectly clear from the phraseology of section 74 of the Act which gives an appeal from the order or decision of a single judge. In that case, if the question to be raised on the appeal involves future rights, or if the order or decision is likely to affect other cases of a similar nature, or if the amount involved in the appeal exceeds $500, an appeal shall lie.\nThis shews conclusively that there is an appeal to this court only in cases where monetary questions are to be considered, as for instance, where the question is as to whether any one should be placed upon the list of contributories or should be held liable or not liable quoad his character as a shareholder or where some such similar matter is in controversy. The following decisions of this court may be usefully referred to upon the point in question: Stephens v. Gerth[1]; O'Dell v. Gregory[2]; Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements de Qu\u00e9bec[3]; Noel v. Ghevrefils[4]; Talbot v. Guilmartin[5]; Bell v. Vipond[6]; Donohue v. Donohue[7]; Winteler v. Davidson[8]; Tousignant v. County of Nicolet[9]; followed in Leroux v. Parish of Ste.

Judgment appealed from (10 Ont. L.R. 657) reversed, Girouard J. dissenting.\nThe city, and not the company, is the proper authority to determine, decide upon and direct the establishment of new lines, and the service, time-tables and routes thereon. Judgment appealed from affirmed, Sedgewick J. dissenting.\nAs between the contracting parties, the company, and not the city, is the proper authority to determine, decide upon and direct the time at which the use of open cars shall be discontinued in the Autumn and resumed in the Spring, and when the cars should be provided with heating apparatus and heated. Judgment appealed from reversed, Girouard J. dissenting.\nUpon the failure of the company to comply with requisitions for extensions as provided in the agreement, it has no right of action against the city for grants of the privilege to others; the right of making such grants accrues, ipso facto, to the city, but is not the only remedy which the city is entitled to invoke. Judgment appealed from affirmed, Sedgewick J. dissenting.\nCars starting out before midnight as day-cars may be required by the city to complete their routes, although it may be necessary for them to run after midnight or transfer their passengers to a car which would carry them to their destinations without payment of extra fares, but at midnight their character would be changed to night-cars and all passengers entering them after that hour could be obliged to pay night-fares. Sedgewick J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which in part affirmed and in part varied the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin[2], upon a special case stating questions of law for the opinion of the court in pursuance of the consolidated rules (Ontario) numbers 372, 373 and 374, and the proceedings thereon.\nThe City of Toronto, in 1891, acquired the Toronto Street Railway with its appurtenances and property from its former owners and called for tenders for the purchase of the same together with the right and privilege of operating surface tramways in the city for specified term of years, subject to certain conditions and limitations as to the establishment of new lines and branches and respecting the operation of the entire system. An agreement was subsequently entered into between the city and the successful tenderers, in September, 1891, for the purpose of carrying out the sale and the contract in respect to the franchises and privileges granted, which had been assigned to the appellants, and this agreement was validated by legislation under the 99th chapter of the statutes of Ontario, 55 Vict., in 1892. The agreement, bye-law and conditions in question are set forth in the schedules to the statute and the issues to be decided on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nBy the special case the following questions were submitted for the opinion of the court.\n\u201cIs the city or the railway company, and which of them, on the proper construction of the agreement, entitled to determine, decide upon and direct:\u2014\n\u201c1. What new lines shall be established and laid down and tracks and service extended thereon by the company, whether on streets in the city as existing at the date of the agreement or as afterwards extended?\n\u201c2. What time-tables and routes shall be adopted and observed by the company?\n\u201c3. Whether if so determined by the city engineer with the approval of the city council cars which start before midnight must finish the route on which they have so started, though it may require them to run after midnight?\n\u201c4. At what time the use of open cars shall be discontinued in the autumn and resumed in the spring, and when the cars should be provided with heating apparatus and heated?\n\u201c5. In the event of the decision of the court being in favour of the city on any of the above questions, is the city entitled to a decree for specific performance as to the matter so decided or in any and which of them.\n\u201c6. Is the privilege to the city to grant to another person or company for failure of the company to establish and lay down new lines and to open same for traffic or to extend the tracks and services upon any street or streets as provided by the agreement, the only remedy the city can claim?\u201d On hearing the special case Anglin J. decided, in effect, that the right to determine what new lines should be established was vested in the city, not only in respect to lines within its limits as constituted at the time of the contract but also in respect to lines in areas annexed to this city subsequently; that the remedy of the city was not restricted merely to the right of granting the privileges to others upon the failure of the company to construct new lines when required to do so; that the city could settle time\u2011tables, fix the routes of cars, determine the seasons during which open cars might be used and how and when the cars should be heated, but that the city could not compel the company to continue to run, after midnight, cars which, having started before midnight, could not in due course finish their routes by that time. By the judgment appealed from the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of Mr. Justice Anglin, except as to the running of day-cars after midnight, and decided that cars starting out upon their routes before midnight should finish such routes, even if it was necessary to run after midnight in order to do so.\nNesbitt K.C., and Laidlaw K.C., for the appellants.\nAylesworth K.C., and Fullerton K.C., for the respondent.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of Anglin J. in the special case agreed upon between the parties in the course of the action. The action was brought upon the agreements set forth as a schedule to chapter 99 of 55 Victoria (Ontario), 1892, between the plaintiffs and the defendants, relating to the purchase of the street railways and properties and street railway privileges, and involved, on one branch of the case, the questions: (1) Whether under the agreement the defendants were compelled to lay down new lines or extensions of lines in territory annexed to the city after the date of the agreement; (2) Whether the company had a right to choose the streets in the city upon which it would lay down its lines subject to the approval as to location, etc., mentioned in clause 12 of the conditions; (3) Whether the city also had the right under clause 14 of the conditions to require the company to lay down its rails and operate upon a street selected by the city, and if so required, could the company abandon such street or streets and so abandon its exclusive franchise to operate upon such street or streets, and thus allow the city to grant the franchise to another company, the Toronto Railway Company having no right to claim compensation by reason of such grant, or, could the city compel the company when so required to lay down its lines and operate its railway, or obtain any other remedy in addition?\nIn construing an instrument in writing, the court is to consider what the facts were in respect to which the instrument was framed, and the object as appearing from the instrument, and taking all these together it is to see what is the intention appearing from the language when used with reference to such facts and with such an object, and the function of the court is limited to construing the words employed; it is not justified in forcing into them a meaning which they cannot reasonably admit of. Its duty is to interpret, not to enact. It may be that those who are acting in the matter, or who either framed or assented to the wording of the instrument, were under the impression that its scope was wider and that it afforded protection greater than the court holds to be the case. But such considerations cannot properly influence the judgment of those who have judicially to interpret an instrument. The question is not what may be supposed to have been intended, but what has been said. More complete effect might in some cases be given to the intentions of the parties if violence were done to the language in which the instrument has taken shape; but such a course would on the whole be quite as likely to defeat as to further the object which was in view.\nBearing in mind these observations, it is apparent that the City of Toronto owning the railway, then operated by horse cars, advertised the same to be sold to the highest bidder, together with and in addition to such railway, the exclusive privilege of operating surface street railways within the limits of the City of Toronto as is shewn by the bye-law, No. 2920, passed on 27th July, 1891, which recites the Ownership by the City of Toronto of the Toronto Street Railway and all the real and personal property in connection with the working thereof, and that the city had asked by public advertisement for tenders from persons seeking to acquire the said railway and the privileges of operating surface street railways in the City of Toronto.\nCertain conditions were made, numbered from 1 to 47, and the tender of Messrs. Kieley, Mackenzie and Everett was accepted, and the contract, contain- ing some thirty clauses, was entered into on the 1st day of September, 1891, and subsequently, in 1892, an Act was passed validating the agreement and the conditions and tenders therein referred to, and declaring, by its first section, that under the said agreement the purchasers acquired\nand are entitled to the exclusive right and privilege of using and working the street railways in and upon the streets of the said City of Toronto (except certain portions) for the full period of thirty years from the first day of September, 1891, * * * subject, nevertheless, to all the conditions, provisoes and restrictions in the said agreement expressed or contained, and as hereinafter mentioned.\nAnd by the fourth clause therein it was enacted that:\n(1) After the said agreement has been duly assigned to the company it shall, subject to the provisions and conditions contained therein, have full and exclusive power to acquire, construct, complete, maintain and operate * * * along all or any of the said streets or highways of the City of Toronto, subject to the exceptions and under the qualifications contained in the first section hereof.\nAnd further providing by section 19, sub-section 4, for a special case of annexation to the City of Toronto of an outside municipality or any part thereof.\nIn my opinion the city clearly only purported to deal with streets within its jurisdiction. Outside municipalities into whose area the company might desire to extend its operations had independent powers in these respects, and the Act provides that with them the company could make separate arrangements, and without going in detail through the various provisions in the conditions, agreement and statute, it appears to me plain that by the special reference contained in section 19, sub-section 4 of the Act, the parties did not intend to provide for territory subsequently annexed and as to which the city, at the time, had no right to give any franchise or make any contract.\nOn the second part of this branch of the case, it appears to me plain that the city granted the exclusive right to construct, maintain and operate their railway along all or any of the said streets or highways of the City of Toronto subject to the exceptions, etc., contained in the conditions and agreement, and, so far as the right of construction is concerned, I think the only over-riding exception to this power is that contained in clause 12 of the conditions, namely, that the gauge of the system was fixed and the location of the railway on any street should not be made by the company or confirmed by the council until plans thereof, shewing the proposed position of the rails, style of rail to be used, and the other works in each such street had been submitted to and approved in writing by the city engineer, and I think the language of the Privy Council in the case of The City of Toronto v. The Bell Telephone Company of Canada[3], is applicable. To this extent, this clause and clause 14 are derogations from the grant to construct and use and work a railway along any of the streets, and make plain the meaning of \u201csubject to the conditions, provisoes,\u201d etc. I cannot understand how the right to use and operate street railways which has been conferred upon the company along all or any of the streets can be made effective unless they have a right to lay down the rails upon the street and to operate the cars upon them.\nOn the third part of this branch of the case, I am of opinion that clauses 14 and 17 must be read together, and that the city may require the company to extend its tracks and street-car service on such streets as may be from time to time recommended by the city engineer and approved by the city council, etc., but that the language does not import that the purchaser \u201cshall build,\u201d but, upon such requisition being made, the company has the right to abandon the privilege which it had purchased, and that, on so abandoning, it had no right of action against the city for granting the privilege of laying down lines on such streets, and the city had the right to make such grant to another, and that these two clauses contain both the rights and remedies of the parties. In my opinion failure to comply with the requisition ipso facto creates the right of granting a privilege to another person or company, and that is the only remedy, and the remedy which the parties have themselves seen fit to provide. It has been stated in the Court of Appeal that this is an illusory remedy, but reference to Winnipeg Street Railway Co. v. Winnipeg Electric Street Railway Co.[4], and The City of Toronto v. The Toronto Street Railway Co.[5], at page 35, shews that it has apparently been a most effective remedy in the past.\nThe next question involves substantially the point whether the city engineer, under the 26th clause of the conditions, really has the management of the company, or whether, as one would have supposed, the company had the right of management of its own business subject to the express provisions in the public interest for the city engineer to regulate the number of cars and the intervals at which the same should run on the various routes, both as to day cars and night cars. In my opinion it is the legitimate rule of construction to construe words in an instrument in writing with reference to the words found in immediate connection with them. See Robertson v. Day[6], at page 69; also as explained in Inglis v. Robertson[7], at page 630. The headings must be read in connection with the groups to which they belong and interpreted by the light of them.\nAnd, so construing the instrument, I think that having in mind the fact that at the date of the sale it had not been determined whether horse cars should be continued, or whether on main lines the use of electricity, either by overhead trolley (single or double) or storage battery, or by what is known as the slot system, or cable cars, should be adopted, the use of the word \u201cservice\u201d in section 26 must be limited to its context and cannot be taken as an over-riding word destroying all meaning in the subsequent conditions, and rendering 27, 28, 36, 37, 38 and 39 substantially useless. The wide meaning given to the word \u201cservice\u201d in the courts below would render wholly unnecessary the subsequent particular provisions. I think such a construction entirely destructive of the ordinary canons of construction adopted by the courts. I think the cardinal feature to be borne in mind is that the company were empowered to \u201cuse and work\u201d the railway, which involves necessarily the idea of operation through its board of management. I view the fact that an existing system of nearly sixty-two miles in length, enabling the routing of cars through various streets, coupled with the fact that routes are assumed to exist by the wording of the conditions, is evidence that the ordinary management and routing of cars must be left to the company, and I find no word anywhere in the agreement which would justify the assumption that \u201croutes\u201d could be created by the city engineer, whose sole duty is to regulate, under 27 and 28, the time of starting of the cars on such routes as the company lays down, and to fix the intervals at which cars should run. Even if the word \u201cservice\u201d is given an extended meaning under clause 26, that service is confined to what is necessary on each main line, part of same or branch, which in no sense confers a right of creating or fixing the routes, which it was admitted involved a service on various main lines or parts of same or branches and, therefore, a much greater scope than a mere service on a main line or branch taken by itself. The right of regulation in the city engineer which I have indicated, seems to me to conserve all the rights that any person could be reasonably supposed to have contemplated at the time. The company are bound under section 33 to give transfers and to so arrange the system that the transfers could be made effective. The company, not the engineer, is to \u201cmake the arrangements,\u201d that is, route the cars; the engineer is to approve. They are also bound to start the cars on their routes under 27 and 28 under the direction of the city engineer, and necessarily the engineer having the control of the interval between cars must control the number of cars and so conserve the rights of the public to the accommodation which was sought for, namely, to have as many cars in service as the engineer might determine, and to have those cars so routed that the transfer system would be effective. This seems to me to make a clear and harmonious document and to give effect to the various conditions under their various headings, and so read also gives effect to the language both of the statute and the conditions and leaves the company in the management of its business, subject to the qualifications that were intended.\nAnother branch of the case is as to the right of the city engineer to determine the time for running open and closed cars, heating, etc. The headings and the language of clause 36 seem to me to completely negative the suggestion that the city engineer can regulate these matters. It seems to me that the parties must have had in mind a rule of law that any passenger would have a right to complain of improper accommodation, and that it would be for a jury to determine in any case whether the company was complying with the provisions of clause 36, and it is not for the city engineer.\nAnother branch of the case dealt with the running of the cars up to midnight. It seems to me perfectly plain that the proper construction of the document is that the first day-car shall not be compelled to start before 5.30 a.m., and that no day-car can be compelled to run after midnight. The city engineer has a right to start night-cars at such hour as he deems necessary and he can in this way see to it that cars for the accommodation of passengers are kept running on the streets. It was admitted by both counsel that there was no dispute between the parties as to question of fares; that a person who entered a day-car up to midnight had a right to a ride in that car to the end of its route, and under clause 33 a right to transfer to a night-car, without extra fare, and that any person entering a car for the first time after midnight had to pay double fare. Be that as it may, it seems to me quite plain that no day-car can be compelled to run after midnight, and if the city engineer attempted to start day-cars upon a route fixed by the company which would compel any such day-car to run after midnight, the company has a right to so arrange its routes that the all day-cars may finish their run at midnight.\nThis covers the various questions which were submitted other than the fifth, and as to that it seems to me that granted that there may be some other remedy open, the remedy is certainly not open to the court of compelling the company to lay down the line so required, since that would entirely destroy the provision of the contract which permits the company to abandon the street upon which it is so required to lay down a line.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal has correctly answered the questions submitted for our determination. The answer to the first question might be open to some doubts, but they are not strong enough in my mind to cause me to dissent from the views they took. I am, therefore, of opinion that the present appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Osler.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The respondent corporation, having in the year 1891 acquired from its former owners the then Toronto Street Railway with its property and appurtenances, called for tenders for the purchase of the same together with the right and privilege of operating surface street railways in the City of Toronto for a specified time, all tenders being subject to certain conditions of sale which had been previously agreed to by the city council and published with the call for tenders.\nCertain parties successfully tendered and an agreement was made between them and the city in September, 1891, for the purpose of carrying out the sale and contract. The award under which the city had become the owner of the street railway, containing (inter alia) schedules describing the property, the conditions, the tender and the city by-law authorizing the execution of the agreement were each and all expressly incorporated with the agreement and made part and parcel of it.\nThe successful tenderers subsequently applied to the Legislature of Ontario for an Act of incorporation enabling the company to be incorporated to take over from them the contract and agreement they had made with the City of Toronto so that the company might carry out the agreement for the purchase of the street railway and own and operate the same.\nThe necessary legislation was passed by the Province of Ontario, 55 Vict. ch. 99.\nThe agreement was declared, in section 1, with all its schedules to be valid and legal and binding upon the parties and it was further declared that under it the purchasers acquired and were\nentitled to the exclusive right and privilege of using and working the street railways in and upon the streets of the said City of Toronto\nexcepting certain specified portions of such streets.\nThe 4th section of the Act, upon which much reliance was placed by the appellant in support of its argument for the right to lay down a street railway on any street it might select within the city, enacted that:\n(1) After the said agreement has been duly assigned to the company it shall, subject to the provisions and conditions contained therein, have full and exclusive power to acquire, construct, complete, maintain and operate, etc., a double or single track street railway, etc., upon or along all or any of the said streets or highways of the City of Toronto subject to the exceptions and under the qualifications contained in the first section,\u201d etc.\nThe first question to be determined before proceeding to answer those submitted for our decision in this appeal is whether this Act of incorporation and the declarations it contains were in any way intended to alter, extend or enlarge and did in fact alter, extend or enlarge the rights, liabilities, obligations or privileges of the parties to the agreement or whether it was merely intended to validate the agreement and confer upon the company the rights and privileges of the individual parties who had successfully tendered and entered into the agreement with the city subject to the obligations and liabilities of these parties under that agreement.\nI am of the opinion that the incorporating Act was not intended to do more than the latter and that to determine the relative rights, liabilities and obligations of the respective parties to this appeal we are relegated to the agreement and all its schedules and parts which were validated by the incorporating Act and must determine from them the extent and nature of these rights, liabilities and obligations.\nSections one and two of the agreement confer full and exclusive powers of constructing, completing, maintaining and operating street railways upon all or any of the streets of the city but they do not confer any right to do so beyond the right prescribed by the agreement, conditions, etc.\nI have had the advantage of reading the judgments prepared by my brothers Sedgewick and Idington and for the reasons given by them I concur in the answer to the first question that there is no obligation on the part of the railway company, appellant, to lay down tracks and establish services on streets in territorial area added to the city since the date of the agreement.\nI agree with the courts below and with my brother Idington that the railway company has not the right to build extensions of the main line or branches within the city as it existed at the time of the agreement excepting as it may be required to do so under the 14th clause of the agreement. That clause seems to be the only one expressly providing for the establishment and extension of new or additional lines on the streets.\nIt was contended that a further right was given by the statute to the company to build on any street they chose in their own uncontrolled discretion. A construction of the contract and legislation validating the same conferring such a right would, in my opinion, be a very startling one and would require very clear language to support it. The exclusive power to build and operate no doubt is given but the right to exercise the power is controlled by the agreement and can be exercised only when called into existence under and in manner provided for by the 14th clause. Even under the 11th clause of the agreement the city while conceding to the company the right to change the method of operating the street railway to electric power so far as then existing tracks were con- cerned reserved complete control as to when the change to electric cars should be made so far as branch lines or extensions of the main line and branches were concerned. To give the company the exclusive power to construct and operate street railways on any streets of the city and so prevent competition was one thing. To confer the uncontrolled right of building and operating on any street the company might from time to time select was quite another and different thing. On this branch of the question I concur with the Court of Appeal and my brother Idington.\nI am also of opinion, answering the 6th question, that if the company should fail to establish any new line which it was required to establish under the 14th clause the remedy of the city for breach of the requirement is not confined to what in many if not in most cases would be the illusory one of granting the privilege to establish such line to some other person or company but that it may resort to its other remedies under the contract. The specific power to make such a grant might, in certain conceivable cases, be a desirable one for the city to possess while quite illusory as a remedy in others and was properly introduced into the agreement for the purpose of avoiding difficulties which the exclusive powers granted to the company would probably give rise to. But it was not intended as the only remedy the city might resort to arising out of the neglect of the company to carry out its obligations.\nThen with respect to the time-tables and routes to be adopted and observed by the company I adopt the reasoning of Anglin J. He says:\nReading clauses 26, 27 and 28 of the conditions together and having regard to the tenor of the whole agreement, I think the con- clusion is inevitable that both time-tables and routes are within their purview. The city engineer cannot satisfactorily or efficiently exercise his right to determine speed, service and intervals between cars unless he also possesses power to decide upon and fix routes. His right to determine, with the approval of the city council, the \u201cservice\u201d necessary upon all lines is unrestricted and is quite wide enough to include the power to specify the routes to be established and maintained. Given the routes and condition No. 27, fixing the hours of starting and finishing the daily runs, the making of time-tables is nothing more than a convenient method of exercising the right to determine speed and intervals.\nFor these reasons and those given by the Court of Appeal I concur with the answer given by it to the second question.\nMuch was said at the argument before us as to the unreasonableness of such a construction with which I do not agree. It seems to me that to allot to the company the determination of the routes while giving the power and imposing the duty on the city engineer of determining alike the \u201cspeed\u201d and the service necessary on each main \u201cline\u201d as also the \u201cintervals\u201d between which day-cars are to run would be more likely to create chaos than the construction I have concurred in as the proper one.\nThe contention put forward by the company as the proper answer to question 3, namely, that day-cars are not to be started at a later hour than would clearly enable them to finish their route before midnight is not I think the proper one. By this construction it was admitted that day-cars could not be started on any of the routes after 11 or 11.15 o\u2019clock p.m. I think a fair answer to the question is that cars started before midnight as day-cars must finish the route on which they have so started though it may require them to run after midnight or transfer their passengers to a car which would carry them to their destination, but that at midnight they, eo instanti, change their character to night-cars and all passengers entering them after that hour must pay the night fares.\nI concur in the answer proposed to question 4 by my brother Sedgewick and Idington and in the disposition made by them of the 5th question.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe case is reported in 10 Ontario Law Reports, page 657, maintaining in part and varying in part the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin in 9 Ontario Law Reports, 333.\nI am of opinion that the answer given to the first question by the Court of Appeal should be varied, so as to exclude the obligation of the railway company to establish and lay down tracks and services on streets in territorial area added to the city since the date of the agreement.\nI am unable to see anything in the contract binding the railway company in respect of future extensions of the city, save so far as is expressed in clause 16 of the conditions of sale incorporated with the agreement and section 19 of the Act whereby the appellants became incorporated and bound to execute the agreement entered into by the purchasers.\nI cannot see how these provisions may be so enlarged as to imply that all the rest of the contract must necessarily be held as intended to become operative in any new territory annexed to the city, whenever and wherever such additions might happen to be made.\nTo provide in express terms for such a contract, as operative and binding from the execution thereof, would have been beyond the powers of the municipal corporation. It is said, however, that it was unnecessary to have made any provision anticipating such extensions because the contracting parties well knew that the City of Toronto was likely to expand within thirty years from the date of the contract, during which the franchise created thereby was to exist, and must be taken to have contracted in light of that anticipation and in light of the provisions of the Municipal Act to continue the corporate existence, in such cases of addition to a municipality, so as to give the municipality the same powers over the new territory as it had over the old.\nI am, after fully considering all these things, still unable to apprehend how any such implication must necessarily exist, in a contract such as we have to pass upon, as would make all the covenants between the parties that bound them in relation to the old territory operative upon the new.\nThe provisions for continuous existence of the city and all its corporate powers when its territorial limits have been extended are merely relative to jurisdiction. It would seem as if the necessity for expressly providing, as the Municipal Act does, that in the case of annexation of new territory the by-laws of the city shall be held to apply to the new territory, suggests that contracts of this nature, if to operate upon the new territory, must do so by express provision made therefor. There is none shewn in the Municipal Act or any other act. There is none in this contract.\nStatus and jurisdiction are not in any way the same thing as a contract, which either may enable to be made. The contract may, and generally must, remain valid even if the status be lost or the jurisdic- tion be increased or diminished. But can its operative field be of necessity affected by any such change and especially in a contract of this nature?\nThere seems to me to be a confusion of ideas in contending that this jurisdiction over a defined area and the inhabitants thereof must, of necessity, give such legal effect to a contract with a municipal corporation to do something to or in relation to its property as existent before extension as to bind the contracting parties to do or submit to have the things contracted for done to the new extension of property or domain.\nBut for what has been brought under our notice and stoutly maintained I would have said that such a case needed only to be stated to carry with it refutation. If it need, as it seems to need, refutation I may illustrate the distinction by something like unto what may come to be within the range of modern possibilities.\nIf a fire insurance company should undertake with a municipal corporation for a fixed compensation the fire risk for a number of years of all the houses within its bounds, or a life insurance company undertake in like manner for such a term to pay at the death of each of the inhabitants a certain sum of money, and the risks were in either case within the term without further consideration doubled or trebled simply by joining one municipality to another and the name and jurisdiction of the one, thus supposedly contracted with, extended to include the increased size, surely there could not be found any one to claim that such added risks in such a contract were within the terms of the contract or the reasonable intendment thereof. On the other hand, if, by an enactment, power were given to a municipality to insure the houses and inhabitants therein against fire and death respectively, and the defined area of the municipality were added to by legislation, it would not surprise or shock any one, if the defined area were then doubled, to find it contended that the power of insurance could be exercised within the increased district and for the added inhabitants.\nWhy are we likely to be surprised or shocked by the first proposition and undisturbed by the second? Plainly because the reasonable or probable intendment was obviously against the first proposition and yet might be within the second. And why? The first relates to a contract, the other to extended power or authority implied in extended jurisdiction.\nApply this to the case in hand.\nWhen we look at the thing they are contracting about, the nature of the enterprise involved, the many uncertain factors in the operation of such a contract, even within a well-known and defined area, and we reflect how much more complicated the contract must be if projected into the future possibilities that might arise in relation to any added territory, we seem to be forbidden to entertain the thought that any such contracting parties could have intended to apply the terms agreed upon for thirty years to territory over which neither party had any domain or any security for the future condition thereof in any regard, and especially in regard to the value thereof for the purpose of constructing therein or extending therein a system of street railway.\nWe must bear in mind that the key note of this contract is an exclusive right for thirty years. We must also bear in mind that whilst the city could assure the company in regard to the exclusive right within the then existing boundaries that there was no power that could exclude any other railway system from existing or coming into existence in what was likely to become part of the territory to be added in course of time to the city.\nAmbitious suburban towns might spring up, with municipal powers enabling them to construct such railways and form such alliances in regard to the transportation of their own people not only through and about their own town but to do business with and in the centre of the greater town. We might find existent railways, at the time this contract was executed, which in all probability would grapple with the situation and make accessory to their business the entire travel of such suburban towns. The chances were entirely, one would say, in favour of such development, rather than that the territory to be occupied by these suburban towns would remain and be in regard to railway service, for years before and at annexation, like a blank sheet of paper to have written over it the policy of the City of Toronto in relation to street railways.\nTo assume that such adjacent territory might possibly within thirty years be annexed might be reasonable; but to assume that it would be annexed in the same plight and condition in every way in relation to the development of street railway business as when this contract was entered into is something that the common knowledge of any one living upon this continent with observant eyes is unlikely to believe was assumed.\nI can hardly comprehend how the varying and variable conditions likely to arise, beyond the power of control of the contracting parties here, could have been adequately dealt with within their limited powers in any other way than that in which it was dealt with in section 19 of the incorporating Act or in something of a similar way.\nThe parties anticipated, as was likely, that the company might pave the way for future annexations and pave the way also for future accommodations and future extensions of the relation of the contracting parties hereto and encouraged the company to extend its tracks into the suburban district. Hence in relation thereto they provided for the junction of tracks by stipulating that the grade should be appropriate to such junction. And in the event of annexation such extensions of the company\u2019s lines were to become subject to the terms of this contract.\nIf we find that the contracting parties had no power to go beyond the then area of the city or right to assume the continuation of things beyond that in the same condition, how can we attribute to them any such purpose or intention as that of extending the contract thereto as within their contemplation? How can we under such a contract unless by express language seek to bind them? How can we where they have by express language partially dealt with this problem hold that there was any reasonable intendment to go beyond what they have so expressed? It seems to me, with every respect, that if ever there was a case in which the maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d was applicable this must be one.\nI do not read the judgment of the Privy Council[8], as deciding this question at all. The court was dealing with one of those very extensions of a line which the contract expressly provided for as far as it could then provide for it.\nThe company having sought to take it out of the operation of this contract by maintaining they had built not by virtue thereof, but under another charter, refused to pay the mileage contracted for. That was decided against it and the decision upheld by the Privy Council. Needless to say that had the Privy Council judgment been otherwise than of this character and an express decision upon the point now in question we would not have been now troubled with it.\nI am of opinion, further, that the power to direct the establishment and laying down of new lines within the city as it existed at the date of the agreement came entirely within the scope of clause 14 of the conditions of sale.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Osler when he says that,\none cannot read the contract between these parties without seeing how anxiously\u2014I do not know how effectively\u2014the city has attempted to provide in many respects for the control of their streets and for the protection and convenience of the public.\nI will not labour with the question. It is to be gathered from the entire scope and purpose of the contract as a whole that clause 14 I have referred to was intended to be the governing authority in regard to the establishment of new lines.\nThere could be in the minds of those concerned in the business no doubt but that the city would prefer to have as many tracks and as much street car service as could possibly be got. The thing to be feared was not that the city would object to the rail- way company laying down a new track, but that it might be tardy in doing so.\nThe company, on the other hand, had to fear lest the desire for new lines would go beyond the bounds of reason and justice and hence the provision that two-thirds of all the members of the council must assent before such an obligation could be imposed upon the company.\nThe social and Commercial forces at work would solve the rest.\nThere need not and should not be two parties armed with authority to outline where new lines should be run. One authority, or source of authority, should suffice.\nThis interpretation of the contract will become more apparently correct by the application of the propositions that I am about to submit in relation to question 2.\nIf the city engineer had the right to direct which route should be taken, as I think he had, it would almost necessarily follow that effective operation could only be given to that power by the same remaining in the same hands that directed the placing of new lines.\nIt seems to me it would have been a manifest absurdity that the exercise of these powers so related if not absolutely dependent on each other should be in different hands.\nMuch has been said of the meaning of the word \u201cservice\u201d as used in the 26th condition of sale. It is urged that it applies to and was intended to apply to the subjects, or some of the subjects, under the head of \u201cTracks, etc., and Roadways,\u201d of which clause 26 is the last. It has been especially, urged that inasmuch as the electric or other new system of motor or a combined system were contemplated that a selection from the varieties of motive power or mechanical means of applying motive power might be what was referred to. I cannot accept any one of these suggestions; indeed I think that the application of clause 26 to such subject matters or any one of them would be strained. Paragraph 26 hardly seems germane to most of the paragraphs that precede it under this heading.\nIn almost everything provided for under the heading of \u201cTracks, etc., and Roadways\u201d the city engineer and council, or both, are in each particular case, including selection of motive power, referred to as the determining authority. It was not necessary for the purpose of applying their authority to any of these subject matters to reiterate it in clause 26 or to connect it with the use of the words \u201cthe speed\u201d as is done in the clause 26, which reads as follows:\n26. The speed and service necessary on each main line, part of same or branch, is to be determined by the city engineer and approved by the city council.\nWhat is the most obvious meaning that the word \u201cservice\u201d can have in such a sentence in such a contract? What was the purpose of every appliance, track, car, motive power and the service of the men all combined but to furnish a service? What was that service? The transportation of passengers on these tracks, in these cars, by means of this motive power.\nThe transportation of the largest number of passengers that could possibly be induced to accept the use of these cars was the object of the entire contract and all that relates to the contract. But for the reiteration in detail of some particular parts of what were covered by the words used in 26 there could not have rested a shadow of doubt in regard to what the word \u201cservice\u201d here means.\nThe draftsman, like many others, has in the two following sections of these conditions seen fit to specify particulars as to day-cars and night-cars and thereby weaken the force of the general and comprehensive expression of the ideas present to his mind in framing clause 26. The power of generalization, the apt use of words to express a generalization when the idea has been once seized and the courage to leave such expression as first and best bodied forth are very often more or less wanting in the drafting of documents such as we are now dealing with.\nClause 13 of the agreement seems intended to rectify these defects in the agreement and conditions by adding,\nit being understood that the reference to particular matters to be performed by the purchasers shall not diminish or limit the obligations of this agreement.\nMaking allowances for these considerations and having regard to the latter part of clause 13 just quoted, I have no hesitation in accepting the word \u201cservice\u201d here as conclusively meaning all that is implied in fixing a route. Not only is the wise selection of routes necessary to maintain the service (that is, the transportation of passengers), in the highest degree of efficiency in working the railway but it is of the very essence of such service that it shall be so determined as to so meet the requirements of those using the streets that there will be accommodated the largest possible number that can be accommodated by means of a given mileage of track. The citizens would probably feel more promptly and acutely than the shareholders of the company the lack of the best possible service. The engineer would therefore be more responsive to new demands than the manager of the company.\nWhen we couple routes with speed and what in both respects is to be done on the main line or part of same or branch we have almost everything that in relation to service can be advantageously determined by the city engineer and approved by the city council, including, of course, what sections 27 and 28 specially covered.\nThe manifest purpose was to control the lessees or contractors who might fail, as they do in such cases, to go to the expense of modifying a service as it becomes less efficient than it may have formerly been.\nFrom time to time a spur is needed in every public service.\nWhat we are asked here to do is to suppose that any and every efficient means of supplying this was omitted.\nSpeaking of the possible incompetency of a city engineer to discharge such a duty is beside the question. It would be equally to the purpose to speak of the manager of the company as possibly incompetent. We must assume both contracting parties intended to have efficient officers. We cannot overlook the facts that both parties to the contract were deeply interested in the best financial results being got, and that though this was the case the interest of the company was and is only temporary whilst that of the city is perpetual.\nThe engineer and manager in order to produce the best results should work harmoniously, each giving the best of his skill and knowledge and results of his experience to the other. One would suppose in such kind of a partnership that the final decision ought to rest with those nominated by the parties who undoubtedly have the greatest and a continuous interest.\nThese considerations, of course, cannot decide the meaning of the contract if clearly expressed in a different sense; but such considerations are an obvious answer to so much of what was strenuously advanced in argument as needed to be borne in mind for the purpose of interpreting correctly this contract.\nWhen we try to find how this word \u201cservice\u201d has been applied in other parts of the same contract we see in every instance where it has been used, except in clause 41, it is applicable to, and can, I think, only be fairly read as being applied to the transportation of passengers.\nIn clause 14 it is contradistinguished from the tracks and properly described as a street car service. In condition 17 it is again used in contradistinction to the tracks, and in 33 it is used in harmony with the idea of transportation of passengers, when it provides for the transfer service as a means of carrying out the transportation. And when used in the condition 36 it is the car that is designed for what? For service in the transportation of passengers. The same may be said to be true of its use in condition number 40.\nI do not think it derogates from the force of this to find that the word \u201cservice\u201d is used in 41 in relation to the word \u201cmen\u201d in its original sense.\nTime-tables and routes are but incidental to the same idea of transportation of passengers. Stoppages may be also, but though referred to in argument they do not seem covered by any of these questions. As to the third question, I am unable to appreciate what this dispute is about. We have been assured by counsel for the appellants that there is not and has never been any claim to turn out a passenger who may have entered upon a car near midnight before that passenger was carried to his destination. We also are assured that no such passenger has ever had exacted or claimed from him the double fare payable after midnight.\nI can conceive that the use of a day-car after midnight when passengers are few may entail extra expense upon the company and that the gradual introduction of the night-car instead of the day-car would be less burthensome for the company and quite as serviceable for the greater part of the time as carrying out the requirements of the city engineer. At other times this might not be so.\nI am unable, however, to see how the requirements of the citizens and other passengers can be ensured, by any other means, within the specifications in this contract, than those the city engineer has adopted. I can conceive of a manager in the car-barn being able, from day to day, and night to night, to accurately determine whether or not the requirements of the travelling public would or would not be served by putting on night coaches earlier than midnight. I am unable, however, to see how the city engineer can foretell all this. If these parties cannot accommodate each other in any other way than by a rigid interpretation of the provisions of the contract in this regard it must be applied. I think undoubtedly the correct answer has been given by the Court of Appeal to this third question.\nAs to question 4 and the answer thereto, I am unable to concur in the view expressed by the Court of Appeal.\nI think it would be impossible to carry out by any hard and fast rule, consistently with the greatest degree of the comfort and convenience of the passengers, just what the city engineer has chosen to lay down. The requirements in spring months and fall months might vary from week to week, from day to day in changeable weather such as occasionally occurs in spring and autumn. Such an interference with the carrying on of the appellants\u2019 business is undesirable and ought therefore not to be inferred as intended. It does not form an essential part of the service and so necessarily come within clause 26 as I interpret it.\nClause 36 I think provides all that is to be looked at in this connection. The section on this point reads thus:\nCars are to be of the most approved design for service and comfort, including heating, lighting, signal appliance, numbers and route boards.\nPlainly the cars here spoken of are not those that are in the barn but those that are actually running, and they must be heated, lighted, as well as otherwise according to the most approved design.\nThat does not entitle a company to put out a summer car in winter weather or a winter car in summer weather. It leaves, as there is no power given to any one expressly or as I think impliedly to determine the matter, the parties complaining, either passengers or covenantees, to their respective remedies on this which by force of clause 13 of the agreement is part of a covenant.\nA persistent defiance of the requirements of this covenant can be dealt with also upon the facts either in a case seeking to rescind the charter or otherwise quite as efficiently as the requirements of the engineer had he the power to specially direct in this regard as I do not think he has. That in the same section there are two objects committed to the determination of the city engineer and that the cars or heating thereof as described are not so intrusted to his direction is to my mind conclusive that it never was intended that anything further should be open to the respondents or others than the usual remedies for a breach, or for persistent breaches of contract on the part of such a corporation as the appellants\u2019.\nI would therefore answer question 4 in the negative.\nI have no doubt of question 5 being properly passed over for the reasons given in the court below.\nI have no difficulty in assenting to and upholding the answer of the Court of Appeal to the 6th question. But for the able and strenuous argument addressed to us I should have supposed the question was not arguable. There is to my mind as clear as can be a covenant to observe each one of the provisions in this contract and one of them is the obligation resting upon the company to obey the requirement of the city council and the city engineer when that is made known in the manner described in clause 14.\nIn effect we are asked to give the same meaning to the word \u201crequire\u201d as if it were \u201crequest\u201d or something that did not imply an obligation upon those subjected to it. I cannot assent to such a proposition.\nThe option rests with the city to accept this alternative of clause 17 or pursue their remedies on the covenant or possibly (upon which point I express no opinion) do both.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be varied accordingly and the appeal to that extent allowed.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

Saunby v. The Water Commissioners of London ([1906] A.C. 110) followed.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment of Meagher J. and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought the action against the Town of North Sydney on account of the injurious affection of her rights as a riparian proprietor and as the owner of privileges in a stream called Smelt Brook which is the only outlet of Pottle's Lake, in the County of Cape Breton. N.S., seeking to recover damages at common law and for an injunction, or, in the alternative, for statutory compensation and a mandamus to compel the town to proceed to expropriate the property affected and have the compensation assessed by appraisers under the provisions of chapter forty-four of the statutes of Nova Scotia for 1896. The plaintiff is the owner of lands on both sides of Smelt Brook a short distance below the lake and has also the right, acquired from riparian owners above her lands, to run a pipe two hundred feet in length up-stream for the purpose of getting a head of water. She built a laundry on her land, erected a dam, ran a pipe up to the dam, installed laundry machinery with a turbine wheel with a flume and raceway and operated the machinery by means of the water-power thus obtained.\nBy the above mentioned Act the town was authorized and empowered to provide for its inhabitants a good and sufficient supply of water for domestic uses, fire protection and other purposes and to construct the necessary works, lay pipes, build dams and reservoirs, acquire lands and to do all other necessary things in relation thereto. The provisions of the statute affecting the matters in issue are contained in the second, fourth and fifth sections, which are as follows:\n\"2. For the purpose of obtaining the said supply of water the town council are hereby authorized and empowered to enter upon all lands within the limits of the Town of North Sydney, and upon all lands in the County of Cape Breton outside the limits of the Town of North Sydney, and to enter upon the bed of any river, lake or stream whatsoever in the County of Cape Breton, and to build dams, reservoirs or other works wherever necessary, and to cause the water to overflow the land bordering on such river, lake or stream, and to take from such river, lake, stream or springs, such quantity or quantities of water as may be required; and in the construction, building or repairing of any dams or reservoirs, and in the laying down, constructing, repairing or alteration of any main or service pipe or other structure under the provisions of this Act, the mayor, councillors, or any or either of them, and their engineer, superintendent, servants or workmen, shall have full power, and they are hereby authorized, from time to time, as occasion may require, to enter upon any lands or tenements, inhabited or uninhabited, both within the said town or outside of the same, and may remain thereon as long as they may deem requisite for the proper execution of the work, and make all such excavations on the premises as may be expedient, and take up and remove any floors, timbers, planks, walls, fences or erections whatsoever, doing no unnecessary damage to the same, and carefully replacing the same, as far as can be, on the requisite work being performed.\n\"4. Whenever it shall be necessary for the securing the necessary supply of water, the laying down or placing of any reservoirs, tanks, fountains, pipes, leaders or tubes, or for any purposes whatsoever under this Act, that the town shall be invested with the title or possession of or in any lot or parcels of lands and premises, situated anywhere, either in the town or outside the corporation limits, it shall and may be lawful for the council, in case they cannot agree with the proprietors of such lands, respectively, for the purchase or lease thereof as may be required, to give notice in writing to the party whose lands are intended to be taken, or to his agent, that the said lands are required for the purposes of the town under this Act, and shall request the party or his agent, whose land it is proposed to take or occupy, to appoint one arbitrator, and the council shall appoint one arbitrator, and a judge of the Supreme Court shall appoint a third arbitrator, and the arbitrators so appointed shall proceed to determine the damages, if any, and award the same to be paid to the owner or occupier, as the case may be, whose award, or the award of any two of them, shall be final and conclusive, provided the town council decide to take such lands; and thereupon the town shall pay and satisfy within six months to those entitled to receive the same, the full amount of such award or valuation, and immediately upon the payment or tender of the sum awarded as aforesaid to the owners, or in case of dispute to such parties as a judge of the Supreme Court shall decide, the town shall be and be deemed the rightful purchasers and owners in fee simple of such lot or parcel of land with the appurtenances, if the said award be for the purchase thereof, or otherwise the tenant thereof for such time as in such award set forth, and in case the proprietor of such lands neglect or refuse to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days after due notice as aforesaid, or in case the proprietor cannot be found, or is absent and has no known agent residing in the province, a judge of the Supreme Court may appoint such arbitrator, who shall be disinterested and not a resident of North Sydney. If the town council have no reason to fear any claims of encumbrances, or if any party to whom compensation is payable cannot be found, or is unknown, or if for any other reason the council may deem it advisable, the council may pay such compensation into the office of the prothonotary of the Supreme Court of the County of Cape Breton, a judge of which court shall by order direct it to be deposited in some bank, there to remain until by him directed to be paid out to the party entitled thereto, and shall deliver to the prothonotary aforesaid a copy of the award, and such award or a certified copy thereof under the hand and seal of the prothonotary aforesaid, together with his receipt for the amount awarded, when registered in the registry of deeds office for the County of Cape Breton, shall thereafter be deemed to be the title of the town to the property therein mentioned.\n\"5. In the event of any damage being done in the execution of the work the party sustaining such damage shall be entitled to receive such compensation as shall be mutually agreed upon, and in case no such agreement can be made, three appraisers, one to be appointed by the party sustaining such damage, one to be appointed by the town council, and the third to be appointed by the two appraisers already so appointed, shall view the premises and determine the damages, if any, without hearing evidence in the matter, the decision of said appraisers, or any two of them, to be final and binding on the parties, and the amount so assessed to be paid within three months thereafter. In case the party sustaining such damage shall not appoint an appraiser as aforesaid within thirty days from the service upon him of a notice in writing requesting him to appoint such appraiser, the judge of the county court for district number seven may appoint such appraiser.\"\nUnder the powers conferred by the Act, the town constructed a system of waterworks obtaining all its supply from Pottle's Lake and the plaintiff complained that, thereby, such large quantities of water were diverted and abstracted from their natural flow through Smelt Brook past and over her lands that the value of her property was greatly diminished and the effective operation of her water-power injuriously affected.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Graham decided in favour of the plaintiff and adjudged that she was entitled to such damages as might be awarded by appraisers to be appointed under the provisions of the fifth section of the Act, and that she was entitled to a mandamus against the town directing the appointment of an appraiser on its behalf and for the proceedings therein provided. By the judgment appealed from this decision was reversed and the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs, Russell J. dubitante.\nDrysdale K.C.

Section 5, which provides for the case of damages caused by entries upon lands authorized by sec. 2 of the Act in the \"execution of the work,\" but does not look upon the taking of water as the doing of damage, and cannot have been intended to provide compensation for value of impaired riparian rights.

The section requires a prior attempt at agreement, and in the event of failure to agree, the party sustaining damage must appoint an appraiser. The party sustaining the damage is first named in the Act. In a proper case, he must move first, and if he does not move, the Act provides compulsory process. It is necessary to prove a prior disagreement between the parties and a neglect or refusal to appoint an appraiser before the remedy by mandamus may be invoked.

Dawson[72].\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The determination of this appeal depends upon the construction to be given to section two of chapter forty-four of the statutes of Nova Scotia of 1896, and of sections four and five of the same Act.\nThe majority of the court are of the opinion that while section two gives to the town council of North Sydney the power to divert the stream in question and to take water therefrom, such diversion and taking can only be done subject to the provisions of section four and that no entry or works done upon the lands through which the stream in question flows or any diversion of the waters thereof can be made until after the arbitration proceedings under section four are taken.\nSection five, we think, relates only to cases where damage is done the property by the construction, as distinguished from the operation, of the work authorized to be done.\nThe Town of North Sydney was, therefore, a trespasser when it diverted the plaintiff's waters from their natural course and appropriated such waters for the purposes of the town and, under ordinary circumstances, would be compellable to pay damages for the trespass complained of. Counsel for the plaintiff, however, during the argument in this court expressly waived any claim for damages asking only a perpetual injunction restraining the town from continuing the tortious acts referred to. This she is entitled to upon the same principles that influenced their Lordships of the Privy Council in Saunby v. The Water Commissioners of London[73], a case which would doubtless have been followed had the judgment been given before the trial of the present action.\nThe result is that the appeal is allowed and that judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff as herein stated, she being entitled to costs in all the courts below and here.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgewick. The appeal should be allowed and judgment should be entered for the appellant with costs in the courts below and in this court. DAVIES J.\u2014This appeal depends, in my judgment, entirely upon the construction to be given to the statute as a whole, chapter 44 of 59 Vict. of the statutes of Nova Scotia for 1896. This statute is, as one of the counsel for respondent observed, unique and unlike any other statute to be found in the province and, I might add, in any other province of the Dominion.\nI doubt whether much assistance can be gained from any of the array of cases decided under the English Lands Clauses Consolidation or Railway Clauses Consolidation Acts or the many private Acts giving power to expropriate lands to private companies. These statutes are carefully drawn, apt and proper language is used and provisions introduced for the purpose of protecting all interests likely to be affected. The statute before us for construction is inartifically drawn, improper and inapt language is used and no general clause was inserted for the protection of interests likely to be affected or prejudiced by the exercise of the powers granted.\nThere are, however, several well known rules or canons of construction which may be drawn from the cases decided on these expropriation clauses of private Acts and which may with advantage be borne in mind while endeavouring to determine the full and true meaning of this crude bit of legislation. One of these rules is not to impute unnecessarily to the legislature the intention to confiscate private property and that in the absence of any clear language shewing the existence of such intention, the rights conferred on a private company or corporation compulsorily to take the lands or property of an individual, may well be held to be commensurate and cor-relative with the obligation imposed to pay compensation. I say such will be the general rule applied but of course If the statute is plain, clear and unambiguous nothing remains for the court but to give effect to it however unfortunate or unjust the Act of confiscation may be. If the language conferring powers of expropriation is, however, ambiguous and doubtful as to their extent and the compensation clauses are limited in their scope and definite in their extent the statute will have a construction put upon it which will avoid confiscation and the ambiguous language of the expropriation clause will be limited to cover such property and interests only as are provided for in the compensation clauses. And this is only another way of stating the proposition that the courts will not impute to the legislature an intention to confiscate private rights and interests.\nIf the statute is clear and authorizes the promoters to do any particular act or thing and it is done in a proper and reasonable manner even though it should work a special injury to a particular individual or his property, the only remedy he would have would be for compensation under the Act and if no compensation was provided he would be without a remedy.\nAs was said by Lord Macnaghten in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in East Freemantle Corporation v. Annois[74], at page 217.\nThe law has been settled for the last hundred years. If persons in the position of appellants, acting in the execution of a public trust and for the public benefit, do an act which they are authorized by law to do and do it in a proper manner though the act so done works a special injury to a particular individual, the individual injured cannot maintain an action. He is without remedy unless a remedy is provided by the statute.\nIt was upon that principle the judgment of the court below proceeded in dismissing this action, namely, that the works built and executed by the town council were within and not beyond those expressly authorized by the statute and were properly and reasonably done, and that the statute not having provided compensation the plaintiff was without a remedy. I agree with them that the statute does not provide compensation for such a case as the plaintiff's. I differ from them as to the works not being beyond or in excess of the statutory authority, and on this ground would allow the appeal and grant a new trial for the assessment of damages. The case of Geddis v. Proprietors of Bann Reservoir[75], is very instructive upon the question, as is also the judgment of Far-well J. in the case of Roberts v. Charing Cross E. & H. Railway Company[76]. In his judgment amongst other statements pertinent to the case before us he says:\u2014\nThere may be questions of construction which are affected to some extent by the consideration whether compensation is or is not given by the Act, but the same principle applies to all. If the Act of Parliament has authorized the particular thing to be done then you cannot sue a man or a company for doing what is a lawful act. In my opinion this principle applies whether the powers are given to public authorities acting for the public benefit or to railway companies or others acting for their own profit.\nThe statute here in question was one intituled \"An Act to provide for supplying the Town of North Sydney with water.\" The first section conferred upon the town in general terms the power so to provide either by contract or by itself constructing the works and doing all things necessary to be done to carry out the object. The second section for the purpose of obtaining the necessary supply of water generally empowered the council\nto enter upon all lands in the County of Cape Breton and to enter upon the bed of any river, lake or stream in the county, and to build dams and reservoirs where necessary, and to cause the water to overflow the land bordering on such river, lake or stream, and to take from such river, lake or stream such quantities of water as may be required.\nThe fourth section enacted that\nwhenever it shall be necessary for the securing the necessary supply of water * * * or for any purposes whatsoever under this Act that the town should be invested with the title or possession of or in any lots or parcels of land situated anywhere\nit should be lawful for the council in case it could not agree with the owners for the lease or purchase of the lands to take the same compulsorily. The section then goes on to specify the procedure to be adopted in the compulsory purchase and the mode or method of assessing the damages and declares that\nimmediately upon the payment or tender of the sum awarded * * * the town shall be and be deemed the rightful purchaser and owners in fee simple of such land with the appurtenances if the award be for the purchase thereof or otherwise the tenant thereof for such: time as in such award set forth.\nThe section then goes on to provide for the payment into court of the money awarded in case the party to whom the compensation is payable cannot be found.\nNow many difficulties, some of them perhaps insuperable, might be met in the attempt to apply such crude and ill drafted legislation to the purchase of many titles or interests.\nThe Nova Scotia Interpretation Act might, no doubt, help in some cases, because it says that the word \"lands\" shall, wherever used, include\nlands, tenements, hereditaments and all rights thereto and interests therein.\nBut putting a reasonable and fair construction upon these two sections I conclude that section two was intended generally to confer and did confer upon the town council the \"authority and power\" in addition to its municipal functions to enter upon lands, build reservoirs and dams upon them, dam up and back the water, overflow the lands bordering on rivers, lakes or streams, and to take from them such water as might be required. Such general power was no doubt given but the mode of its exercise, the procedure to be adopted in changing the power into a right, the limitations and obligations imposed upon the exercise of the right were, so far as they were set out and defined at all, set out in the fourth section from which I have quoted above.\nOnly such rights are given as could be gained by the exercise of the powers granted as prescribed by this fourth section. No other or greater are provided for. If under that section, in the exercise of the powers conferred, the town council amicably purchased the lands of an owner in fee it was authorized by the second section to do so and on the necessary documents being signed- became the owner in fee itself. If the estate or interest so amicably purchased was other or less than the fee of course only the lesser estate passed. If the compulsory powers were resorted to under the section then the estate or interest of the person notified might be expropriated but no more nor other estate than he possessed no matter what it might be. And as the section does not provide for the \"injurious affection\" by the town council of any lands, and it was not essential to the exercise of any of the powers conferred upon them that they should injuriously affect any other lands than those they took under their compulsory powers, the result follows that if they did so injuriously affect other lands, such for instance as those of the plaintiff by taking away or abstracting from her the natural flow of water which the trial judge and the appeal court held she had a right to flow over her land, they did so wrongfully and to the extent they did so are trespassers.\nNo one could successfully contend that either the amicable or compulsory purchase of certain property from third persons could in itself give the right contended for by the defendant here to destroy the right of the plaintiff which defendant did not purchase or treat for to the natural flow of water across and over her property.\nSuppose the case I put during the argument. The bed of a lake is owned by ten or twelve several owners in ten or twelve several equal or nearly equal parts. Could it be seriously argued that the purchase, amicable or compulsory, of that particular owner's part of the bed of such lake nearest its outflow gave the town council the right to enter upon that portion and drain off all the water from the other parts of the lake and that without treating with the owners of such other parts and without compensation? Such a proposition need only be stated in order to refute it. No express power or right to divert the natural course or run of any stream is given by the Act.\nI interpret the statute, reading it as a whole, to invest the town council with the power it did not otherwise possess of buying either amicably or compulsorily lands outside of the town, laying pipes, building dams and reservoirs on the lands bought, overflowing the banks of lakes and streams upon lands which they might buy, and taking from all these lakes and streams not only all such surplus or additional water which by their dams or works they might dam back and retain, but also all the water which the owners or persons from whom they bought might have of right taken or abstracted before any dams were built with the correlative obligation of compensation to each owner. I refuse to extend the right or power of the town council to take away or injuriously affect the valuable right of other parties without compensation. Such an extension would mean confiscation not expropriation, and would require much clearer language to justify it than is found in the statute.\nI agree with the court below in its reasoning and conclusion that neither the fourth nor the fifth sections provides for compensation to the plaintiff in this case because neither her lands nor any right or interest in them have been taken by the respondent and the sections do not provide for damages caused by injuriously affecting lands. Bush v. Trowbridge Waterworks Co., 1875,[77]. I do not think the damage done a necessary incident of the powers conferred or that any authority under the statute existed to justify the injury caused the plaintiff. So far as the defendant has taken away the plaintiff's right to the natural flow of water over her lands it is a trespasser.\nThe case is one where damages will be a complete satisfaction for the injury and wrong. These damages can be assessed by the court once for all with or without the assistance of a jury as the practice of the province provides, and I think therefore the appeal should be allowed and the case remitted to the court below for the assessment of such damages as the plaintiff has sustained.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The plaintiff who is appellant here was a riparian proprietress in a stream known as \"Smelt Brook\" and entitled, as such, and also by virtue of a grant to her of an easement, to use the waters of the said stream for divers purposes.\nThe respondent's town council were by the Nova Scotia Statute (1896) 59 Vict. ch. 44, sec. 1, empowered to provide for the town a supply of water.\nIncreased powers were given by later legislation to extend this supply to other places.\nSection two of the first mentioned Act was as follows:\u2014\nFor the purpose of obtaining the said supply of water the town council are hereby authorized and empowered to enter upon all lands within the limits of the Town of North Sydney, and upon all lands in the County of Cape Breton outside the limits of the Town of North Sydney, and to enter upon the bed of any river, lake, or stream, whatsoever in the County of Cape Breton, and to build dams, reservoirs or other works wherever necessary, and to cause the water to overflow the land bordering on such river, lake or stream, and to take from such river, lake, stream or springs, such quantity or quantities of water as may be required; and in the construction, building or repairing of any dams or reservoirs, and in the laying down, constructing, repairing or alteration of any main or service pipe or other structure under the provisions of this Act, the mayor, councillors or any or either of them, and their engineer, superintendent, servants or workmen, shall have full power, and they are hereby authorized, from time to time, as occasion may require, to enter upon any lands or tenements, inhabited or uninhabited, both within the said town or outside of the same, and may remain thereon as long as they may deem requisite for the proper execution of the work and make all such excavations on the premises as may be expedient, and take up and remove any floors, timbers, planks, walls, fences or erections whatsoever, doing no unnecessary damage to the same, and carefully replacing the same, as far as can be, on the requisite work being performed.\nSection four of the same Act provides that:\nWhenever it shall be necessary for the securing the necessary supply of water, the laying down or placing of any reservoirs, tanks, fountains, pipes, leaders or tubes, or for any purposes whatsoever under this Act, that the town shall be invested with the title or possession of or in any lots or parcels of lands and premises, situated anywhere, either in the town or outside the corporation limits, it shall and may be lawful for the council in case they cannot agree with the proprietors of such lands respectively for the purchase or lease thereof as may be required, to give notice in writing to the party whose lands are intended to be taken, or to his agent, that the said lands are required for the purposes of the town under this Act, and shall request the party or his agent, whose land it is proposed to take or occupy, to appoint one arbitrator, and a judge of the Supreme Court, etc.\nand following this at length provides details of an appropriate arbitration to fix an amount for compensation and gives the council the option of deciding to take such lands or not, and if accepting, that then the town\nshall be and be deemed the. rightful purchaser and owner in fee simple of such lot or parcel of land with the appurtenances, if the said award be for the purchase thereof or otherwise the tenant thereof for such time as in such award set forth, etc.\nThe respondent pursuant to the powers thus conferred constructed the contemplated works, tapped the lake which fed the stream in question, and drew therefrom such quantities of water as to impair the supply plaintiff by virtue of the rights above mentioned was entitled to enjoy at about a mile below this lake.\nThe questions thus raised are, whether or not, respondent was entitled to do as it has done and if so entitled must it compensate plaintiff? And if it must compensate can it so act as to invade appellant's rights, until it shall have made compensation, or at least taken such steps as to bind it to acquire and to compensate?\nThe learned trial judge found for plaintiff and awarded a mandamus requiring defendant to appoint an appraiser and proceed under section five of the said Act which provides that:\nIn the event of any damage being done in the execution of the work the party sustaining such damage shall be entitled to receive such compensation as shall be mutually agreed upon, and in case no such agreement can be made, three appraisers, one to be appointed by the party sustaining such damage, one to be appointed by the town council, and the third to be appointed by the two appraisers already so appointed, shall view the premises and determine the damages, if any, without hearing evidence in the matter, the decision of said appraisers, or any two of them, to be final and binding on the parties, and the amount so assessed to be paid within three months thereafter. In case the party sustaining such damage shall not appoint an appraiser as aforesaid within thirty days from the service upon him of a notice in writing requesting him to appoint such appraiser, the judge of the county court for district number seven may appoint such appraiser.\nHe thought section four was not applicable.\nThe court en bane reversed this judgment and dismissed the action.\nAt first blush the suggestion that the claim of plaintiff may fall within section five is rather taking. But can what is now complained of be matter of \"damage being done in the execution of the \"work?\"\nThe damages suffered do not arise from \"the execution of the work\" if we take that as the equivalent of the construction of the work and all incidental thereto.\nThe phrase is of ambiguous import. The subject matter provided for was clearly, to the mind of the draftsman, something entirely different from an implication of the acquisition of a title to lands or easements such as one would expect to be desirable and be provided for, to put an end to complaints such as now in question.\nIt is not, however, necessary here to determine more than that the appellant should not be confined to rights such as might rest upon that clause alone.\nThe respondent sets up the rather startling answer to appellant's claim that nothing was done to infringe upon her rights during the construction of the works, and that what has been done was the direct result of using, without negligence, the works after construction, and that the use was authorized by law, and hence no claim for damages. It is an extension of the principles upon which the well-known case of Hammersmith and City Ry. Go. v. Brand[78], rests, that seems to mean this; that if a municipality or company is authorized to carry on a business, not only is it protected against liability for damages arising from the necessary and unavoidable incidents of such a business, which, but for such necessity and unavoidability, so authorized, so legalized, would give rise to actions for damages; but also entitles such municipality or company to appropriate for the purpose of carrying on such business its neighbour's goods.\nSuch would seem to be the logical result of the maintenance of the respondent's position here.\nSuch results are not within, any case or line of cases.\nNothing in this Act imposes upon the municipality here the duty or the necessity of taking from this Smelt Brook or Pottle's Lake anything. If it does take therefrom that which would or may destroy another's property it must abide by the ordinary results of so doing unless it can shew express authority, for doing so without compensation, or that it has imposed by law upon it an imperative legal duty that presents no alternative possibility of discharging, unless by the taking or destroying.\nThe facts do not warrant any such conclusion as necessary. See Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parke[79].\nWe are then driven to see if the statute has given the right of expropriation of the appellant's easement or riparian rights, or if the acts complained of are wholly unauthorized.\nThe answer to this inquiry must depend upon the meaning of the words \"lands and premises\" in section four of the Act.\nThe provisions of section two clearly contemplate the taking not only of lands but of waters.\nThey do not perhaps express clearly and definitely all that was intended to have been covered but they do beyond a possibility of doubt indicate the intention on the part of the legislature of authorizing the expropriation of the rivers and lakes needed by the municipality for the purpose in hand.\nWhere have they executed this intention if not in section four?\nIs it conceivable that it was intended to compensate for lands but not to do so for water?\nIs it possible that anybody could have intended whilst giving a method of paying for and taking land as such that it was intended to confiscate any and all rights in water and the valuable uses it might have been serving? The answers to these questions must be in the negative, and the interpretation of the word \"lands\" given in the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia then in force is as follows:\u2014\n\"The expressions 'land,' 'lands,' 'real estate,' or 'real property,' include respectively lands, tenements, hereditaments and all rights thereto, and interest therein.\"\nAre the words \"interest therein\" in this definition read into the word \"lands\" in the second and fourth sections by virtue of this statutory interpretation,, as we must read them, sufficient to cover the appellant's rights?\nSuch words do not appear in \"the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,\" or \"the Waterworks Clauses Consolidation Act, 1847,\" upon which the greater part of the numerous cases cited to us are founded.\nThe interpretation of the word \"lands\" in one of these statutes reads it so as to include \"messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments of any tenure,\" and in the other the same with the word \"heritages\" inserted before word \"tenure.\" Questions as to easement have been dealt with under the provisions in these statutes for the \"injuriously affecting,\" and thus obvious difficulty avoided. Hence the cases under those acts are for our present purpose almost wholly useless.\nThe case of The Great Western Railway Co. v. Swindon & Cheltenham Railway Go., 1884,[80] is suggestive, if not instructive, in regard to this phase of the easement being a thing capable of expropriation within such legislation.\nThe case of Clark v. The School Board for London[81], which turned upon 33 & 34 Vict. ch. 75, sec. 19, where the words used were \"and any right over land,\" resembles somewhat in the question raised what we have here.\nThe \"Lands Clauses Consolidation Act\" having been incorporated with this special act \"The Elementary Education Act\" so complicates the legal questions raised as to prevent us from having the benefit of a decision upon the exact point. The opinion of the eminent judges who dealt with the meaning to be attached to the words \"any right over land\" are, however, instructive. They suggest that such words might comprehend any easement. If so the words \"and all, rights thereto and interest therein\" may also be well understood as covering such rights and easements as the appellant's case rests upon.\nThey are inapt words, if we are to view the real estate interests in question here from a legal scientific point of view. They are, however, in ordinary language, very comprehensive. And when we have regard to the many peculiarities of the wording of the Act we are considering, we must make due allowances and try to extract from it a meaning that will give effect to the purpose so clearly in hand without being too fastidious in the way of attaching to each word or phrase used its exact legal value, as if the document had been penned by a lawyer having regard to such things.\nWe find in every sentence of these clauses stumbling blocks unless we take the course that seems thus required of us to interpret this act. We may thus, without violating any canon of construction, best subserve the interests of justice and the true interests of all parties, by holding section four as applicable.\nIt would seem, therefore, that we can thus find the easement and riparian rights of the appellant as covered by the words \"lands and premises\" and as a consequence the subject of expropriation.\nWhat then must we find the rights of these parties to be herein? The respondent had the right to expropriate this easement and these riparian rights, but did not proceed to do so. It gave no notice such as the Act contemplates it should do.\nIt had the right to retreat, if it had done so and found the burthen after arbitration greater than anticipated and practicable for it to bear.\nThese considerations seem to put the case entirely out of the class of cases where possession may be taken, the right be fully asserted, once and for ever, and the question of damages be remitted to a tribunal to fix compensation later on, upon the basis that all that had been done was lawfully and rightfully done.\nThe case seems rather to fall within the case of Saunby v. The Water Commissioners of London[82], where it was held the proceedings to arbitrate must precede the taking possession.\nThe result is that the appellant is entitled, as in that case, to an injunction restraining the respondent from further infringing upon the rights of the appellant in the premises until, as was provided there, such steps have been taken as will ensure a proper settlement between the parties pursuant to the provisions of the Act for fixing first the rights to be exercised and then the compensation to be paid therefor, and the assurance be given that respondent will abide by these findings.\nAll we need to determine is that injunction go and be continued until the court below has found these matters fully and finally determined or so adjusted to the satisfaction of the court below as may be done with least possible inconvenience to any one concerned.\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed with costs in all the courts below and here.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The plaintiff is the owner of a parcel of land through which a watercourse, the natural outlet of a lake of considerable area, flows, The defendant obtained, by provincial statute, 59 Vict. ch. 44, sec. 2, authority to take from the lake and stream such quantity or quantities of water as might be required by them for domestic, fire or other purposes. This the defendant has done, and has thereby diverted from the watercourse a very large proportion of the water which would otherwise flow over the plaintiff's land.\nBy another statute, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 87, the defendant has obtained authority to take a further large quantity of water from the same lake and stream to supply the Town of Sydney Mines, and the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company.\nIn this action the trial judge found that the plaintiff had suffered injury by the diversion of water from the stream and gave judgment for a mandamus to the defendant to appoint appraisers of the plaintiff's damages under the provisions of section five of the original Act.\nThat judgment was reversed on appeal, and the action was dismissed, and from that reversal the plaintiff appeals to this court.\nIt is impossible not to be very strongly impressed by the judgment of Meagher J. and the reasoning by which he has supported it. But, after very careful consideration, I am of opinion that it ought not to be allowed to stand and that the plaintiff's appeal should be allowed.\nI think the plaintiff has a remedy under either section four or five, but preferably under section four.\nThe nature of the plaintiff's right as a riparian proprietor in the flow of the water of this watercourse over her land is stated in Coulson & Forbes on Waters (2 ed.), p. 112, as follows:\u2014\nThe right * * * is not what is called an easement, because it is inseparably connected with and inherent in the property in the land; it is parcel of the inheritance and passes with it.\nThat statement is abundantly borne out by numerous authorities.\nI will take an extreme case. Suppose that a private person wished to take the whole outflow of the water of the lake, to divert it altogether, so that the old course over the plaintiff's, and other lands, should become dry. How could he obtain the right to do so? Plainly he must obtain a grant from all the proprietors down the stream. He must get a parcel of his inheritance from each of these proprietors, obtaining from each a freehold, or less right, according to the nature and extent of his title.\nNow the defendant could not do anything of that kind, that is the diversion of streams, for want of corporate power, and so it obtained that from the legislature. But it also obtained power to do it compulsorily. It is authorized to take such quantity or quantities of water as may be required from any river, lake or stream. It can take all if required. Another power which has been given to it is that of laying down pipes upon any lands, doing no unnecessary damage, evidently without being obliged to buy or take the lands itself or more than the right to lay the pipes therein.\nNow, having regard to these two powers, let us consider section four of the Act. It is as follows:\u2014\nWhenever it shall be necessary for the securing the necessary supply of water, the laying down or placing of any * * * pipes, * * * or tubes, or for any purposes whatsoever under this Act, that the town shall be invested with the title or possession of or in any lots or parcels of land and premises, situated anywhere, either in the town or outside the corporation limits, it shall be lawful for the council in case they cannot agree with the proprietors of such lands respectively for the purchase or lease thereof, as may be required,\nthen follows provision for arbitration to ascertain the damages, upon payment or tender of which the defendant is to be deemed the rightful purchaser in fee simple or lessee, as the case may be, of such lot or parcel of land with the appurtenances.\nThis section is not very happily or clearly expressed, but, having regard to the subject of it, I think it means to say that whenever, for the purpose of securing a supply of water, or laying down pipes, it is necessary to obtain title to or possession of land, then there must be either agreement or arbitration with the owner.\nIt is evident that in order to obtain the water of this stream to the extent to which they have taken it it was necessary that the defendant should have obtained a title from the plaintiff, that is a title to the interest in her land which they required, namely, to stop either wholly or in part the flow of water over it. So, likewise, in order to lay down pipes in any land it is not necessary to take the land itself, or the whole title, but only a part of the freehold, that is just the actual space which the pipes necessarily occupy, with a right of entry for repairs. Section four provides for both these cases, the taking of water and the laying down of pipes, and I think it is plain that the title of lots or parcels of land mentioned in the section must include and mean the title of any limited interest in lots or parcels as well as the absolute interest.\nThe defendant having taken, as I think, an interest in the plaintiff's land without taking the steps prescribed by section four ought, I think, to be restrained by injunction from continuing the wrong and there should be a reference as to damages, if desired. The defendant should have a reasonable time to take the steps prescribed by the statute, until which the issue of the injunction should be suspended.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charles J.

Girouard and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig allowing one of the preliminary objections taken to the election petition filed by the appellant, and dismissing said petition.\nPolling on an election for the House of Commons in the Yukon Territory took place on 16 Dec., 1904, and the respondent Thompson received the greater number of votes. On the 25 Jan., 1905, a petition against his return was filed by the appellant who delivered preliminary objections thereto which came on to be heard before Mr. Justice Craig in August, 1905.\nThe learned judge allowed preliminary objection No. 11, and dismissed the petition. That objection was that \"the petitioner is not a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the said petition relates.\" The hearing on Aug. 15th was adjourned and leave given appellant to file a certified copy of the voters' list used at the election. When it was resumed a list of voters was produced headed \"Polling Division No. 3(c),\" but certified to be a true copy of the list in \"Polling Division No. 36,\" No. 3(c) being the proper designation. This copy was filed without objection on respondent's part and the appellant testified, also without objection, that he had called on the enumerator and found his name on the list; that he had voted at the election; that on tendering his vote and being told that his name had already been voted on he took the oath required in case of personation; and that he was the John Grant named in the list. The trial judge held the certified copy to be, for several reasons, insufficient and the status of petitioner not proved. From that decision the petitioner appealed to this court.\nTwo other preliminary objections, Nos. 1 and 3, which were overruled by the judge, were that the respondent was not when the petition was presented a member of the House of Commons and a person against whose election or return a petition could be presented under the Election Act. The ground for this objection was that the respondent was not a member for the purposes of an election petition until he had been declared elected by the returning officer. Under the Act relating to elections in the Yukon Territory the date for declaring the result of the elec- tion is fixed by the returning officer and in the present case said date was more than fifty days after polling day. As the petition had to be filed within forty days from polling day it was impossible to wait for the declaration.\nThe respondent gave notice of a cross-appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Craig dismissing said objections Nos. 1 and 3, and the appeal and cross-appeal were argued together.\nEwart K.G. and Glyn Osler for the appellant.\nTravers Lewis for the respondent.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of opinion, for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington, that the appeal should be allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014These two appeals arise out of a controverted election petition filed by Grant who claimed to be a voter to avoid the election of Thompson, the member elected in the Yukon District.\nBoth appeal and cross-appeal come before us from a judgment on preliminary objections taken alike to the petitioner's status to prosecute the petition, and to the petition itself as having been filed before the returning officer made his return to the writ of election.\nThe trial judge maintained the objection to the petitioner's status holding, in accordance with previous decisions of this court, that the onus was upon the petitioner to prove that he was a person who had a right to vote at the election in question. He held, that this must be proved either by the production of the original voters' lists used upon the day of election, or by the production of a copy properly certified. He further held that the certified copy produced in evidence from the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery was fatally defective not only because of the insufficiency of the certificate of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery attached to the list, but also because the certificate of the enumerator appearing at the foot of the certified copy produced shewed that it was a \"copy of the voters' list in polling division No. 36,\" and not No. 3(c), which was the poll where the petitioner claimed to have had the right to vote.\nThe latter objection when read in conjunction with the heading of the list which shewed it to be a \"List of voters, Electoral District of the Yukon Territory, Polling Division No. 3(c)\" might be difficult to uphold if the decision depended upon it.\nI do not think however that it does, or that the production in evidence of the original list or copy duly certified is in all cases imperatively required. In the very case before us I find all the facts necessary to prove the petitioner's status duly proved by the oral testimony, not objected to, of the petitioner himself. Of course' the primary evidence to shew whether petitioner's name was on the list actually used was the production of the list itself or of a duly certified copy under the statute, but if, as was the case here, oral testimony proving all the essential facts was allowed to be put in without objection, then it cannot be successfully contended afterwards that this proof is insufficient. If objection to the oral testimony had been taken that would of course have called for the production of the list or of a properly certified copy. But in the absence of any such objection the oral testimony given was quite sufficient.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the appeal Grant v. Thompson on the question of the petitioner having given sufficient proof of his status must be allowed.\nThe cross-appeal involves a most important point as to the construction of the Controverted Elections Act as amended in 1891, with respect to the date when petitions may be filed. Mr. Ewart for the petitioner contended that the polling day must be construed to be the \"election\" or the close of the election and that a petition may be filed under the Act any day after the polling day and that the summation by the returning officer of the votes polled on the declaration day appointed by him for such summation and the return to the writ made by him in consequence of such summation, are not necessarily part of the election as the word or phrase is used in the Controverted Elections Act.\nAs the Act was originally passed, and as it remained for many years upon the statute book, such a question as is here presented could hardly have arisen. By sub-sec. 6 of sec. 9 of the original Act the petition must have been presented not later than \"thirty days after the publication in the Canada Gazette of the receipt of the return to the writ of election by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery,\" unless it questioned the return or election upon grounds arising subsequently as specified in the section. It would be impossible, I would say, successfully to contend under this provision fixing a specified time after a specified event for the filing of a petition that it could nevertheless be presented before the specified event occurred. I would read that clause as undoubtedly providing thirty days after a specified official act (the publication in the Gazette of the return) for the filing of a petition and by irresistible inference prohibiting its filing before such event occurs. And I do so because, in my opinion, the petition itself provided for in the 5th section of the Act necessarily depends upon the facts of a return to the writ having been made in some way improperly or of the time for making it having elapsed and no return made, the special provision relating to a petition for disqualifying a defeated candidate necessarily being dependent upon the return, the words being \"any candidate not returned.\" The importance of determining the proper construction of the Act as originally passed will be readily seen. In 1891, sub-sec. (b). of sec. 9 was amended by providing that the petition must be \"presented not later than 30 days after the day fixed for the nomination in case the candidate or candidates have been declared elected on that day, and in other cases forty days after the holding of the poll,\" unless it questions the election or return upon grounds arising subsequently as therein specified. Now this amendment only had reference to the time within which the petition had to be presented. It did not in any way change or amend section 5 or the construction to be placed upon it.\nUnder the statute before it was amended the return to the writ of election or the failure of the returning officer to make it was, in my opinion, an essential prerequisite to the right to file a petition. The amendment merely altered the date from which the time allowed for the filing of a petition should be counted. It in no wise altered the jurisdiction of the Election Court to entertain a petition or the essential prerequisites to the right to file it. Before the amendment the 30 days allowed for filing were to be counted from and after the publication in the Canada Gazette of the return to the writ. After the amendment 40 days were allowed from the day of polling within which the petition must be presented. But that in no way changed the law that it should not in any case be presented until the return to the writ had been made. Generally speaking the practice had been to appoint a day from 7 to 10 days after the polling day as declaration day for the summation of the votes polled, the declaration of the result and the making of the return. And so when the day of polling instead of the day of publication of the return was selected by Parliament as that from which the time was to run, 40 days and not 30 days were given so as to permit of the making of the return to the writ and still allow the usual 30 days after that for the filing of a petition. But such change did not either expressly or impliedly change or amend the 5th section of the Act which authorises the filing of a petition, or permit of such filing before the return to the writ of election or the expiration of the time for making the return.\nIt is argued, however, that all candidates nominated are from the date of their nomination \"candidates not returned\" within the meaning of those words in the 5th and 9th sections of the Act and that there is nothing to prevent a petition being filed against any of them for unlawful acts \"by which they are alleged to have become disqualified\" before the return day or as I understand the argument, even before the polling day. But reading those two sections together, it seems to me clear that the \"candi- date not returned\" is the candidate not returned by the returning officer in his return to the writ of election. It would seem absurd to hold that a candidate afterwards duly returned by the returning officer as elected was a candidate \"not returned\" by him. These words evidently relate to the defeated candidate and not to the elected one, and no candidate can be truly said to be a \"candidate not returned\" until after the return is made, when for the first time it is officially ascertained and known who is the successful or elected candidate and who the defeated one. The error in the appellant's argument is in confounding the result of the polling with the return. It by no means follows that the candidate receiving the majority of votes is always returned. Experience has shewn that this is not so, and that sometimes returning officers either violating or neglecting their statutory duties have returned the minority candidate as elected or made a double return, or an undue return, or other return not the proper one. In all such cases the statute provides a remedy. But until the return is made or the time for making it expires no petition can be filed. So far as a petitioner complains \"of the undue election or return of a member or that no return has been made or that a double return has been made or of matter contained in any special return made\" it clearly has the return as the pivot or centre around which it revolves and without which it cannot be filed and where the same section speaks of \"an undue return or election of a member\" or any unlawful act \"by any candidate not returned\" it seems to me to have one meaning and that is to refer to the successful and the unsuccessful candidates as they appear by the return calling the one returned the \"member\" and the one defeated the \"candidate not returned,\" and to provide expressly for the presentation of a petition or cross petition against the defeated candidate personally to disqualify him.\nThe trial judge who expressed himself as doubtful upon the construction of the Act on the point in question, seemed to have his doubts removed because he thought such cross petition\nwas afterwards provided for by a separate and distinct section.\nOn this point I venture to think however he was misled. The subsequent section doubtless to which he had reference was sub-sec. (b) of sec. 9, but the cross petition provided for expressly in the latter part of that sub-section is one by the sitting member as he is called against his opponent who was not returned in the special case only where a petition had been presented against the sitting member for some\ncorrupt practice by such member or on his account or with his privity since the time of such return,\nthat is the return to the writ of election, in which cases the petition may be presented at any time within thirty days after the date of such payment or corrupt act.\nSuch a petition and cross petition might be filed weeks or months after the polling and the return and therefore cannot have any effect upon the construction of sec. 5 under which the petition in this case was filed and which the amended sub-section provides must be filed not later than 40 days after the holding of the poll.\nThe petition in this case was filed within such forty days but inasmuch as at that time the day for the summation by the returning officer of the votes polled and the making of his return had not been reached, there was not anybody or any return against whom or which a petition could be filed, or any want of return which could be complained of.\nClearly there was then at the time of such filing no official knowledge of the result of the polling; no summation of the votes had been or could have been made; no one of the candidates had been declared elected or returned, and no return had been made or could have been made by the returning officer. Neither of the candidates could then be properly said to be a \"candidate not returned,\" within the meaning of the section so as to authorize even the filing of a disqualifying petition against him. And as for Thompson, against whom the petition was filed, so far from being a \"candidate not returned,\" he was the candidate actually returned by the returning officer when the time came for him to make his returns.\nThe result is unfortunate no doubt, but it is caused entirely by the amendment to the Act of 1891 coupled. with the fixing of the declaration day by the returning officer some 50 days after the polling. Under the circumstances no petition would lie under the Controverted Elections Act. Not before the expiration of the 40 days for there was then no return made to the writ and no one, and no act or return to petition against, and not after the return had been made because then the time within which a petition could be filed had elapsed. We cannot, however hard the case may be, construe the statute otherwise than according to its plain language and meaning. Parliament alone can by amendment prevent a repetition of such an unlooked for result. The court is powerless and as the election court had no jurisdiction to proceed upon such a petition as that filed in this case before there had been any summing up, declaration or re\u00adturn, the preliminary objection should have prevailed and must now be given effect to, and the appeal allowed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant who is a petitioner herein was held by the learned judge of the Territor\u00adial Court of the Yukon Territory to have failed to establish that he was entitled to petition.\nThe learned judge seems to have inferred from the Richelieu Election Case ([1]) and other cases in this court that the petitioner was bound to produce a pro\u00adperly certified copy of a proper list of voters which shewed thereon the name of the petitioner as a voter.\nThese cases were decided under statutes which provided that means of proof.\nIn the statutes that govern this case there is ap\u00adparently no such provision. The petitioner is there\u00adfore driven to other means of proving his standing as an elector and consequent right to petition against a candidate.\nHe was sworn as a witness on the motion and gave what to my mind is prim\u00e2 facie evidence, and for the present purpose, as it is uncontradicted, con\u00adclusive evidence of his right to vote. It is this. He swears that he was put by the enumerator on the voters' list for the division in question.\nHe presented himself as a voter. He was told another had personated him. He claimed then the right to tender his vote and was sworn accordingly to prove his identity.\nIt forms an essential part of this particular oath that the list there being used must by the deputy re- turning officer be shewn the voter and he be thus enabled to see the name and description to identify himself. When satisfied of that he can take the oath but not before. This man says he was thus satisfied and took the oath. He, speaking of this incident, says there was only one name John Grant on that voters' list.\nIt is just as plain as if in express words he had said to the learned judge on this inquiry, I am one of the voters named in the list which was used at the polling place in question.\nIf he had been allowed to say so and no objection made to such secondary evidence on the grounds that it was such, how could it be gainsaid in law or in fact?\nThe objection taken a month or so before to an order to open the matter up is not of the nature of such an objection as called for here. It savoured not of an objection to giving of secondary evidence but something else and was entirely at the wrong time to be effective in securing the rejection of secondary evidence.\nWhen counsel fails to object at the proper time to secondary evidence it stands, and when he goes further and elicits as he did here the very facts that made the secondary evidence conclusive, he has no right to complain.\nIf the petitioner had not been personated he never could have been in the position to give this proof He would not have been tendered any oath of identity and never have been shewn the voters' list.\nI have some doubt if the apparently wide provisions of the Canada Evidence Act, 1893, would have helped, if proper objection had been taken when the exhibit of the certified list was produced. The ten days' notice is not the trouble I conceive possible. I also doubt if a subpoena could have brought the clerk on this motion with the documents to the court. I need not enlarge, for I think the exhibit being presented without protest and accepted without the objection as to mode or form of certificate thereto was good evidence and can if need be relied on here. I do not read it as raising doubts or difficulties. I think there are none.\nThe ordinary legal presumptions supply all else needed, beyond this evidence of the petitioner, to maintain his right.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nAs to the cross-appeal that presents two alternative questions for consideration.\nIf the petition can be presented before the declaration of the result of the election then the appeal fails. If it cannot be presented as an attack on the election as well as against a candidate it may possibly be upheld as a petition against a candidate within the alternative of section 5 relative to candidates not elected.\nIn such case also the appeal must fail.\nI think that we can without stultifying Parliament, or doing violence to its language, or denying justice or doing any injustice to any one, find ample grounds within recognized canons of construction to hold that in such a case as this the petition as against an election may be presented before the declaration.\nThe settled policy of Parliament has been for a long time past to relegate all questions relative to elections to the courts of justice. Whether Parlia- ment can entirely divest itself of its constitutional powers in that regard or may have power yet remaining to deal with any unprovided cases is beside the question.\nThe settled policy stands expressed in section 68 of the Controverted Elections Act, as follows:\nAll elections shall be subject to the provisions of this Act and shall not be questioned otherwise than in accordance therewith.\nSuch imperative language binds us to find if we can in the statute as it stands amended a meaning that will execute this purpose.\nThat which upon the whole is the true meaning shall prevail, in spite of the grammatical construction of a particular part of it\nsays one high authority; and another says\nif the grammatical sense would involve any absurdity, repugnance or inconsistence, the grammatical sense must then be modified, extended or abridged so far as to avoid such an inconvenience but no further.\nSee quotations in Hardcastle, (3 ed.) p. 97. Apply that here. The limitation in section 9 is that the petition must be presented\nnot later than * * forty days after the holding of the poll.\nThe word \"election\" may have a technical meaning in some parts of this Act.\nThe interpretation clause is vague but gives a meaning which the context in other parts of the Act may call sometimes for a technical sense reading. In itself the interpretation clause does not necessarily imply more than the usual acceptation of the word election in relation to members. Nothing appears in the Act to take away from the word \"election\" its plain ordinary meaning and reduce, as sought here, the use of it in section 5 to an absurdity. The phrase there is \"an undue election of a member\" as contradistinguished from \"an undue return\" and other alternatives. This clearly distinguishes the election from the return. Again, why should the time for the presentation run from the date of the poll if it never could be presented before the declaration? And especially why so when in so very many obvious cases (of which this is one) it might be an impossibility to comply with such a limitation? Take the word \"election\" here to mean nomination and the polling of the votes, which are commonly and popularly known as the election, and a petition could be framed to meet all that and be presented at any time after the poll\u2014within forty days\u2014and there is no difficulty in the matter. But the suggestion is urged that notice of the petition must be given the member. Once the petition is filed the court could extend the time for service of notice and no difficulty exist. And in this connection too much importance is attached to the use of the word \"member.\" A man is not technically speaking a member until the return is in the hands of the Clerk of the Crown, if then.\nAppellant's counsel did not shrink from supporting his client's position, though recognizing, properly, this logical result.\nI fail to see any right to draw the line at the declaration. It must be at the time when ready for gazetting or as judgment appealed from holds.\nOf course if the express language were that the petition could not be presented until after declaration we would be bound by it. But short of the most express language I would not feel constrained to so interpret the Act as to defeat its purpose. separate causes for petition such as \"undue return\" and \"undue election,\" etc., but also elsewhere throughout the Act many cases of distinguishing the return from the election and that the Act's interpretation of the word \"election\" permits of a double sense, we will not be astray in accepting the plain ordinary meaning of the word election to which I have already referred. I prefer that to the absurd result we are asked to bring about by allowing this cross-appeal.\nIt must moreover be observed that section 9, sub-section (b), prescribing the time of forty days from the poll for presenting a petition repeals and is substituted for one which postponed the time until, or at least prescribed it within a time running from, the gazetting of the return of the member. This radical change accounts for many inconsistencies in the Act as it now stands amended.\nThese inconsistencies must yield to the application of the rules of construction I have adverted to, rather than that the Act become an absurdity. And so far as necessary to give full effect to this amendment, that which still stands unrepealed by express enactment must be held to have been thereby modified, and if, and so far as, need be impliedly repealed.\nIf we must proceed by such a narrow method of interpretation as appellant seeks then it should be followed to the end and the petition allowed to stand as literally within the meaning of section 5, a good petition against one who was then a candidate but not elected.\nWe are not concerned as to its form for section nine is obviously intended to avoid all difficulties of form and it suffices to have any substance covering and comprehending what is appropriate to the facts and possible issue within the Act as subject matter of a petition.\nI think this cross-appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed without costs and cross-appeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Black & Black.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Frank T.

(1903) ch. 30, sec. 139, was not void as against a judgment creditor who had actual notice of the mortgage and whose judgment was not registered under that section at the time of the commencement of the suit, and that the judgment creditor was not entitled to a prior lien for rent paid to the Crown on the licenses declared to be held in trust for the mortgagee.\nAfter hearing counsel for the parties, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Barker upon the rendering of the judgment appealed from. His Lordship Mr. Justice Maclennan dissented, as follows:\u2014\nMACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the decree appealed from ought to be varied. It declares that the mining leases in question are subject to the plaintiff's mortgage. I think that is right so far as those leases cover the freehold lot, containing 150 acres; but that so far as they cover the leasehold lots, containing 100 acres and 300 acres respectively, they cannot be held to be subject to the mortgage.\nThe learned judge in his judgment at the trial has, I think, misconstrued the mortgage. He is of opinion that the words\nand also all and singular the coal, albertite, etc., and all other minerals whatsoever which can, and shall, or may be found in or upon the herein particularly described premises,\nrefer to the whole of the parcels, the leasehold as well as the freehold. With great respect I do not think that is so. In my opinion those words relate solely to the freehold lot previously described, and not to the leasehold lots described afterwards. The mortgage first grants the freehold lot, and all the estate therein, and all the minerals to be found therein, and the privileges and appurtenances belonging thereto. And, when it comes to deal with the two leaseholds, what is granted is the mortgagor's right, title and interest therein, and that only. That the first grant of the minerals is to be confined to the freehold lot is put beyond doubt because there is an express grant relating to the leasehold minerals, and it is not of the minerals but only of the mortgagor's right, title and interest therein.\nThere is, therefore, as I think, a clear distinction between the grant of the minerals in the freehold lot and in the leasehold parcels. As to the first the grant is absolute, but as to the other it is of the grantor's right, title and interest only.\nIn his judgment in the Supreme Court the learned trial judge seems to abandon and no longer to rely on the clause on which he rested his first judgment. He says:\nIt is true that in the case of the latter (the leaseholds), the mortgage, as well as the conveyance to the Products Co., professes to convey only the right, title and interest of the parties to the lots and minerals. But if the parties thought that conveyed a right to the minerals under the lease, and they intended to convey that interest, and were paid for it, why should they escape making good a defective title in the one case more than in the other?\nIt is true the mortgage contains a covenant by the mortgagors to deposit a sum with the mortgagees as a redemption fund, per ton of manganese shipped from the premises, and that this covenant is wide enough to be applicable to the leaseholds, as well as to the freehold lot. But, in my opinion, neither this covenant nor the covenant for further assurance, nor any other circumstance disclosed in evidence, can enlarge the grant of the leaseholds so as to give the mortgagees an equity to claim the benefit of the Crown leases so far as they apply to the leasehold lands. So far as the leaseholds are concerned the mortgagees got exactly everything the mortgagors could then give, and that is carefully expressed and limited in the mortgage, and there is no ground of equity on which they can claim what was subsequently required.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the relief granted by the judge should be confined to the freehold lot of 150 acres.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nPugsley K.C. and Ewing for the appellants.\nHazen K.C. for the respondents.\n[1] 37 N.B.

H. Thorne & Co. brought action to recover from Bustin the price of goods sold on his alleged guarantee to one Segee. Bustin had given a guarantee to pay for goods so sold to the extent of $1,000 and had paid over $900, thereunder. The first of the goods sued for were supplied some six months after those paid for by Bustin had been delivered and were charged in plaintiffs' books to Segee to whom all the accounts were rendered. On the trial the secretary of the W. H. Thorne & Co. swore that Bustin had authorized the further supply to Segee on his account and had requested that they be charged to Segee to keep them separate from his own account with the company. This the defendant denied and testified that he had notified the company that he would no longer be responsible but neither the notice nor a copy of it was produced nor any proof except a stenographer's notes on dictation by defendant.\nThe jury answered questions submitted by both counsel and the court on which a verdict was entered for the plaintiff company for the amount claimed. Motion was made for a new trial on numerous grounds of improper reception and rejection of evidence, misdirection and improper direction and remarks by the presiding judge. The court being equally divided the motion for a new trial failed and the defendant appealed to this court.\nThe formal rule or judgment appealed against drawn up by the clerk of the court on the motion for new trial, after the formal portion as to hearing counsel, stated that \"the court having taken time to consider, and being equally divided, the said rule drops and the verdict entered for the plaintiff on the trial stands.\"\nOn the appeal being called Hazen K.C. and W.H. Harrison for the respondents moved to quash on the ground that the said formal rule or order was not a judgment from which an appeal would lie.\nPugsley K.C., Attorney-General for New Brunswick, was not called upon to support the jurisdiction of the court and the motion to quash was overruled.\nCounsel were then heard on the merits after which the court gave judgment ordering a new trial, on the ground that the charge of the trial judge to the jury shewed passion and bias and was improper. Davies J. dissented as follows:\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I have carefully read the charge to the jury of Chief Justice Tuck and while some remarks relating to the several counsel engaged in the case might have been better unsaid I cannot find anything in the charge taken as a whole to justify a new trial being granted.\nIt is not now open to the Attorney-General to complain that a particular question was not put to the jury relating to the delivery of a letter from the defendant to the plaintiff company's manager terminating any further liability on his part for goods supplied to one Segee. It was open to him to have had the question put at the trial. He did not elect to do so and cannot now complain of its not having been put.\nThe evidence while conflicting was fully sufficient to justify the findings and the findings ample enough to justify the entering of the verdict.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The defendant, by declinatory exception, objected to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to hear or adjudicate upon the plaintiffs' demand on the grounds that the defendant's election of domicile, in accordance with the provisions of the \"Patent Act\" was outside the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Quebec, that he never had a domicile in the said province, and that, by the 34th section of the \"Patent Act,\" the jurisdiction of the Superior Court in regard to matters of patents of invention is limited to such cases only as impeach their validity by a direct action where domicile has been elected in the Province of Quebec under the provisions of that Act.\nIn the Superior Court, Mr. Justice Taschereau maintained the declinatory exception and dismissed the action with costs. On appeal, the Court of King's Bench dismissed the exception and ordered that the case should be proceeded with in the Superior Court and disposed of upon the merits. The respondents moved to quash an appeal by the plaintiff from the latter judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada on the ground that the judgment complained of was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nErroll Languedoc for the motion. We rely upon the following authorities: Auger v. Magann([1]) and authorities there cited, also, on the appeal in the same case, Magann v. Auger([2]) at pages 187-8; Connolly v. Armstrong([3]); Hamel v. Hamel([4]); Griffith v. Harwood([5]). See also Shannon v. Turgeon([6]), where W\u00fcrt\u00e9le J. defines an interlocutory judgment as one which is rendered in a case between the institution of the suit and the final judgment therein and as given in an intermediate state of the case on some intermediate question before the final decision.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree that the appeal should be quashed upon the ground simply that if, as pleaded by the defendant, the jurisdiction of the Superior Court is ousted by section thirty-four of the Patent Act, it will not be too late for him to take the objection if the case should come to this court on appeal from the judgment to be rendered on the issues as now settled by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014We are called again to determine what is a final judgment and what is an interlocutory one. A final judgment (jugement d\u00e9finitif) is not necessarily the last one of the court, for we have held frequently, and more particularly in the recent case of Johnson's Go. v. Wilson, that the whole issue between the parties might be finally disposed of by a judgment which is not the last one. Here we have only a judgment dismissing a declinatory exception, and we do not know what the trial of the merits has in store. It. is not therefore a jugement d\u00e9finitif, which disposes of the whole case.\nFuzier-Herman, vol. 25, p. 296, No. 382, says:\nOn entend par jugement d\u00e9finitif celui qui statue sur toute la cause et qui la termine.\nHe quotes the following authorities: Bioche, vo. cit. n. 57; Boncenne, t. 2, p. 360 et seq.; Bonnier, n. 1071; Boitard et Colmet-Daage, t. 1, n. 240; Rousseau et Laisney, vo. \"Jugement,\" n. 2.\nThe same interpretation has been given by the English and American Courts; 13 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law (2 ed.), p. 23; 2 Cyc. 586-591; 19 Cyc. 533.\nEvidently the judgment appealed from does not dispose of the whole case, but merely of an incident raised by a declinatory exception which was maintained by the trial court and rejected by the court of, appeal. Of course in both the trial court and the court of appeal the question cannot be raised again; it is there chose jug\u00e9e; but it can be raised here if, after being disposed of on the merits, the case comes up again before this court. The reason for this ruling is that an appeal on the merits opens all the interlocutoires, especially if a reservation or an exception be filed immediately after the rendering of the interlocutories. Such has been the well settled practice and jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec. Renaud v. Tourangeau([22]); Jones v. Gough([23]); Goldring v. La Banque d'Hochelaga([24]); Benning v. Grange([25]); Archer v. Lortie ([26]); Metras v. Trudeau ([27]).\nThis court expressed the same views on several occasions, and especially in Molson v. Barnard([28]); Hamel v. Hamel([29]); Griffith v. Harwood([30]).\nIt must be noticed that our court has no discretion in the matter like the court of appeal of Quebec, which may grant leave to appeal from interlocutory judgments.

VII. c. 58, ss. 176, 214, 253.\nOn an application to the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the provisions of the \"Railway Act, 1903\" for a direction that a railway company should replace a siding, where traffic facilities had been formerly provided for the respondents with connections upon their lands, and for other appropriate relief for such purposes;\u2014\nHeld, that, under the circumstances, the Board had jurisdiction to make an order directing the railway company to restore the spur-track facilities formerly enjoyed by the applicants for the carriage, despatch and receipt of freight in carloads over, to and from the line of railway.\nAppeal, by leave of His Lordship Mr. Justice Maclennan, from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, which directed the appellants to restore certain spur-track facilities for the carriage, despatch and receipt of freight in carloads, over the railway and the connection for those purposes on the lands of the respondents.\nOn the application of the respondents, who are coal and wood merchants, in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba, under sections 214 and 253 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" for an order to direct the railway company to replace a siding wrongfully taken up by them from the respondents' property immediately adjoining the station, main-line and yards of the railway company in the said City of Winnipeg, or any such other part of the respondents' yard as to the Board might seem proper, or, in the alternative, that general delivery of all freight consigned to the respondents should be made at a siding constructed conveniently near the respondents' yard, and for such other relief as to the Board might seem just, the Board made the order appealed from, as follows:\n\"It is ordered\u2014That the said railway company be, and it is hereby, directed to restore the spur-track facilities formerly enjoyed by the applicants for the carriage, despatch and receipt of freight in carloads over, to and from the line of the said railway company, and the connection for that purpose between such spur-track and the railway siding on the land of the applicants; the said railway company to have the option of constructing the siding on the applicants' land, at the expense of the applicants, or of allowing this to be done by the applicants, who shall bear the expense of making the necessary connection; and the said company to have the further option of constructing the track from such point on its line and to such point on the applicants' property as it shall think proper, said siding or spur-track to be constructed within four weeks from the date of this order, the plans of the completed work to be filed with the Board.\n\"This order, and the construction and use of the siding or spur-track herein provided for, are not to affect the rights of the railway company upon or to any expropriation of the applicants' property authorized by law or by any order to be hereafter made by the Board.\"\nThe reasons given by the Board for making the said order were as follows:\n\"The Board is of opinion that, in taking from the applicants the sidings and rail connection formerly enjoyed by them the railway company deprived the applicants of reasonable facilities which the company should be directed to restore.\n\"The applicants do not apply under section 176 of the 'Railway Act,' as owners of an industry, for an order to compel the railway company to construct a branch or spur-line. Their land adjoins the railway yards of the company, and it does not appear to the Board that any order is necessary to enable the railway company to construct a line upon its own land up to the boundary line between its property and that of the applicants or to make connection at such boundary with a siding upon the applicants' land and transfer cars to and from such a siding.\n\"The Board is of opinion that it may properly regard the siding and connection, and the privilege of loading cars and delivering goods for carriage on such a siding, and of receiving and unloading goods by means thereof, as facilities within the Act.\n\"By its notice of the 16th November, 1904, the company stated its intention 'to discontinue the spur-track facilities.'\n\"The Board has carefully examined the yards of the railway company in Winnipeg, and the sidings and spur-tracks furnished for the use of those engaged in various kinds of business; and while the Board does not desire to be understood as holding that the railway company should be made to furnish similar facilities to every applicant, it considers that, in view of the previous supply of the same to the applicants and of the company's practice in so freely furnishing such accommodation to those engaged in the same and other branches of business, as well as the other facts and circumstances observed and those disclosed by other evidence, these facilities should be regarded as reasonable and proper ones, which the company should afford to the applicants.\n\"Under all these circumstances, the discontinuance of the former service seems to the Board to have been unreasonable. In the opinion of the Board railway companies should not be allowed to furnish and cut off such facilities capriciously.\n\"It does not appear to the Board that an order directing the railway company, in the general terms of section 253, to afford to the applicants all reasonable and proper facilities for the receiving, etc., would be sufficient, or that the authorities cited by counsel for the company are conclusive against the jurisdiction of the Board to direct specifically the continuance of previous facilities which seem to the Board to have been unreasonably discontinued.\"\nChrysler K.C. and G.F. Macdonell for the appellants. The Board has no power to order particular works to be done nor to interfere with the discretion of the railway company as to providing facilities: South-Eastern Railway Co. v. The Railway Commissioners[1]; Darlaston Local Board v. The London & North-Western Railway Co.[2]. The \"Railway Act, 1903,\" prescribes a method, by section 176, to compel the construction of branch lines and thereby excludes jurisdiction on the part of the Board to order such construction otherwise than as there prescribed. Coal merchants are not owners of such an \"industry\" as is referred to in that section; no case of discrimination has been shewn; the Board cannot order constructions to be made by the railway company upon lands which do not belong to it, and, as the occupation of the premises in question is deemed dangerous, the railway company is unwilling to place a siding there which may have to be removed should it be deemed necessary to expropriate the land for their own protection.\nEwart K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. The court is of opinion that the Board of Railway Commissioners had, in the circumstances, jurisdiction to make the order complained of.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: G.

The questions raised upon the appeal are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.G. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.G. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The plaintiff in this case sued to recover the amount of a judgment debt due under a judgment dated 19th December, 1894, of a superior court of the State of Washington, U.S.A., together with interest from the date of the said judgment. That the said judgment debt was the cause of action in the present suit cannot be questioned, and in this country it is an action of simple contract.\nIt is disputed within what period after the cause of action has arisen the action will be barred by the Statute of Limitations.\nThe ordinance of the Yukon Territority, ch. 31 of 1890, provides that\nall actions for recovery of merchants' accounts, bills, notes and all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or other contract without specialty shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such action arose.\nIt is not disputed on this appeal that the action was not brought until after the expiration of six years from the 19th December, 1894, when the cause of action arose.\nThe terms of the ordinance are express and the meaning of the language unmistakeable. I do not think therefore anything is to be gained by considering either what the law is elsewhere or what it was formerly in the Yukon Territory.\nIt is necessary to give the ordinance its effect, and it is an absolute bar to the present action. It follows that the appeal should be allowed and the action be dismissed with costs to the appellants, both here and in the courts below.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014I think it is a well settled rule of English law, whatever may be the law on the continent or in Quebec, that in matters of limitations of personal actions the lex fori must prevail, except when the debt has been absolutely extinguished by the Statute of Limitations of the locus contract\u00fbs. Here it is admitted that the debt was not there extinguished, and that prescription was not even acquired. It is also conceded that the action in the Yukon was taken within six years after the arrival of the debtor in that country.\nIn the Yukon country an ordinance has been passed which provides that,\nall actions for recovery of merchants' accounts, bills, notes and all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or other contract without specialty, shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such action arose.\nI quite agree with the learned Chief Justice that this ordinance governs the case, but, with due deference, I am not prepared to say that the foreign judgment was the whole cause of action. The cause of the action is not only the undischarged indebtedness of the defendant, but his default to pay the same and his presence in the territory of the court where the action is taken, or property within its reach, in fact everything that is necessary to complete the remedy of the creditor and make it efficient. Until his presence in the forum of the court no action is possible there. The default of the debtor to satisfy the judgment, wherever he may be found\u2014for it was his personal duty to satisfy the same\u2014constitutes the right of action, but is not the whole cause of the action as I read the statute. The removal of the debtor to the forum of the Yukon court completes the remedy. That statute covers the whole case without taking into consideration the statutes of James and of Anne.\nFor these reasons I submit that the judgment appealed from should be confirmed, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014At the time of the passing of the Yukon ordinance, ch. 31, sec. 1, of the Consolidated Ordinances of the Yukon Territory, 1898, the English statutes as to limitations of actions and also all other English law as of the 15th July, 1870, were introduced into the Yukon by a statute of the Dominion and were in force in that territory.\nThe ordinance referred to, upon the construction of which this appeal turns, reads as follows:\nAll actions for recovery of merchants' accounts, bills, notes, and all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or other contract without specialty shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such action arose.\nThe trial judge held that this ordinance did not repeal the Statute of Anne regarding disabilities, and only repealed such part of the Statute of James as was re-enacted by the ordinance, and that consequently as against the defendant, a foreigner, the time did not begin to run until he had first entered the Yukon Territory. On appeal this judgment was sustained by a divided court.\nThe appellant here contends that so far as the actions specially named in the ordinance are con- cerned, the ordinance is absolute and complete repealing all then existing English law on limitations, whether relating to disabilities or to acknowledgments of the debt and making an arbitrary period of six years after the cause of action arose within or without the Yukon Territory as the limit within which an action should be commenced in the Yukon courts under any and every condition and circumstance. And that the cause of action arose within the meaning of the words in the ordinance when the debt first became due.\nThe respondent in addition to supporting the reasons of the court below, contended that under the Statute of James, as also under this ordinance, the cause of action only arose in the Yukon Territory against this defendant when he came within the jurisdiction of the courts of that territory, and not before, in which case the six years' limitation had not expired.\nI am of opinion that this contention is sound and that the authorities cited in support of it are conclusive. In Douglas v. Forrest ([1]), Chief Justice Best, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, is reported, at p. 703, as follows:\nUpon the second question we are of opinion that the replication is an answer to the plea of the Statute of Limitations. The words of the 21 Jac. I., ch. 16, sec. 3 are that the action shall be brought \"within six years next after the cause of such actions or suits and not after.\" Although the injury of which the plaintiffs complain has existed more than six years, yet they had no cause of action until there was some person within the realm against whom the action could be brought. Cause of action is the right to prosecute an action with effect; no one has a complete cause of action until there is somebody that he can sue.\nIf the law as here laid down is correct it is conclusive of this appeal. It was suggested that the lan- guage was obiter only, and must in any case be confined to the facts of the case in which it was used. I think, however, it is a correct statement of the law generally, and was used not as mere obiter dicta, but as the basis and ground of the judgment rendered.\nIn the case of Musurus Bey v. Gadban ([2]), Wright J. in delivering the judgment of the court (Lawrence and Wright JJ.) expressly cites the language of Chief Justice Best above quoted as the law, and applicable to the case before him, and A. L. Smith L. J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal before which that case afterwards came, says ([3]), at pp. 357, 358:\nThere is another ground which is also fatal to the contention of the plaintiff. It has been held that as on the one hand there cannot be a cause of action within the meaning of the Statute of James from which the six years will commence to run unless there be a person in existence capable of suing ([4]), so on the other hand there can be no such cause of action unless there is somebody who can be sued.\nHe then cites from Douglas v. Forrest ([5]), at p. 704:\nCause of action, says Best C.J., is the right to prosecute an action with effect; no one has a complete cause of action until there is somebody that he can sue.\nThese authorities for me are conclusive that the six years' limitation specified in the ordinance did not begin to run until after the defendant had gone into the Yukon, within the jurisdiction of the courts of that territory.\nThe American authorities collected in 19 Am. & Eng. Ency., at pages 193 and 219, are generally to the same effect. The law is at the latter page stated as follows:\nThe rule is, therefore, well settled that the statute does not begin to run until there are in existence some one capable of suing and some one who may be sued.\nSee also 1 Cyc., title, Actions, at p. 644.\nWhile stating the grounds as above on which I think this appeal must be dismissed, I do not wish to be understood as expressing any opinion upon those on which judgment in the courts below proceeded.\nThe broad construction of the ordinance contended for by the appellant ignores alike the disabilities excepted by the Statute of Anne from the Statute of James, and the provisions of Lord Tenterden's Act with respect to acknowledgments of the debt. It would bar the recovery of a debt in the Yukon, though neither the debtor nor creditor were ever within that territory and even though it might not be barred by the lex loci contract\u00fbs. Such a construction would make the ordinance applicable to persons and things over which the legislature had at the time no jurisdiction.\nI am glad to have been able to reach the conclusion that the limitation upon the time for bringing actions for the recovery of debts in the Yukon Territory prescribed by the ordinance has application only to parties who have brought themselves within the jurisdiction of the courts of that territory, and only runs from the time they have so brought themselves.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondents sued appellant in the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory upon a judgment recovered in one of the United States. The appellant set up as his defence the Yukon ordinance, ch. 31. It is as follows:\nAll actions for recovery of merchants' accounts, bills, notes, and all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or other contract without specialty shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such action arose.\nThe trial judge found as fact that the appellant had not been in the Yukon until within six years preceding the bringing of this action, and that fact is not disputed. It is admitted also, that unless the date of the respondent's coming into the Yukon is to be taken as the time from which the six years is said to run, the claim was barred when action began.\nThe learned judge held that in some way or other, in which I cannot agree, the provisions of 4 & 5 Anne, ch. 16 (1705), sec. 19, saved to the respondents their right of action for at least six years from the date of the appellant's coming into the territory.\nOn appeal to the court in banco of that territory the court, though divided, dismissed the appeal, and hence the appeal here.\nThere seems to be radical error alike in the result and the reasoning by which it is arrived at.\nSuppose the statutes of James and Anne blotted out before the enactment quoted from the Yukon ordinance was passed, then the common law would have given a right of action at any distance of time from the breach of contract.\nNow, if the Yukon ordinance has been passed in that state of the law, surely no one could pretend that the wide and comprehensive provision of the ordinance could be read in any other sense than as a bar to any action rested upon any of the contracts named therein, and brought six years after a breach. The Statute of James barred the right of action after the lapse of time therein specified.\nAll that the Statute of Anne did was to restore partially the common law right of action.\nIf the Yukon ordinance would have been an effective bar to the unlimited common law right, how much more must it have been a bar to the partial restoration of that right which the Statute of Anne furnished.\nThe right, restored and thus reserved by the Statute of Anne, was not urged as a special right within the meaning of those cases covered by the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant.\nEven if it had been, it is hard to see how full effect could be given to the words of this ordinance if both were to stand, and if they could not stand together the special provision must yield to the latter, so as to give it any effect.\nIt seems as if, accepting the contention of respondents, some of the provisions of the Statute of James had been re-enacted to no purpose whatsoever. All this seems a complete answer also to the plausible argument that the words (in the ordinance) \"cause of such action arose\" must be read as if there were added thereto the words \"within the territory of the Yukon.\"\nThe words in the Statute of James are\nwithin six years next after the cause of such action or suit.\nThey are substantially the same in meaning. They were clearly not interpreted in construing the Statute of James as we are asked to interpret them here, or the Statute of Anne need never have been enacted.\nI can find only two reported cases directly bearing upon the question raised here, as to the meaning of such words in the Statute of James before it was amended by the Statute of Anne.\nThese are, however, important and significant.\nThey are important, as the only judicial interpretation anywhere to be found of these words, unfettered by any amendments or other legislation bearing directly on the points in question here.\nThe last of these authorities has this significance, that it was almost immediately after the Statute of James being so interpreted therein that the amendment in the Statute of Anne was passed.\nThe first case is Hall v. Wybourn ([6]), (Trin. 1 W. & M. Rot. 130 B.R.), and is as follows:\nIn bar of the Statute of Limitations, the plaintiff replied that the defendant was beyond sea, and it was held no plea, for the plaintiff might either file his original, or outlaw him; and in one Bynton's Case, it was held by Bridgman C.J., that though the courts of justice were shut up so as no original could be filed, yet this statute would bar the action, because the statute is general, and must work upon all cases which are not exempted by the exception.\nThe next is Dupleix v. De Boven ([7]) (of Hilary Term, 1705). The plaintiff and defendant (intestate) were merchants at Lyons, in France, where judgment was recovered by plaintiff. The bill filed in England was, to follow this up, some years later, and it was answered by a plea of the Statute of Limitations.\nThe judgment of the Lord Keeper was as follows:\nAlthough the plaintiff obtained a judgment or sentence in France, yet here the debt must be considered as a debt by simple contract. The plaintiff can maintain no action here, but an indebitatus assumpsit, or an insimul computasset, etc., so that the Statute of Limitations is pleadable in this case; and although both parties were foreigners, and resided beyond sea, that will not help the plaintiff. The statute provides where the party plaintiff, he who carries the action about him, goes beyond sea, his right shall be saved; but when the debtor or party defendant goes beyond sea, there is no saving in that case. It is plausible and reasonable that the Statute of Limitations should not take place, nor the six years be running until the parties come within the cognizance of the laws of England, but that must be left to the legislature.\nThe editor's note is that the plea was allowed and again on a rehearing.\nI am unable to trace who reheard the case, but we know that Lord Cowper was sworn in as Lord Chancellor 23rd of October of that year; and that this Statute of Anne which contained a great many valuable amendments besides this one we are concerned with, was the work of Lord Somers, to whom no doubt both these cases were well known. We are told truly that for him nothing was too vast or too minute.\nPossibly the rehearing convinced him or Lord Cowper or both that the plain words could not be so strained as we are asked to, but that to accept the Lord Keeper's invitation to legislate was the proper course to adopt.\nWhether any of these surmises be correct or not it would be eminently fitting the probable facts that some of them should be.\nThe Statute of Anne being abrogated, and thus obliterated, as indicated above, these precedents seem conclusive unless we conjure up some distinction between the words here \"arose\" and there \"accrue.\" I will not try.\nI found American cases of which the statement in text books seemed to maintain the respondents' proposition as to the meaning of those words which I have quoted from the Statute of James.\nI find, however, in looking into a very great number of the cases so cited, that they all rest upon the Statute of Anne or explicit legislation of a like character. And the statement is broadly made by some judges that in almost every state such provisions have been enacted.\nIt is thus obvious why we have to go so far back for precedent exactly in point.\nAll that has ever since transpired, I venture to say, when properly read, supports these early interpretations.\nA cause of action arises from, and upon, the breach of a contract, no matter when, or where, that may have occurred.\nThe cause of action \"accrued\" and then or there time began, or was to begin, to run, or is not to run, such is the language used. The accruing of the action happens once only, is one thing, and not many happenings from time to time.\nIt accrued when the duty to be done had failed to be rendered where it ought to have been rendered.\nSuch is the plain ordinary meaning of the words, and to read into such words the far fetched meaning we are asked to place upon them would not only do violence to a fundamental rule of construction, but would also conflict with the reasoning upon which the courts have for so long a time proceeded in dealing with similar legislation.\nIn the numerous cases and statutes I have seen in the investigations I have adverted to there is, in not one single instance that I have found, any attempt to deal with the words \"cause of action\" in other sense than this.\nThe cases of Douglas v. Forrest ([8]), and Musurus Bey v. Gadban ([9]), relied on are clearly distinguishable. In the former the debtor was beyond the seas and so continued till his death and the action was brought against executors in England within six years from the grant of probate. It expressly rests on the Statute of Anne, though unnecessary language in the judgment suggests something beyond what was necessary. In the latter the defendant was held within the Statute of Anne as always beyond seas, first by the fiction of law, or courtesy of nations, by which an ambassador is treated as within his own country, though resident in England, and even after his return home was actually beyond seas. The statute of 7 Anne, ch. 12, expressly forbade any such action against an ambassador. See Magdalena Steam Navigation Co. v. Martin ([10]).\nTest the matter by the plea which uniformly has been used, that the alleged cause of action did not accrue within so many years, etc.\nAnd as early as Snode v. Ward ([11]), Trinity Term, 1 W. & M., it was held that the plea was good, though exceptions might exist; or as there an addition had been temporarily made to the statute. And it was held such exceptions might, and must, come by way of reply.\nFancy a reply such as would be appropriate here to plaintiff's contention.\nWe have then what was tried ineffectually in Hall v. Wybourn ([12]), but has not been tried since.\nThe fact is that in England, and in the United States with its numerous jurisdictions, the relief to be got by means of such a reply has never been tried. Instead thereof the numerous legislators who have come to face the problem have chosen to legislate. The reasoning upon which the cases of Cornill v. Hudson ([13]), and Pardo v. Bingham ([14]), at page 740, turn, in applying the mercantile amendment law, 19 Vict. ch. 97, sec. 10, is entirely destructive, not only of the contention set up by counsel for the appellant, but also of the other features of the case relied upon in the court below. In the first of these cases the contract was made and both parties were in Venezuela till the death of debtor.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs both here and in the courts below, and the action be dismissed.\nMACLENNAN J. \u2014 Appeal from the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory in banco.\nAction upon a judgment for $2,471.45 recovered by the respondent against the appellant and others on the 19th December, 1894, in a superior court in the State of Washington, one of the United States of America; the only defence now relied upon being the territorial Statute of Limitations.\nThe first question is upon the construction of the ordinance of the territory respecting the limitation of actions, passed in 1890. At the date of the passing of that ordinance both the statute 21 Jac. I. ch. 16, fixing the limitation in such a case at six years next after the cause of such action, and not after, and the statute 4 & 5 Anne ch. 16, giving six years after return from beyond the seas, when the defendant was beyond the seas at the time of the cause of action, were in force in the territory, and had become the law of the territory at the same instant of time.\nThe ordinance is as follows:\nAll actions for recovery of merchants' accounts, bills, notes, and all actions of debt grounded upon any lending or other contract without specialty, shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such action arose.\nTo my mind there is no room for the contention that the exception enacted by the Statute of Anne is still in force in this class of actions. The ordinance had no effect at all unless it did away with that exception. I think it was intended to do that very thing. As the law stood before the ordinance there was an enactment, with an exception. That is now superseded by an enactment without an exception. I therefore think that in this case the time began to run when the cause of action arose. The action was commenced on the 15th July, 1902, more than six years after the judgment was recovered, and it was argued very strenuously that inasmuch as the plaintiffs are a company domiciled abroad, and that neither they nor the defendant had come into the Yukon Territory until within six years before action, the time limited by the statute had not run. The contention in other words was that the judgment being a foreign one, it was not a cause of action within the territory, or within the meaning of the statute, until there was some one within the territory who could sue or be sued. I do not think that contention can be maintained. When the judgment was recovered in the State of Washington, both the appellant and the respondents were in that State and the judgment not having been paid on being entered, immediately became a cause of action in favour of the respondents. It is the cause of action now sued upon, and the plaintiffs claim interest on it from the 19th of December, 1894, the day on which it was entered up.\nThe respondents relied very strongly on two cases in the English courts, the first being Douglas v. Forrest ([15]), in which, at page 704, Best C.J. says:\nAlthough the injury of which the plaintiffs complain has existed more than six years, yet they had no cause of action until there was some person within the realm against whom action could be brought. Cause of action is the right to prosecute an action with effect. No one has a complete cause of action until there is somebody that he can sue.\nIn that case the plaintiffs had recovered two judgments in Scotland against a defendant resident there, in 1802. Before these judgments were recovered, but after the debts had accrued, the debtor left Scotland and went to India, where he died in 1817. Probate of the debtor's will was taken in England in March, 1824, and the action was brought within three or four years afterwards, and was held to be in time. These facts explain the language of the learned Chief Justice. While the judgment debtor was in Scotland and in India, time did not run against the plaintiffs in the English courts by reason of the Statute of Anne. And between the death of the debtor and the probate of his will it did not run, for there was no one in whose favour it could run.\nThe other case relied on by the respondent is Musurus Bey v. Gadban([16]), a counterclaim for a debt incurred in England by the Turkish ambassador, Musurus Pasha, in which the language of Best C.J. in Douglas v. Forrest ([17]) was quoted with approval. It was held that while the ambassador was in England no writ could be issued against him, and that after he had gone to his own country the time would not run against his creditor in England by reason of the Statute of Anne. The counterclaim was brought within six years after probate to the pasha's estate taken in England, and the language of Best C. J. was, and was held to be, as applicable to this case as to the case of Douglas v. Forrest ([18]).\nIn the case before us the Statute of Anne being out of the case, there was nothing to prevent the plaintiffs from suing the defendant, wherever he happened to be, at any time after default in paying the judgment. In other words, although this action is brought in the Yukon court, the cause of it arose in the State of Washington on the day the judgment was recovered.\nI am therefore of opinion that when the action was brought it had been barred by the Yukon ordinance, and that the appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

He then, after midnight, visited all his committee rooms and gave to the chairman of each committee, personally and secretly, one of such parcels. His financial agent had no knowledge of this distribution and no evidence was produced of the application of the money to legitimate objects:\u2014\nHeld, that the inference was irresistible, that the money was intended for corruption of the electors and respondent was properly held guilty of personal corruption.\nAllegations in the petition that respondent had himself given and procured, undertaken to give and procure money and value to electors and others named, his agents, to induce them to favour his election and vote for him, for the purpose of having such monies and value employed in corrupt practices were sufficient to cover the offence of which the respondent was found guilty.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Davidson and Robidoux JJ. sitting for the trial of a petition against the return of a member to the House of Commons for the electoral district of St. Ann's in the City of Montreal which judgment found the respondent personally-guilty of corrupt practices at said election.\nThe facts upon which the judgment appealed from was founded are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies on this appeal.\nE. F. B. Johnson K.C. and Perron K.C. for the appellant.\nBisaillon K.C. and Garmichael for the respondent.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appeal is dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014At the hearing of the argument on this appeal I was inclined to think that as there was no express finding or determination by the election judges of the personal disqualification of the successful candidate against whom the petition was fyled, but a formal determination only that he was not duly returned and that the election was void, and as the appeal was limited to the supposed finding of personal disqualification there was no jurisdiction on our part to hear the appeal at all. After a careful reading of the formal judgment of the election judges and also of their report to the Registrar of this court which, by the 14th section of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, amending the Controverted Elections Act, is in cases of appeal substituted for the report which under the Act as originally passed was to be made to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and which substituted report is expressly declared together with the decision and findings (if any) to form part of the record, I have reached the conclusion that there is enough on the face of the record to enable us to amend it by inserting the necessary formal finding and thus make the record conform not only to the recital in the formal adjudication that such a finding was arrived at, and to the statutory report to the Registrar to the same effect, but also to the reasons for judgment given by both the trial judges.\nThe 13th section of the amended Act above referred to gives this court express power to\nconfirm, change or annul any decision, report or finding of the court that tried the petition appealed from upon the several questions o\u00ed law as well as of fact upon which the appeal was made.\nwhile the Controverted Elections Act enacts that this court\nshall pronounce such judgment upon questions of law and fact, or both, as in the opinion of such court ought to have been given by the court or judge whose decision is appealed from.\nThe omission of the personal condemnation of the appellant from the dispositif of the formal judgment therefore can, it seems to me, be rectified by this court, sufficient matter appearing upon the face of the record to justify such rectification.\nThe appeal then being properly before us it does seem to me that the questions for our determination are reduced to these: Do the particulars delivered cover the charges and offences for which the appellant has been personally disqualified, and, secondly, does the evidence given by the appellant (Gallery) and his chairmen of committees as to the personal payments by Gallery to them of sums of money amounting to about $6,000 between nomination day and election day, raise an irresistible inference that such money was paid for the corrupt purpose of inducing the voters in the several wards of which these committees had charge, to vote for Gallery or refrain from voting against him or for having so voted or refrained from voting? And was that money so used in whole or in part? I am of opinion that paragraph 10 of the particulars delivered, and especially sub-sections 5\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 of that paragraph, are sufficient to cover the charge and offence with which the appellant was personally charged and for which he was found guilty and disqualified.\nMr. Gallery is a politician of some experience, having run-other elections before the one in question. He cannot and does not plead ignorance of the law. He had a regular agent, through whom he knew that all legitimate expenditure should be made in order to ensure that publicity which is a cardinal principle of the Election Act. He organized his committees after nomination day and there was consequently only a week within which to do such work as committees had ordinarily to do. He went around to these committees a few nights after their organization and paid to their several chairmen a small part of the $6,000. On the eve of the election day and before leaving his home he carefully made up into packages at his own house, and as he himself says in his own room and by himself, the remaining portion of the money amounting to over $4,000, in sums ranging from $250 to as high as $1,500; placed them on and about his person and distributed them to his various chairmen taking care to deliver the money personally and secretly, and so that even his own financial agent who accompanied him on his rounds is alleged to have known nothing about his acts.\nThe financial agent who by law was to have sole control over his disbursements, and through whom alone they could be legally made, had the transaction carefully screened from his knowledge, although he accompanied his principal up to midnight before election day in the latter's visits to the committee rooms. We are asked to believe that this money was intended to be honestly paid to \"locators\" so called, for bon\u00e2 fide and necessary work to be done by them, while in the same breath we are told that at least one-half of those to whom the money was to be paid, and actually was paid, were electors whom the receipt of these moneys for alleged services in connection with the election would actually disfranchise.\nThe moneys paid to these chairmen of committees were not counted, no receipt was taken, no memorandum of payments made, no account kept by those to whom it was paid of those electors and others to whom they paid the money, and no evidence or the slightest possible that any actual bon\u00e2 fide work was done by those to whom it was paid, or if and where any work was done by any or by which of them. The moneys paid to Francis McCabe, a relatively small amount, do not appear to be open to these observations, and were not apparently used for corrupt purposes. His case appears to be an exception to the general rule. About one-half of the moneys paid to these chairmen . was admitted in the argument to have been paid to electors on the ostensible ground that they were employed as locators. Some of the chairmen admitted that every one attending the committee room expected to be paid and Guilfoyle (one of the chairmen) says, he thought the persons to whom he paid out the money on election day had been acting personally and that he should pay them, and he supposed they had worked, and he paid them $10 or more according to his own judgment not having anything to determine the amounts they should severally receive. During the argument I asked repeatedly whether there was any evidence shewing that these locators actually did bona fide necessary work and reported the results, and where such evidence could be found if it existed at all. But such references as were given were to evidence of the flimsiest and most unsatisfactory kind.\nI do not wish to be understood as saying that bon\u00e2 fide payments made through the proper agent to persons for the purpose of locating electors in the congested districts of large cities might not be defended as being within the Act, or that even if made improperly by the candidate they would necessarily under all circumstances, however necessary their work might be and however well it might prove to have been done, gave rise to an irresistible inference that the payment was a \"corrupt practice.\"\nBut in the face of such evidence as we have here, to ask us to assume that the payments were bona fide and made for a bona fide purpose, is to ask us to abdicate our common sense. I think the only and the irresistible inference which can be drawn from the evidence is that these moneys were paid to the several chairmen of his committees by the appellant colourably for the purpose of paying locators so called for work done or to be done, but actually for the corrupt purpose of improperly influencing electors to whom they were to be paid and in order to induce them to vote or refrain from voting, or for having voted or refrained from voting, and that the moneys having in large part at any rate been paid over by these chairmen to electors and others on election eve and election day in pursuance of such corrupt purpose such payments constituted \"corrupt practices\" on appellant's part within the meaning of the statute. Mr. Johnstone contended that the same particularity was required to make a legal finding of the personal guilt of a candidate for corrupt practices and so disqualify him as was necessary in ordinary penal actions.\nI do not, however, concur in this view. The reason for the application to findings under the Controverted Elections Act (the penalty for which is personal disqualification) of the rule applicable to penal actions, does not exist. That rule is necessary in penal actions to prevent a party sued from being put in peril twice for the same offence and to enable him to plead his prior conviction or acquittal or discharge as the case may be to any second action. Certainty in the particulars of the offence must therefore appear on the conviction or judgment. But in trials under the Controverted Elections Act while the party incriminated and sought to be punished is entitled on every principle of justice to have full and clear particulars given him of the offence he is charged with and is also entitled to have the evidence confined to the charge so made, the same reason does not exist for the particular certainty in the statement of facts in the findings of the election court as does exist in a conviction or judgment in a penal action.\nThere must, of course, be reasonable certainty in the finding of the statutory offence and the different elements necessary to constitute the offence must be found by the election court. But in the case of the \"corrupt act\" of bribery that fact may depend upon one proved case as well as upon one hundred, and the penalty of disqualification follows alike in the one case as the other. The offence may be proved and found even though the name or names of the elector or electors bribed may not be able to be given. Several acts of personal bribery do not for the purpose of personal disqualification constitute different offences.\nWhere large payments of money are made by a candidate to electors by the score either directly or through the hands of his chairmen of committees and the courts find they were so made corruptly and for the purpose of inducing those electors to vote or refrain from voting as in the case before us has been found, it surely would make the Act practically inoperative in this important point if the court, having clearly found the offence committed, had to stay its hand and not pronounce judgment because owing to the faulty memory of the candidate or his agents through whom he paid the money or from other causes the names of the electors could not be given. Nor is there any sufficient reason why the names must appear in the finding to make it a good one. It is quite sufficient if it is proved that the recipients of the bribe money were electors. The mens rea must be shewn, the fact of payment pursuant to the guilty intent to actual electors proved and that is sufficient. One court alone, the election court, can make the finding and that finding can only be made by it once after trial of the petition; one penalty alone, disqualification, flows from the finding. The candidate found guilty cannot before any other court or before the same court in any other proceeding or at any other time be put in peril for the same offence. It is true he may be indicted for the crime of bribery in each specific case where bribery can be proved against him. But the penalties under the Election Act and those for the crime for which he may be indicted are entirely different, and in no case could the proof of conviction under the Election Act with its penalty of disqualification avail to defeat any indictment which might be brought against him for bribery or be received as evidence of his guilt.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs and proceeding to give the judgment which in our opinion the court appealed from should have given with respect to the particular and limited part of their judgment appealed from to this court with which limited appeal we alone have the right to deal, we should adjudge and find the appellant to have been guilty at the election aforesaid of paying large sums of money to the several chairmen of his committees between the day of nomination and the day of election corruptly and with the intent that these moneys should be paid and disbursed by these chairmen or some of them in large part at least to electors of the said electoral district for the purpose of inducing such electors to vote for him (the appellant) or refrain from voting against him, or for having so voted or refrained from voting, and that such moneys or a large part thereof were by such chairmen or some of them so paid and disbursed to such electors for the corrupt purpose aforesaid, and that in so acting and doing the appellant had committed a corrupt act within the meaning of the Dominion Elections Act and was in consequence personally disqualified as prescribed by that Act.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I agree in the result that appellant be or stand disqualified by reason of his having violated the Dominion Elections Act, 1900, sec. 108, sub-sec. (e).\nI am unable to accede to some of the propositions of law and part of the procedure involved in the judgment of the majority of the court.\nThe learned trial judge failed in their order of 2nd January, 1906, to comply with the provisions of section 43 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act.\nFor the reasons set forth in the case of 'Norwich Election Case; Stevens v. Tillett([1]), and followed in South Oxford Election Case ([2]), by the late Chief Justice Draper, I am clearly of the opinion that the subsequent report of the trial judges made on the 15th January in discharge of their duty under section 44 of the said Act, can give no assistance to the interpretation of the previous order, and that such previous order cannot receive any force or vitality from the report which is only made for the consideration of Parliament, and has no final or binding effect.\nHowever anomalous the proceedings may be, to amend, on an appeal by the man to be convicted, if not already convicted, so that he of a certainty shall stand convicted, yet I think, under section 51, sub-section 3 of the Act it becomes our duty in a clear case, to amend.\nI am of the opinion that the defects in form and in much of the procedure in the court below sprang from the respondents presenting a case of \"general corruption\" which is not known to the law, instead of adhering to the obvious course that they ought to have followed, of having regard to section 10, sub-section 5o of the particulars, and being as specific as possible in the trial of the accused. Any necessity for amendment, that has arisen in this case, is the result of the respondents failing to observe these requirements.\nThe accused in these election cases is entitled to have the charge made as specific as possible, and to have due regard paid to such specification in the taking of evidence, and when that is concluded, to have the consideration thereof dealt with as a separate issue, and reported upon free from trammels of anything else. With due submission I think this was not adhered to in this case as closely as is desirable in a trial of this kind.\nI think it is a matter of regret, if there was the extensive corrupt expenditure which the court below has found, that the trial was not so conducted with due regard to the necessities for the specific charges being adhered to, for in that event the report usually made to the Speaker, but in this case made to this court, as the result of the appeal, would have doubtless contained a very large number of names that are omitted therefrom.\nI think a certain duty devolves upon petitioners in cases of this character to see that there is not such a failure in carrying out the provisions of the Act in regard to the reporting of people prim\u00e2 facie guilty of corrupt practices as this case does plainly exhibit. I think that duty was neglected in this case, and that and the want of specification giving rise to the irregularities, and the mistake in the form of the judgment requiring it to be amended, were such that the respondents ought not to get their costs of this appeal.\nI am the more impressed with this view that the petitioners specially prayed that all persons who might be found guilty might be dealt with, yet let the guilty escape, and in the case of one man at least, McCabe, permitted him to be reported without evidence justifying such report.\nThe reporting of Francis McCabe, who does not seem to have committed, according to any evidence have been able to find, any offence save receiving from the appellant part of the money, which it is said was designed by him to be partly used for improper purposes, suggests that others of those reported may not, any more than he, have been guilty of any corrupt practice. The receiving of such money is not in itself made a corrupt practice by the Act. The receiver's transgression of the law begins only when he uses the money entrusted to him for a corrupt purpose. The acceptance and an express undertaking with the candidate to spend improperly might place such a receiver in a difficult position, morally, and in the eyes of the law, and yet he might not be guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of this Act.\nThere was nothing expressly corrupt or improper in anything that passed from the appellant to McCabe, or indeed many others, that would place him or some of them in this light I have just adverted to. The money paid out was not all designed even by appellant for improper purposes.\nIt is said that we have nothing to do with that phase of this case, because the only questions we have to consider are those arising out of this appeal which has been limited to the question of the appellant's disqualification. Sub-section 4 of section 51 as it originally stood, and until amended by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 13, would, if we were acting under it, amply justify this contention. All that the Registrar under the section as it originally stood certified as the judgment of this court was that which touched upon the decision on the appeal.\nBy the amending section I have just referred to, however, the following is what is now required:\n4. The registrar shall certify to the Speaker of the House of Commons the judgment and decision1 of the Supreme Court, confirming,; changing or annulling any decision, report ' or finding of the court that tried the petition appealed from, upon the several questions of law as well as of fact upon which the appeal was made, and therein shall certify as to the matters and things as to which, by section forty-four of this Act, the court would have been required to report to the Speaker, whether they are confirmed, annulled or changed, or left unaffected by such decision of the Supreme Court; and such decision shall be final.\nWhat is the meaning of the words at the end declaring \"such decision shall be final?\" I submit that it is possible to interpret this amended section so as to give to the report, going from this court to the Speaker, and dealing with persons guilty of corrupt practices, a meaning not found to exist in the report to the Speaker when made by the trial judges; in other words, a meaning it had not in law, as above cases shew, when it reached us. It may or may. not be the true meaning to hold that it has the effect of making that report final and conclusive as to the status of the persons reported. It is to be observed, however, that it is upon the use of these words at the end of a section that enabled the courts in the cases I have cited to hold candidates' status affected finally and conclusively by virtue of a report under a section so worded. Lest such signification should be given to the report to the speaker from this court, I think we ought to guard ourselves and make clear that such is not our intention, and not our judgment.\nI do not think that we escape responsibility by saying that it is something with which we have nothing to do. There being a duty cast upon us by this amended sub-section, I think, as to the whole report, in the case of any appeal whether specially directed to the terms of the report or not, leaves the matter in such a condition that I cannot think we are free from responsibility and ought to so amend the form of report as to remove a doubt. We ought at least to say, if we feel we are not responsible, that the report is not to be taken as our judgment.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies, and am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Archer, Perron & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Bisaillon & Brossard.\n[1] L.R. 6 C.P. 147.\n[2] Hodgins' Elec.

The substance of the decisions of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in relation to the issues raised upon the present appeals, is summarized, as follows, in the judgment appealed from, as formally entered in the court below:\u2014\n\"Considering that the defendant, Fraser, in support of his right to such fishing and against the claim of the Crown to the same, in addition to invoking the non-navigability and non-floatability of the said river and the letters patent issued by the Crown for the said lots, also invokes other documents and facts, already declared by this court relevant and admissible in the case, and particularly the written application of the 13th December, 1880, * * * made to the Crown, for the purchase and acquisition of said lots and right of fishing, by John Holliday, acting for the firm of Fraser & Holliday, in whose rights defendants * * * were and are, the assent to and acceptance by the Crown of the said application, as made and the action of the parties thereon and specially the possession and enjoyment of the said fishing right for twenty years by the said Fraser & Holliday and their representatives.\n\"Considering that it is established that the Crown and the said Fraser & Holliday, in January, 1882, concluded an agreement between them by the assent to and acceptance of and according by the Crown of the said application of the 13th December, 1880, as made, without change or modification except to fix by mutual consent the extent of the grant along said river and the price, and by the payment by said firm and acceptance by the Crown of the consideration for said agreement so entered in; whereby the said Fraser & Holliday acquired the right to have, own, possess and enjoy the said lots of land and the said right of fishing in the said river opposite to the same, and, in fact, the said firm and their representatives have for and during a period of twenty years before the filing of said informations publicly and peaceably possessed and enjoyed the said lands and right of fishing conformably to the said concluded agreement between said firm and the Crown.\n\"Considering that the subsequent issue of letters patent, in June, 1883, for the said lots to the said Fraser & Holliday and their pr\u00eate noms ought not to and did not deprive the said Fraser & Holliday and their representatives of the said right of fishing acquired by the said firm by said agreement concluded between them and the Crown, as aforesaid, in January, 1882.\n\"Considering that the said right of fishing at all times, since January 21st, 1882, was and is vested in the said Fraser & Holliday and their representatives * * * and not in the Crown; and that the appeals herein taken are well founded and ought to be maintained * * *\n\"This Court, without pronouncing on the navigability and floatability of the said river, doth declare that there is error in the judgment appealed from rendered by the Superior Court, at Quebec, on the 16th February, 1904, doth maintain the said appeals and annul and set aside the said judgment and, proceeding to render the judgment which the said Superior Court ought to have rendered, doth declare;\n\"That the right of fishing in the said Moisie River opposite the said lots (except the right of fishing reserved by the Crown in front of the small portion of lot A North, three chains wide and thirteen chains deep) to have belonged at all times since the 21st January, 1882, to the said Fraser & Holliday and their representatives and to now belong to the appellants (now respondents) and not to the Crown, and doth dismiss the informations herein filed and doth recommend that the Crown pay the costs, etc.\"\nThe application referred to was in the form of a letter addressed to the Commissioner of Crown Lands, as follows:\n\"Sir,\u2014In view of the late decision of the Supreme Court of Canada to the effect that the right of angling for salmon in the fresh water portion of rivers above tidal waters belongs to the land on either side of the river when sold or patented to individuals, I beg to apply for a portion of land of each side of the Elver Moisie beginning at the foot of the first rapids and extending downwards for seven miles with such limited width on either side as the Government will consent to sell.\n\"I particularly desire to acquire this land and these fishing rights as I have establishments on the side of the main river on the land applied for for the artificial propagation of salmon, also as being the lessee from the Federal Government of the netting portion which I have held for the last twenty years.\"\nMr. Justice Hall, one of the judges of the Court of King's Bench, while concurring in the judgment appealed from, stated that, in his opinion, the River Moisie was not, in a legal sense, a navigable and floatable river.\nThe letters patent granted the lots, in free and common socage, describing them as having frontage on the River Moisie, and did not, in terms, mention any rights in the waters or bed of the river or as to fishing therein. Stuart E.G. and Lafleur E.G. for the appellant. The grant is of land only\u2014bounded by the River Moisie; if that river be navigable and floatable the boundary is high water-mark; if non-navigable, it no doubt is the centre of the river.\nTwo principles of law have been violated by the judgment appealed from: 1st. That all the negotiations which precede the execution of a written contract are merged in that contract itself; and 2ndly. That, when a contract is clear and unambiguous, no evidence as to the negotiations which preceded the execution of the contract, whether oral or written, can be admitted to construe it.

Wallace & Co.([6]), at pages 602 and 614; Leggott v. Barrett([7]). Moreover, the evidence does not justify the conclusion that there was any concluded agreement for the sale of fishing rights; the holding is, in fact, at variance with the evidence.\nThere can be no need for interpretation of a contract unambiguous in every respect; no estoppel runs against the Crown, and no laches of any officer of the Crown can in any way impair the Crown rights.

The Queen ([12]); The Queen v. The Bank of Nova Scotia([13]); City of Quebec v. The Queen([14]).\nThe court of appeal did not expressly deal with the question whether the Moisie River is a navigable river or not, but Mr. Justice Hall denies the navigable and floatable character of the river. The question of navigability was fully discussed by Mr. Justice Larue, who decided, upon the testimony of a number of witnesses heard by him at the trial, that the river was navigable, at least to the place in dispute opposite the defendants' land. It is true the defendants adduced evidence as to the difficulties of navigation in the estuary at low tide, the difficulty of getting over the bar at the mouth of the river at low tide and in certain conditions of wind and weather, and further, as to the nature of the upper part of the river, starting from the rapids above the American Camp northwards. This evidence appears to be wholly irrelevant; the navigability of the river cannot be decided by its condition at low tide, nor can the question whether or not it is navigable opposite the defendants' lands be decided by the difficulties of navigation further north. The evidence which relates to the river opposite the lands in question, admits the navigability of the river below, when the tide has flowed to some extent. The whole evidence not only justified the finding of the trial judge, that the river from the foot of the rapid near the Grand Portage to its mouth is navigable and floatable, and, in consequence, a dependency of the Crown Domain, but rendered such finding imperative.\nThis fact being established, the propositions of law applicable to the case and the principal authorities in support of them may be summarized as follows:\u2014The right of fishing in navigable waters is exclusively vested in the Crown, unless specially granted.

Corporation of Quebec([23]).The arguments in respect to making the respondent Adams a party are not mentioned as the question is not discussed in the judgment now reported.\nFlynn K.C. for the respondents. We contend, 1st. That the fishing rights in question were conceded by the Crown to Fraser and his associate, and Fraser became and was the sole owner thereof; and 2ndly. That the river is neither, as a whole nor as regards the part opposite the lots in question, navigable, floatable or tidal.\nThe statutes, orders in council, regulations, correspondence and proof of record clearly shew that it was the intention of the Crown to grant, and the object of the grantees to secure, the exclusive rights of fishery in that part of the river which has its course between the riparian lots conveyed by the letters patent. The contract was completed quite irrespectively of the letters patent, which are merely a convenient method of supplying evidence of the grant of the riparian lands necessary to be used in connection with and for the protection of the fishing rights bargained for. We refer to the judgments of their Lordships Justices Hall and Trenholme, in the court below, in this connection.\nThe instructions for the survey and examination of the lands were merely for the purpose of having a report as to their unfitness for agricultural purposes in order to permit of their being made the subject of a special grant in connection with the fisheries. They can have no other effect in regard to the dealings between the Crown and the respondents; the lands are shewn to be valueless, save in so far as they were to be utilized in connection with the fisheries. The Crown is shewn to have been dealing with this river upon the view that it was, by its nature, neither navigable nor floatable; as a matter of fact, it is not so at any point opposite the lands granted, and, as a consequence, the bed of the river is included in the grants usque ad medium filum aqu\u00e6. We are owners of both banks, consequently of the whole of the bed of the river flowing between them; arts. 414 et seq., 503 C.C. The mouth of the river is shewn to be so obstructed by reefs and sandbars that it is impossible for even very small craft or light boats to enter it, except at high tides and with favourable conditions of the wind. There are but a few inches of water on the shallows at low tides, and, even at high tides, with a contrary wind, the channel cannot be safely or profitably navigated. The fact that a few vessels have been able, with much difficulty and at great risks, to enter the river, does not affect the general non-navigability of its character. Navigation is, moreover, rendered absolutely impossible from the lowest point opposite our lands by the condition of the channel and rapids; see report of the case in the court below, at pages 130-131, per Hall J., and cases collected in Bouvier's Law Dict.([24]), p. 471; Coulson & Forbes on Waters, pp. 9,12,13,14, 62, 94, 96, 360-1, 479; Angel on Watercourses, p. 731, No. 544; Reece v.

Hogan([30]).\nThe letters patent can be explained and interpreted with the aid of the contemporaneous dealings and writings which passed between the parties, and by the manner in which the contract was executed: 16 Laurent, Nos. 503, 504, 508; 7 Huc, No. 176; 25 Demolorube, Nos. 7-10 and 36; 5 Marcad\u00e9 & Pont, p. 116; Beaudry-Laeantinerie, Nos. 558, 559; Fusier-Herman, art. 1341 C.N., Nos. 207, 208; Chad v. Til-sed([31]); 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, No. 243.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal involves important questions of law, although not entirely new. They have been considered by this court on several occasions, and were it not for their practical consequences, it would be sufficient to refer to Re Provincial Fisheries([32]), and the elaborate opinion of Mr. Justice Larue in this case, where all the authorities are collected. Although mere opinions, not binding, have been expressed in the Provincial Fisheries Case (7), on a reference by the Governor-General-in-Council, the questions with regard to fisheries and the right of fishing, navigable and floatable rivers, have been so carefully considered that they are entitled to very great weight, more especially in view of the fact that these opinions, at least with regard to the subject matter under consideration, were confirmed on appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ([33]), and that in the present case the parties have not alleged any reason why they should not prevail.\nThe substantial facts, free from irrelevant details and extrinsic matters, which form at least three-fourths of the immense volume (700 pages) of the case, are simple enough. By information of the Attorney-General for Quebec, His Majesty the King claims fishing grounds and the right of fishing opposite certain lots of land granted to the respondent, Alexander Fraser, and his associates, on both sides of the Moisie River, in the County of Saguenay, alleging that the said river is \"a public, navigable and floatable river.\" The respondent met this action by pleading that he was a riparian proprietor of the said lots of land by virtue of letters patent from the Crown, in right of the Province of Quebec, and, as such, had the\nexclusive right of fishing in the said River Moisie opposite or appertaining to the lots.\nHe adds that for years before and after said grant, and at the time it was issued, the Government of Quebec, by the acts, letters and writings of its ministers and officials, always considered and represented the said lots as\nincluding fishing rights in the said River Moisie, opposite said respective lots usque ad medium filum equ\u0153.\nand finally, that the said river was not navigable nor floatable. The Attorney-General demurred to that part of the respondent's pleas, paragraphs 14-20, in which facts are alleged tending to explain, contradict, vary, supplement or add to the letters patent. The demurrer was maintained by Chief Justice Casault, but in appeal that judgment was reversed. The court has left no notes of this judgment, but from the consid\u00e9rants, it is based upon the following ground:\nConsiderant que ces paragraphs sont pertinents et contiennent des faits qui tendent, \u00e0 supporter la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant que la concession que lui a faite la couronne inclut le droit de p\u00eache dans la rivi\u00e8re Moisie, en face des lots conc\u00e9d\u00e9s, etc.\nIn consequence of this decision, the parties were sent back to the first court, and had to go through a very voluminous enqu\u00eate, as there was no further appeal to this court or any other tribunal, the judgment being only interlocutory. But as we decided quite recently in the case of Willson v. Shawinigan Carbide Co. ([34]), it is now open to the appellant to shew that the judgment of the first court was right. At all events, we hold that the evidence adduced under this branch of the case is illegal.\nThe trial judge, on the merits, found: 1st. That the evidence outside the letters patent did not contradict, and was, moreover, insufficient to override their clear language; and 2ndly, that the river was navigable and floatable. The action of the Crown was, therefore, maintained with costs. In appeal, this judgment was reversed as to the first ground only, the question of the navigability remaining undecided. From this final judgment the Crown appeals to this court.\nWe entirely agree with Chief Justice Casault that the matters struck off by him are no answer to the information. In the Revised Statutes of Quebec respecting Crown lands, the commissioner is vested with very large powers; he may cancel a grant of land under certain circumstances. Art. 1283 R.S.Q. He may even cancel letters patent which have been surrendered, and order correct ones to be issued in their stead; art. 1299; but he cannot supplement or add to the same. I do not mean to say that ambiguous letters patents cannot be explained like any other contract. I mean that letters patents, clear in their terms, cannot be varied; Massawippi Valley Railway Go. v. Reecl([35]); except by the same parties who caused them to be issued, that is, the Lieutenant Govornor in Council, by supplementary letters patent, or fresh letters patent, or, at least, orders in council delivered to and accepted by the grantee; and here I cannot do better than quote the language of Chief Justice Strong in the case of Bulmer v. The Queen([36]):\nThe orders in council authorizing the Minister of the Interior to grant the licenses to cut timber on the timber berths in question, did not, on any principle which has been established by authority, or which I can discover, constitute contracts between the Crown and the proposed licensees. These orders-in-council, as similar administrative orders in the case of sales of Crown lands in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec have always been held to be, were revocable by the Crown until acted upon by the granting of licenses under them.\nIn this case the respondent cannot even produce an order in council. Art. 1207, of the Civil Code, says that letters patent, issued by the Government of Quebec, are authentic writings, and art 1210 adds that\nan authentic writing makes complete proof between the parties to it,\nof the obligation expressed in it, etc. Under these articles I cannot see how any evidence of the nature allowed by the court of appeal can be legal. But there is more in the case.\nWhatever may have been the correspondence and other acts of certain officials, the substantial documents (outside the letters patent) support the appellant's contention. In the application for a patent, dated 13th December, 1880, to the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Mr. Flynn, a demand is made only\nfor a portion of land on each side of the River Moisie, beginning at the foot of the first rapids and extending downwards for seven miles, with such limited width on either side as the Government will consent to sell.\nTrue, a reference is made to fishing rights opposite that land, but it is only with regard to his desire or motive for the application. Finally, on the 20th January, 1882, the assistant commissioner recommends that a sale of 200 acres of land be made to the respondent and his associates, and that letters patent. be issued accordingly, The report was approved by the commissioner, Mr. Flynn, on the 21st February following. The respondent contends that these documents complete the agreement and the court of appeal agrees with him.\nI cannot see how a complete agreement can be found in face of the very terms of the letters patent and of the memorandum of commissioner Flynn. I must confess I cannot conceive how a \"concluded agreement\" can be presumed from the above documents. First, the report of Mr. Lemoine, of the 20th January, 1882, purports to grant only lots of land; 2ndly, no right of fishing is mentioned; 3rdly, if the latter was only contemplated, why order in 1881 a survey \"as to the nature of the soil\"? In 1882, Mr. Lemoine again orders a regular survey. And finally letters patent are to be issued.\nNow let us look at the terms of the letters patent which were issued more than one year after, in 1883. They do not purport to transfer fishing grounds or fishing rights, but only tracts of land situate on both sides of the River Moisie. It cannot be doubted that the Crown never expressly intended to grant by these letters patent the right of fishing in front of the said lands. It is now well settled law that, without such special grant, the fisheries in public or navigable rivers do not pass from the Crown. The authorities are all collected in Re Provincial Fisheries ([37]). We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal which, quite irrespective of the navigability of the River Moisie, construed the negotiations and correspondence leading up to the granting of the letters patent as, in themselves, constituting a collateral or independent contract establishing the patentees' right to a fishing grant, although at variance with the plain and unambiguous language of the letters patent themselves.\nUndoubtedly the respondent, under the belief that the river was not navigable, expected to acquire the fishing grounds and the right of fishing on both sides of the river. He says so in the application of the 13th December, 1880, and some of the representatives or officials of the Crown, if not all, seem to have been under the same impression. In his application the respondent says:\nIn view of the late decision of the Supreme (he meant the Exchequer) Court of Canada to the effect that the right of angling for salmon in the fresh water portion of rivers above tidal waters belongs to the land on either side of the river when sold or patented to individuals, etc.\nThe applicant evidently had in mind the recent decisions in Robertson v. Steadman([38]) by the New Brunswick court, in 1879, and The Queen v. Robertson([39]), decided in 1880 by Mr. Justice Gwynne, one of the judges of the Supreme Court, sitting in the Exchequer Court, both reviewed by this court in 1882, in The Queen v. Robertson(2). The courts held that the locus in question in the Miramichi River, where no tide was felt, was not a public or navigable river, and that, therefore, the grant of the land on each side of the river carried with it, ipso facto, the fisheries in the river, and the right to fish from shore to shore, although for many miles lower down the river is tidal and navigable.\nThe law of the Province of Quebec with regard to navigable rivers is very clear. No attention is paid to the tide element. Art. 400 of the Civil Code says that\nall the roads and public ways maintained by the state, navigable and floatable rivers and streams and their banks, etc., are considered as being dependencies of the Crown domain.\nThe respondent, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and all the officials, may possibly have been acting under an erroneous impression of the law; there is evidence that, at that time, the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada claimed the fisheries of all navigable rivers; it was not until 1896 that the question was settled in favour of the provinces by this court, and in 1898 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. If there be an error on either side, or on both sides, as to the law or the fact of the navigability of the River Moisie, the respondent may find a remedy in art. 1299, or, at least, 1303, of the Revised. Statutes of Quebec, and C.P.Q., art. 1007. All we are called upon to establish is that the clear terms of the letters patent he produces do not establish any grant of the fisheries he claims, and that these fisheries are located in a navigable or floatable river.\nAs to the navigability, we intimated to the appellant's counsel that it was not necessary to hear him in reply. We considered that we were relieved from the duty of reading the whole evidence upon this branch of the case. The counsel for the respondent had read enough of it to this court during his lengthy argument to satisfy us that the River Moisie is not only floatable\u2014that is, for rafts, but navigable for canoes, boats, scows, barges, schooners, and even steamers. If we understood him correctly, he admitted that it is capable of navigation, although always difficult at a low tide, which in this instance rises to 7 or 8 feet, and this twice a day. In his factum, the respondent further says:\nThe River Moisie has some 400 miles in length, and in all the plans produced by the Crown, and by the defence, and by the description given by witnesses, it is a series of rapids, falls; cascades, rocks, sand-banks, and reefs (battures), with a velocity of current equal to 4, 5, and 6 miles an hour. There never has been any regular navigation, traffic or commerce on this river.\nThe only exception to this, if it can. be so considered, is the salmon net fishing in the estuary of the river by Messrs. Holliday and Fraser, and now Messrs. Holliday Bros., and the fly fishing in the fluvial part of the river.\nThere is no cultivation on either side of the river, all the timber has disappeared, at least, up to that part of the river where the Jots in question are situate. * * As to the species of boats which have been in use on this river, those mentioned by the witnesses are the following: Bark and wooden canoes, drawing a few inches of water; small \"flats,\" as the word indicates, flat bottomed, and drawing less than 1 foot of water; and boats (barges). Amongst the latter, is what the witnesses call \"the long-boat,\" used by the Messrs. Holliday to carry down their salmon nets in the estuary of the river. * *\nThis long-boat goes up the river during the fishing season daily, as far as the one before the last fishing camp, and once every week, to the uppermost camp. This boat, as Captain Mercier says himself, has the shape of a \"chaloupe.\" The stern is square and not sharp, as the witnesses say. Its draught of water is two feet, perhaps a little more when completely laden. * *\nVessels are frequently stranded at the mouth of the river, the channel there is extremely narrow, and at low water contains scarcely four or five feet in depth. Vessels drawing 7 or 8 feet have to await the rising tide to enter the bay of the river and reach the wharves there. * * *\nThe \"Pointe \u00e0 Mercier,\" is of extremely difficult access; there is only at the most one foot and a half of water in the channel at low tide, and it becomes necessary to await the rising tide, as we have seen, in order to pass by. A glance at some of the maps, produced by the Crown and by the defence, gives an idea of the general physiognomy of that part of the river. Mr. Neilson, who is an old explorer, having a thorough knowledge of our rivers and forests, and who has gone up this river for a considerable distance (250 to 260 miles on eastern branch), says that the only means of navigating it is by the bark canoe and by taking advantage of the many portages. In truth, 'evidence of record shews that such is the general rule, and that it is exceptionally, or in favourable conditions of the river, that other boats have made use of, as we have seen. Advantage has to be taken of the high waters of the river, in the spring or after heavy rains or of the rising tide. * * *\nNow, if we take the river below the American Camp, which is the part more particularly in question, we can divide it as follows: 1. The bay, that is, from the mouth of the river to \"Pointe \u00e0 Mercier.\" The bay is very large and the sand being continually driven down by the waters of the river, it is very shallow. 2. From \"Pointe \u00e0 Mercier up to the \"Coude\"; there are very serious obstacles in the way as regards the channel, even for the Messrs. Holliday \"Brothers' \"long-boat.\" 3. Beyond the \"Coude\" the ordinary means of navigation used by the gentlemen, who go fly-fishing, is the canoe. Nevertheless, during the fishing season, to bring up their provisions and luggage, and to take their luggage down, they make use of a boat, which draws about two feet of water, some witnesses say two and one-half feet; but even in doing so, they must take certain precautions to avail themselves of the elevation of the water in the river, of the rising tide, etc.\nAnd if we add to the above admissions, the facts as stated by Mr. Justice Larue, that steamers like the \"King Edward,\" the \"Lord Stanley,\" the \"Beaver,\" the \"Gypsy,\" drawing from nine to eleven feet of water, have been able to make regular commerce with Moisie, and on the River Moisie to very near the first rapids and in front of the lots granted to the respondent. I cannot see how it can be contended that the Moisie is not navigable up to and including the locus - in question. Mr. Justice Larue has quoted the testimony of quite a number of witnesses, and we must not forget that he saw these witnesses and was in a better position than we are to judge of their intelligence,. competency and truthfulness.\nIf we were to hold that rivers navigable only by the assistance of the tide, are not navigable within the meaning of the law, we would simply put out of the public domain a considerable number of large rivers,, which in every country have been considered navigable and are used for transportation of commercial commodities. What is navigability of a river is a question of fact. I do not think the size of the boat has much to do with it. Until a little over one hundred years ago all the great rivers of Canada, including the Saguenay, the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence, above Montreal, were navigated by canoes and flat-bottomed boats. These were the kind of craft that the Hudson Bay Company, the North-West Company, the Government, and the traders of the West used to carry their furs, goods and merchandise to and from Montreal for hundreds of miles along the above rivers, and others connecting with them. Before the construction of the canals, for at least fifty years, steamers were navigating different parts of the St. Lawrence, but were prevented from ascending above Montreal by huge rapids and falls, and yet can it be said seriously that these rivers were not at all times navigable? Therefore, it is not necessary that navigation should be continuous, as contended for by the respondent. A river may not be capable of navigation in parts, like the St. Lawrence at the Lachine Rapids, at the Cascades, Coteau and Long Sault rapids, the Ottawa at Carillon, the Chaudi\u00e8re and the Chats rapids, and yet be a navigable river, if, in fact, it is navigated for purposes of trade and commerce. The test of navigability is its utility for commercial purposes. Every river is not equally useful. The Moisie, which is in the wilderness, with few fishing and min-, eral establishments for 15 or 17 miles from its mouth, cannot be compared with the River St. Lawrence, where the state has spent millions to improve its navigation possibilities. No public money has been spent on the River Moisie; it may never be spent if the volume of trade does not justify expenditure of public money; the Government is not bound to improve rivers, and it cannot be expected that it will do so without regard to the requirements of the shipping trade. For the moment, the Moisie is sufficient for the wants of its inhabitants and the public dealing with them.\nIn the case of Bell v. Corporation of Quebec, decided by the Privy Council([40]), their Lordships, after citing Dalloz and Daviel, said:\nThese general definitions of Daviel and Dalloz shew that the question to be decided is, as from its nature it must be, one of the fact in the particular case, namely, whether and how far the river can be practically employed for purposes of traffic. The French authorities evidently point to the possibility, at least, of the Use of the river for transport in some practical and profitable way as being the test of navigability. And, in the same case, Chief Justice Dorion said, in the court of appeal:\nD'apr\u00e8s cela, tcute rivi\u00e8re qui, sans travaux artificiels, peut porter bateaux serait une rivi\u00e8re navigable. Cette d\u00e9finition laisse cependant beaucoup \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. En effet, une rivi\u00e8re comme la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles, qui une fois ou deux pendant Tann\u00e9e ,dans les plus hautes mar\u00e9es lorsque le volume de ses eaux sera consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9 par la fonte des neiges du printemps ou les pluies abond-' antes de l'automne, permettra \u00e0 un bateau de se rendre jusqu'au pont de Scott, devra-t-elle \u00eatre consider\u00e9e comme navigable, lorsque pendant tout le reste de l'ann\u00e9e il sera impossible d'y aller, m\u00eame avec une chaloupe ne tirant qu'un ou deux pieds d'eau? Il semple qu'il faut admettre avec Championni\u00e8re (Trait\u00e9 des eaux courantes, 428), que la division des cours d'eaux est tout \u00e0 fait arbitraire, et que ce n'est pas tant le volume de l'eau que la circonstance que son cours est ou n'est pas consacr\u00e9 au service public, qui lui donne son caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gal.\nThe trial judge has found the River Moisie from the foot of the rapid near the Grand Portage to its mouth on the River St. Lawrence is navigable an. floatable, not only when the tide is rising, but even at low water. I must confess that the evidence is conflicting as to this; but his findings as to navigability have not been reversed in appeal. Mr. Justice Hall did not agree with him that the river was navigable under any circumstances, while Mr. Justice Trenholme took a different view of the case. The majority of the court declined to express any opinion on this point, and so we have only the finding of one court as to the navigability of the Moisie at low water. Are Ave justified in overlooking such a finding? I would hesitate to do so, especially in face of our ruling in Massawippi Valley Railway Co. v. Reerl([41]).\nHowever, we do not base our judgment upon this finding, but upon the fact, not controverted, and admitted by the respondent, and upon the evidence, that the river is navigable, and is navigated by the assistance of the tide, in a practical and profitable way, and for the purposes of traffic, at least from its mouth up to and including the part in dispute. Beyond that we are not called upon to say anything, and we decide nothing.\nSummarized, therefore, our holdings are: 1st. That the patent issued by the Crown is plain and unambiguous in its language, that the rights of the parties must be determined by it, and cannot be added to, altered or diminished by any previous negotiations, written or oral, leading up to its issue. That, therefore, the application of the patentee and subsequent correspondence between him and the Crown officials should not have been received in evidence for the purpose of explaining the patent, and, if looked at, for the purpose of establishing an independent or collateral contract conferring additional rights upon the patentee, entirely fail to do so. That the legal effect of the language of the patent with respect to the bed of the river, and the fishing rights therein, depends upon the determination of the question whether the Moisie at and in the four or five of its miles covered by the patent is navigable or floatable within the meaning of the law of Quebec, and that, adopting the test of navigability laid down by the Privy Council and hereinbefore quoted, we concur with the findings of the trial judge, and which findings are not questioned in the judgment of the court of appeal, that such river at such locality and from thence to its mouth, is so navigable and floatable.\nFor these reasons, the appeal is allowed with costs, and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.

Adams.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Caron, Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitor for the respondents : E. J. Flynn.\n[1] Q.R. 14 K.B. 115, sub nom, Lefaivre v.

Subsequently, the directors of the bank passed a resolution authorizing the discharge of B., on payment of $15,000 by one V., \"jusqu'a concurrence de la dite somme de $15,000\" and the transfer of the shares to V. This resolution was followed by a deed of compromise, V. paying the $15,000, and obtaining a transfer of the shares, and it was thereby declared that, by the transaction, B. was discharged in so far as concerned the bank's advances on the stock account \"vis-\u00e0-vis la banque des avances qu'elle lui a faites du chef susdit mentionn\u00e9es en un acte de r\u00e8glement'' etc., the resolution being annexed and the deed of settlement referred to for imputation of the payment, and V. was to become creditor of B. under conditions mentioned, \"jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $15,000,\" the note which had not become dus and the securities being allowed to remain in possession of the bank. In an action by D. to whom the notes held by the bank were assigned:\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the effect of the deed of compromise was to discharge B. merely to the extent of the $15,000 on account of the larger note; and further, affirming the judgment appealed from, that no action could lie upon the smaller note as it represented interest on a claim in relation to a contract of an illegal nature. L'Association St. Jean Baptiste v. Brault (30 Can. S.C.R. 598) followed. APPEAL from a decision of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff sued to recover $9,600.54 for the balance of two promissory notes made by the defendant in favour of La Banque du Peuple in settlement of debts owing by him to the bank, one for $18,762.02 for advances and interest on a loan for the purchase of Dominion Cotton Co. shares, and the other for $4,731.61 advanced to meet the interest on a loan made in connection with a lottery scheme. Credit was given for a payment of $15,000 on account of the larger note, thus leaving the balance claimed. The defendant contended that the whole amount of the larger note had been discharged by the deed of compromise mentioned in the head-note and that the smaller note had been compensated by a larger sum due him by the bank for interest on an obligation assigned by him to the bank. At the trial Mr. Justice Archibald held that the deed of compromise had dis charged the whole of the larger note as a draft thereof had been approved by the bank before execution and the resolution of the directors in respect to its execution could be so construed as to authorize a full discharge; the learned judge also held that the consideration for the other note was illegal, being based upon an immoral contract relating to a lottery and, therefore, that no recovery could be had thereon. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe questions raised upon the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. B\u00e9ique K.C. and Delfausse for the appellant. Belcourt K.C. and Lamothe K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred in the judgment delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nGIROUARD J. concurred for the reasons stated by Idington J.\nDAVIES J. concurred for the reasons stated by their Lordships Justices Idington and Maclennan.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent owed the Banque du Peuple $18,772.17 on the 20th July, 1897, for which he gave his promissory note at eighteen months with interest at six per cent. per annum pursuant to a deed of settlement relative to this and another debt he owed the bank. By that deed of settlement there was declared to be held by the bank \"Dominion Cotton\" and \"Duluth\" stocks of the respondents, as collateral security only for this debt, and that the bank could sell if default made in paying this note. The original advance on this amount had been $18,000 and the balance odd since is made up of interest thereon.\nOn the 15th September, 1898, the parties agreed that one Vinet should advance the bank $15,000 and get the \"Dominion Cotton\" stock, and that the respondent would have three years to pay the said sum, and the bank release the respondent.\nThe question is raised whether or not this release should be of the whole indebtedness or only the sum of $15,000, part of the whole principal debt. Several causes no doubt moved each party to this arrangement, but none of such a character as to suggest that the bank was likely to be willing, with such securities as it had, to sacrifice $3,772 and 14 months' interest on $18,772 for the sake of getting what they got.\nYet we are asked to construe the instrument which concluded the arrangement in this sense.\nThis instrument certainly contains some expressions which lend a colour to the contention which has received the support of the courts below.\nIt purports, however, to have been made. by virtue of a resolution of the bank directors which is annexed to it.\nThis resolution must be held to govern all that is doubtful in the document in question. It is not clear that without such authority the bank agents had any power to make such a surrender of its claims, under such circumstances as existed here.\nIt is idle, however, to suggest that this agreement for release in whole or in part might have fallen within the scope of such general authority as the officers of the bank might have had, for it obviously never was intended by either party that in this case such authority was to be or was relied on.\nThe resolution clearly contemplates an acquittance to the respondent of his debt to the extent of the sum of $15,000\u2014and no more.\nIf the parties have not been in accord as to that then there was no release.\nIt seems to me, however, that he well understood this was the extent to which he was released and all he expected or desired.\nOne crucial circumstance, in this connection, is the retention by the bank of the respondent's promissory note and of the further collateral securities known as the \"Duluth\" stock, which so remained without objection in their hands until respondent heard of the proposed sale of same to the appellant, who acquired them from the bank and now sues upon said promissory note.\nThe intention of the parties must be sought in interpreting any document, and as an aid thereto the surrounding facts and circumstances can and, in doubtful cases when ambiguous words are used, must always be looked at.\nI must not be understood as including in that, evidence of actual intention or agreement. Evidence of that kind given here I exclude, as it is not necessary to consider questions here raised thereby.\nOn this branch of the case I think appellants are entitled to succeed.\nOn the other branch where the question of illegality is raised I am unable to see how the appellants can succeed.\nThe promissory note sued upon was given for the balance of a debt of $34,731.61 of which $30,000 was extinguished by dealings, needless to refer to, save for the purpose of such indications as they furnish, as to the contested point of whether or not the $30,000 was paid on account of principal or interest.\nIt seems, by the case of L'Association St. Jean Baptiste v. Brault([1]), that a claim for interest upon such advances can not be maintained.\nHence, in this case, if the promissory note now in question were given for interest, it must be held void in law. It seems to me that the intention of the parties, as shewn by expressions in the documents dealing with this adjustment of thirty thousand dollars, on account of the appellant's claim when it stood at |34,731, as stated above, as well as date of note in question being a few days prior to those dealings, shew a clear intention to apply that sum of $30,000 on account of principal. The appellant's factum clearly refers to this payment as if on account of capital.\nBut, in case there be not a clear appropriation to pay principal, it might be urged, in the absence of such express appropriation, that the payment of $30,000 would, in due course of law, wipe out the interest first, and that as a result the balance going to make up the note in question must be treated as part of principal.\nI am, however, of the opinion that if the illegality so tainted the interest that it be irrecoverable, then the law will not impute, in the absence of express application, the payment of any sum to the liquidation of such a debt when there is another to which it can be properly and lawfully imputed.\nI have not been able to find express authority on the point or any allusion to it in the text books, but such a result seems to me clear on principle.\nHence I find that appellants must fail\u2014on this ground\u2014which leaves the interest all that the note in question can represent.\nThe reservation in the Criminal Code relied upon by Mr. B\u00e9ique will not cover a lottery, of the character of this, as it was carried on. The case above referred to seems decisive unless that reservation could possibly have distinguished, as I think it cannot, this from that case. All other debts of the respondent he swears were paid, and in this he is not contradicted.\nAs to this part of appellant's claim I think their appeal must fail.\nAs each had succeeded in a material part of the case I think there should be no costs of this appeal, but plaintiff (appellant) should get costs in courts below.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed so far as relates to the smaller of the two notes of the 20th July, 1897, but that we ought to reverse it with respect to the claim upon the other note.\nThe question is one of some nicety, depending on the construction of a deed dated the 15th September, 1898, between the Banque du Peuple and the respondent.\nAt the date of this deed the Banque du Peuple held two notes made by defendant, one for $18,772.17. and the other for a smaller sum, both made the 20th July, 1897, and both payable with interest at 6%, eighteen months after date; and for the largest note they held as security 150 shares of Dominion Cotton Co. stock, and 200 shares of Duluth Railway Co. stock, with power of sale on default. The larger note was for an advance made by the bank to the respondent of money wherewith to purchase the cotton shares.\nWhile these notes had still about four months to run the dealing now in question took place.\nIt is in the form of a deed acknowledged before a notary. The parties to the deed are the bank and the respondent, and also a Mr. Vinet. The description of the bank as party appearing is expressed as follows:\u2014The Banque du Peuple represented in these presents by Mr. Dufresne, its cashier, in virtue of a resolution of its Board of Directors at a meeting of the ninth instant, hereto annexed.\nThe deed goes on to say:\u2014As the result of a compromise between the parties, Vinet has this day paid in discharge of Brault to the bank a sum of $15,000 which it had advanced to him to acquire 150 shares of the Dominion Cotton Co., and the bank, which was guaranteed the repayment of its advance by the transfer which had been made to it of the said 150 shares, has this day transferred to Vinet the same shares. And by this act Brault is discharged towards the bank from the advances which it had made to him of the character aforesaid mentioned in a deed of settlement passed * * * the 24th July, 1897, to which the parties refer for the application or reduction of the sum, and Vinet becomes the new creditor of Brault on the following conditions, to the extent of $15,000 secured by the transfer of the said shares which takes effect from the first instant.\nThe remainder of the deed concerns Brault and Vinet alone and has no bearing on the question in the appeal except in declaring that the shares were to be regarded as worth par.\nThe judgment declares that upon the true construction of this deed the bank has discharged Brault from the full amount of the note, whereas the appellant contends that the discharge is limited to the sum of $15,000, and that he, as assignee of the bank, is entitled to recover the difference.\nNow unless it is made perfectly clear that the bank has released the respondent by this deed the appellant must succeed, for there is absolutely nothing else in evidence favouring that conclusion, and everything outside of the deed favours the contrary view. Some of these last circumstances may be noticed. The debt was represented by a note not yet due, which remained in the possession of the bank for more than a year afterwards, without objection or demand by Brault. The bank held as security, besides the 150 shares of the Cotton Co., 200 \"Duluth\" shares and these were left and continued in the name of the bank for more than a year afterwards, without any complaint or demand of transfer by Brault. The deed makes no provision whatever for delivering up of the note or the transfer of the shares to him.\nThen let us see whether the deed, while it does not in terms discharge the note or provide for the re-transfer of the shares, clearly releases the defendant beyond |15,000.\nThe first thing to be noted is that the resolution of the directors of the bank is referred to in the deed as being annexed (ci-jointe), and is therefore to be regarded as part of the deed. That resolution authorizes the cashier on the receipt of $15,000 from Vinet to transfer to him the 150 shares of \"Cotton\" stock, held by the bank as security from Brault, in such a manner that Vinet shall become the creditor of Brault, and that Brault shall be discharged to the bank to the amount of the said sum of $15,000, \"telle qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9e\" in a deed of 24th July, 1897, and this present transfer being more particularly expressed in a draft deed approved by the counsel of the bank and which is to be signed by the bank and Vinet and Brault. The resolution further authorizes the cashier in order to complete the business, so far as con- cerned Mr. Brault, to transfer to Vinet in the name of the bank the 150 shares of \"Cotton\" stock.\nThis resolution is signed by the president, and . professes to have been passed at a meeting at which five other directors were present. The draft deed referred to is the deed in question, which was in fact prepared by Brault some time before, and was approved of by the bank's counsel.\nIt is quite plain that what the board intended to do, and to authorize their cashier to do, was to discharge Brault only to the extent of $15,000. There is no sum of $15,000 mentioned in the deed of 24th July, 1897, and I therefore read \"telle qu'enonc\u00e9e\" as intending to say that the $15,000 to be released was part of the money mentioned in that deed.\nBut then there is the reference to the draft deed, which is the very deed in question, and which now requires consideration. The deed says that, as the result of what had been agreed, Brault is discharged to the bank of the advances, which it has made to him, of the character or for the purpose aforesaid, (that is, as I understand the words \"du chef susdit,\" for the purpose of buying the \"Cotton\" shares), mentioned in the deed of 24th July, 1897,\nauquel les parties referent pour l'imputation de la somme, et M. Vinet devient le nouveau cr\u00e9ancier de M. Brault aux conditions ci-apr\u00e8s jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de quinze mille dollars garanties par le transporte des dites actions.\nReading these words, and omitting all but the substantial governing words, they read thus:\u2014By this transaction Brault is discharged from the advances mentioned in the deed of 24th July, to which the parties refer for the deduction of the sum, and Vinet becomes the creditor of Brault to the extent of $15,000. That is, the words to the extent of $15,000 qualify not merely the words immediately preceding them, but also the words, Brault is discharged from the advances mentioned. The deed of 24th July is to be referred to for the deduction of the sum. What sum? Evidently the sum which was to be discharged, as well as the sum for which Vinet was to become the new creditor of Brault.\nThe language of the deed is obscure, but when studied and applied to the circumstances, may and ought to be read as above. Reading it in that manner makes it consistent with the clearly expressed intention and purpose of the directors of the bank, as expressed in the resolution, and also with the conduct of the parties at the time and for more than a year afterwards.\nAppeal allowed in part without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Martineau & Delfausse.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Lamothe & Trudel.\n[1] 30 Can.

While the action was pending and before judgment on the merits, she was married a second time to Albert Duguay, one of the respondents, became common as to property with him under the law respecting legal community, and she and her second husband were subsequently appointed joint-tutors to the minor children. An admission was filed after this appeal had been inscribed for hearing in this court setting out these facts as follows:\nLe dit Albert Duguay et la dite Dame L\u00e9ocadie V\u00e9zina, la demanderesse personellement pour la part reclam\u00e9e par la demanderesse et en leur qualit\u00e9 de tuteurs conjoints aux dits enfants mineurs, ont duement repris l'instance en cette affaire, et, par jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure en date du 20 novembre, 1905, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 duement autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 reprendre la dite instance et a la poursuivre d'apr\u00e8s les derniers errements.\nBy the judgment of the Superior Court, the action was maintained and the defendants were adjudged and condemned to pay to the plaintiffs, personally, damages in the sum of $300 for the female plaintiff personally, and in the sum of $2,700 to the plaintiffs in their capacity of joint-tutors to the children. This judgment was affirmed by the court of review.\nAt the hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada, an objection, not taken in the factum nor raised in the courts below, was for the first time urged by the appellants, that, upon her second marriage, the female plaintiff was deprived of her right of action for the recovery of the damages claimed by her personally, that in respect to this part of the action there had been no reprise d'instance in the name of her second husband and that, consequently, the judgment appealed from was invalid in so far as it awarded personal damages to her: McFarran v.

The plaintiff undertook that the hypothec would be discharged, and, in the meantime, permitted the intending purchaser to take possession of the premises, which she did, in 1889, occupying them in the same manner as if she had become proprietor up to the time of her marriage with the defendant, and, subsequently, they had continued to occupy and enjoy the property together, in the same manner as before the marriage, paying taxes and ground rents and making repairs and improvements thereon. The plaintiff brought his action, in 1905, against the husband, as chef d\u00e9 communaut\u00e9, for the value of the use and occupation of the premises during the 18 years-which had elapsed, and, after deducting the disbursements for taxes, ground rents, repairs and maintenance, claimed a balance of $1,688.91, and a declaration that he was entitled to the possession of the property and asked that the defendant should be evicted.\nThe plea set up the facts as above stated, that the plaintiff was still in default, not having caused the hypothec to be discharged, and contended that, under the circumstances, the action for the value of use and occupation did not lie.\nAt the trial His Lordship Chief Justice Routhier dismissed the action, saving to the plaintiff such other recourse as he might be entitled to, and his judgment was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from, His Lordship Mr. Justice Andrews, dissenting.\nThe questions at issue upon the present appeal are stated in the judgment of the court, delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard, which is now reported.\nA. Corriveau K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014De tous les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui du jugement dont est appel, je crois qu'il n'y en a qu'un seul qui puisse soutenir un examen s\u00e9rieux. Les faits de la cause ont \u00e9t\u00e9 resum\u00e9 par Sir Alphonse Pelletier et je crois qu'ils sont amplement prouv\u00e9s; je cite de son opinion en cour de r\u00e9vision:\nEn 1887, Ad\u00e9line Boivin, alors fille majeure et commercante, entra en pourparlers avec le demandeur pour acheter un terrain avec maison dessus construite, situ\u00e9e coin des rues Arago et Sauvageau et faisant partie du lot No. 376 du cadastre officiel pour la paroisse St. Sauveur de Qu\u00e9bec. Un acte \u00e0 cet effet fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le notaire Leclerc et par lequel acte le demandeur vendait le dit terrain et b\u00e2tisse pour la somme de $800, dont $400 comptant et les autres $400 payables $100 par ann\u00e9e.\nN\u00e9anmoins l'acte ne fut pas sign\u00e9 ce jour-l\u00e0, le notaire ayant d\u00e9couvert qu'il y avait une hypoth\u00e8que affectant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. comme le demandeur vendait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 claire d'hypoth\u00e8que, le notaire avisa sa cliente de ne pas signer l'acte tant que l'hypoth\u00e8que ne serait pas radi\u00e9e. Il fut convenu que le demandeur verrait \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre l'hypoth\u00e8que. Mais du consentement du demandeur, Ad\u00e9line Boivin prit possession de la maison, en mai 1889, et l'a toujours occup\u00e9e comme propri\u00e9taire seule jusqu'\u00e0 son mariage, et en 1895 avec le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9fendeur, et tous deux depuis le dit mariage ont occup\u00e9 et occupent encore la dite maison.\nLa dite Ad\u00e9line Boivin dit dans son t\u00e9moignage que plusieurs fois avant son mariage, qu'elle est all\u00e9e chez le demandeur pour finir le contrat, mais qu'il n'a jamais voulu rien faire et m\u00eame la recevait mal et que depuis ce temps \u00e0 venir jusqu'\u00e0 la poursuite en cette cause, environ 17 ans, le demandeur ne lui a jamais rien demand\u00e9 au sujet de la dite maison, et qu'elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'occuper avec son mari comme propri\u00e9taires, qu'elle a pay\u00e9 les taxes et les rentes sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qu'elle a fait des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 la maison pour environ $600, sans que le demandeur ait jamais rien fait ni r\u00e9claim\u00e9.\nCes faits n' \u00e9tablissent pas les relations de locateur et locataire; ils d\u00e9truissent enti\u00e8rement la pr\u00e9somption d'usage et d'occupation \"par simple tol\u00e9rance du propri\u00e9taire,\" consacr\u00e9e par l'article 1603 du Code Civil. Cette pr\u00e9somption est r\u00e9pouss\u00e9e par le fait avanc\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 et admis par l'appelant que l'occupation, ou pour mieux dire, la possession, r\u00e9sultait des relations de vendeur et acheteur. L'ap- pelant all\u00e8gue m\u00eame dans sa d\u00e9claration que le d\u00e9fendeur et son \u00e9pouse\nont occup\u00e9, g\u00e9r\u00e9 et administr\u00e9 la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour et au nom du demandeur.\nC'est donc une action en reddition de compte qu'il aurait d\u00fb intenter ou peut-\u00eatre encore une action ex vendito pour le recouvrement du prix de vente et des int\u00e9r\u00eats, en lui faisant, l'offre d'un titre clair de toute hypoth\u00e8que. La jurisprudence est constante dans ce sens.\nD'abord la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec: Parent v. Oisel([1]), 1883, McCord J.; Letang v. Donohue([2]). Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause la cour sup\u00e9rieure, Routhier J., et la cour de r\u00e9vision, Langelier et Pelletier JJ., Andrews J. diff\u00e9rant, sont d'accord avec cette jurisprudence.\nL'article 1608 du Code Civil a \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9 de la loi anglaise, en 1853, par la 16e Vict. ch. 200, secs. 1 et 15; r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9, en 1855, par 18 Vict. ch. 108, sec. 16; en 1860, par les S.R.B.C. ch. 40, sec. 16. Or la jurisprudence anglaise est aussi formelle dans le m\u00eame sens. Right v. Beard([3]), 1811; Winterbottom v. Ingham([4]), 1845. Qu'il nous suffise de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ce que Lord Denman C. J. disait dans cette derni\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce:\nA question of considerable importance, and likely to be of frequent occurrence, is involved in this case; whether one who contracts for the purchase of landed property, but is prevented from completing the purchase by the vendor's failing to make a good title, is liable to the latter in an action for use and occupation, in respect of the time of his holding in the expectation that such good title would be made and the purchase completed. * * The defendant certainly was considered both by himself and the plaintiff as purchaser, not as tenant; and the plaintiff cannot convert him into an occupier, liable to pay for his occupation, by his own wrongful act in not completing the contract of sale. * * Admitting the defendant's occupation and the plaintiff's permission to occupy, we think a negative must be put on his third proposition, that the defendant promised to pay, because both parties understood that he made no such promise. Parties may easily secure themselves by stipulating for the event of a non-completion of the purchase in their contract of sale and purchase.\nSi l'appelant se trouve aujourd'hui dans une position embarassante, il n'a de reproche \u00e0 faire \u00e0 personne, except\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. Apr\u00e8s 1887, il ne s'est aucunement occup\u00e9 de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il laissa enti\u00e8rement entre les mains des d\u00e9fendeurs pendant au del\u00e0 de 17 ans; il fuyait m\u00eame son acheteuse lorsqu'elle le recherchait pour en finir. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action qu'il s'avisa de demander la quittance et la radiation de l'hypoth\u00e8que qui la grevait, bien que l'acte d\u00e9clare que l'argent avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 avant sa passation, sans cependant dire quand. Il a produit cette quittance au dossier. Pourquoi? C'est ce que je ne puis m'expliquer, si les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient simplement des locataires ou occupants.\nAvec ces observations, qui d\u00e9finissent les motifs qui nous engagent \u00e0 confirmer le jugement de la cour de r\u00e9vision, confirmant celui de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, nous renvoyons l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Apollinaire Corr\u00edveau.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Fitzpatick, Taschereau, Roy, Cannon & Parent.\n[1] 9 Q.L.R. 135.\n[2] 2 Rev. de Jur. 276.

The whole of the embankment was built on the natural surface, which consisted, as afterwards discovered, of a lair of sandy loam of three or four feet in depth resting upon clay subsoil. No borings or other examinations were made in order to ascertain the nature of the subsoil and the road-bed remained for a number of years without shewing any subsidence except such as was considered to be due to natural causes and required only occasional repairs; the necessity for such repairs had become more frequent, however, for a couple of months immediately prior to the accident which occasioned the injury complained of. Water, coming either from the berm-ditch, or from a natural spring formed beneath the sandy loam, had gradually run down the slope, lubricated the surface of the clay and, finally, caused the entire embankment and sandy lair to slide-away about the time a train was approaching, on the evening of 20th September, 1904. The train was derailed and wrecked and the engine-driver was killed. In an action by his widow for the recovery of damages,\nHeld, that in constructing the road-bed, without sufficient examination, upon treacherous soil and failing to maintain it in a safe-and proper condition, the railway company was, prima facie, guilty of negligence which cast upon them the onus of shewing that the accident was due to some undiscoverable cause; that this onus was not discharged by the evidence adduced from which inferences merely could be drawn and which failed to negative the possibility of the accident having been occasioned by other causes which might have been foreseen and guarded against, and that, consequently, the company was liable in damages.\nJudgment appealed from affirmed, following The Great Western Railway Co. of Canada v. Braid (1 Moo. P.C. (N.S.) 101).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, which had maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the widow of the engine-driver of one of the company's freight trains, who was killed in the accident described in the head-note, to recover damages in consequence of his death, caused, as alleged, by the negligence of the railway company in failing to construct and maintain their permanent way, at the place where the accident occurred, in a safe and proper manner. The action was brought in her own name, personally, and as tutrix of her minor children, issue of her marriage with the , deceased. At the trial, by Mr. Justice Pelletier without a jury, judgment was entered for the plaintiff for $4,000, of which $2,000 was awarded as personal damages to the widow and the balance, $2,000, as damages found in favour of the children. This judgment was affirmed on appeal by the judgment now appealed from, Boss\u00e9 and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nThe questions at issue upon this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nStuart E.G. for the appellants.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. for the respondent.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appeal is dismissed with costs. I concur in the opinion of my brother Davies. DAVIES J.\u2014This action was brought by the representatives of the locomotive engineer of one of the appellants' trains who was killed in an accident which took place on the appellants' railway line near Chicoutimi, in the Province of Quebec, on the 20th September, 1904.\nThe railway runs along the western slope of the lands descending to the Saguenay River, and at and in the neighbourhood of the place where the accident occurred the country is very hilly.\nAt the place in question the rails followed a curve on an embankment built on the side of a hill, the hill having been partially cut down or into and the material used to form the embankment. The railway runs practically north and south, and at the place where the accident occurred the grade is represented as being very steep, one and a half per cent, or 78.2 feet to the mile. The road was constructed in 1893, and, according to the evidence of the engineers, was well constructed and generally of a high grade.\nShortly after the accident Mr. Vall\u00e9e, the inspecting railway engineer for the Province of Quebec; Mr. Hoare, C.E., who was the chief engineer of the railway at the time of its construction in this locality, and Mr. Evans, C.E., who was the contractors' engineer at the time of the construction of the road, visited the scene of the accident at the defendant company's request. As stated in the factum of the defendant (appellant), these gentlemen examined the locality carefully, took measurements and made a plan which was produced as Exhibit D 3. As this plan gives a better idea of the situation than any language I could use can do, I have had it reduced so as to accompany and explain these my reasons for judgment. [Page 636]\nIt is common ground between both parties that the entire embankment had been built upon the original surface of the soil on the slope of the hill and that for a depth varying from three to four feet this natural hill surface was composed of sand or sandy loam lying upon a clay bed or bottom, that water had entered into this sandy loam and percolating or running down the slope had lubricated the clay on which the embankment and the layer of sandy loam rested, causing the entire embankment and ledge of sand to slide down into the valley, of course carrying the rails with it.\nThere was some discussion as to whether the landslide had taken place before or when the train was actually on the embankment, but that point did not seem to make any difference in the determination of the issues to be decided.\nThe real question was as to where the water which caused the slide came from, and whether the company should be held liable for its presence underneath the embankment at the locality in question.\nThe plaintiff contended that the evidence all shewed that this water, which undoubtedly caused the accident, came from the upper or higher lands and percolated either through or alongside of the ditch constructed along the line to carry off the water, down through the three or four feet of sandy loam to the clay beneath, which ditch they contended was not kept clean and clear for months preceding the accident.\nThe defendant company, on the other hand, contended that this ditch was along a steep slope; that it was always kept clear and open and carried away the surface water, and that the water which caused all the damage came from a hidden spring on the edge of the clay bed underlying the sand ledge and directly underneath the bottom of the ditch at a distance vertically of about three or four feet. The land slide which carried away the embankment with the rails and also the ledge of sand forming the original and natural surface of the soil, left a little triangular corner of this sand ledge intact, of which a vertical line from the ditch to the spring formed one side of the triangle so left.\nThe first question to be determined in a case of this kind is whether a presumption of negligence or imperfect construction or maintenance arises from the admitted or proved facts. On this point I have no hesitancy in saying that it does, a conclusion reached alike by the majority judgment appealed from as by the minority judges who dissented.\nIn the Great Western Railway Go. of Ganada v. Braid ([1]), the Judicial Committee, in delivering judgment, say, at p. 116:\nThere can be no doubt that where an injury is alleged to have arisen from the improper construction of a railway the fact of its having given way will amount to prim\u00e2 facie evidence of its insufficiency, and this evidence may become conclusive from the absence of any proof on the part of the company to rebut it.\nFor us, this statement of the law must be held as conclusive, unless called in question by some subsequent decision of that judicial body or of the House of Lords. Other authorities on the subject are collected in a note to 601a of the 9th edition of Story on Bailments.\nIf this is the law we have then to determine whether the company has met the onus cast upon it. I do not think it has. The engineers called by them do certainly speak of the land-slide having disclosed the existence of what they call a spring lying about three or four feet below the ditch, and express their opinion that the water which caused the trouble came from this spring. But nowhere do they use any language from which any conclusion can be drawn as to the character of this spring or the quantum of water which flows from it. Whether that quantity made a respectable stream or was a tiny trickle only is not stated. The evidence on this point is extremely defective, and, moreover, their opinion is reached apparently by a process of exclusion and on the assumption that the drainage was excellent and carried off all the surface water.\nMr. Vall\u00e9e, in his evidence, says, at that particular place:\nI do not believe that five per cent. of the water could filter into the sand in a slope of a foot and a half per hundred if there were good ditches, perfectly cleared, with a slope of a foot and a half per hundred.\nThe other engineer's evidence was based upon similar assumptions,\ngood ditches, perfectly cleared, with the slope of a foot and a half per hundred.\nBut where was the evidence of these facts? The man who knew most about them, foreman of the section-men on this section of the railway, and who had been such for years, Harry Fox, left the company almost immediately after the accident, it is said because of insufficient wages, and crossed the international boundary line into the State of Maine. He was not examined either by commission or at the trial, and we are without the benefit of his testimony. It certainly was not suggested in this court that the company or its officials had anything to do with his removal to the United States, but it is most unfortunate for the company, if he could support their contention on this crucial point, that his evidence was not forthcoming.\nThe other evidence on this point is given by one Tremblay, Harry Fox's predecessor as foreman of the section-men; two of the section-men, Truchon and Larouch, and Michael Carpenter, the road-master of 150 miles of the railway, including the place in question. The latter witness certainly did state that he passed over the place about a week before, inspecting the road, both in a hand-car and walking, and found the road at the place of the accident in\ngood condition, ditches in good condition, * * water running very nicely but very little, * * (and that) there was nothing to attract or which did attract his attention.\nAs against this general evidence there was that of the ex-foreman, Tremblay, who swore that, when he-was section-foreman, about two years after the completion of the line, he found the water oozing through the slope of the embankment under the railway at the place where the accident happened, and for. its protection sunk down some pickets and piled up some railway ties inside them so as to protect the dump, and enlarged it some two or three feet, and then opened up, cleaned and straightened the ditch leading to the culvert, after which he says that for years, and while he kept the ditch open and clear, there was no further trouble. Truchon, the section-labourer, said that the ditch must be cleared every spring, but that they did not clear it the spring of the accident year, but simply \"broke the ice on the surface.\"\nHe was a witness called and examined by both sides, and was vigorously attacked by the company's counsel as being stupid, but his credibility seems to have been accepted by the trial judge, who makes no remark upon his alleged stupidity. Accepting the plan put in evidence by the defendant company and prepared and signed by Mr. Evans, C.E., and Mr. Vall\u00e9e, chief engineer of the Department of Railways of Quebec, after a careful examination of the locality immediately after the accident, for the very purpose of making such plan, as being accurate and correct, it does seem to me that, as the ditch which was to carry off all the water descending from the higher lands upon the railway appears to have been made right over the ledge of sandy loam on which the embankment was constructed, the greatest possible vigilance would be required to keep that ditch in perfect working order. Any imperfection in it or any stoppage of it would probably result in the water it accumulated filtering down through the sandy loam to the clay below. The onus of shewing that such did not take place has not in my opinion been discharged. The placing of such an embankment over such a seam of sand overlying a bed of clay on a hill-side such as this would seem to call for extreme vigilance so as to prevent the surface water from the higher lands percolating through the sand to the clay and so causing a land-slide.\nIt was suggested by Mr. Stuart that the plan so prepared for and at the request of the company, and put in evidence by them, is inaccurate and misleading in that it does not correctly shew what he suggested was the fact, that the clay bed on which the sand loam strata rested stopped short at the place where the spring is marked, and did not go further up the hill, which he suggested, above that point, was composed of sand. He called special attention to the evidence of Doucette, the present chief engineer of the road, who stated that the cut in the hill immediately-above was about twelve feet deep, and that no clay shewed in that cut. The inference he wished us to draw was that the clay bed stopped some four feet or more below the bottom of the hill-cutting, and that the contractors of the road had no reason to suspect its existence. Assuming that to be the case, he strenuously contended that they were not obliged by boring or otherwise to ascertain the true nature of the foundations on which they built the embankment on this steep hill-side, but were justified in assuming them to be as shewn upon the surface. Without entering further into a discussion of this very interesting legal question, it is sufficient for us to point out that the plan in question was prepared just after the accident, under conditions which enabled the draftsmen to ascertain with absolute accuracy just where the clay bed did lie, and its extent with reference to the cutting above and the embankment; that Mr. Evans stated explicitly that\nit correctly represented the condition of things which he found,\nand that it was put in evidence by the defendant company as correctly representing those conditions, and their expert engineers, in giving their opinions as to whether the company could have foreseen that such an accident was liable to happen as did happen, were asked to do so on the assumption that the plan correctly represented the true condition of things. Not a, suggestion was made at the trial as to any inaccuracy in the plans with respect to this clay bed or otherwise, and to ask the court of appeal to assume that the plan is misleading in this important particular and to draw the inference that the clay bed did not underlie the sandy loam on the hill-side except at a distance down undiscoverable by the construction of the road unless by borings, is, in my opinion, asking what this court would not be, justified in doing, more especially in the face of ex-foreman Tremblay's evidence as to the soakage of the surface water through the embankment some two years after construction and the means which he then successfully resorted to in order to overcome the difficulty and danger.\nThe suggestion that the water which caused the damage may have come from the alleged hidden spring loses a great deal of its force from the absence of any evidence as to the size, capacity of or flow from the spring.\nIt does not satisfy the onus which lay upon the plaintiff, it disproves neither negligence in the original construction or in the proper maintenance of the road-bed under its peculiar and hazardous construction, and it leaves the question of the actual condition of the drains at least open and in grave doubt, and even if accepted as a partial explanation does not negative the fair inference to be drawn from the facts that at least a substantial portion of the water which caused the damage was surface water which filtered through in consequence of defective drainage.\nI do not, after a careful consideration of all the evidence given as to the sinking from time to time of the outer rail on this embankment, while the inner rail, which naturally bore the greater weight of the passing trains, did not sink at all, draw the conclusion that the company's employees should have suspected the undermining of the embankment. Bather I would conclude that this evidence pointed more to \u00a1 the wearing away of the outer steep sloping surface of the embankment from natural causes and called for its strengthening, which appears to have been at- tended to. Such evidence does not indicate to me necessarily or reasonably the existence of any defect which caused the land-slide.\nLooking at the evidence as a whole I conclude for the foregoing reasons in agreeing with the Court of King's Bench that the presumption of negligent construction and maintenance has not been rebutted, and that the company has failed to discharge the onus which under the circumstances the law casts upon it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nI cannot subscribe to the entirety of what is relied upon in support of either of the judgments in the courts below, or I would content myself with doing so.\nThe evidence given by witness Tremblay of what the appellants' foreman, Fox, when off duty, told him, seems to be quoted in each court below as supporting respondent's case. It seems to me that this evidence was not properly admitted, and I discard it entirely in coming to the conclusion I do.\nAs to the expression used by Fox when engaged on the work, I think it neither adds to nor detracts from the weight of evidence either way, and, therefore, am not concerned to determine whether it was properly admitted or not, though I am inclined to think it was not admissible in the connection, and for the purpose it was presented.\nThere is much in the case to support the view that there was negligence in the construction of the road in question, at the point now giving rise to many curious considerations. I am unable to see how a railroad can be held to have been constructed without negligence if its road-bed is rested on a hill-side covered by a bed of sand or sandy loam, or both, and requiring artificial embankments along the side of the hill to make that road-bed wide enough to lay a track upon; and yet no attention paid by the contractors or engineers in charge to the thickness of the sand or nature of the sub-stratum upon which this bed of sand, or sandy loam, rested, or to ascertain accurately the nature of the foundation whereon they were building.\nAs one result, this bed of sand, when saturated with water, slid off the bed of clay on which it rested, and which by nature was formed, as one would expect, with an inclination towards the river, and thus well adapted when lubricated by the moisture in the sand, to produce such results as we see here.\nIt was clearly disclosed as a result of this accident that the bed of sand or sandy loam was only from three to four feet thick, measuring from the surface of the original soil. This bed, resting upon a sloping bed of clay, was, as I understand it, together with the added embankment, the foundation upon which the track in question rested. It would seem a treacherous sort of foundation to build upon, unless in the course of construction the added embankment was of such extent, weight and material, solidly packed, as to prevent the possibility of the sliding that has taken place.\nTime and use would no doubt solidify and improve such a foundation if care were taken to keep water from undermining it or retarding this process of solidification. No care seems to have been taken to discover such springs or other outlets furnishing drainage from the mountain area above, as one is apt to find in the face of all hills. The shallow ditch in the sand would not seem to have been a proper safeguard against what has been discovered, and what I venture to think ought to have been discovered long ago.\nA road thus constructed may have appeared to be properly constructed. It was not in fact properly constructed, and with due regard to the necessities for drainage.\nIt might be, as in truth it was, used for years without disastrous results.\nAnd if it may thus be said to have been in a sense properly constructed, it would nevertheless call for greater care in its maintenance than in the case of a road-bed known to rest upon a level rock or extended level bank of solid clay.\nWe are left in doubt as to the exact operation of each and all of the manifest causes that brought about this accident. Some may or may not have contributed quite as much as others or as much as we may feel inclined to say when trying to appreciate this evidence and allot to each branch thereof its proper weight.\nSome factors producing or tending to produce such an accident as this in question, may be attributable to neglect in construction. Others may be attributable to neglect of maintenance and repair.\nIt is obvious that either sort of neglect, or the combined effect of both kinds of neglect, must, if found to be the cause or causes of the accident in question, result in-finding the appellants liable. Can there be any doubt, if we accept the evidence of Truchon, that the place where the track gave way had been for at least from six weeks to two months in a dangerous condition? Can any one read his story and doubt that this condition of things was neglected in a way that it should not have been? Can there be any doubt that the sinking of the road-bed and the wet weather were concurrent events? How could any capable man attending to this work have failed to realize that fact? Would a careful, prudent man, fit to be entrusted with such duties as devolved upon this foreman, have been satisfied with what he did, and failed to find, or even to search for, the cause of such repeated subsidences of track as shewn by the evidence if the substance of it is to be believed.\nIt has been urged that Truchon is stupid. It is not urged that he is dishonest. Reading his evidence does not so impress one as to find in the results of his stupidity an equivalent for dishonesty. The utmost extent to which I can find his stupidity yield unsatisfactory results, is that the exact length of time ove: which this defective state of the road-bed in question continued, and the exact number of times when it demanded and got attention, beyond that paid to other parts, cannot be fixed. It is not absolutely essential here that they should be so fixed. There is enough to lead to the conclusion that, though the exact dates and numbers of times and length of time cannot be accurately fixed, yet there was for a considerable time (much too long a time) a continuous want of repair on one spot in this road. It was never properly mended there. No attempt was made to find out the cause. Hence all the efforts were quite unavailing.\nFox was the only man of any sort of railway experience, so far as we know, that saw the place, and we do not know what remarkable things passed through his mind. Truchon was certainly not the only stupid one of that party.\nOrdinary sense would have taught men fit to be entrusted with such work, that wet weather tends to make things soft, and heavy weights placed thereon sink, yet Fox loaded the outside of this sinking bank, when obviously sinking from the effects of wet weather, without trying to find where the water in question came from, or went to. The result is before us.\nWe are asked to sweep aside the facts that are before us, explaining as only facts can, the causes of these results, and substitute, for the facts, the speculation of experts, some of whom never saw the place and the facts, lying open for investigation, and others of whom saw, yet refrained from that thorough investigation that alone can make expert evidence worth anything.\nThese speculations rest upon the existence of the spring discovered by this accident uncovering the clay bed and shewing the spring about two feet and a half directly underneath (if I understand the plan rightly) the ditch that I have referred to.\nIt hardly consists with reason to suppose that a spring of any very substantial size or force could have remained for ten or twelve years undiscovered on a sandy hill-side, beneath only so slight a depth as I have mentioned.\nWhy did it not seek a way out through so very natural a channel for a spring to burst through? And then why not find its way down hill into the ditch? Why did it not do this, as springs usually do under such favourable circumstances, instead of being perverse enough to try and seek a way of its own ten feet (or fifteen, or twenty feet, the plan is uncertain) away, for an outlet?\nDriven to explain suggestions like these, the appellants suggest that the spring only came into existence at the time of the accident, or shortly before, and wrought the destruction of life and property in the way that great land-slides are brought about.\nIf this suggestion had any foundation in the minds of the engineer or engineers who saw it and attribute to it such great consequences, one would have expected them to be able to enlighten us by other appearances than that of a little vein of water, so small that one of them, the only one who speaks of its size,, is unable to give us any intelligent idea with regard to that.\nWe would expect, if this suggestion had been taken seriously, to have found some examination for fissures in the clay, or disturbances in the surrounding earth, that would account for the sudden appearance of such a spring. We would expect such investigation, all the more, because we find such care bestowed upon fissures and disturbances of the earth in other relations that some of these witnesses speak of.\nWith every respect that one can have on reading such evidence, I cannot help saying that I do not find any evidence for such a theory as the coming into existence suddenly of this spring.\nHowever, none of these experts giving evidence have ventured to meet with their theories the case which Truchon's evidence presents. Any of them con-confronted with the substance of his evidence failed to say that their theory would hold good as shewing; the cause of the accident, in face of such assumed facts.\nIt seems clear that this spring, called by roadmaster Carpenter \"a very small stream, a vein,\" was most insignificant, and probably nothing but what, in very wet weather, may be found at any time on the hill-sides. In dry weather probably it had no existence.\nThe state of repair of the ditch seems much in doubt. The evidence is conflicting. It is contradictory. It is clear, moreover, that the foreman thought proper to dump stones and other refuse into this ditch. I must be permitted to doubt how long they stayed there. Something of that kind, happening then, or at some other time, probably accounts for the change in the course of the weepings of this spring.\nInsignificant as I think it was, possibly it had something to do with the supply of the water which softened the bank. It was not, however, the only supply.\nWhen this case is stripped of all these mysterious-suggestions and theories, as I think it must be stripped of them to comprehend it properly, we have the broad fact presented to us that for want of proper drainage this embankment was undermined and the surface of the clay lubricated; hence the accident. We have this outstanding feature of the case, which may be called negligent construction, or negligent maintenace and repair, as one may be disposed to look at the facts.\nWe have, moreover, along with that no mystery, no unforeseen cause, no vis major; for we have had the results of this development holding up a signal as it were for at least six weeks before this occurrence, without attracting the eyes of those whose duty it was to see and observe such signals. I prefer to call this a neglect of repair and maintenance.

H. used the binders with sheets obtained from the other defendants, contrary to the condition. In an action for infringement of the patent,\nHeld, that the condition in the contract with H. imposing the restriction upon the manner in which he should use the binders was not a contravention of the provisions of section 37 of the \"Patent Act,\" R.S.C. ch. 61, in respect to supplying the patented invention at a reasonable price to persons desiring to use it, and that the use so made of the binders by H. was in breach of the condition of the contract licensing him to make use of the patented device and an infringement of the patent.\nJudgment appealed from (10 Ex. C.R. 224) affirmed.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action was brought, under the circumstances stated in the head-note, against the defendant Hatton, with whom the contract had been made, and the defendants Victor Guertin and Henri Guertin as having knowingly and for their own gain contributed to the infringement of the patent.\nThe judgment appealed from, in maintaining the action, directed the usual reference for the taking of accounts, restrained the defendant Hatton from using in any of, the binders purchased by him from the plaintiffs, on the condition mentioned in the contract, any sheets other than those sold by or under the plaintiffs' authority, and, further, restrained the other defendants from making, using or vending similar binders; and, with respect to sheets adapted for use in such binders, restrained them from procuring or inducing persons known to be purchasers of the plaintiffs' binders subject to such restrictive conditions, to use such sheets in plaintiffs' binders.\nMignault K.C. and Perron K.C. for the appellants.\nRaney for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondents never authorized, nor intended to authorize, the use by the appellant of the binder sold to him, save in connection with sheets sold by the respondents. That is clearly expressed by the words\nthis binder is sold and bought for use only with sheets sold by or under authority of the Copeland-Chatterson Co., Limited,\nforming part of the appellant's order, and inscribed in large letters prominently set forth in the inside cover of the binder delivered. The appellant never paid nor agreed to pay such a reasonable price for the patented binder as if bought freed, by the terms of purchase, from this obvious restriction upon its use.\nAn absolute, unconditional sale of a patented article may carry with it unlimited license to use it.\nIf the appellant desired that unlimited right he ought to have bargained for it, and not left it in such doubtful condition.\nThe rights to make, use or sell a patented article are daily subject matter of limitation in regard to time and place and mode of user thereof. So infinitely varied are these that no fixed price or terms can be attached uniformly to all of these modes of licensing the use of a patent right.\nThe patentee and those claiming under him arrange these various rights of user between themselves, and it is not our province to do more than determine whether or not the use has been within or beyond the intention of the parties.\nIf a use goes beyond that which is clearly expressed and permits such user the court enjoins, and if the use is within a clearly expressed intention the court refrains.\nIn each case the duty of the court is to find, as in other cases, the intention from the agreement.\nNo question arises of want of jurisdiction so long as the point raised is one of extent of right to use. Collateral agreements of many kinds involving something beyond this bare issue, yet having relation to, or springing out of, patents in their relation to the uses of articles, may arise and be outside the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court. I see nothing such in this case, and the astute counsel who had charge of the case does not seem to have pleaded it. As to the alleged forfeiture I see nothing to support the contention.\nClearly, section 37 of the \"Patent Act\" has been complied with in every respect, unless we are to find, what is not in evidence, that respondents, having manufactured in Canada and made obtainable for use therein, as they did, the article in question, refused deliberately to permit its use, or its being obtained therefor, for a reasonable price.\nThe Huysman incident occurred after this suit began, and is not pleaded even if available. The evidence relating to it is not definite. It obviously relates to a supposed request to sell one of the articles then being vended, covered by other patents, presumably valid, as well as the use it is said herein to relate to.\nIt is, even if capable of the meaning which I should not attach to it, fully met by abundant evidence. Neither is the long and very extensive dealing of respondents in the goods covered by this patent, restricted, as I am viewing it just now, to the binder part as subject to a separate patent, any evidence of refusal to sell the binder part alone and unconditionally.\nIf parties having a patent see fit to make ten thousand bargains for a limited use thereof with people ready and willing to accept such limitations, that is no evidence that it has become impossible to obtain the unlimited use of the article so patented at a reasonable price.\nThe patentees might have been giving the patented article away, as an inducement to bring about by its use compensation in the sale, at a large profit, of other articles stipulated to be used therewith so long as, and whenever, used. That compensation is no measure of, or criterion of, what might be a fair price to ask for an unconditional sale or other use of the patented article by itself.\nThe price in this latter case would be something so difficult to fix, and needing so much consideration, that I do not think a patentee is to be tripped up and his ruin brought about by such an ingenious device as displayed in Huysman's visit to the shop of the respondent, the invitation to somebody there to meet him, and the interview that followed. It may be said the patentee might from the start have fixed that price. I decidedly think the reasonable price contemplated by the statute is not a thing that must be fixed once and for all during the currency of the patent.\nA patentee might fix, in order to induce buyers to interest themselves at first, a price far below what could be insisted upon by the public as a reasonable price.\nSurely he is not bound to abide by that.\nAnd if by reason of such a situation, never until years after the issue of a patent, (from such causes as existed here) having arisen, he has overlooked this fixing of a price, he is entitled to time to consider.\nIn dealing with the patent as if restricted to the binder alone, or as if separate, I am not to be taken as saying or holding that such is the necessary meaning of this patent under the law.\nI have formed no opinion either as to the validity of other claims set up in this patent and case, or as to the true extent of meaning (in every case) of the word \"use\" in section 37, or many other questions that this case suggests, and in respect of some of which I may, in thus arguing it out, have thrown out tentative suggestions.\nCertainly I do not think that it is desirable to weaken in any way the provisions of section 37. The respondent's property in his invention is the creation of a statute intended for the benefit (by encouraging productions of inventive genius) of others as well as the patentee. Whilst he must be treated fairly, he must treat these others fairly. It is in that spirit I would desire to interpret that section, when, if ever, the necessity for a closer scrutiny of its meaning arises.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Archer, Perron & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mills, Raney, Anderson & Hales.\n[1] 10 Ex.

It may, however, be added, that the river in question, Rivi\u00e8re du Sud, is floatable \u00e2 b\u00fbches perdues, and that the respondent is riparian owner of the land on the side of the river where his mill was erected and opposite which he had placed his boom across the entire breadth of the stream.\nThe plaintiff, by his action, claimed $4,000 for the value of salvage of the defendant\u2019s wood, and of the use and occupation by the defendant for a period of two months, during which the defendant\u2019s wood was allowed to remain in plaintiff\u2019s boom.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Pelletier dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for reasons stated as follows :\u2014\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il est en preuve que le d\u00e9fendeur a, sur la Rivi\u00e8re du Sud, * * \u00e0 2 \u00e0 5 milles en amont des estacades du demandeur, un barrage pour arr\u00eater, et retenir son bois de pulpe;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que ce barrage derri\u00e8re lequel se trouvait une certaine quantit\u00e9 de bois de pulpe appartenant au d\u00e9fendeur et un grand nombre de billots appartenant au demandeur, s\u2019est rompu et que tout ce bois est descendu dans les booms du demandeur et y \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 chercher son bois dans les booms du demandeur;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur n\u2019a fait aucune d\u00e9pense pour re\u00e7evoir et retenir son bois de pulpe et le livrer au d\u00e9fendeur;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que le fait seul que ce bois appartenant au d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et retenu par les booms du demandeur ne constitue pas une obligation de la part du d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019indemniser le demandeur;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019arriv\u00e9e et la r\u00e9tention de ce bois dans ses booms lui aient caus\u00e9 aucun tort.\u201d\nOn appeal, this judgment was reversed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Lacoste C.J. and Ouimet J-dissenting, and judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff for $100 with costs, for reasons stated, in the formal judgment, as follows:\n\u201cVu que les parties en cette cause font sur la Rivi\u00e8re du Sud, chacune pour leur propre compte, l\u2019exploitation et la descente de bois de diff\u00e9rentes esp\u00e8ces;\n\u201cVu que cette exploitation ne peut \u00eatre conduite \u00e0 bonne fin qu\u2019au moyen d\u2019\u00e9cluses et estacades qui doivent \u00eatre construites en pr\u00e9vision des crues des eaux, afin de retenir les bois malgr\u00e9 ces crues;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que ces \u00e9cluses et estacades doivent partant \u00eatre faites, plac\u00e9es et construites de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter leur rupture et l\u2019entra\u00eenment des bois sur les fonds inf\u00e9rieurs;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les estacades \u00e9tablies par le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019ont pu retenir la grande quantit\u00e9 de bois de pulpe qui s\u2019y trouvait, plusieurs mille cordes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9es dans les estacades du demandeur, solidement \u00e9tablies et renforc\u00e9es davantage en pr\u00e9vision de la descente des bois du d\u00e9fendeur;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que ce flot de bois de pulpe constituait un danger pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du demandeur, qui s\u2019en est gar\u00e9 par les travaux susdits;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les estacades du demandeur ont emp\u00each\u00e9 les bois du d\u00e9fendeur de descendre jusqu\u2019au fleuve et d\u2019y \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement, ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s perdus; Consid\u00e9rant que ces bois sont ainsi rest\u00e9s chez le demandeur pendant deux mois et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9s dans ses estacades, d\u2019o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e0 son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019il pouvait le faire;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9fendeur s\u2019est partant enrichi aux d\u00e9pens du demandeur et lui doit compensation pour l\u2019usage d\u2019\u00e9cluses et estacades, dont il a tir\u00e9 profit de m\u00eame que pour les travaux faits en pr\u00e9vision de la descente des bois provenant de la r\u00e9gion sup\u00e9rieure;\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que cette indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas couverte ni pr\u00e9vue par les statuts en vigeur et qu\u2019elle ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie qu\u2019en vertu des r\u00e9gies du droit commun et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\u201d\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and, by cross-appeal, the plaintiff asked that the amount of the judgment in his favour should be increased to $3,000.\nBelcourt K.C. and Turcotte K.G. for the appellant and cross-respondent. The principle of salvage can have no application. Salvage is an act performed, at the moment of danger, to save a thing from destruction, and the word implies the intention of so preserving it. There must be very meritorious and exceptional services to entitle any one to salvage. There can be no question of lease, mandate or negotiorum gestio. Art. 1043 C.C.; 7 Larombi\u00e8re, Obligations (ed. 1885), No. 4, p. 406; 31 Demonlom.be, Nos. 56, 57, tome 8, \u201cContrats.\u201d Mandate and negotiorum gestio are gratuitous. The gestor can recover only his actual and useful expenses which he has incurred specially. He who performs a work for his own advantage has no claim against a third party who may benefit by it.

McLaren ([1]).\nThere is no action de in rem verso; 3 Baudry-La-cantinerie, Obligations, 2e partie, No. 2826, p. 1060.\nThe respondent suffered no loss or expense by reason of Tanguay\u2019s wood being in his boom. Nemo ex alternis detrimento fieri del)et locupletari; Fletcher v. Alexander ([2]).\nThis river is naturally floatable, and both its waters and bed are of the public domain; it is a public highway. No one can place any boom or barrier in a floatable stream and exact toll or remuneration on the ground of services rendered without having been thereto previously authorized by competent authority.

Boissonnault ([8]).\nStuart K.C. and Bender K.C. for the respondent. It is shewn that we have used and maintained the booms which saved the defendant\u2019s wood, with piers planted on our lands, for over thirty years. We refer to the r\u00e9asons of the majority of the judges of the court below, as reported ([9]), but insist that, on our cross-appeal, we should have the amount of the judgment in our favour increased to $3,000, on the evidence.\nThe conclusive answer to the reasoning of the minority of the court of appeal is the defendant\u2019s plea, wherein he not only does not say that his pulp-wood went down into the respondent\u2019s boom as a result of an accident, nor that the respondent is making use of his misfortune to enrich himself, but in which he does say that his pulp-wood went down in the ordinary course of the \u201cdriving\u201d of the river and in the ordinary carrying on of his lumbering operations and in which he directly claims to be entitled to use the respondent\u2019s property without paying for it until such time as the Lieutenant Governor in Council shall have fixed a toll of payment for its use.\nOn the facts in the case the respondent is entitled to compensation, and the appellant has no right to the free use during two months of the respondent\u2019s property, nor to endanger the whole of the respondent\u2019s mills and logs, simply on the excuse that he is in the exercise of his rights in \u201cdriving\u201d the river. No person may occupy the property of another for a period of two months without payment, and, under such circumstances, the question whether or not damage is caused to the proprietor is not relevant except to increase the sum. If the appellant had not made use of the respondent\u2019s booms he would have completely lost his pulp-wood, worth from $15,000 to $18,000; he very seriously endangered the respondent\u2019s logs in the boom, worth some $46,000, and some 36,000 logs were kept back by the appellant\u2019s boom, solely for his own convenience. Arts. 407, 7608 C.C.\nIn addition to the use and occupation, the respondent can recover upon a quasi contract of negotiorum gestio.

The fact that respondent was acting also in his own interest does not prevent the act from being one of negotiorum gestio. Sirey, Code Civile ann.

City of Montreal ([17]).\nThe statute, 55 Viet. ch. 25 (Que.), does not bear the meaning appellant places upon it; all the courts have been unanimous in holding that it did not apply; it, however, establishes the right to compensation for the use of the improvements on the river in favour of the proprietor of such improvements and it does not subordinate that right to the fixing of a tariff by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. It has been held, in interpreting C.S.L.C. ch. 51 (now art. 5535 R.S.Q.), that the common law right to indemnity continued to exist. McGillivray v. McLaren ([18]); Emoncl v.

Bannerman ([24]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court is restored; the cross-appeal is dismissed with costs. I concur for the reasons stated by my brother Maclennan.\nThere is no difference between Quebec and English law on the points raised in this case with respect to the rights of riparian owners to waters of floatable streams flowing past their lands. Miner v. Gilmour ([25]).\nDAVIES and IDINGTON JJ. also concurred for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, of Quebec which, two of the learned judges, the Chief Justice Lacoste and Mr. Justice Ouimet, dissenting, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montmagny, which had dismissed the action.\nThe plaintiff is the owner of a sawmill on the bank of the Rivi\u00e8re du Sud, near its d\u00e9bouchure into the St. Lawrence, and, in connection with his mill, has constructed a boom upon and across the river for the reception and safekeeping of his logs, which are cut in the woods up and along the river, and are floated down to his mill. It is said that this boom was constructed at a cost of about $25,000.\nThe defendant is a manufacturer and dealer in pulpwood, and has also constructed a boom on the river some miles above the plaintiff\u2019s mill and boom, for the safekeeping of his wood, which is also cut higher up the river and is brought down by flotation.\nIn the month of September, 1904, there was in the defendant\u2019s boom a large quantity of the defendant\u2019s pulpwood, it is said about 4,000 cords, and there was at the same time in the defendant\u2019s boom a large quantity of the plaintiff\u2019s logs on their way down to the plaintiff\u2019s boom and mill.\nIn that month an unusually heavy rainfall occurred which caused a flood in the river, the force of which, acting upon the pulpwood and logs, broke the defendant\u2019s boom, and the plaintiff\u2019s logs and the defendant\u2019s pulpwood were carried down the stream until they were stopped by the plaintiff\u2019s boom.\nThe defendant promptly used every exertion to separate his pulpwood from the plaintiff\u2019s logs and to convey it back to his own boom, and this operation was only completed in about two months.\nOn the 5th of December following the plaintiff brought this action to recover the sum of $4,000 from the defendant as the value of the salvage of the defendant's pulpwood by means of the plaintiff\u2019s boom, on the ground that but for his boom the defendant\u2019s pulpwood would have been carried out to sea and would have been lost, or would have cost more in the recovery than it was worth.\nIn the course of his pleadings the plaintiff admitted that in constructing his boom he had not improved the condition of the river as a floatable stream, au point de vue du flottage, which effectually excluded from the case the application of the statute, 54 Vict. ch. 25 (Que.), and the offer of the defendant to pay the toll which under that Act might be fixed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. He also frankly admitted that the defendant\u2019s wood was collected in his boom without any labour of any of his men, and was brought there by the current. He urged at the trial, however, and before us, that, seeing the mass of wood which was coming down the river, he had expended some labour in strengthening his boom.\nThe trial judge, as I have said, dismissed the action, but the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench reversed that judgment, and by a majority of three to two awarded the plaintiff the sum of one hundred dollars. This they did, as they say, \u201cen vertu des r\u00e8gles du droit commun et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\u201d\nBesides resisting the defendant\u2019s appeal the plaintiff has taken a cross-appeal, insisting on his right to the larger sum claimed by him for his alleged service to the defendant.\nI am clearly of opinion that we ought to allow the defendant\u2019s appeal, and to disallow the cross-appeal, and that the plaintiff should pay all the costs both here and below.\nThe reasons of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench are so full and satisfactory that little is left to be said in support of his conclusion.\nI may point out, however, that the shelter which the plaintiff had provided for his logs was not his private property; his boom was stretched across the public floatable river, and we have not to consider what his rights might have been if the defendant\u2019s wood, had been carried down and received into an artificial haven or shelter constructed by the plaintiff upon his own land. The defendant\u2019s logs were lawfully in the river while on their way down, and until they were stopped by the plaintiff\u2019s barrier, and they continued to be lawfully there after they were stopped. They were there quite as lawfully as the plaintiff\u2019s own logs, and for the reason that the water in which they were lying was public water. Beyond all question, that water was and continued to be publici juris, notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s structure. It is true that the plaintiff might have opened his boom and have allowed the defendant\u2019s wood to pass out and be lost. But because he did not do such an unneighbourly act is no reason for claiming the large compensation to which he thinks himself entitled. The plaintiff\u2019s logs and the defendant\u2019s wood having been mixed together, to have opened his boom would probably have been as disastrous to the plaintiff himself as to the defendant. The truth is that the service rendered to the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s boom, although of great value, was involuntary and accidental, and could afford no ground of action upon any principle of common law or equity which has been brought to our attention.\nDuff J. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Bedard, Roy & Chaloult.\nSolicitor for the respondent : A.

A. made an entry for the purpose of removing this obstruction, and re-building a retaining wall to support the bank. In a possessory action by\nHeld, that, as the original boundary had become obliterated, the decision of the question of possession should be postponed until the limits of the canal bank had been re-established. Parent v. The Quebec North Shore Turnpike Road Trustees (31 Can. S.C.R. 556) followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe defendant was proprietor of a mill, operated by water-power, with a canal appurtenant thereto which served as a tail-race for the escape of the water from the mill. The plaintiff was proprietor of lands adjoining and bounded by the canal and was in occupation of a point or mound projecting into the canal, formed there by the falling in of the bank. The defendant made an entry and commenced to clear away the obstruction thus formed in the tail-race and to re-build a retaining wall to support the bank of the canal. The plaintiff claimed ownership to the water's edge, contended that these acts were a trespass upon his property and sought relief by a possessory action, which was maintained by His Lordship, Mr. Justice F. Langelier, in the Superior Court. This decision was reversed by the judgment now appealed from, Tren-holme, J., dissenting, which declared it to be impossible to decide whether or not there had been a trespass until the boundary between the properties of the parties had been established, that the plaintiff had failed in proving the necessary possession, for the year and a day preceding the action, of the strip of land in dispute, and dismissed the action with costs.\nStuart K.C. and Chaloult, for the appellant. L. P. Pelletier E.G. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Le demandeur \u00e9tait probablement en possession de la bande du canal jusqu'\u00e0 l'eau; mais l'\u00e9tait-il \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire? Son propre titre d\u00e9montre que son immeuble \u00e9tait born\u00e9 d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 par le canal du dit moulin. D'apr\u00e8s l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, le propri\u00e9taire d'un moulin, mu par Peau d'un canal, est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire du canal et de ses berges. Sous le code, la jurisprudence n'est pas uniforme; des distinctions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites; mais, comme l'observe le juge-en-chef Lacoste, les d\u00e9cisions contraires \u00e0 l'ancien droit sont rares. L'appellant invoque un arr\u00eat de la cour de cassation du 7 avril, 1880, rapport\u00e9 par Dalloz, Jur. G\u00e9n., 1880, part. 1\u00e8re, p. 215. Cet arr\u00eat ne dit pas qu'un possesseur comme l'appelant a l'action possessoire, mais seulement que le propri\u00e9taire du moulin et du canal ne peut pas l'instituer sans prouver une possession r\u00e9elle. D'ailleurs, l'annotateur observe, notes 3 et 4, qu'une autre chambre de la cour de cassation, la chambre des requ\u00eates, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 tout le contraire par deux arr\u00eats qu'il cite. Dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, la cour d'appel a cru devoir suivre la jurisprudence de ces deux arr\u00eats, et nous croyons qu'elle avait raison. D'abord ils sont conformes \u00e0 l'ancienne jurisprudence, et d'ailleurs me paraissent fond\u00e9s en raison.

Abrath v. The North Eastern Railway Co. (11 Q.B.D. 440) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Quebec([1]), and restoring the judgment of Andrews J, at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe respondents are a company incorporated for the purpose of generating and supplying electric power and light in the City of Quebec, and furnished electric light to the owner of the building, insured by the plaintiffs, which was destroyed by fire said to have been caused through a defect in the defendants' transformer which they had negligently allowed to remain in an unsafe condition so that it broke down and sent a current of 2,000 volts of electricity over the secondary wires by which the building was lighted and which were calculated to stand a current of 110 volts only. The insurance company paid the amount of the insurance, obtained a subrogation from the proprietor of the building and claimed re-imbursement from the defendants on the ground that they had been guilty of the negligence by which the fire occurred in failing to maintain their transformer in a proper condition to ensure their consumers against the consequences of dangerous high tension currents entering on the secondary wires. The defence was that the defendants' appliances were of the best known quality and skilfully set up, and that, if the fire had actually been caused by an electric current, it resulted from the unskilful and improper installations in the building itself.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice Andrews found that the fire was caused by electricity, but that no fault or negligence had been proved against the defendants. This judgment was set aside by the Court of Review([2]), but, on appeal, the judgment of the Superior Court, at the trial, was restored by the judgment now appealed from. The facts of the case are shortly stated in the head-note and more fully referred to in the judgments now reported.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. and L. A. Taschereau K.C. for the appellants.\nStuart K.C. and Lafleur K.C. for the respondents.\nGIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014In my view of this case there is no necessity of passing upon any of the many questions of law (some of them of a most interesting nature) presented to us here for consideration, save the very common-place one that a plaintiff, when his cause of action is denied, must prove his case by evidence that can be relied upon, before he can be held entitled to succeed.\nThe appellant complains that a house was destroyed by fire, started by electric wires, conducting an electric current, supplied by the respondents, to light the house in question.\nThe wiring inside the house was, where at least one fire, or part of the whole fire, first broke out, very defective.\nThe respondents' transformer through which the current was supplied for use by means\" of this defective wiring was found after the fire to be then broken down.\nOne side blames the fire on the defective wiring, and the other on the defective or broken down transformer.\nThe transformer admittedly was of the best make known, and had been well tested before being placed, and had only been in use three years. It is not known how long it might live, but, barring accidents, might reasonably have been expected to serve for seven years longer. . Periodical inspection from day to day, or other short period, would seem from the evidence of appellants' expert witness, as well as the other evidence, to be quite impracticable, that is, an inspection of such character as might have discovered the derangement complained of inside this transformer in question.\nIn their normal condition, these appliances and their connections should have brought into the house a low tension current of only 100 to 110 voltage.\nIt is asserted by respondents that no fire can, in such a place as the wires in question ran,, be produced by such a current. The evidence of respondents' witnesses, however, admits the possibility, and under certain unusual conditions the probability, of fire therefrom.\nIt seems to be admitted, or at least not seriously denied, that once a fire started in this house the result might possibly be to break down the transformer and leave it as found after this fire, though up to the time of the fire it had been in good working order.\nNotwithstanding these respective possibilities arising from the circumstances referred to, in each of the respective conditions relating thereto, we are asked to find that as a fact, in some way or other unexplained, the transformer, working well up to 3 a.m., suddenly broke down and let into this house a higher tension of current than that necessary to serve the house.\nSuch is the problem of fact to be solved by the appellants before they can succeed. And this problem must be so solved as to satisfy us that the solution arrived at is in accord with the evidence, supported by the evidence, and appeals to our reason in such a way as to enable us to find this transformer had suddenly gone wrong.\nThe evidence of the fire in this house being caused by electricity might reasonably be found in this case. I am, however, quite unable, after a most careful consideration of the evidence and all else in the case, to find such evidence as would establish that the fire was caused by a current of higher tension than the owner of the house agreed might be transmitted therein.\nThe contract between the parties was in writing, but that is not produced, and the contents are not proven. We must deal with the case as if the relations between said parties had for their basis an agreed service such as I have adverted to.\nMuch ingenuity was displayed in the argument by suggesting certain presumptions. I think the evidence has not reached that stage at which, on any theory of this case possible on the evidence before us, there can be any presumption that would operate in appellants' favour. If the appellants had succeeded in establishing as a fact upon which we could act that, with the low tension current permissible, the fire in question could not possibly have arisen, perhaps we might have had to consider these suggestions.\nAs the case stands the appellants have not established a prima facie case of any possible cause of action.\nWith such inaccurate data as given here to build upon it would be an impossible task to make even a reasonably fair appearance of a case.\nThe evidence has been so fully analyzed in the courts below, and so fully dealt with in the argument before us, that I see no good purpose to be served by any lengthy exposition of it here.\nMuch seeming strength was given to the appellants' case by the apparent coincidence of a little flame scorching on this occasion a rosette through which the service wire from this same transformer entered another house. To support the appellants' case, such an apparent coincidence ought to have been clearly shewn to have been coincident and taken place immediately before, or simultaneously with, the fire in question.\nWe can only guess at the exact time when the fire broke out.\nThe owner was awakened by a child's cry and found smoke, that indicated fire between a ceiling and a floor, coming through the floor in the child's room. Common experience forbids us accepting the time of this awakening as that when the fire started. If the fire was the result of a low tension current it might have begun in such a place long before the awakening, and remained unnoticed for an indefinite time.\nThis is one of many obvious weaknesses of the case upon which a very ingenious theory has had its foundation laid.\nAccuracy in something\u2014absolute accuracy if possible\u2014is the first essential for a scientific investigation of anything. And in approaching the Solution of a question in which the working of electricity has to be reckoned with, if we cannot find some solid basis of accuracy in time or place or both, we had better leave the problem as unsolved.\nThe appellants' chief expert witness frankly admits he was only sent to find out if the fire had been caused by electricity, and that if he had thought he was sent to build up a case against the respondents he\nwould have taken many more precautions to secure additional evidence then.\nThe appellants' whole case exemplifies this as absolutely true. Doubtless this accounts for many missing links one would like to have seen supplied in order to understand what actually had happened. Thirty to forty other houses were served through this transformer, yet this scorching of the rosette referred to is the only indication of even seemingly concurrent accident. The setting of this rosette was unusually fitted to attract to it the current, and much dispute occurs as to whether its scorching was the result of a low tension current, or a result flowing from the fire in question.\nTo indicate some of the many proofs wanting in this connection, I may say that the doubt as to the order of events in relation to the fire in question, and that developed at this rosette, is such as to deprive the latter circumstance of any possible value.\nEach side in argument seemed satisfied that they had established this rosette fire as before or after (as their interest required) the main fire in question. I find it utterly impossible on the evidence to determine which may be right. Either may be right. I am quite clear the evidence does not satisfactorily establish either view.\nThis scorched rosette no doubt influenced many parties having to deal with this matter from the beginning, including the courts through which the matter has been carried.\nI repeat that owing to the impossibility of determining the time when the fire in the house began, the determination of this point is impossible. In the evidence upon which the appellants' expert proceeded, he says this rosette scorching was only a confirmation of his judgment.\nI rather think it so impressed him that it vitiated his whole attitude to the issue raised.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014Admittedly a condition of the plaintiffs' success is the proof by them that the fire giving rise to the litigation was caused by the introduction into Morissette's house, through the defendants' system, of a current of electricity having a tension higher than 110 volts. The burden of this proposition of fact remained throughout the trial upon the plaintiff, and accepting the contention of the plaintiffs' counsel that proof of the derangement of the transformer was alone sufficient to establish a prim\u00e2 facie case, I am still unable to disagree with the opinion of the majority of the court of appeal that the evidence viewed as a whole is upon this issue inconclusive. In this I am much influenced by the fact, not, I think, open to dispute, that owing to the defective state of the wires and appliances which Morissette himself, to connect his lamps with the defendants' system, placed in his house (and over which the defendants exercised no supervision or control), the house was exposed to the hazard of fire from the ordinary current of 110 volts which the defendants were under their contract bound to supply. In Abrath v. North Eastern Ry. Company ([3]), Brett M.R., said: It is contended (I think fallaciously) that if the plaintiff has given prima facie evidence which, unless it be answered, will entitle him to have the question decided in his favour, the burden of proof is shifted on to the defendant as to the decision of the question itself. * * It seems to me that the proposition ought to be stated thus: the plaintiff may give prima facie evidence which, unless it be answered, either by contradictory evidence or by the evidence of additional facts, ought to lead the jury to find the question in his favour; the defendant may give evidence, either by contradicting the plaintiff's evidence or by proving other facts; the jury have to consider, upon the evidence given upon both sides, whether they are satisfied in favour of the plaintiff with respect to the question which he calls upon them to answer. * * Then comes this difficulty\u2014suppose that the jury, after considering the evidence, are left in real doubt as to which way they are to answer the question put to them on behalf of the plaintiff; in that case also the burden of proof lies upon the plaintiff, and if the defendant has been able, by the additional facts which he has adduced, to bring the minds of the whole jury-to a real state of doubt, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the burden of proof which lies upon him.\nThe facts in evidence leading to this state of doubt I think the plaintiff must fail.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Taschereau, Roy, Cannon & Parent.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\n[1] Cf.

He was struck and injured by a car coming at considerable speed from the opposite direction without, it was alleged, giving notice according to running regulations, by sounding the gong as it was meeting and passing the other car.

The insured died about ten days after a premium was payable and a firm of solicitors acting for his family notified the insurance company of his death, stating in their letter that if the premium had not been paid they would pay it. On the same day the beneficiary under the policy called at the company\u2019s office and saw the secretary who, knowing, the premium was unpaid, told her the policy was all right so far as he knew. The solicitor of the company to whom had been given the letter with notice of the death of insured answered it by requesting that proofs of loss be sent in saying nothing about the premium.\nThe company afterwards set up the non-payment and refused to pay. The beneficiary named in the policy sued and obtained a verdict at the trial. This was affirmed by the Divisional Court, which held that plaintiff was a beneficiary and the company were estopped by conduct from setting up non-payment.

After the work was partly completed a delay occurred of over a year caused by other trades working on the building. When plaintiffs were able to resume work it was found that what they had done was inadequate as the roof leaked badly and the architects instructed them to remedy it, which they were unable to do. They claimed that the fault was in the construction of the roof, the boards being too thin to hold the nails which were to secure the iron covering, while the city claimed that in such case rivets should have been used. Finally the city dismissed plaintiffs and had the work completed by others.\nThe plaintiffs sued for the value of the work done originally and for that done to prevent leakage as extra work, and for other relief. The Chancellor who tried the case held them entitled to both, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Supreme Court held that plaintiffs could not recover for extras as the terms of the contract in respect thereto had not been observed. They held, however, that plaintiffs were entitled to damages for wrongful dismissal and directed that the reference ordered by the Chancellor should include such damages.

Neither the statute nor the judgment referred to sanctions the view that the said will and codicils constitute more than one substitution; there was but one substitution created thereunder in favour of all the joint legatees and consequently accretion takes place among them within the meaning of article 868 of the Civil Code, in the event of any legacy lapsing, under the terms of the will, upon the death of an institute without issue prior to the opening of the substitution. In such case, the share of the institute dying without issue devolves to the other joint legatees, as well in usufruct as in absolute ownership, and, consequently, none of the institutes or substitutes have the right of disposing of any portion of the testator's estate, by will or otherwise, prior to the date of the opening of the substitution.\nJudgment appealed from. (Q.R. 28 S.C. 257) reversed. DeHertel v. Goddard (66 L.J.P.C. 90) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Montreal ([1]), Loranger J. dissenting, whereby the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal (Fortin J.), dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs was affirmed.\nThe action was brought by the appellants, Armand Pr\u00e9vost and Ad\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost (wife of Azarie Brodeur) as co-heirs and beneficiaries under the will of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, deceased, against all other co-heirs,, under the said will, and the respondent, Lamarche, in his capacity of testamentary executor of the last will of Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost (one of the co-heirs) deceased,. for the partition of the share of the estate of the said Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost under the last will of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost. The defendants, other than the present respondent, did not contest the action, and the judgment appealed from was rendered upon the issues: joined by the executor, under the circumstances following. The late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, who died in 1872 leaving seven sons and daughters, made his last will on 26th December, 1844, and subsequently made codicils thereto, the material parts of which are as follows:\u2014 By his last will he gave and bequeathed to the child born and to the children to be born of his marriage with his wife (yet living) the enjoyment and usufruct during their lives of all the property, movable and immovable, of which he should die possessed, his said child and children to be born to enjoy said property in usufruct during their lives, subject to all the charges ordinarily imposed upon usufructuaries, the full ownership of his said property to belong, after the death of his said children or any of them to the children to be born of their respective marriages, and his grandchildren who were thereby substituted to his said children, as regards his said property, to enjoy, use, deal with, and dispose of the same as they may think fit, appointing them for that purpose his universal legatees.\nIt further provided that the revenues of said property should be received by the testator's children for their support and that of their children, and should, therefore, be neither transferable nor subject to seizure by creditors; that the property itself should pass to the grandchildren, and should not be sold even for their greater advantage; and that none of the grandchildren should alienate, incumber, or hypothecate their parts or rights or his or her part and rights in his said property before the extinction of the usufruct in such property bequeathed to his said children, or of the share thereof belonging to the father or to the mother of said grandchildren respectively.\nOne of the codicils contained the following provisions: \"It is my will that if the child born or the children to be born of my marriage with * * * my wife, all die before her without leaving children or legitimate descendants; * * * my said wife shall have, during widowhood, the enjoyment and usufruct of all the property movable and immovable * * * except the land with buildings and dependencies which I have at Terrebonne, which I leave, in such case, to Louis Joseph Pr\u00e9vost, my brother, in full ownership, and as to my other property movable and immovable after the extinction of the usufruct thereof, which I have bequeathed to my said wife during widowhood, they shall return and belong to the said Louis Joseph Pr\u00e9vost and to Dame Edwidge Pr\u00e9vost, wife of Mr. S\u00e9raphin Bouc and Miss Anathelie Pr\u00e9vost, my sisters, if they are living, if not to their children,\" etc.\nIt was contended by the appellants that the said will and codicil should properly be interpreted as imposing on each of the testator's children an express substitution in favour of their children if any, and, in case of death without issue, an implied substitution in favour of the institute's surviving brothers and sisters or their children. The interpretation contended for by the respondent was that the will created as many substitutions as there were children of the testator; that each substitution was in favour of the children of the institute if any, and, failing children, in favour of the brother and sisters of the testator in the event of all the testator's children dying without issue before their mother; that upon the death of Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost (who died without issue, in the State of California, on the 19th of October, 1902), his share was subject only to the contingent substitution in favour of his uncle and aunts and in the meantime remained in his estate. After having held possession of the estate of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, as usufructuaries in common, for about seven years after his death, the beneficiaries executed a deed of partition thereof among themselves by which the said estate was divided into seven separate shares and, since then, the said shares have been separately held and enjoyed by the respective beneficiaries to whom they were so allotted. Doubts having arisen as to the validity of the partition, upon petition of all the beneficiaries having interests on the 9th of January, 1897, a special statute([2]) was enacted, as follows, by the Legislature of the Province of Quebec:\n\"An Act to declare the Partition of the Property of the Estate of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost final and definite.\"\n\"Whereas by his testament, dated the twenty-fourth of December, one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, and by codicils, respectively dated the twenty-sixth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, and the twenty-second day of January, one thousand eight hundred and sixty, received at Montreal before J. Belle and his colleague, notaries, the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, in his lifetime of the same place, merchant, bequeathed to the children born and to be born of his marriage with Dame Rosalie Victoire Bernard, his wife, the usufruct and enjoyment, during their lifetime, of all his movable and immovable property, the full ownership of the said property to belong, after the death of the said children or of any of them, to the children to be born of their respective marriages;\n\"Whereas the said will and codicils constitute a substitution in which the children of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost are the institutes and his grandchildren are the substitutes; and whereas it is especially ordered by the said will and codicils that the real estate or immovables of the testator should pass in kind into the hands of the said grand-children without the children of the testator or even the grandchildren, so long as the usufruct bequeathed to the children should exist, being able to alienate, sell, pledge or hypothecate the same for any cause whatsoever;\n\"Whereas the said late Amable Prevost died at Montreal on the ninth of February, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, without having revoked his said will and codicils, leaving as his survivors his wife, the said Dame Rosalie Victoire Bernard, and seven children;\n\"Whereas the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost was common as to property with his said wife, Dame Rosalie Victoire Bernard, so that the said will affected only the share of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost in the said community and the property personally belonging to him;\n\"Whereas, after inventory was made of the property that was left by the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, his said children and their mother, the said Dame Rosalie Victoire Bernard, proceeded on the twenty-seventh of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, by deed passed before G. M. Pr\u00e9vost, notary, to the partition and liquidation of the said community of property and of the estate of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost; and, by the said partition, all the movable and immovable properties coming to them from their father were divided amongst the seven children of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, his only heirs and legal representatives; \"Whereas the agreements and stipulations of the said partition have been carried out on both sides, and since the said day, the twenty-seventh of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, the heirs Pr\u00e9vost have separately enjoyed the property of the said estate according to the partition then made amongst them;\n\"Whereas, since the said partition, doubts have arisen as to the question whether the said partition was a provisional one, like that between institutes, under the provisions of article 948 of the Civil Code, or whether, on the contrary, it is final, in consequence of the special provisions contained in the will of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost;\n\"Whereas, the said institutes have consulted eminent legal authorities, but their opinions are divided on this point and even, in a non-litigious proceeding, to wit: an application made by Dame Marie Elizabeth Ad\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost, wife of Azaire Brodeur, Esquire, physician, of the City of Montreal, for the purpose of being authorized to expend a sum of money for the improvement of a property which devolved to her by the said partition, the Honourable Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9, by an order in chambers, dated the twenty-seventh of March, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six, ordering the convening of a family council, declared that the said partition was not provisional, but final, that the said legatees, the institutes, were authorized to make it so by the very terms of the said will and codicils, and, consequently, that each institute definitely owned the share of the property bequeathed to him, on the sole condition of delivering it to his children, and that the other institutes have no interest in the property so allotted to one of them; \"Whereas the said order, although it cannot constitute res judicata, causes serious doubts as to the nature, whether provisional or final, of the said partition; whereas such doubts cannot be solved except by a suit at law between the said heirs Pr\u00e9vost, which cannot but be very long and costly, and which would have the effect of dissipating the property of the said succession; whereas the legatees, the institutes, have divided the property of the said estate amongst themselves in a fair and equitable manner; whereas one of them, to wit: Amable Oscar Alexandre Pr\u00e9vost, in his-lifetime of the City of Quebec, superintendent of the Government Cartridge Factory at Quebec, died on the sixteenth of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, leaving minor children, now represented by their mother, Dame Marie Louise Duchesnay, their tutrix, duly appointed in law, in favour of whom the said substitution is now opened, as regards their father's share, so that it is necessary to determine, without delay, the true character of the partition made on the twenty-seventh of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, of the property left by the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost;\n\"Whereas all the testamentary executors appointed by the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost are now deceased, and the interested parties have applied to the courts-to have them replaced, but the Honourable Mr. Justice Taschereau, by an order, dated fifteenth of November, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six, declared that the execution of the said will and codicil were-completed, and that there was no occasion to replace-the said testamentary executors;\n\"Whereas, Edouard Henri Armand Pr\u00e9vost, burgess, both in his quality of legatee and institute, and: as curator duly appointed in law to the said substitution, Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost, accountant, Toussaint Pr\u00e9vost, Benjamin Hector Pr\u00e9vost, broker, and Dame Marie Rh\u00e9a Berthe Pr\u00e9vost, widow of the late Joseph Elz\u00e9ar Berthelot, all of the City of Montreal, being the majority of the legatees and institutes in the substitution established by the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, have, after alleging the facts above mentioned, represented, by their petition., that they are prepared to accept the principle laid down in the order of Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9, as aforesaid, and to acknowledge the partition of the property of the estate of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, as having been final and definite; and whereas it is very important, in order to remove all doubts and avoid ruinous law suits for the heirs, that the said partition of the twenty-seventh of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, of the property of the estate of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, be declared final and definite to all intents and purposes whatsoever; and whereas it is expedient to grant the prayer of the petitioners;\n\"Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislature of Quebec, enacts as follows:\n\"The partition of the property of the estate of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost, in his lifetime merchant, of the City of Montreal, made by and between the legatees who are institutes in the substitution under the will and codicils of the latter, dated respectively the twenty-fourth and twenty-sixth of December, one thousand eight hundred and forty-four, and the twenty-second of January, one thousand eight hundred and sixty, before J. Belle and his colleague, notaries, by a deed of partition and liquidation before G. M. Pr\u00e9vost, notary, on the twenty-seventh of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, is declared to be and always to have been final and definitive; and, accordingly, the legatees who are institutes in the substitution established by the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost are declared to be and always to have been the sole proprietors of the share of the said property which has respectively devolved to them, under the terms of the said deed of partition and liquidation, subject to the condition of handing over such share to their children at their death, as set forth in the said will and codicils; and the children, issue of the marriage of the said late Amable Oscar Alexandre Pr\u00e9vost with the said Dame Marie Louise Duchesnay, are declared to be and always to have been, since the death of their father, the sole owners of the property which devolved to the said late Amable Oscar Alexandre Pr\u00e9vost, in virtue of the said partition.\n\"Nevertheless any of the parties interested may, within two months following the passing of this Act, submit to the Court of Queen's Bench, sitting in appeal, the other heirs being duly notified, the question whether the said partition of the 27th April, 1883, made before Pr\u00e9vost, notary, is final and definitive, which may be done by taking an appeal to the said court by inscription in the ordinary way from the judgment rendered in chambers by the Honourable Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9, in March, 1896, and in such case the parties shall proceed as in a case in which the said partition shall have been declared definitive.\n\"If, by the judgment of the said court, the said partition is declared definitive, the said judgment shall be declared final and without appeal. If the contrary, the said parties shall immediately proceed to a new partition and liquidation according to the ordinary rules of voluntary partitions, each interested party returning to the mass, according to law, all that he shall have received under the said partition of the 27th April, 1883. The partition thus made after the returns shall be final and definitive for all purposes, subject to the substitution enacted by the will of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost.\"\nOn the 23rd of December, 1897, the Court of King's Bench, upon an appeal taken under said Act and to which Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost and the present parties, were parties, affirmed the judgment of Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in the Superior Court and held that the testator had \"bequeathed to each of his children an equal share of his property, and substituted to each of his children the children of the latter, to receive the share of the property which their father or mother would have received by means of the legacy to the latter; that the share of the property accruing to each of his said children had been fixed at the time of the testator's death and defined by the said partition for each of the children, within the language and according to the intention of said will'; and declared the partition final.\nOn the 19th of October, 1902, Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost made his last will in authentic form, thereby bequeathing to Marie Louise Bouthillier, during her natural life should she remain unmarried, an annuity of $1,200 per annum, to be paid out of his estate, consisting principally of the share he inherited under his father's will, and the residue to his brothers, Oscar Pr\u00e9vost, Arthur Pr\u00e9vost, Armand Pr\u00e9vost and Hector Pr\u00e9vost, and his sister, Mrs. Berthelot, or the survivors or survivor of them and to the lawful issue of any of them who might pre-decease him, in equal shares, constituting them his universal residuary legatees in absolute ownership. In his said will he also appointed the respondent his sole executor, extending his powers beyond the time limited by law and authorizing him to sell or dispose of all or any part of his said estate with the powers necessary to carry out, that provision.\nIn the Superior Court, the appellants' action was dismissed with costs by Mr. Justice Fortin, who held that the effect of the will, codicils and the statute, read together, was the constitution of as many separate and distinct substitutions as there were children of the testator, and his judgment was affirmed by the judgment of the Court of Review([3]), now appealed from.\nThe main questions upon the present appeal areas to the correct interpretation of the will of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost and codicils thereto read in connection with the statute, 60 Vict. ch. 95 (Que.); the effect of the partition, and the right of the late Louis Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost, dying without issue, to dispose of his share in the estate of the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost as he did by his will.\nBrosseau K.C. for the appellants. The will and the codicils do not provide for a partition and the whole estate is bequeathed in usufruct to the children and the property to the grandchildren en bloc, without assigning any shares to the children or grandchildren. The usufruct is declared inalienable and unseizable and the will expressly forbids alienation of the property until the end of the usufruct. The property must be delivered to the grandchildren en nature as at the time of the testator's death. The grandchildren are the real legatees of the estate according to the testator's will. Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost could not make a will and dispose of part of the estate which was given in express terms in usufruct to the children, without assigning any share, and in property to the grand-children of the testator. The testator's intention to preserve the whole estate for the grand-children is moreover expressly manifested in the codicil where it is provided that if all the children die without issue, the estate shall revert in usufruct to the widow and in property to the brother and sisters. Here again it is quite clear that the testator wished the estate to remain in the family, and that, in the case of only one grand-child surviving he should get the whole.\nAccording to respondent's contentions, if of the seven children only one had married and had issue, that issue would have received only one-seventh of the estate; and six-sevenths would go to strangers, if the children chose to make wills to that effect. Such cannot be the proper interpretation of the will of the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost.\nThe statute had not the effect of changing the will as to the transmission of the estate. The only matter that it settles is the partition of the property and not the transmission, which will follow according to the will. The words of the first paragraph are: \"And, accordingly, the legatees who are institutes in the substitution established by the said late Amable Pr\u00e9vost are declared to be and always to have been the sole proprietors of the share of the said property which has respectively devolved to them, under the terms of the said deed of partition and liquidation, subject to the condition of handing over such share to their children at their death, as set forth in the said will and codicils.\" The will provides that the property in the estate shall belong to his grand-children without assigning any particular share to any one of them. This general disposition of the estate makes it clear that the intention was that it should contain the clause of accretion. Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost having died without issue, his shares accrued to his co-usufructuaries and to the grand-children.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is based on\u00bb the case of DeHertel v. Goddard ([4]), which was rendered by Loranger J., who states, in the present case, that there is no analogy between the two cases.\nIn the case of Ad\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost v. Berthe Pr\u00e9vost ([5]), on a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that Ad\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost, one of the appellants in this case, had no interest in her co-heir's share, because the partition had been declared. final and definitive, the Court of King's Bench dismissed the motion and maintained the contentions of appellants herein on that point.\nWe also refer to 7 Aubry & Rau, nn. 714, 726 and 22 Demolombe, p. 349, no. 394.\nB\u00e9ique K.C. for the respondent. The statute and judgment of the Court of King's Bench are absolutely decisive. It is quite clear that the legislature intended to set at rest every question upon which judge Jett\u00e9 had expressed an opinion. The summary of his opinion is given in the preamble;\u2014the necessity of removing doubts and preventing litigation, the declaration, in the petition, that the petitioners were willing to accept judge Jett\u00e9's opinion, the granting of the petition; and the safeguarding of the rights of the other heirs by means of an appeal from judge Jett\u00e9's order, put this beyond doubt. One of the questions upon which judge Jett\u00e9 expressed an opinion, was the one in controversy here, viz., Whether or not any substitute had, after the partition, any interest in the property assigned by the partition to the other institutes. This question was answered in the negative, and the Court of King's Bench agreed with him. There is, therefore, res judicata on the point. The statute declares the partition to be and always to have been final and definitive; and accordingly the institutes to be and to always have been the sole proprietors of the property, respectively devolving to them under the deed of partition, subject to the condition of handing over such share to their children, etc. Here,, as in the judgment of Mr.. Justice Jett\u00e9, is found not merely a holding that the partition is final, but a declaration as to the consequences of such finality, that. each of the institutes is and always has been proprietor but that his ownership was subject to the condition of handing over, etc. It is evident, both grammatically, and from the intention evinced by the recitals in the preamble that \"the conditions\" mean \"the sole condition.\" The mere use of the definite article-in connection with the word \"condition\" excludes the idea that there any other condition was contemplated.\nThe intention of the Act was that, as between the institutes, there should be but one final and definitive partition; either the one already affected, or the new one ordered by the Act in the event of the Court of Queen's Bench declaring it to have been provisional. The partition having been declared final, each co-petitioner must be \"deemed to have inherited alone and. directly all the things comprised in his share * * * and to have never had the ownership of the other property of the succession. Art. 746 C.C. Everything, therefore, is in the same position as if the will had specifically bequeathed to Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost the property which actually fell to him under the partition, with a substitution in favour of his children.\nConsider the position of the children of the deceased institute, Amable Oscar Alexandre Pr\u00e9vost. The partition having been final, they must be \"deemed * * * to have never had the ownership of the other property of the succession\"; they must be deemed to have been excluded from the ownership of the other property of the succession. Yet if appellants' contention be well founded, they are entitled to a part of this other property, and perhaps ultimately to the whole of it.\nThe case is concluded by the judgment of the Privy Council in De Hertel v. Goddard ([6]). Reference is also made to Dumont v. Dumont([7]); Joseph v. Caston-guay([8]).; Thevenot-Dessaules (ed. Mathieu) nos. 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006; 4 Mignault, Code Civil, 332.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Je partage enti\u00e8rement le sentiment de Mr. le juge Loranger, qui a diff\u00e9r\u00e9 de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour de revision. Les motifs qu'il apporte \u00e0 l'appui de son dissentiment me semblent si p\u00e9remptoires que je serais dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 les adopter purement et simplement. Mais comme la cause est importante, nous croyons devoir r\u00e9sumer les raisons qui nous ont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, sans cependant r\u00e9capituler tous les faits de la cause.\nEn cour sup\u00e9rieure, Mr. le juge Fortin admet que le testateur, Amable Pr\u00e9vost, a fait deux substitutions distinctes, l'une en faveur de ses enfants comme grev\u00e9s, et de ses petits enfants comme appel\u00e9s, et l'autre subsidiaire, si tous ses enfants d\u00e9c\u00e8dent sans post\u00e9rit\u00e9, en faveur de sa femme comme grev\u00e9e et de certains collat\u00e9raux comme appel\u00e9s. Mais, ajoute le savant juge, ceci a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 en 1897 par un acte de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, 60 Vict. ch. 95, intitul\u00e9\nLoi d\u00e9clarant final et d\u00e9finitif le partage des biens de la succession de feu Amable Pr\u00e9vost.\nLa l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a si souvent modifi\u00e9 les testaments de ses habitants, que depuis longtemps on tient pour constant qu'il n'y a pas de testament qui soit \u00e0 l'abri de ses coups. A cette m\u00eame session de 1897, pas moins de huit testaments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 revus, corrig\u00e9s et surtout consid\u00e9rablement alt\u00e9r\u00e9s. Si les substitutions sont pr\u00e9judiciables aux familles et \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il vaut mieux les abolir, comme on a fait en certains pays, plut\u00f4t que de les laisser \u00e0 la merci de la l\u00e9gislature \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de certains usufruitiers qui trouvent toujours leurs revenus insuffisants pour supporter le fardeau de la vie moderne.\nMr. le juge Fortin et la majorit\u00e9 des juges en r\u00e9vision, sont d'avis que l'effect de la loi Pr\u00e9vost a \u00e9t\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er autant de substitutions que le testateur a laiss\u00e9 d'enfants, chaque part formant une substitution distincte.\nMr. le juge Pagnuelo est d'avis que la port\u00e9e du jugement de Mr. le juge Jett\u00e9, qui fait l'objet de la loi Pr\u00e9vost, est que chaque grev\u00e9 poss\u00e8de d\u00e9finitivement la part de biens \u00e0 lui l\u00e9gu\u00e9e,. sous la seule charge de la rendre \u00e0 ses enfants, et que les autre grev\u00e9s n'ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les biens ainsi attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'un d'eux.\nLe pr\u00e9ambule de l'acte fait en effet mention de ce jugement dans ces termes. Il ajoute m\u00eame que les grev\u00e9s\nsont pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter le principe formul\u00e9 dans l'ordonnance du juge Jett\u00e9, tel que susdit.\nMais quel est ce principe et ce jugement qui Fa consacr\u00e9? Etait-ce le principe invoqu\u00e9 aujourd'hui par l'intim\u00e9, qui n'\u00e9tait pas m\u00eame en jeu? On ne peut pas supposer que le jugement porte au del\u00e0 de ce qui \u00e9tait demand\u00e9, qu'il soit ultra petita. Que demandaient les grev\u00e9s devant Mr. le juge Jett\u00e9 et la l\u00e9gislature? Simplement une d\u00e9claration que le partage qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9tait non pas provisoire, mais d\u00e9finitif. Et c'est tout ce qui fut fait. Les parties comme le juge n'ont jamais voulu pourvoir \u00e0 un cas qui n'existait pas, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du partage, ni \u00e0 celle du jugement ou m\u00eame celle de l'acte de la l\u00e9gislature, savoir, celui o\u00f9 un ou plusieurs grev\u00e9s\u2014ils \u00e9taient au nombre de sept \u2014d\u00e9c\u00e9deraient sans enfants. En exprimant son opinion sur l'effet du partage, Mr. le juge Jett\u00e9 n'a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 et ne pouvait consid\u00e9rer que les circonstances qu'il avait devant lui, savoir, que tous les grev\u00e9s vivaient ou \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par leurs enfants. C'\u00e9tait l'effet imm\u00e9diat du partage que le savant juge avait \u2022 en vue. Il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 plus prudent de s'en tenir aux conclusions de la requ\u00eate des grev\u00e9s et de d\u00e9clarer seulement que le partage \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitif. Peut-on supposer un seul instant que les grev\u00e9s auraient accept\u00e9 un effet de ce partage qui leur enlevait \u00e0 eux et \u00e0 leurs enfants, le droit d'accroissement, si l'un d'eux d\u00e9c\u00e9dait sans enfants avant l'ouverture de la substitution? Ils ont accept\u00e9 le principe du jugement qui d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait que la partage \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitif et non provisoire, voil\u00e0 tout; et c'est ce qu'ils s'empressent de d\u00e9clarer de suite comme la phrase compl\u00e8te le d\u00e9montre, savoir:\nqu'ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter le principe formul\u00e9 dans l'ordonnance du juge Jette, tel que susdit, et \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le partage des biens de la succession du dit feu Amable Pr\u00e9vost comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 final et d\u00e9finitif.\nSi le jugement de Mr. le juge Jette laisse quelque doute sur la port\u00e9e qu'il peut avoir sur le testament de Mr. Amable Pr\u00e9vost, celui de la cour d'appeal n'en souffre aucun. Cette derni\u00e8re cour \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 l'examiner et m\u00eame \u00e0 le casser par le statut que nous venons d'indiquer, 60 Vict. ch. 95. Le grev\u00e9 Rom\u00e9o Pr\u00e9vost \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame un des requi\u00e9rants provoquant cette r\u00e9vision. La cour d'appel a-t-elle sanctionn\u00e9 l'-opinion du juge Jett\u00e9 que les grev\u00e9s n'ont aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les biens attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'un d'eux par le partage? Non, elle a purement et simplement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le partage final et d\u00e9finitif. Comme la teneur de cet arr\u00eat a jusqu'ici \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 l'attention des juges et des avocats, il n'est pas sans \u00e0 propos d'en rappeler le texte:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le dit testateur a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun de ses enfants, une part \u00e9gale dans ses biens, et substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 chacun de ses dits enfants, les enfants de ces derniers, pour recevoir la part des biens que leur p\u00e8re ou leur m\u00e8re aurait recueillie au moyen du legs fait \u00e0 ces derniers, et, qu'en autant, la somme des biens, \u00e9chue \u00e0 chacun des dits enfants, a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e, lors de la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du dit testateur, et d\u00e9finie par le dit partage, pour chacun des dits enfants, aux termes et suivant l'intention du dit testament;\nD\u00e9clare et adjuge que le dit partage est d\u00e9finitif, et qu'il est par les pr\u00e9sentes, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il est d\u00e9finitif.\nL'acte 60 Vict. ch. 95, d\u00e9cr\u00e8te enfin que ce jugement sera final et sans appel. Il faudrait un texte bien clair pour accepter un changement aussi radical que celui sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, et en cas de doute je le donnerai en faveur du testament. Le statut en question ne dit pas cela ni ' express\u00e9ment, ni implicitement. Je suis heureux de le constater, la loi Pr\u00e9vost respecte l'invioliabilit\u00e9 des derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s du p\u00e8re de famille qui dispose de sa succession. Le l\u00e9gislateur le d\u00e9clare d'une fa\u00e7on non \u00e9quivoque et dans le pr\u00e9ambule et dans le texte du statut; il l\u00e9galise tout simplement un partage d\u00e9finitif, qui dans les circonstances \u00e9tait un avantage pour tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, sans changer les dispositions testamentaires ou pour \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis sans modifier l'ordre de transmission de la substitution qu'il avait cr\u00e9\u00e9e. L'acte 60 Vict. ch. 95 d\u00e9clare dans son pr\u00e9ambule que Mr. Pr\u00e9vost n'a fait qu'une substitution en faveur de ses enfants et petits enfants (et non pas sept):\nAttendu que les dits testament et codicilles comportent une substitution dont les enfants du dit feu Amable Pr\u00e9vost sont les grev\u00e9s et ses petits-enfants les appel\u00e9s, et qu'il fut sp\u00e9cialement ordonn\u00e9 par les dits testament et codicilles que les biens fonds ou immeubles du testateur passeraient en nature aux dits petits-enfants, sans que les enfants du testateur, ni m\u00eame les petits-enfants, tant que l'usufruit l\u00e9gu\u00e9 aux enfants ne serait pas \u00e9teint, puissent les ali\u00e9ner, vendre, engager ou hypoth\u00e9quer pour quelque cause que ce f\u00fbt.\nPuis dans le dispositif, section 1\u00e8re, le statut d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que\nle partage des biens de la succession de feu Amable Pr\u00e9vost * * * fait par et entre les l\u00e9gataires grev\u00e9s de substitution * * * est declare etre et avoir toujours ete final et d\u00e9finitif, et en cons\u00e9quence les l\u00e9gataires grev\u00e9s de substitution du dit feu Amable Prevost sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s \u00eatre et avoir toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 les seuls propri\u00e9taires de la part des dits biens qui leur est respectivement \u00e9chue aux termes du dit acte de partage et liquidation, sous la charge de ' rendre cette part \u00e0 leurs enfants, \u00e0 leur d\u00e9c\u00e8s, tel que port\u00e9 aux dits testament et codicilles. Mais si l'un des grev\u00e9s meurt sans enfants, \u00e0 qui ira sa part? Le statut n'en dit rien express\u00e9ment. Peut-il en disposer par testament ou autrement? L'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que ni le code, ni le testament, n'a pr\u00e9vu cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, et qu'il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 l'accroissement. Le testateur ne parle pas d'accroissement en termes formels. Mais le testament de Mr. Pr\u00e9vost, en cr\u00e9ant une seule substitution en faveur de ses enfants et petits-enfants conjointement, qu'il institue ses l\u00e9gataires universels, ne dispose-t-il pas de cette part en faveur des col\u00e9gataires survivants? C'est ce que veulent dire les termes du testament, la loi des substitutions et le statut, 60 Vict. ch. 95, particuli\u00e8rement ces expressions qui se trouvent dans ce dernier document que les grev\u00e9s de substitution seront tenus de rendre \u00e0 leurs enfants, \"tel que port\u00e9 aux dits testament et codicilles,\" ou encore celles qui forment les derni\u00e8res lignes du statut,\n\u00e0 la charge de la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le testament de feu Amable Prevost.\nAssur\u00e9ment lorsqu'un chef de famille d\u00e9clare que l'usufruit de ses biens appartiendra \u00e0 ses enfants et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ses petits-enfants, il n'entend pas que ce legs change de destination chaque fois qu'un enfant ou petit-fils, repr\u00e9sentant une souche, d\u00e9c\u00e9dera sans post\u00e9rit\u00e9 avant l'ouverture de la substitution. Le legs reste toujours le m\u00eame et de m\u00eame effet, c'est-\u00e0-dire, qu'il sera toujours en faveur des enfants et petits-enfants quelque soit leur nombre. Par la force m\u00eame du legs, il y a accroissement, m\u00eame si l'article 868 du Code Civil n'existait pas., Cet article, \u00e0 mon avis, n'est venu que confirmer la position des l\u00e9gataires faite au testament. Il d\u00e9clare en effet: Il y a lieu \u00e0 accroissement au profit des l\u00e9gataires en cas de caducit\u00e9 lorsque le legs est fait \u00e0 plusieurs conjointement.\nIl est r\u00e9put\u00e9 tel lorsqu'il est fait par une seule et m\u00eame disposition et que le testateur n'a pas asaign\u00e9 la part de chacun des co-l\u00e9gataires dans la chose l\u00e9gu\u00e9e. L'indication de quote-part \u00e9gale dans le partage de la chose donn\u00e9e par disposition conjointe n'emp\u00eache pas l'accroissement.\nOn dit qu'ici le legs n'est pas caduc dans le sens de cet article. Pour quelle raison? C'est ce que je ne puis comprendre, \u00e0 moins de d\u00e9cider que le testateur a fait autant de substitutions qu'il y a de grev\u00e9s, proposition que nous ne pouvons accepter. Il n'a cr\u00e9\u00e9, selon nous, qu'une seule substitution en faveur de plusieurs conjointment, par une seule et m\u00eame disposition, comme d'ailleurs le d\u00e9clare la loi de 1897, et alors il y a accroissement.\nJe ne puis concevoir qu'un legs fait aux enfants en usufruit, et \u00e0 leurs petits enfants en propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ne devient pas caduc \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du grev\u00e9, et de son appel\u00e9,. et ce pour leur part, lorsqu'ils meurent sans enfants avant l'ouverture de la substitution. Caduc, du latin cadere, veut dire que le legs, d'ailleurs valide, tombe et demeure sans effet par le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du grev\u00e9 sans enfants avant l'ouverture de la substitution. Sa part accro\u00eet aux autres l\u00e9gataires conjoints, tant en usufruit qu'en propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est la volont\u00e9 expresse du testateur qui l'exige. Personne autre n'est appel\u00e9. C'est la situation que l'art. 868 C.C. a en vue.\nEnfin, lorsque l'on examine les diverses clauses du testament, l'on acquiert la ferme conviction que ce que le testateur voulait c'\u00e9tait avant tout de conserver dans sa famille, jusqu'\u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration apr\u00e8s lui, la fortune opulente pour l'\u00e9poque qu'il avait amass\u00e9e. Les legs d'immeubles sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s insaisissables et incessibles. D\u00e9fense absolue de les ali\u00e9ner est faite aux l\u00e9gataires en usufruit. Les appel\u00e9s eux m\u00eames, c'est-\u00e0-dire, les petits-enfants, ne peuvent pas non plus disposer de leur part ou de leurs droits durant la vie de leurs parents et des autres grev\u00e9s. Je veux, dit-il\nque mes biens fonds ou immeubles de quelques nature et qualit\u00e9 qu'ils soient passent en nature \u00e0 mes dits petits-enfants et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ils ne puissent \u00eatre en tout ou en partie vendus ou ali\u00e9n\u00e9s par quelque autorit\u00e9 que ce soit ni sous quelque pr\u00e9texte que ce puisse \u00eatre m\u00eame sous celui de plus grand avantage de mes dits petits-enfants, car telle est mon expresse volont\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nQue signifie encore la deuxi\u00e8me substitution en faveur des collat\u00e9raux qu'il nomme, si ses enfants meurent tous sans enfants? Aucune allusion n'est faite \u00e0 cette substitution subsidiaire dans le statut de 1897. Il ne para\u00eet pas que les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s cette dis position aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause ou appel\u00e9s, probable ment parce qu'en face du nombre des descendants de Mr. Pr\u00e9vost, on la consid\u00e9rait comme non avenue. Ses enfants existaient tous ou presque tous en 1860, quel ques ann\u00e9es avant sa mort, lorsqu'il fit son dernier codicille et il n'a pas song\u00e9 alors \u00e0 r\u00e9voquer cette seconde substitution, sans doute pour mieux mani fester sa volont\u00e9 de conserver sa fortune dans sa famille.\nComment cette deuxi\u00e8me substitution serait-elle r\u00e9alisable, si les biens \u00e9taient pass\u00e9s l\u00e9galement \u00e0 des mains \u00e9trang\u00e8res? Tous les grev\u00e9s auraient bien pu faire comme leur fr\u00e8re Rom\u00e9o et ali\u00e9ner ainsi toute la succession. Toutes ces dispositions d\u00e9montrent l'absurdit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9.\nIl ne me reste plus qu'ajouter quelques mots \u00e0 propos de l'arr\u00eat du conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de De Hertel v. Goddard ([9]), 1896, qui semble avoir influenc\u00e9 quelques juges des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. J'ai lu et relu cette d\u00e9cision et je dois avouer que la rap- port qui en est fait est si raccourci\u2014j'allais dire vague, il couvre deux pages\u2014que je n'ai pu \u00e0 sa lecture en saisir toute la port\u00e9e. Comme dans cette cause, le conseil priv\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour de r\u00e9vision et celui de la cour d'appel, je suis all\u00e9 chercher des renseignements dans les rapports de ces cours. Le jugement de la cour d'appel ne me parait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9, mais celui de la cour de r\u00e9vision l' est ([10]). Il couvre treize pages et \u00e7a n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans un certain travail que j'ai pu comparer les deux esp\u00e8ces. Bri\u00e9vement, voici ce dont il s'agissait dans la cause de De Hertel v. Goddard ([11]). William P. Christie l\u00e8gue la seigneurie de L\u00e9ry en usufruit \u00e0 Catherine Robertson, et \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 ses deux filles,; Mary et Amelia Robertson, et \u00e0 sa ni\u00e8ce, Elizabeth. Tunstall, qu'il institue d'ailleurs ses l\u00e9gataires universelles en usufruit, pour en jouir par parts \u00e9gales,, aussi en usufruit leur vie durante et, apres leur d\u00e9c\u00e8s,. \u00e0 leurs enfants en propri\u00e9t\u00e9; enfin, au cas du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de-deux d'entr'elles, sans enfants, la seigneurie descendait en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux enfants de la survivante. Cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 arriva. La ni\u00e8ce mourut la derni\u00e8re laissant un fils. Le conseil priv\u00e9, la cour d'appel, et la cour de r\u00e9vision ont jug\u00e9 que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9volue \u00e0 ce fils, \u00e0 l'exclusion de la l\u00e9gataire universelle d'Amelia. Je ne puis con\u00e7evoir comment cet arr\u00eat peut \u00eatre de quelque secours \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Je crois qu'il aide plus les appelants, car il maintient le principe de l'accroissement entre les grev\u00e9s au deuxi\u00e8med\u00e9gr\u00e9; il ne pouvait en \u00eatre question quant aux appel\u00e9s, puisqu'il n'y en avait qu'un seul. Ce qui est certain, c'est que les deux esp\u00e8ces sont bien diff\u00e9rentes. D'abord la succession Christie a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte et l'une des grev\u00e9s est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e avant le code civil. La succession de Mr. Pr\u00e9vost a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte apr\u00e8s. C'est peut-\u00eatre pour cette raison\u2014il n'en donne pas\u2014que le conseil priv\u00e9 tient que\nthe word \"conjointly\" cannot neutralize or control the plain meaning of the words \"in equal shares\" by which it is immediately followed.\nC'est la r\u00e8gle toute contraire que l'article 868 du code consacre. Quoiqu'il en soit, les deux dispositions ne sont pas les m\u00eames. Le fils d'Elizabeth Tunstall n'a pas recueilli les biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par une seule et m\u00eame disposition conjointe, tandis que les appel\u00e9s Pr\u00e9vost doivent recueillir non seulement \u00e0 ce titre, mais encore comme l\u00e9gataires universels. On ne trouve pas dans le testament Christie les prohibitions d'ali\u00e9ner qui frappent dans le testament Pr\u00e9vost, ni les m\u00eames liens de parent\u00e9. Toutes ces circonstances tendent \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre la volont\u00e9 du testateur. Enfin, le testament Christie pr\u00e9sentait une difficult\u00e9 touchant la validit\u00e9 du legs \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9, parce que, disait-on, il comprenait plus de d\u00e9gr\u00e9s que la loi ne le permettait, et cette difficult\u00e9 en a soulev\u00e9 une autre au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 963 du code, qui ne se pr\u00e9sente pas dans le testament Pr\u00e9vost. Sans entrer dans plus de d\u00e9tails, je conclus, avec Mr. le juge Loranger, qui a rendu la jugement de la cour de r\u00e9vision dans la cause de De Hertel v. Goddard([12]), que les deux esp\u00e8ces n'ont gu\u00e8re d'analogie.\nPour ces raisons, nous sommes d'avis d'accorder l'appel et les conclusions de la demande des appelants, avec d\u00e9pens contre Ie mis-en-cause, contestant et intim\u00e9 devant teutes les cours, encourus depuis sa d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Brosseau & Holt.\nSolicitor for the respondent : A.

S.C.R. 546), no reference being made to certain costs incurred by the plaintiffs in respect of several defences which the defendant had abandoned in the trial court. On motion to vary the minutes, the matter was referred to the judge of the trial court to dispose of the question of the costs on the abandoned defences.\nMOTION to vary minutes of judgment as settled by the Registrar.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in this case was allowed with costs ([1]), and the form of the minutes was settled accordingly by the Registrar in Chambers. It appeared by the record that several defences had been pleaded, on some of which the plain tiffs were obliged to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses abroad which had been duly executed. On the trial these defences were abandoned and the sole issue raised was as to the application of the statute of limitations. The plaintiffs were successful in the courts below, but the Supreme Court of Canada reversed their judgments with costs and held that the action was barred by the Yukon Ordinance, ch. 31, of 1890; that being the only question argued on the appeal.\nThe motion was to have the direction as to costs varied, as having been made inadvertently, and that the plaintiffs should be allowed to set off their costs pro tanto upon the abandoned defences, or, alternatively, to have the matter remitted to be dealt with in the courts below.\nChrysler K.C. for the motion.\nEwart K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014After judgment in this case, al lowing defendant's appeal with costs in this court and in the courts of the Yukon Territory, the respondent moved to vary the judgment by directing that the respondent should be allowed to set off, pro tanto, against the costs of the appellant, his costs of the issues raised by the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th paragraphs of the statement of defence, and that the respondent should recover the costs properly incurred by him in the Yukon Territorial Court after the entering of the appeal to this court.\nThe action was upon a judgment recovered in the State of Washington, and the defences referred to are: No. 2, that the defendant was at no time subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that state; No. 3, that he had never been summoned in the action; No. 4, payment; No. 5, that the Washington Court had no jurisdiction over him; and No. 6, that he was only one of several debtors under the said judgment, and so only liable for a proportion of the debt.\nAt the trial the defence was rested upon the Statute of Limitations of the Territory, and that is the defence upon which the defendant has ultimately succeeded.\nNo witnesses were examined at the trial, but the defendant had been examined for discovery, and evidence appears to have been taken on two commissions, one in the State of Washington, and the other in the State of Minnesota, both at the instance of the plain tiffs.\nWe have no means of knowing what if any evidence or other proceedings were taken by reason of the several defences referred to, nor how far the taking of such evidence or proceedings was reasonable or necessary.\nWe therefore refer it to the learned trial judge to direct what disposition should be made of the costs of such evidence and proceedings.\nThere will be no costs on this motion.\nMotion allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Galinski[6]; City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[7]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appeal is dismissed with costs. I agree with the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nGirouard J. also concurred with His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The appeal in this case is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, confirming a judgment of Meredith J., holding that the by-laws of the city and the agreements between it and the street railway company were binding upon the company, so far as the disputes in question in this action were concerned, and obliged the company to continue to pay to the city, yearly, during the term it had acquired the right to operate its street railway in Hamilton, certain percentages provided in these by-laws and agreements upon their gross receipts.\nSeveral subsidiary questions also were raised and argued. One was as to the effect of certain legislation enacted subsequently to the by-laws and agreement which, it was contended, validated these documents, if that was necessary. Another was that the acceptance by the company of the city\u2019s consent to construct and operate a railroad on its streets, in the first instance, and an extension subsequently of the term of years during which they were permitted to operate the road, combined with their uniform practice for many years in paying voluntarily the percentages agreed upon precluded them from now setting up the invalidity of the bargain; and still another, that under the agreement itself they were only bound to account to the city for traffic which originated in the city and not for that which originated in the Township of Barton, even though it terminated in the city.\nIt was not contended by the city before us that the company was bound to account for any traffic which originated and terminated outside of the city limits, in the Township of Barton, but it was contended that for all traffic attributable to the operation of the railway in the city, wherever it originated or terminated, the company was accountable.\nThe authority of The Montreal Street Railway Go. v. The City of Montreal[8] is conclusive in favour of this contention, if authority was needed in its support.\nThe only debatable question, to my mind, on this branch of the case, was whether the company had to account for the whole receipts arising from trafic originating or terminating within the city limits, or only for a proportion of such receipts to be estimated in accordance with the rule approved of by the Judicial Committee in the Montreal Street Railway Case8. I agree with the courts below that they have to account for the whole. The only outside municipality is that of the Township of Barton, and the proportion of mileage of the railway in that township to that in the city is very small.\nThe maximum fares permitted by the agreement to be charged between the city and the company have always been charged by the latter, and, when they extended their line into the Township of Barton, they entered into an agreement with that municipality to carry passengers from that township into all parts of the city for the city rates. Practically they agreed that there should be no charge for the short carriage to the city limits. There is, therefore, no basis for apportionment and nothing to apportion. The charge they make is that for the carriage within the city limits and that only, and the agreement with Barton makes no provision for the payment to that municipality of any percentage. These circumstances entirely distinguish the case on that point of apportionment from that of the City of Montreal.\nI am also of opinion, concurring with the courts below, that all receipts for tickets sold must be accounted for, and that there is no possible means by which any deduction could be made for tickets sold, but alleged not to have been actually used. These receipts are clearly part of their gross receipts.\nAs to the main question argued, namely, the in- validity of the by-laws and agreement so far as they make provision for the payment of the percentage of profits, I am unable to accept the appellants\u2019 reasoning. That reasoning, as I understand it, was that the company and city had no power whatever to contract together, except within the powers specifically given them; that all these powers are to be found in sections 7, 8 and 15 of the company\u2019s charter; and that the general words of section 7 authorizing the city to consent to the construction and operation of a street railway on its streets,\nunder and subject to any agreement hereafter to be made between the council of the said city and the said company,\nwas controlled by and limited to the special subjects on which the city and the company were authorized by section 15 to enter into agreements. The radical defect underlying that argument is the assumption that the company had the power to construct and operate its railway in the municipalities by its charter and that the only control, or anything left to the city, related to the proper regulations of such powers.\nSupport was sought for this argument in the decision of the Privy Council in The Bell Telephone Case[9], but even a casual reference to that case and the language used by the Dominion Parliament in conferring powers upon that company shews how entirely inapplicable it is to the case now before us.\nHere we have the legislature of Ontario conferring a naked power upon the company to construct and operate street railways in the City of Hamilton and the adjoining municipalities on such streets as the company may be authorized to pass along, under and subject to any agreement hereafter to be made between the council of the said city and of the municipalities, respectively, and the said company.\nThe section goes on to provide that the operation of the railway shall be by such motive power as the city council may authorize.\nNow, assuming for a moment, that the language \u201cunder and subject to any agreement\u201d is ambiguous and must have some limitation put upon it, I utterly deny that there is any ground whatever for inserting, as such limitation, the enumeration of powers respecting the construction of the railway afterwards specified in section 15. The two sections had entirely different objects. The naked power of constructing and operating street railways given to the company in the first part of section 7 is subject to the limitation that it can only be exercised with respect to such streets as the city council might authorize and designate and only as to them subject to any agreement to be made between the city and the company. I construe that to mean that the city could impose such reasonable conditions within their municipal powers as they thought fit. I see no reasons for putting limitations upon the power of the city council to impose conditions under which alone they would authorize their streets to be used for street railways so long as these conditions are not such as would be altogether beyond and at variance with their municipal powers. There is nothing unreasonable or unjust in the conditions attached to the consent given in this case. On the contrary, they appear to be eminently fair and reasonable in their general character. Of course, I know nothing and say nothing about their details, but I speak of the principle of exacting some percentage on the gross profits from the company as a condition of conceding to them the privilege they were asking of turning their naked and useless power into a living and probably beneficial right. The denial of the power to impose any such condition as a percentage of profits necessarily involves a denial of the power to impose any limitation as to time. So that, if the argument of the company is sound, the city only could consent to a perpetual charter binding the citizens for all time and could not impose any condition whatever excepting such regulations as were within section 15.\nThe special subjects on which by section 15 the parties were authorized to agree were those which would naturally arise after the city had given its consent, after the powers of the company had been changed by such contract into a right, and relate, as will be seen, to the regulations of those rights, the paving of the streets, the construction of drains and sewers, the laying of gas and water-pipes, the particular streets along which the railway should run, pattern of rail, time and speed of cars, time within which the works were to be commenced, manner of proceeding with the same, and the time for completion and generally the safety and convenience of passengers, conduct of the agents and servants of the company and the non-obstructing or impeding of the ordinary traffic.\nNow, each and all of these matters specified in section 15 are confined to necessary and proper regulations and arrangements on matters arising after the consent of the city had been first obtained to the construction within its borders at all of the street railway.\nThe agreement, however, which is authorized to be entered into between the parties by section 7, and under and subject to which alone they could enter into the city limits and construct their railway, by necessary inference, in my opinion, authorizes an agreement limiting as well the time during which the consent was to operate as a payment of money for the concession made. That such payment should take the form as well of a mileage payment for each mile of track laid as also for a percentage of the gross profits is, to my mind, neither unreasonable nor ultra vires.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants are resisting payment of certain percentages of their \u201cgross receipts\u201d which, by an agreement of 26th March, 1892, they covenanted to pay to the respondents.\nThe case was tried by Mr. Justice Meredith, who gave judgment for respondent, and then appellants carried the case to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that court dismissed the appeal.\nFrom that judgment appellants have appealed to this court.\nThe statement of claim sets forth the material parts of certain statutes, by-laws and agreements upon which respondent rested its claim.\nThe appellant\u2019s statement of defence consists of a denial of indebtedness under the by-laws, agreements and other matters thus set forth, and a counterclaim for recovery of over\u2011payments by error or mistake\nin excess of percentages on the receipts of the defendants (now appellants) to which the plaintiff (now respondent) was entitled under the by-laws or agreements referred to in the statement of claim, etc. The plaintiff (now respondent) replied to this by joining issue, and, as to the counterclaim, pleading the Statute of Limitations.\nNot a word about the agreements being ultra vires appears in the pleadings which were thus closed on 14th May, 1903.\nOn 23rd June, 1904, counsel signed a memorandum of admissions for use on the trial. Nothing is there suggested of any of the by-laws or agreements, which are those in question here, being ultra vires or in any other way invalid.\nOne may see, in the frame of the pleadings and these admissions, that there was foreshadowed a contest or contests raising questions I will presently refer to over the construction of these documents, but could hardly expect the doctrine of ultra vires to be likely to arise.\nIt may be that in those pleadings it was open to the appellants to raise such questions. I am by no means so clear that when a party has solemnly made such an unconditional admission of by-laws and agreements that he can turn round and say that they are utterly void, and, if not entirely so, were so as to the clauses and paragraphs, that the whole suit was about. I would incline to take it as an admission of a valid by-law.\nThis was not observed by me during the argument before us and no observations were made upon it.\nThe arguments were addressed to the questions of agreements and by-laws being ultra vires and the questions incidental thereto and the cases which the pleadings present.\nI suggested during the argument that if there was anything in what appellants contended for, their rights on the streets of Hamilton had no legal ground to rest upon. Appellants\u2019 counsel sought to shew that this was not necessarily so. I think he was unsuccessful in that regard.\nOf course, if the whole foundation of appellants\u2019 rights to operate on said streets an electric road are gone, or rather never existed, the cause of action in question may be gone also.\nI think it will, however, enable a better apprehension of what is involved in this contention as to ultra vires, to consider the question first from the point of view I suggested.\nHave the appellants any right to operate an electric railway in Hamilton?\nIf so, on what does such right rest? Can that right be rested upon something severable from the claim to a correlative right of the respondent such as it sets up herein?\nThe appellants were incorporated by 36 Vict. ch. 100 (Ontario), for the purpose of constructing and operating a street railway \u201cin the City of Hamilton and adjoining municipalities.\u201d Section 7 thereof is as follows:\nThe company are hereby authorized and empowered to construct, maintain, complete and operate a double or single iron railway, with the necessary side-tracks and turn\u2011outs, for the passage of cars, carriages and other vehicles adapted to the same, upon and along streets and highways within the jurisdiction of the corporation of the City of Hamilton, and of any of the adjoining municipalities, as the company may be authorized to pass along, under and subject to any agreement hereafter to be made between the council of the said city and of said municipalities respectively, and the said company, and under and subject to any by-laws of the said corporation of the said city and municipalities respectively, or any of them, made in pursuance thereof, and to take, transport and carry passengers and freight upon the same, by the force or power of animals or such other motive power as they may be authorized by the council of the said city and municipalities respectively by by-law to use and to construct and maintain all necessary works, buildings, appliances and conveniences connected therewith.\nIt is conceded that, as a motive power, electricity, or rather electric force, thus applied, could not be within the contemplation of any one then.\nHorses were used to carry out what the parties hereto then agreed upon and a road of that kind was operated until 1892.\nWhat the terms of that agreement may have been, we are not able to say. It was swept away, or supposed by every one, up to the trial of this case, to have been swept away by the one now before us.\nCounsel informed us in the course of the argument that the road itself and all its equipment had become pretty well worn out by 1892.\nThe need of a new and better system being felt, respondent\u2019s counsel, on the 26th March, 1892, passed a long by-law covering such terms as by this time had become of common use to define the relations between a municipal corporation and an electric railway company. Amongst other things it provided for the payment by the appellants to the respondents of the percentages of earnings designated \u201cgross receipts\u201d now in question by way of compensation for the use of the streets.\nThe last two clauses of this by-law are most significant and important for the purpose of understanding the questions now raised.\nIt is urged by appellants that the preceding paragraphs of this by-law, which contain most explicit, provisions for the payment by appellants to respondents of the percentages intended to be covered thereby, were all ultra vires, and that any assent thereto by the appellants was also ultra vires. Of these last two clauses of this by-law, No. 33 is as follows:\nThis by-law and the powers and privileges hereby granted shall not take effect or be binding upon the said city unless formally accepted by the said railway company, within ten days after the passing hereof, by an agreement which shall legally bind the said company to pay to the city corporation the sums mentioned in this by-law, and to perform, observe and comply with all the agreements, obligations, terms and conditions herein contained, and shall be approved by the city solicitors, or one of them, and such agreement, when so approved, shall also be executed under the city seal by the mayor or the chairman of finance and the city clerk.\nIt is followed by clause 34, repealing many named by-laws (I take it, all the former by-laws conferring rights upon the company to use the streets), and all others so far as inconsistent; such repeal to\ntake effect only upon and from the coming into force of this by-law and the agreement referred to in the last preceding paragraph.\nThen follows, in same clause, a reservation of right to run with horses for six months.\nThe company immediately entered into an agreement, which recites what had been done and is intended, and the operative clauses following such recitals contain, first, a covenant binding the respective parties, and then proceeds as follows:\nThe company do hereby accept the said by-law and agree with the city corporation to pay the city corporation the sums mentioned in the said by-law and to perform, observe and comply with all the agreements, obligations, terms and conditions therein contained.\nNow, in face of this, the appellants claim they have the right to reject part, and insist on accepting and acting under other parts. But they seem to overlook the comprehensive nature of this agreement.\nThey also seem to overlook that the destruction of any substantial part of the contract, such as that involved in the ultra vires issue raised, would tend to destroy the whole contract. But, more strange than all that, the powers and privileges granted by the by-law, as the above section 33 thereof shews, were not to take effect or be binding upon the city\nunless formally accepted by the railway company, within ten days after the passing thereof, by an agreement which shall legally bind the said company to pay to the city corporation the sums mentioned in this by-law.\nNow, if the agreement is, in this regard, not valid and binding, there never existed any concession on the part of the city to the company authorizing the use of the streets for the purposes of constructing thereon an electric road.\nSection 7 would be the only authority. Clearly the first part of that, in itself and without relation to the authorizing power of the city at the close of the section, never could have conferred such a right.\nIt hardly needs to be stated that the construction and operation of an old system of horse-tramway (and that is all that was given and taken under the first part of section 7), is entirely a different thing from the construction and operation of an electric road. The appliances of the latter are of such a character that their use requires much to be guarded against. The establishment of it involves considerations of an entirely different character from those arising from constructing and operating a horse-tramway. A concession of a kind that would authorize the former is, and implies, so much of a different nature from that which the company had acquired authority to obtain, that I am surprised to find it assumed, as it evidently was by the contracting parties, that, without amendment, the city and company were supposed to have authority to act under section 7 and to enable the making of a contract to build and operate an electric road.\nThe appellants contended stoutly that the first part of the section gave a right to construct and operate a road unfettered by any restrictions of the city, save as to those matters within sections 8 and 15.\nBefore adverting further to the possible power derivable from the authorizing part at the end of section 7, I would call attention to cases distinguishing the effect of different powers.\nThe case of Attorney-General v. Pontypridd Urban District Council[10], cited by the appellants\u2019 counsel for another purpose, seems to apply to the point I am now taking.\nI need not enlarge upon it, but refer to the judgment therein of Mr. Justice Farwell, and especially at pages 450 to 453. The substance of it is this, that a municipal corporation acting in the exercise of a power for one particular purpose, cannot be presumed to have thereby been exercising any other one of its powers. If it acquired land as for one particular purpose, even though that purpose may be made remotely to be adapted to supply some of the wants of the other purpose, it cannot be held to have acted in execution of the powers given to carry out the other purpose. See also the case of Attorney-General v. Mersey Rly. Co.[11], following London County Council v. Attorney-General[12].\nHere, beyond peradventure, the appellants never intended, and could not have intended, when incorporated, the construction of such an unknown thing as an electric road. They applied for leave to operate a road whereon the force or power of animals would be used as the motive power. When they conceived it necessary in their interest to use some other power, they felt it incumbent upon them, as I am quite clear it was incumbent upon them, to apply to the city authorities to permit the adoption of some other motive power. It was a power inconceivable to the minds of ordinary men at the time when section 7 was enacted. It is not in the words of the section. It may be possible to rest its adoption on the words enabling to do what the city would agree to be done in that regard. It has no other existence in law.\nMoreover, there is this to be observed in the reading of section 7 that the subject matter over which the corporation of the city was given special control, was the application of the kind of motive power to be used. The company were in any case to construct and operate, under and subject to any agreement to be made between the council of the city and the company, and they were to be subject to any by-laws of the said corporation made pursuant to such agreement. But beyond all that, and particularly germane to what has become the subject of discussion in this suit, they were\nto take, transport and carry passengers and freight upon the same (that is the road) by the force or power of animals or such other motive power as they may be authorized by the council of the said city and municipalities respectively by by-law to use.\nIt is quite clear that unless this latter part of section 7 can be relied upon to support the concession implied in the by-law and agreement now in question, that the company never had the slightest vestige of a right to construct upon the streets of Hamilton an electric street railway. By virtue of what authority did they do so? The 7th section above quoted manifestly never conferred any such power unless by virtue of this power of authorization by the city. It might be held that this was put there to meet all future possible emergencies such as elsewhere discussed.\nThe doctrine of ultra vires in this case goes to the destruction of the whole contract, the whole concession, or is not operative at all.\nI do not wish to say anything further to disturb. I will accept rather than do so, the theory proceeded upon by a number of the judges in the courts below, that there had come to be, by virtue of the several enactments relative to this agreement and this by-law, such a legislative recognition of its validity as at this distance of time, in light of all that has happened, might be relied upon to support the by-law and contract as duly established.\nIf ever circumstances existed that would entitle the inference to be drawn, in the absence of express and explicit words of enactment, of legislative confirmation of a by-law and agreement, this seems to be that case.\nThe fact that the legislature of Ontario had some years earlier, in regard to companies incorporated under the \u201cStreet Railway Act,\u201d given, by section 13 thereof, power to the municipalities to exact a license, might also be borne in mind. The power given municipalities to own and operate such roads is also illustrative.\nThese provisions are only of value here as shewing that the policy of that legislature was such that indirect confirmation, if possible to infer at all, was not so repugnant to that policy and prevalent opinion as to forbid such inference. Assuming the contract valid, as I think down at least to May, 1904, the parties all believed it to be, what is the true construction of it in relation to the accountability of the appellants to the respondents for the percentage of \u201cgross receipts\u201d agreed upon?\nI accept the suggestion made in the courts below that the gross receipts must be confined to the receipts for traffic or passengers. I also see no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that if the instruments before us were intended to, and expressed the intention, that it was agreed between the parties to make the respondents account for the Barton fares as part of the gross receipts, they must do so. The percentage of gross receipts might well be taken as the measurement of the price the municipality were exacting for the franchise.\nIs it, however, the correct construction of the documents in question that these fares must be accounted for? There can be, under the ruling in the Privy Council in the case of City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Rly. Co.[13], no doubt but that the appellants must account for the fares received in respect of passengers travelling over the Hamilton portion of the road, whether their journey originated in the township of Barton or in the City of Hamilton.\nThe contract in that case and the contract in this case, have so much in common in that regard, that I accept the authority of the Privy Council interpreting the Montreal contract as conclusive upon this point.\nI think there is no foundation in reason for the contention that if a ticket happened to be sold in Barton, entitling a passenger to travel over the entire 18.796 miles of the appellants\u2019 track in Hamilton, though the passenger may only have used 50 feet of the track in the Township of Barton, his fare need not be accounted for. I state the proposition as I understand it was presented in argument, unillustrated of course by the contrast of distances I present. It refutes itself. I will not labour with it.\nThe accountability in respect of the earnings of the company beyond the city, in respect of fares for journeys not projected into the city, stands on a somewhat different footing. The circumstances, the expressions in the statute, in the by-laws, and in the agreement in this case, must be carefully looked at to see whether or not this case is distinguishable from that of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[14] in the Privy Council.\nThe Act of incorporation recites the appellants\u2019 charter members as petitioning the legislature for incorporation for the purpose of constructing and operating a street railway in the City of Hamilton and adjoining municipalities. Clearly this was one enterprise at its very inception.\nThe Montreal Street Railway at its inception, for the purpose of construction as an electric road, was confined by the language to the City of Montreal.\nThe company in this case is not confined to, and never was, but entitled to go beyond Hamilton and into any adjoining municipality. The adjoining municipalities are few. They do not extend far. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the parties to this contract perceived that it was a matter of very little consequence; too trifling to consider in light of the question of auditing and determining what amount of fares might be collected for services in any one of the adjoining municipalities, as distinct from the fares collected for services rendered in the City of Hamilton.\nSurrounding the City of Montreal there were and are populous suburbs, and a continuous stretch of municipal corporations of that character. It might shock one knowing the locality and knowing the condition as to population and business relations with Montreal, on the part of the inhabitants of these populous suburbs, to find a claim set up for earnings, through miles of such a district.\nOn the other hand, if it would not shock, but it would surprise any one to find that, when this contract was formed, any great stress was laid by either party to the contract as to the amount of fares possible to be collected for services in Barton alone as distinct from journeys by the inhabitants of Barton into the city. The amount involved was so trifling at the date of the accounting now in question, that the city solicitor seems to have been willing in the Court of Appeal to abandon the consideration of it, rather than face the expense involved in settling the trifling sum that would be coming to the City of Hamilton as the product of such investigation.\nThis surrender of counsel may have been an inadvertence. We are assured by the appellants\u2019 counsel that it has, by virtue of the small amount in question being added to the aggregate of services in Hamilton, brought about a total that passes the line at which an increased percentage is drawn.\nIn that way, the item is possibly an important one.\nI doubt very much if such a consideration was ever present to the minds of anybody concerned in the framing of this by-law or contract. I would rather come to the conclusion that in consideration of being free from the trouble and annoyance of keeping separate accounts as to the earnings for Barton services, as distinguished from the earnings for Hamilton services, and all that that implies, the appellants had abandoned anything to be gained by making the distinction.\nThe foregoing considerations, along with the difference in the inception of the relations, between the Montreal case and this, and the interpretation put upon the contract by the contracting parties in this case for many years, seem to distinguish this case from that, as determined by the Privy Council.\nI cannot say that this small branch of the case is entirely free from doubt. I have no doubt that the parties, if they really seriously considered it, intended that Barton fares should go with Hamilton fares as a basis for the percentage. My only doubt is as to whether the expressions used can in law fairly be so read as expressing that intention.\nI also think the admission on which the case was tried implies a valid by-law.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. concurred for the reasons stated by Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gibson, Osborne, O\u2019Reilly & Levy.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Francis Mackelcan.\n[1] 10 Ont.

Whitehaven Harbour Commissioners ([1899] 2 Q.B. 132); Hall v. Snowden, Hubbard & Co. ([1899] 2 Q.B. 136), Lowth v. Ibbotson ([1899] 1 Q.B. 1003), Farnell v. Bowman (12 App. Cas. 643) and The Attorney General of the Straits Settlement (13 App. Cas. 192), referred to.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition of right with costs.\nThe claim was for damages to the suppliant\u2019s steam-barge \u201cPr\u00e9fontaine\u201d through coming in collision with His Majesty\u2019s steam-tug \u201cChamplain\u201d in the Contrec\u0153ur Channel, on the River St. Lawrence, a short distance below the Harbour of Montreal, about half past eight o\u2019clock in the evening of the 6th October, 1902. The night was clear, with a light south wind, regulation lights were shewn by both vessels, those of the tug indicating that she had a tow.\nThe suppliant charged that the injuries sustained by the \u201cPr\u00e9fontaine\u201d were wholly caused by the negligence of the officers and crew of the steam-tug, then employees of the Crown acting within the scope of their employment, on, in and about a public work of the Dominion of Canada. At the time of the collision the \u201cChamplain\u201d was engaged in towing mud-scows laden with material which Avas brought up from the bottom of the channel in the course of dredging works being then carried on there by His Majesty\u2019s steam-dredge \u201cLady Minto.\u201d The method of the operations was for the tug to tow the loaded scows from the dredging ground to the dumping grounds, some distance away, on the other side of the channel, and then to tow the empty scows back to the dredge. It was while so engaged in towing an empty scow back from the dumping grounds, but still at a considerable distance from the place where the work of dredging was being carried on, that the vessels. came in collision in the channel.\nThe defence blamed the suppliant, his officers and servants, for causing the collision by neglect to observe proper precautions in navigating the channel and also denied liability on the part of the Crown on the ground that the injury complained of did not arise upon a public work within the meaning of section 16 of \u201cThe Exchequer Court Act\u201d\nThe petition was dismissed by the judgment appealed from on the ground that, under any circumstances, no relief could be granted as the collision which occasioned the injuries had not occurred upon a public work within the meaning of the section above mentioned.\nThe questions raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nMignault K.C. and Martineau K.C., for the appellant, cited The City of Quebec v. The Queen[1], at page 450; Filion v. The Queen[2]; Letourneux v. The King[3]; Ryder v. The King[4], at pages 464-467.\nNewcombe K.C, Deputy Minister of Justice, and J. L. Decarie K.C., for the respondent, cited The Hamburg American Packet Co. v. The King[5]; Chambers v. The Whitehaven Harbour Commissioners[6]; Fenn v. Miller[7]; Back v. Dick, Kerr & Co.[8]; The \u201cMentor\u201d[9]; The \u201cLord Hobart\u201d[10]; The \u201cAthol\u201d[11]; The \u201cVolcano\u201d[12]; The \u201cBirkenhead\u201d[13]; The \u201cSwllow\u201d[14]; The \u201cInflexible\u201d[15]; The Siren\u201d[16]; The \u201cFidelity\u201d[17]; Filion v. The Queen2; City of Quebec v. The Queen1.\nGirouard J.\u2014I quite agree that a navigable river, although under the control of the Dominion Government, is not a public work within the meaning of the \u201cExchequer Court Act.\u201d But to hold that a government dredge, operating on a navigable river, is not such a public work is more than I can understand, Likewise, I would feel inclined so to look upon the tug and scows used to carry away, within close proximity, the material excavated by the dredge, and, were it not for the English decisions quoted by Mr. Newcombe K.C.for the respondent, especially as to the meaning of similar clauses in the Imperial \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d 1897, and the \u201cPublic Works Act,\u201d and referred to by my brother Idington, I would probably so hold. In face of all these decisions, one by the House of Lords, I do not, however, see how I can dissent.\nDavies J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal must be dismissed on the ground stated by the Exchequer Court that the case does not come within the provisions of clause (c) of the 16th section of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d under which section alone could relief be given.\nBefore dealing with this point, however, I wish to say that the merits of the case have been argued at length before us, and that I desire to guard against any inference whatever being raised from our silence as to the disposition of the case we would have made upon these merits had it been competent for us to enter into them. When I speak of the merits I desire to be understood as including the amount of damages reported by the Registrar as well as the question of negligence.\nThe construction placed upon this section of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d by the Exchequer Court and this court has been that it created a liability as well as gave jurisdiction. The City of Quebec v. The Queen[18]; The Queen v. Filion[19].\nIn the case of Larose v. The King[20] this court held that a rifle range under the control of the Department of Militia and Defence was not a public work within the meaning of section 16 (c). That section reads as follows :\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nIn the case at bar the claim was for injuries to the suppliant\u2019s steamer \u201cPr\u00e9fontaine\u201d arising out of a collision which occurred between her and the King\u2019s tug \u201cChamplain\u201d in the channel of the River St. Lawrence.\nThe steam-dredge \u201cLady Minto,\u201d also owned by the Crown, was at the time working in the Contrec\u0153ur Channel of the St. Lawrence River.\nThe tug \u201cChamplain\u201d was employed in towing the scows loaded with the mud dredged by the \u201cLady Minto\u201d from the bottom of the channel to a convenient dumping ground. It was while so engaged and with one of the scows attached to her, but at a considerable distance from the dredge, that the tug was either run into by the suppliant\u2019s steamer or ran into her. The question as to whose negligence caused the accident is entirely apart from the one I am considering, of the construction of the clause.\nIn delivering the judgment of the court in Larose v. The King20 Taschereau J., afterwards Chief Justice, said: It must not be lost sight of that the suppliant to succeed must come within the strict words of the statute.\nThe injury complained of must have arisen \u201con a public work,\u201d and must have resulted from the negligence of the Crown\u2019s officer or servant when acting within the scope of his employment.\nThis collision which caused the injury here complained of occurred between two steamers on the waters of the St. Lawrence River.\nThis court has already held in the case of The Hamburg American Packet Go. v. The King[21], confirming the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, that the channel of the St. Lawrence River after it had been deepened by the Department of Public Works did not, in consequence of such improvement, become a public work within the meaning of the section under consideration. An appeal taken from this judgment to the Privy Council was afterwards abandoned. This judgment is, of course, binding upon us and somewhat narrows the point now before us.\nTo hold the Crown liable in this case of collision for injuries to the suppliant\u2019s steamer arising out of the collision we would be obliged to construe the words of the section so as to embrace injuries caused by the negligence of the Crown\u2019s officials not as limited by the statute \u201con any public work,\u201d but in the carrying on of any operations for the improvement of the navigation of public harbours or rivers. In other words, we would be obliged to hold that all operations for the dredging of these harbours or rivers or the improvement of navigation, and all analogous operations carried on by the Government were either in themselves public works, which needs, I think, only to be stated to refute the argument, or to hold that the instruments by or through which the operations were carried on were such public works.\nIf we were to uphold the latter contention I would find great difficulty in acceding to the distinction drawn by Burbidge J. between the dredge which dug up the mud while so engaged and the tug which carried it to the dumping ground while so engaged. Both dredge and tug are alike engaged in one operation, one in excavating the material and the other in carrying it away.\nBut, even if we could find reasons to justify such a distinction, which I frankly say I cannot, how could we hold in the face of the decided cases referred to above that the injuries to the \u201cPr\u00e9fontaine\u201d were on a public work when they were admittedly sustained through a collision while she was steaming on the public waters of a public river.\nI think a careful and reasonable construction of the clause 16 (c) must lead to the conclusion that the public works mentioned in it and \u201con\u201d which the injuries complained of must happen are public works of some definite area, as distinct from those operations undertaken by the Government for the improvement of navigation or analogous purposes; not confined to any definite area of physical work or structure.\nThe cases decided as to the meaning of section 7, sub-section 1 of \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1897,\u201d in which the words used are \u201con, in or about,\u201d are instructive on the point before us. See Chambers v. Whitehaven Harbour Commissioners[22], and the cases there cited and relied upon, and Hall v. Snow-don, Hubbard & Co.[23]. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This appellant claims that his vessel, the \u201cPr\u00e9fontaine,\u201d was damaged by a collision with the vessel \u201cChamplain,\u201d owned by the respondent.\nHe says this collision took place in the St. Lawrence and was entirely the result of the negligence of those servants of the respondent in charge of the \u201cChamplain.\u201d\nThe \u201cChamplain\u201d was engaged at the time as tender to a dredge engaged in deepening or widening the channel of the St. Lawrence.\nThe \u201cChamplain\u2019s\u201d work as such tender was towing barges or scows, filled with material raised by the dredge, to dump it on the other side of the channel, or at all events some distance from the spot where the dredge operated.\nThe question is raised whether or not appellant can have, in the Exchequer Court, assuming all that he claims to be true, a remedy for the wrong he has suffered.\nHis claim was rested in the argument upon section 16, sub-sections (c) and (d) of the \u201cExchequer Court Act.\u201d\nThis sub-section (c) has been held not only to furnish a jurisdiction, but to create thereby a liability not otherwise existing for the wrongs done by servants of the Crown in such cases as the sub-section (c) covers.\nIf the claim can only be rested on these words used in sub-section (c), I am clear that it must fail. I cannot see how the words therein \u201con any public work\u201d can alone be held to give relief in light of the interpretation put by the Court of Appeal in England upon even wider terms in the cognate legislation there embodied in the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1897,\u201d See the cases of Lowth v. Ibbotson[24]; Chambers v. Whitehaven Harbour Commissioners[25].\nThis latter case, in its facts, is very like that now in hand. There was a dredge working in a harbour and the material was being carried to sea to be dumped therein, by what were called \u201choppers,\u201d a mile or so distant from the dredge. One of the men who worked on the dredge, but took his time to work on a hopper thus conveying the material to sea, was knocked overboard and drowned. Assuming negligence, it was held that though the spot where the dredge operated and the operating dredge might be \u201cengineering work\u201d within the meaning of the Act, yet the Act which gave a remedy for cases arising \u201con, in or about\u201d a number of specified works of which an \u201cengineering work\u201d was one, was held not to extend to this case.\nIt was held that these much wider words were pointed to a definite locality. I fear the words in question here must be held also to point to locality unless we read them in connection with the rest of the section, in a way I am about to advert to.\nWe were referred to the interpretation given the words \u201cpublic works\u201d in the \u201cPublic Works Act.\u201d If the meaning given there could be used here then the appellant\u2019s right, if otherwise entitled to succeed, would be clear.\nThe only way in which that can be done is to put upon section 16 a much wider and more comprehensive construction than this court has ever yet seen its way to do, though invited on several occasions to try to do so. In Ryder v. The King[26], at p. 466 et seq., I reviewed the authorities and dicta appearing in them.\nI still think, as then, that the policy of Parliament, as shewn in this section 16 (as a group or as independent sub-sections) of the \u201cExchequer Court Act,\u201d was to put the relation between the Crown and its subjects and all issues springing therefrom, in regard to the several matters dealt with by such legislation, upon the same footing as between subject and subject.\nNo doubt, though the general trend of opinion, in and of this court, in this regard has been against such a wide, and as I conceive beneficial, interpretation of this section, yet it has never been in terms formally declared against.\nHowever, even if such interpretation were ever open, it seems hopeless now to expect this court, after such a mass of opinion looking the other way, and in. Ryder v. The King26, coming to conclusions inconsistent with anything but a narrow or restricted construction, to put any such wide construction as would save this case for appellant. What force or effect now remains in this result for sub-section (d) I am at a loss to understand.\nThe language of the Acts respectively in question in the cases of Farnell v. Bowman[27], and The Attorney-General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[28], was more apt than that in section 16 to execute what I have suggested was the purpose of Parliament in its enactment.\nAnd in saying all this I am not by any means blind to the obvious difficulties. The section and its whole frame seem as if constructed as a puzzle. It certainly seems at this time of day unsatisfactory to find that one of the vessels, the property of which is in the Crown, engaged in the business of the Crown, can destroy through grossest negligence the property of a subject and he have no remedy at law unless against the possibly penniless man who has been thus negligent.\nI am not implying that such gross negligence existed here, as I have not examined the evidence, but do imply that no matter how gross it may have been, if at all, there is in the result no proper remedy.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the reasons stated by Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Godin & Brassard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

VII. c. 57\u2014Conditions of contract\u2014Estimating cost of constructing line of railway\u2014Rolling stock and equipment.\nWhere the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to entertain an appeal was in doubt, but it was considered that the appeal should be dismissed on the merits, the court heard and decided the appeal accordingly.\n(Cf. Bain v. Anderson & Co. (28 Can. S.C.R. 481).\nThe provisions of the Act, 3 Edw. VII. c. 57, authorizing the granting of subsidies in aid of the construction of railways are not mandatory, but discretionary in so far as the grant of the subsidies by the Governor in Council is concerned.\nOn a proper construction of the said Act it does not appear to have been the intention of Parliament that the cost of rolling stock and equipment should be included in the cost of construction in estimating the amount of subsidy payable to the company in aid of the \u201cPheasant Hills Branch\u201d of their railway under the provisions of that Act, notwithstanding that the said Act did not specially exclude the consideration of the cost of equipment in the making of such estimate as had been done in former subsidy Acts with similar objects, and that the Governor in Council imposed the duty of efficient maintenance and equipment of the branch as a condition of the grant of the subsidy.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, on a referred case ordering judgment to be entered in favour of the respondent, defendant, and that there should be no costs to either party.\nA stated case was referred to the Exchequer Court by the Minister of Railways and Canals, under section 23 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act.\u201d It recited the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 57 ; certain orders in council in respect of the Pheasant Hills branch of the company\u2019s railway mentioned in sub-section 72 of the second section of the Act and the agreement for its construction and operation.\nThe question to be decided was whether or not, on the proper construction of the said Act, contract and documents mentioned, the cost of the necessary rolling-stock and equipment of the line should be included in estimating the subsidy payable to the company under the Act.\nBy the judgment appealed from it was held that the Crown was under no obligation to pay subsidy estimated upon a basis including the cost of rolling-stock and equipment as part of the expense of constructing the line of railway.\nThe material parts of the documents mentioned and the questions discussed on the argument of the appeal are referred to in the judgments now reported. Objection was made to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to review the discretion vested in the Governor in Council by the ninth section of the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 57.\nLafleur K.C. and Lewis for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014The appeal is dismissed with costs. I concur for the reasons stated by my brother Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014I entertain very grave doubts as to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court and consequently of this court to decide the questions submitted, by the special case agreed upon between the parties.\nIn view, however, of the firm conclusion I have reached upon the merits and that my doubts as to our jurisdiction do not appear to be shared by all the members of this court and that the point does not seem to have been taken before the Exchequer Court, but arises under a case stated between the parties, I will shortly state my reasons for coming to the conclusion I have reached.\nThe question is one to my mind purely of the construction of the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 57, granting railway subsidies.\nThe Act is not mandatory, but discretionary so far as granting the subsidies are concerned. The discretion is vested in the Governor in Council and the second section enacts that he may grant a subsidy. That discretion is limited to the objects and purposes designated by the statute and it is, of course, within those alone that he can exercise his discretion. If the statute means that the subsidies are to be limited to the cost of the construction of the road and its language does not include the cost of rolling stock or equipment the Governor in Council could not exercise any discretion beyond the statutory limitation. In exercising such discretion he could, I have no doubt, impose such conditions as to the subsidized company providing rolling stock and equipment as he deemed fit to ensure that the road would be an efficient one and that the subsidy would not be thrown away. That is what has been done in this case in the order in council passed and the agreement entered into in pursuance of it. But the imposition of any such condition relating to rolling stock or equipment can have no bearing upon the true construction of the subsidy Act. I mention this because the provisions in the agreement and specification attached thereto relating to rolling stock was pressed upon us as indicating that it was a railway line in operation and as a going concern that was contemplated. This is no doubt perfectly true. Anything else or less than such a railway line would be a fraud upon the public. But it by no means follows that because the Government stipulated for provision being made by the company for\nsufficient rolling stock to accommodate and conduct properly and efficiently the traffic and business of the line\nthat they agreed that the cost of such rolling stock or its efficient maintenance should be added to the cost of the line for the purpose of increasing the statutory subsidy.\nOn the contrary by turning to the agreement entered into between the Crown and the company on the 14th January, 1904, it will be seen that after reciting the second section of the \u201cSubsidy Act of 1903,\u201d and the 72nd paragraph designating this particular branch railway, the agreement went on to provide in clause 1 that\nthe company should make, build, construct and complete the line of railway mentioned and described in paragraph 72 of the 2nd section of the \u201cSubsidy Act\u201d above set forth, and all bridges, culverts, works and structures appertaining thereto in all respects in accordance with the specifications hereto annexed marked A.\nThen follows clauses two to eight inclusive relating to location, plans, character of the work, time of completion of work, the kind of steel rails to be provided, and compliance with all statutory requirements.\nNot a single word said or reference made to rolling stock or equipment, but the language used make, build, construct and complete the line of railway and all bridges, culverts, works and structures appertaining thereto in all respects in accordance with the specifications\nunder well-known rules of construction would exclude rolling stock.\nThen immediately follows section 9, providing that upon the performance and observance by the company of the foregoing clauses 1 to 8 of the agreement His Majesty would, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of sections one, two and four of \u201cSubsidy Act,\u201d pay to the company so much of the subsidies, etc.\nThen follows clause ten, an independent clause,\nthat upon, from and after the completion of the said line of railway the company would faithfully and continuously operate and run the same maintaining the said railway and all structures thereon, and equipment thereof, in good condition, etc.\nThis covenant relates to the subsequent operation and maintenance of the railway and its equipment, and is followed by other clauses relating to the details of the operation of the road.\nAnd so while the specification attached to the order in council makes provision for rolling stock and equipment, the agreement explicitly provides for the payment of the subsidy upon the performance of the company\u2019s covenant to construct and complete the line of railway mentioned in the \u201cSubsidy Act,\u201d together with other specific matters not having the remotest reference to rolling stock or equipment, the provision for and the maintenance of which are provided for in independent clauses.\nTurning back then to the second section of the \u201cSubsidy Act of 1903,\u201d we find it makes provision for the granting of $3,200 per mile for the mileage specified towards the construction of each of the undermentioned lines of railway\nof which this branch under consideration is one and\ntowards the construction of each of said lines of railways which shall cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized a further subsidy beyond the $3,200 per mile of 50% on so much of the average cost of the mileage subsidized as is in excess of the $15,000 per mile, but not to exceed in the whole $6,400 per mile.\nNot a word is said about rolling stock or equipment. But it is said and probably the whole argument of the company rests upon the fact, that whereas in former subsidy Acts the cost of rolling stock and equipment was specially excluded under the words \u201cthe cost of equipping the railway\u201d as was also the cost of terminals and the right of way to cities and towns from the cost upon which the subsidy was to be estimated, in this Act the words excluding the cost of equipping the railway have been dropped.\nIt is, therefore, argued that the change of language indicates a change of intention and that the dropping of these words shews Parliament intended their cost should be added to the cost of the line in estimating the subsidy payable.\nI am utterly unable to adopt the argument. The rule invoked respecting the construction of statutes is only invoked where the language to be construed is ambiguous and doubtful. As said by Mr. Hardcastle in his third edition, at page 119:\nSometimes if an enactment is not plain, light may be thrown upon it by observing that certain words \u201chave been\u201d as Brett L.J. said in Union Bank of London v. Ingram (1882)[1] \u201cdesignedly omitted.\u201d\nJust so, but here it cannot be successfully contended that the language of the Act is not plain; it does not require any light to be thrown upon it in order to understand its meaning. The words may have been designedly omitted by the draftsman, but it was probably because they were unnecessary. If they had not been inserted and, as I venture to think, ex abundanti cautel\u00e2, in the earlier statutes and then dropped out in this one I would say that no one would have had the boldness to claim to add the cost of rolling stock and equipment to the cost of the road so as to obtain the larger subsidy.\nThe language of the \u201cSubsidy Act of 1903\u201d is, to my mind, plain and clear, and the language of the agreement entered into between the Crown and the company if possible still more clear. Their construction cannot be radically changed because certain unnecessary words inserted in former Acts by certain draftsmen are omitted in the Act under consideration. The reason for their omission is to my mind obvious, namely, that they were unnecessary, and the meaning of the statute without them is not doubtful or uncertain.\nDuring the argument I put this question to Mr. Lafleur: Suppose the company had made a contract with a sub-contractor for the construction of this line of railway in the very words used in the agreement between the Crown and the company in section one respecting the subsidy above recited, could he argue that such contract involved on the part of the contractor the equipping of the line with rolling stock, etc? He was, of course, obliged to fall back upon the argument arising out of the change in the wording of the \u201cSubsidy Act,\u201d and the meaning of the specification attached to the agreement with which I have already dealt. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs and question 7 of the stated case answered in the negative.\nIdington J.\u2014The claim of appellants being referred to the Exchequer Court in the way it was, I incline to the opinion that the case submitted there is neither more nor less than a mode of trying the questions in issue between the parties, arising out of the claim so referred. The evidence is documentary entirely, and, as I read this submission, such inferences of fact may be drawn therefrom as is usually done in any submission not purely restricted to the statement of a point of law.\nThe question, in one sense, is simply whether subsidy or double subsidy is what appellants are entitled to.\nClause 7 of the submission puts that in the foreground, but ends by these words\naccording to the true interpretation and proper construction of the \u201cDominion Subsidy Act of 1903,\u201d and of the contract and other documents herein mentioned.\nI think the words leave the matter open to the view the learned trial judge has taken, and I do not dissent from the view he has expressed.\nThe rule 111, under which the submission is, on its face, made, makes it abundantly clear that such inferences, if the proper ones to draw, can in law be drawn by us on this appeal, as well as by the judge below, so far as the documents call for.\nI prefer, however, to express my opinion on the construction of the \u201cSubsidy Act,\u201d as I have, as the result of much consideration, formed a much more decided opinion thereon than upon the ground taken in the judgment appealed from.\nThe following is section 2 of the \u201cSubsidy Act\u201d in question, followed by the grant now in question:\n2. The Governor in Council may grant a subsidy of $3,200 per mile towards the construction of each of the undermentioned lines of railway (not exceeding in any case the number of miles hereinafter respectively stated) which shall not cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, and towards the construction of each of the said lines of railway not exceeding the mileage hereinafter stated, which shall cost more on the average than $15,000 per mile for the mileage subsidized, a further subsidy beyond the sum of $3,200 per mile of fifty per cent, on so much of the average cost of the mileage subsidized as is the excess of $15,000 per mile, such subsidy not exceeding in the whole the sum of $6,400 per mile: * * *\n72. To the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, for a branch line from a point on the main line between Moosomin and Elkhorn, northwesterly to a point in the neighbourhood of the Pheasant Hills, not exceeding 136 miles. * * *\nSection 4 directs what fund the subsidy is to be payable from, and that it \u201cbe paid as follows:\n(a) Upon the completion of the work subsidized; or\n(b) By instalments, on the completion of each ten-mile section of the railway, in the proportion which the cost of such completed section bears to that of the whole undertaken; or,\nSub-sections (c) and (d) are mere detail and needless to refer to for our present purpose.\nWhat is the plain, ordinary meaning of the words \u201cconstruction of a line of railway?\u201d I would not, nor do I believe any ordinary person would, take them to include not only the construction of the railway line, but also the equipment thereof when constructed.\nThey might by reason of the context in a document imply the equipment. Such a case is conceivable. It is not the case here. We have daily use for these words, in speaking of the contractors building such roads; in the construction of branch lines as here ; in the building of a railway line to be run by some other body than the constructing parties; in the leasing of lines of railway, and, in short, in such a variety of ways that it seems a waste of words to try to make clear words that every intelligent man in this country, in the discussion of these very subsidies, is supposed to have understood (and I, venture to think did understand), and that only in their primary meaning.\nUsed in relation, as here, to the building of a short branch line, to be run by a great railway corporation like appellants that could furnish equipment for running, they are, if possible, more clear.\nIt is true the executive power had a duty cast upon it to see that security was given for the use of the road when built, and power was given to contract in that regard, but no power was given to pay for the-equipment or any part of it.\nThe rights of appellants as to the amount of subsidy were fixed by the \u201cSubsidy Act,\u201d and not by the-contract.\nThe executive could make many stipulations, but had no power to go beyond the very words I have quoted.\nIt is to be remarked, however, that these words, \u201clines of railway\u201d seem to be used throughout the contract in many ways so as to distinguish them from anything implying equipment. The one or two parts of the contract, where a different meaning might be raised, arise from and are attributable to the future safeguards for running, rather than construction.\nThe two-fold purpose of the contract, to secure first construction and then running over it, must be borne in mind in reading the contract, so far as it may be of any value in interpreting the \u201cSubsidy Act.\u201d An independent equipment in this case, as distinct from that to be used in the branch line, is not likely c to have been in the eyes of the contracting parties in this case a very vital matter.\nIn regard to the exclusion of the words as to equipment, which had appeared in section 1 of previous Subsidy Acts, it can be of no importance where the meaning is plain and no connection between this subsidy and others.\nIn the legislative history of the appellants there is such a wealth of illustration of the meaning of \u201cconstructing a line of railway,\u201d as distinct from and not implying the equipment thereof, that it is hardly possible the parties here concerned misunderstood it in relation to this branch line, in the sense the appellants contend for. The case of In re Branch Lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The James Bay Railway Co.[2], furnishes much of it, and the key to a great deal more. The language of the contract, held to have become law, on which the appellants exercised the right to build the very branch line in question here, is to be found in the statutes referred to in that case, and it clearly distinguishes the meaning of the words \u201cconstruct, equip and maintain.\u201d\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion of my brother Davies.\nDuff J.\u2014In my view of the merits of the questions submitted for determination, it is unnecessary to decide\u2014and, therefore, I express no opinion upon\u2014 the point argued respecting the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court.\nIn other respects, I agree with the judgment of my brother Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lewis & Smellie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. L. Newcombe.\n[1] 20 Ch. D. 465.\n[2] 36 Can. S.C.R. 42.\n"}

Dodge (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1906: December 5, 6; 1906: December 15.\nPresent: Girouard, Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nExpropriation of land\u2014Payment-\u2014Market value\u2014Potential value\u2014Evidence.\nD. purchased at different times and in sixteen different parcels 623 acres of land, paying for the whole nearly $7,000, or about $11 per acre. The Crown on expropriating the land offered him $20 per acre, which he refused, claiming $22,000, which on a reference to ascertain the value was increased to $45,000. The referee allowed $38,000, which the Exchequer Court reduced to the sum first claimed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court (10 Ex. C.R. 208), Girouard J. dissenting, that there was no user of the land nor any special circumstances to make it worth more than the market value, which was established by the price for which it was sold shortly before expropriation.\nD. claimed the larger price as potential value of the land for orchard purposes to which he had intended to devote it.\nHeld, that as he had not proved the land to be fit for such purpose and the evidence tended to disprove it he could not receive compensation on that ground.\nBy 2 Edw. VII. ch. 9, s. 1, only five expert witnesses can be called by either side on the trial of a case without leave. Qu\u0153re. If more are so called without objection by the opposite party is the testimony of the extra witness valid?\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] reducing the sum awarded to defendant by the referee as compensation for land expropriated from $38,00 to $22,649. The material facts are stated in the above head-note and fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington.\nRoscoe K.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C. Dept. Minister of Justice, and Macllreith, for the respondent.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion, both appeals should be dismissed with costs. As to the main appeal, the record shews that the appellant claimed from the Crown $23,680, and that is about the amount which the Exchequer Court allowed him, namely, $22,649. The appellant contends that he is entitled to the full amount found by the referee. I do not see how he can be. He has only claimed the above $23,680, and he certainly cannot get more. True, the referee allowed him to increase it to $45,000, but the latter had no power to grant such an amendment. He was only authorized to take the evidence and make a report thereon to the Exchequer Court. I would, therefore, dismiss the main appeal, as the appellant has obtained almost everything he asked.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court judge commends itself to my mind, and I would require very clear reasons to induce me to reverse his findings of fact, especially in matters of this description in which he has a long experience.\nTaking this view of the appellant\u2019s case, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the question of legal evidence, that is, if we can take notice of the testimony of more than five experts, as there was no leave from the court.\nFinally, I see no reason why the cross-appeal of the Crown should be allowed. As remarked by the learned Exchequer Court judge, even some of the witnesses for the Crown support his findings. Because the appellant got these lands at low figures I see no reason why he should not get the amount awarded him by the Exchequer Court.\nAs to the amount of the tender made by the Crown before taking possession, which the majority of this court declares sufficient, I do not see how it can be considered at all as the Crown has failed to call even one witness to support it.\nBoth appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014Concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington.\nIdington J.\u2014Six hundred and twenty-three acres of land in King\u2019s County in Nova Scotia having been taken on 13th September, 1903, under and by virtue of 52 Vict. ch. 13, proceedings were taken by the Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada to have it declared, that the same had vested in His Majesty the King and further that the sum of $20 an acre was sufficient and just compensation to the owners for all claim in respect of any damage or loss sustained or to be sustained by reason of such taking possession and expropriation of said lands.\nThe Exchequer Court referred the matters in question for inquiry and report under section 26 of the \u201cExchequer Court Act\u201d and the referee reported amongst other things that the appellant as owner was entitled to $38,000 and interest from the said date.\nOn appeal from such finding Mr. Justice Burbidge cut the amount down to $22,649 and interest. The appellant appeals from that, and the respondent cross-appeals.\nThe preliminary objection of appellant, that Mr. Justice Burbidge could not interfere, seems in face of said section 26 and rule 19 of the general rules of his court, absolutely without any ground to support it.\nThe learned judge having very properly called attention to the entire disregard by the referee of 2 Edw. VII. ch. 9, amending \u201cThe Canada Evidence Act, 1893,\u201d the counsel for the Crown object here, that the appellant ought to be now restricted to five expert witnesses in support of his case as the amending Act requires. No objection having been taken at the trial may or may not be a bar to the right to take this objection. In the view I take of appellant\u2019s case, I prefer refraining from forming or expressing any opinion in anything arising from the point taken, save that the increased labour caused by disregard of the Act has been very great, and that such a mass of irrelevant evidence as appears in the case would probably not have appeared there if the provision of the Act had been observed.\nThe land in question is situated near Kentville, the county town of King\u2019s County. The town is a place of two thousand inhabitants. Its growth, and prospective growth, in population, as well as that of the county, is not of that rapid character that holding vacant land therein would be a good form of investment.\nThe land in question had, in some way unexplained, got divided up so that there were sixteen different parcels of it, owned by as many different sets of owners, in February, 1902, when appellant began to buy. He continued doing so until his last acquisition in August, 1903. The following statement appears in Mr. Justice Burbidge\u2019s judgment and none of the facts it shews are questioned:\u2014\nLot.\nAcres.\n\u201cA\u201d\u2014The Robinson land (May 5th,1902)\n206\n$218.40\n\u201cB\u201d\u2014The Sheriff lot (July 21st, 1902).\n30\n110.00\n\u201cC\u201d\u2014Storrs lot (The Lord Bishop, Feb.13th, 1903)\n25\n110.00\n\u201cD\u201d\u2014Walter Reid lot (Oct. 18th, 1902).\n3\n200.00\n\u201cE\u201d\u2014Carter lot (Oct. 13th, 1902).\n1\n120.00\n\u201cF\u201d \u2014Wilson Youngs (Nov. 24th, 1902)\n12\n120.00\n\u201cG\u201d\u2014Scott or Saml.

There are prosperous farmers near it. And the whole district is of that character, we are told by counsel and it is not denied, that suggests there must have been something that affected either the character or reputation of the land or it could not have been acquired by one man at such prices. The two largest parcels, the first and last on above list, were sold at different times by public auction in Kentville. The first was a remnant of an estate in which, at least, half a dozen people were interested, of whom one or two lived not far from it. It had evidently been held for some years, and probably so because unsaleable. They agreed to place it in the hands of an auctioneer and bound themselves to carry out the sale. No complaint is made of want of publicity or of manner of conducting the sale. Appellant\u2019s counsel sought to shew that the heirs had at one time not been harmonious. How that affected, or could affect, the price when all had thus agreed, I fail to see.\nThe last parcel on the list was sold as the result of the foreclosure of a mortgage.\nIt was, presumably, properly sold, and with due precaution against sacrifice, taken by way of upset price, or reserved bid, as in such cases law and good conscience require. There were several judgment creditors interested. There were bidders besides the mortgagee. But \u201cnobody really wanted the land.\u201d Lot \u201cC\u201d may have been sold improvidently, and improperly, but I would require something more than the evidence of the man, acting as church warden, in the selling and then trying to lead the court to believe the price got was the result of such improvidence, before I would come to such conclusion.\nHe lived eight miles from it. I presume he knew the general reputation or character of the tract of land that included it, if he didn\u2019t know the precise part he sold, and acted more honestly than seemingly he desires the court to believe.\nThe lot \u201cB\u201d was bought at sheriff\u2019s public auction sale. The outstanding dower would affect its sale somewhat as well as the known tendency of sheriff\u2019s sale. Lots \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d had each houses on them, estimated by one of appellant\u2019s witnesses at $150 each, and by another at $100 each. Lot \u201cH\u201d had buildings on it worth $450, and lot \u201cM\u201d buildings worth $650, according to the same two witnesses of whom one was accompanied in the inspection on which the estimates are based by the appellant himself.\nLot \u201cH\u201d had also another house worth $100 on it, according to one of these witnesses.\nThe Beckwith lot was sold because money was needed. The Driving Park had $920 worth of buildings on it.\nI think I have thus set forth the facts relative to the chief sales that may have to be borne in mind, in applying these prices, as evidence of what the appellant is entitled to recover herein.\nThe market price of lands taken ought to be the prima facie basis of valuation in awarding compensation for land expropriated. The compensation, for land used for a special purpose by the owner, must usually have added to the usual market price of such land a reasonable allowance measured by possibly the value of such use, and at all events the value thereof to the using owner, and the damage done to his business carried on therein, or thereon, by reason of his being turned out of possession.\nIn this case there is nothing of that sort to be considered. The appellant had never used the land except to take some wood off it. He had expended nothing in improving or in the way of anticipating improvement for future use, special or otherwise.\nHence, prima facie, the ordinary market price when ascertained ought to guide, and almost entirely govern. How can it be better ascertained than by means of the prices paid for it so recently, and up to the day before expropriation?\nThere may be added, as usually is added, a percentage to cover contingencies of many kinds.\nHere the market price is clearly ascertained, as to two-thirds of the land, by exposure to sale in the public open market, where its true value is best known. As to the remainder the cost price furnishes a basis for ascertaining that market price. Some consideration may be given to the peculiar circumstances of each sale and purchase.\nBearing in mind all these considerations we have, in the sixteen different purchases made, evidence of the greatest value not only for determining the aggregate value, but also shewing the great variety of values in each parcel of land that goes to form such aggregate value.\nThis is not the case of a single sale, but of many sales of land in the same tract yet of widely varying values.\nWhat is the net result? We find when the values of buildings fixed by agreement here at $2,740 are deducted from the total purchase money the value of the land is f 4,238.40, equal to about $6.80 per acre.\nThe Crown offers nearly double this and the agreed value of buildings. Or take it as Mr. Justice Burbidge has put it as follows :\u2014\nThe value of the timber and buildings on the lands taken is reported by the learned referee to amount to a sum of a little more than $5,000, and the fairness of his valuation has not in that respect been challenged by either party. I accept it as correct, and that leaves only the value of the lands themselves apart from the timber and buildings to be ascertained. Deducting the $5,000 from the amount paid by the defendant for the whole we have a balance of less than $2,000 attributable to the value of the lands alone. That gives for the 623 acres an average value per acre of a little more than $3. The $20 an acre that the Crown offered to pay included the value of the timber buildings. Excluding the latter the Crown\u2019s offer was equivalent to about $12 an acre.\nThe offer of the Crown involves for the bare land nearly four times the price paid.\nIn the three ways of looking at the cost price and comparing it with what is offered, we have: 1st, in gross, the profit of $5,485; 2nd, excluding buildings at agreed value, we have nearly double per acreage value; 3rd, excluding buildings and timber per reported value thereof, we have offered four times the per acreage value of the cost price.\nThe reason for this pressing and presenting of the acreage value is that the potential value per acre when values of buildings and timber are eliminated is the case presented by the appellant.\nSurely, anyway we can consider the matter, either one of these alternatives covers, beyond a shadow of doubt, any fair allowances that may be due the appellant as a proprietor, turned out of such possession as he had, or for skill in bargaining, or for enterprise in anticipating the market, or for care and trouble in assembling the parts together or for all combined.\nThe case thus presented would seem insurmountable.\nBut the appellant says he is entitled to the potential value of these lands.\nThere are cases of that kind where, by sudden change of conditions, the prospect of a profit beyond the dreams of avarice may be conceivable, or where the land may be available for a special purpose and no other such land can be found. Neither such exists here.\nWhat the appellant sets up as to the potential value in these lands is their adaptation for orchard purposes.\nHere, no doubt, land quite as good as this can be got, in quantites suitable for orchard use, for a great deal less than the Crown, for sake of peace, offered for it. Perhaps one might find it troublesome in that old settled district to find so large a block of such bad land, at any price, but I hardly think that grievance is to be considered.\nThe compensation must rest, not on what such a block may be worth to the Crown for the peculiar purpose involved in its acquisition, but upon the loss the owner suffers by the Crown taking it.\nHas he furnished evidence in support of his contention of such strength as to overthrow the case presented by the facts I have dealt with?\nHe has presented a mass of evidence all of which I have read with care to see on what it rests. I have not confined my reading to the skillfully arranged excerpts set forth in the factum, but have read everything, to see how such a remarkable case was built up and whether or not by reason.\nIf opinions, regardless of knowledge, or means of knowledge, and plainly without knowledge, of a witness must be accepted as fact, then I confess this appellant ought to succeed and the referee\u2019s finding be restored.\nI will not stop to characterize each witness or dwell upon his fitness or right to express such opinion as he has expressed. It would be a waste of time.\nThe land in question had been, until acquired by the Crown, almost all waste lands, from part of which there had been, many years ago, taken some valuable timber. All but a small part of the original timber of substantial value had thus been removed. In its place there had sprung up, in some places, a second growth of timber, likely in time to become valuable, and even in 1903, of some value worth considering. In other parts of this that was originally timbered land there had grown up scrubby bushes of inferior wood, of no value, but rather the reverse as an obstacle to improving the land.\nAbout two hundred acres of the land was thus overgrown by this wood growth of all kinds. Perhaps more, but this is as far as I can find from direct statements in the evidence. Then a number of small holdings (including a 26 acre driving park), together amounting to a little over two hundred acres, were probably cleared land. On one of those holdings are some acres of bog\u2014and outside of those was another bog. What the remaining two hundred acres consisted of I am at a loss to know. I find on the plan a goodly sized millpond within the areas, but nothing to indicate how many acres it covers.\nNo single attempt at description, of a definite character, regarding the external appearance, and condition, of this land in question appears in the evidence as one might expect to find in a case of this land.\nThe same remark holds true of the soil itself of which so very much was said.\nOne witness describes the whole as a gravel loam ridge. Another tells about holes he dug, and he calls what he found sandy loam. Some places he found 10%, other places 20% of loam and all that was not loam was sand. I count thirteen holes he speaks of, but exactly where is impossible to say with certainty from his evidence. Trying to follow on the plan his steps, the utmost I can make of it is that these tests are worthless, as a guide to the character of anything but a fractional part of the whole land.\nAnother dug other holes, but how many or where he fails to tell so as to be of any value in the way of giving information.\nSome others looked in some of these holes, and put their hands in and found loam or sand or both.\nIt is from such loose statements that we are left to conjecture the real nature of the soil on each and all of the many parts of this tract of land nearly a mile square in extent. Some of the witnesses brought to inspect and give such evidence lived eighteen or twenty miles away. They had no special qualification for such work. Why were they brought?\nWe are told two hundred acres had no water on it. How the rest was watered we are left uninformed as to, except that from one place the water ran one way, and then another stream ran another way, and that there were some springs some places.\nThe plan filed helps slightly, but shews no trace of a stream in a place where one witness speaks of one two feet deep. Which is right?\nI have tried to trace the wanderings of those who try to tell of digging to discover the nature of the soil. The witness who did more than any other of this sort of exploration I venture to say did not cover but a very small part of the land. Others seem to have got ta the same places or thereabouts. No sensible man who had the slightest conception of what such an inquiry involves, to be of any value, would invest in a 623 acre orchard on the strength of such explorations. They proceeded without system and, consequently, leave us without that means of testing their proceedings or evidence that we ought to have had if value is to be given to the results.\nAs for the jaunty fellows who could discard all past history of these lands without trying to know why the land had lain so long waste yet see through the woods, the water, the bog, the bushes, the heather or grasses that covered the soil and form opinions, the less said the better.\nThere is not a single witness who has professed to have examined this 623 acres of land in such a way as to suggest that he had anything like a proper conception of the problem he had undertaken to solve.\nIt is common knowledge that land within the space of a very few acres may so vary in its essential qualities as to be eminently fitted in one part to produce a particular crop or grow a particular kind of tree or fruit and in all its other parts utterly unfit therefor.\nSo much more does that apply to the extensive tract of land now in question.\nIt would have required skill and knowledge of a very high order to have established after days and weeks of investigation the proposition that this entire tract of land was, as witnesses have assumed, save as to the bogs useful and likely to prove profitable for growing an immense orchard upon. Some of these lands were sixty feet above other parts. Hence, no doubt, one man talks of gravel loam and others of sandy loam.\nNo prudent man without the possession or use of such skill and knowledge and careful investigation would ever dream of investing $38,000 of his own money in such an enterprise as presented here, as a possibility, upon this imperfect investigation.\nMoney of the Crown is just as sacred as private property. I regret to think as I infer from Mr. Justice Burbidge\u2019s remarks that such is not thought generally to be the case.\nValues it must be observed depend on the estimation of the ordinary man. The extraordinary man who makes great discoveries in such worthless spaces of ground has to wait until he has persuaded his fellow men of the reality of his discovery before he can enrich himself thereby, even when the needs of the public have required of and from him a deprivation of both property and the dream.\nUntil the dream becomes a concrete reality that men can grasp it is worthless for purposes of such a valuation.\nThis appellant, as a discoverer of wealth in the waste places, seems to have at first been modest enough to claim only $23,680 in his statement of defence.\nIt had to be amended to meet his growing knowledge, which reached that state when he placed it on oath at \u201c$45,000 or more.\u201d\nMuch of the land in King\u2019s County has by reason of climatic conditions been found adapted to the growing of fruit and especially apples, and many of the farmers have turned their attention that way. As a result some men have made some orchards so highly productive as to render their orchard lands thus improved and developed very valuable.\nWherever any specialty in farming has become successful in a locality, there is, no doubt, a tendency to turn more land to use in that special direction and thus the values of undeveloped land may rise or shew a tendency to rise. The process is necessarily in the case of orchards a slow one. It has been going on in King\u2019s County possibly for generations and with each new success gathering strength. But there is no evidence here that the land has there suddenly risen in value. I infer quite the contrary. There is no evidence that the available land for such a purpose has become scarce or that this particular land is of the quality that has rendered King\u2019s County orchards so noted. Indeed, quite the reverse. Only a fraction of each farm is as a rule so used. It is said to have been, in recent years, observed that even the inferior lands, such as this undoubtedly is, being sand for a depth of at least two feet according to tests of appellant\u2019s men who have given evidence (with only ten to twenty per cent, of loam) have been found capable, in some instances, by development and use of fertilizers of being made productive of fruit. How far this process of enhancing the worth of such inferior land and its consequent rise in price has gone, the evidence, from its diffusive character, has not instructed us much.\nI am unable, therefore, to find that the movement upon which so much stress was laid has been such as to warrant much weight being given to inferences therefrom regarding the potential value of this land in question.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs, the cross-appeal allowed with costs, and that no costs of the proceedings, the reference, the appeals therefrom or otherwise, should be given either party in the court below.\nI think the judgment should be as prayed and the price offered in the prayer of the petition of the Attorney-General be declared as prayed with interest on the amount thus arrived at from the 13th September, 1903.\nMaclennan J. concurred. Duff J.\u2014The respondent undertook to establish as a fact that the land in question was in situation and in the character of the soil itself suitable to be utilized for fruit growing in a highly profitable degree ; and that it was owing to ignorance of its character on the part of its owners that it had recently been sold to him at prices much below its real value. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court has taken the view that this case is substantially made out, and, although (the learned judge not having in this case had an opportunity to observe the demeanour of the witnesses) we are not in a position less advantageous than his, as regards the appreciation of the evidence, we would not, even in such circumstances, disturb such a finding, except upon coming to a clear opinion that it cannot be supported. There is, however, an appeal to this court on questions of fact as well as on questions of law, and having come to such an opinion it is our duty to give effect to it.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Idington, I agree that the learned judge\u2019s finding ought to be reversed and the amount of compensation reduced to .the sum offered by the Government valuator.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. E. Roscoe.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. L. Macllreith.\n[1] 10 Ex. C.R. 208.\n"}

The trial judge directed the jury that the facts proved in no way operated to discharge him; and that while, if they could find any evidence to satisfy them that he was relieved from liability they could find for defendant he knew of no such evidence and it was not to be found in the case.\nHeld, that the disputed facts were practically withdrawn from the jury, and as there was evidence proper to be submitted and on which they might reasonably find for defendant there should be a new trial.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was on a promissory note to which defendant pleaded inter alia that he only signed it as surety for the other maker, and was discharged by dealings with his principal. At the trial the jury were directed by the judge that they were at liberty to find for the defendant on this issue if there was any evidence, but that none was to be found in the case and that the facts proved did not operate as a discharge. A verdict was given for the plaintiff which the full court upheld, the Chief Justice dissenting. Roscoe K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. J. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014Much as I regret reaching the conclusion that there must be a new trial in this case I cannot help so finding.\nThe trial judge charged the jury explicitly: (1) that the defendant, Wood, was a principal debtor and not a surety on the note sued on; (2) that the facts proved in no way and no matter whom they believed operated to discharge Wood and that, while if they could find any evidence to satisfy them that Wood was relieved from liability they could find for defendant, he knew of no such evidence and it was not to be found in the case.\nBy this charge he practically withdrew from the jury all the disputed questions of fact.\nI assume he must have held the view, afterwards expressed by Graham J., in which Townshend J. concurred, that there was no evidence in the case from which a jury could fairly find for the defendant.\nThe Chief Justice very emphatically dissented from this view, while Russell J. admitted that he had held different views, but finally determined to refuse a new trial.\nAt the argument before us it was conceded by Mr. Ritchie that the defendant Wood must be considered as only a surety on the note for one Porter, another maker, and that the questions open were whether he had been discharged from his suretyship obligation by any action of the plaintiff, Rockwell.\nMr. Roscoe contended there was ample evidence to go to the jury to shew that time had been given to the principal debtor, Porter, by the acceptance from him of another note signed by himself and one D. E. Ross, at five months, for the full amount of the indebtedness.\nWhether or not this note was so accepted depended entirely upon whose version of the facts was to be believed. We had the evidence, on one side, of plaintiff and his son supported, as it was argued, by the inherent probabilities. On the other side was the evidence of Porter and his wife and the defendant. If the evidence of these latter parties was accepted by the jury in preference to that of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, I cannot say that a verdict for the defendant on the question of the acceptance of the new note would be such as reasonable men, under all the circumstances, could not fairly find. It might not be such a verdict as I would find myself but that is another thing altogether.\nThe acceptance of the version of defendant\u2019s witnesses would relieve the defendant from any difficulty arising from the terms of the letter of Porter enclosing the note. If the story told by Porter and his wife is accepted as the true and correct one, then the offer which came from the plaintiff to Porter, the principal debtor, to send him back his note (which Rockwell admittedly had taken to Porter\u2019s house and left with Porter\u2019s wife), signed by Porter and some third party, no names being mentioned, was accepted when the note was returned into plaintiff\u2019s hands with D. E. Boss\u2019s name on it, and plaintiff\u2019s retention of it for four months without objection was corroborative evidence of his acceptance. I think there is evidence in these facts combined with Rockwell\u2019s subsequent assumption of dominion over the new note in his conversation with the defendant Wood, which ought to have been submitted to the jury on the point, and I, therefore, refrain from further discussion so that neither party may be prejudiced on the new trial.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court en banc and a new trial ordered; costs of the first trial and new trial to abide the event.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. E. Dunlop.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. P. Schaffner.\n"}

Rep. 406), affirmed.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] sustaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 barges were registered as schooners and built on the model of schooners of over 400 tons. They were not rigged for sailing, but had masts on which were fitted sails which could be used for sailing purposes in favourable weather. These barges were loaded with coal at Parsboro, N.S., and towed by steamers or tugs to St. John, N.B. The question for decision was whether or not they are exempt from being compelled to pay pilotage dues at St. John as being propelled wholly or in part by steam under \u201cThe Pilotage Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 80, sec. 59 (R.S.C. (1906), sec. 477).\nThe trial judge held that they were exempt and his judgment was affirmed by the full court, Tuck C.J. dissenting.\nMcAlpine K.C. and Coster K.C., for the appellants. The vessels on which pilotage dues are sought to be recovered are not of the class in question in the case of The \u201cGrandee\u201d[2].\nBy the \u201cPilotage Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 80, sec. 2(6), the expression \u201cship\u201d includes every description of vessel used in navigation-\u2019 not propelled by oars. See also The \u201cMac\u201d2. There can be no doubt that these schooners or so-called barges are \u201cships\u201d within the meaning of the Act. R.S.C. ch. 80, secs. 58, 59, leave only two questions to be considered: (1) Did these schooners or so-called barges navigate within the pilotage district of Saint John? (2) Had they motive power of their own, independent altogether of the tugs that towed them, and apart from steam altogether? These vessels are ships that navigated within the pilotage district of Saint John and come under the 58th section of the Act, and therefore must pay pilotage dues, unless exempt under the provisions of the Act, and that said ships or barges, with respect to their employment and only with respect to their employment, come under the exemptions of the 59th section of the said Act. The evidence abundantly proves that these vessels had motive power of their own, in and of themselves by their sails, apart altogether from the tugs which towed them. Fifteen witnesses testify that the schooners (or barges) in question, equipped as now, can sail from four to six and seven miles an hour, according to the wind, and that, if provided with greater sail area, which they could easily carry, they would sail as fast as any ordinary sailing vessel.\nThe words of the 59th section of the \u201cPilotage Act\u201d(c), \u201cpropelled wholly or in part by steam,\u201d means steam power within the vessel itself and do not mean steam power within a tug that may be used to tow the vessel. The propelling power must be within the vessel itself to come within the meaning of the Act. By R.S.C. ch. 79, sec. 1(c), the expression \u201csteamship\u201d or steamboat includes every vessel propelled wholly or in part by steam, or by any machinery or power other than sails or oars. By the \u201cSteamboat Inspection Act,\u201d R.S.C. ch. 78, sec. 2(a), the expression \u201csteamboat\u201d includes any vessel used in navigation or afloat on navigable water and propelled or movable wholly or in part by steam.\nIt is submitted further that the appellants being a corporation for certain public purposes only, possessed of no property or ability to acquire property, could not in their corporate capacity be sued or made defendants in this cause, and no Act or law authorizes such a suit.\nHugh H. McLean K.C., for the respondents, was not called upon for any argument.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014At the close of the argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel we intimated that we did not desire to hear respondents\u2019 counsel, as we were unanimously of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed and the judgment of the court below confirmed. The judges who delivered the majority judgment below have, in their reasons, dealt at great length and quite satisfactorily with the questions at issue.\nIn deference, however, to the dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and to the vigorous and strenuous argument at bar in this court, we desire to re-state very shortly the grounds on which we think the judgment appealed from is correct.\nThe action was one brought by the respondents to recover back from the Saint John Pilot Commissioners certain sums of money which they had been compelled to pay and had paid under, protest for years past as \u201ccompulsory pilotage\u201d upon their laden barges which were towed by a steamer or tug between Parsboro and Saint John, in the Bay of Fundy.\nThe Pilot Commissioners contended that these barges were ships within the meaning of \u201cThe Pilotage Act,\u201d ch. 80 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, which, under the 58th section of the Act \u201cnavigated within the pilotage district of Saint John,\u201d and, as such were liable to pay the pilotage fees and that they were not within the exemption of sub-section (c) of section 59, exempting from liability to pay such fees:\nShips propelled wholly or in part by steam employed in trading from port to port in the same province or between any one or more of the provinces (of Canada) and any other or others of them or employed on a voyage between any port in any of the said provinces and the port of New York, or any port of the United States, on the Atlantic, north of New York.\nMr. McAlpine and Mr. Coster, for the appellants, contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 barges came clearly within the definition of ships contained in the interpretation clause of the Act and that the word \u201cnavigated\u201d in the 58th section and on the true construction of which the liability for pilotage dues arose, means \u201cnavigated by any way or means whatsoever,\u201d whether in itself or outside of itself, and, so must include a barge or ship being towed.\nWe think, however, that the true construction of the word, somewhat ambiguous in the place where used in the section, must be determined, not by its literal and technical meaning only, but by reading it in connection with its context, including the exemption section following.\nTo reach the true meaning of the word one must read, not alone the section imposing the liability, but also that creating and defining the exemptions.\nBut, reading section 58 by itself alone, and its own special exemption, it will be found that that liability only attaches to such ship on her inward voyage, in cases \u201cwhere a licensed pilot offers his services as a pilot.\u201d In any case where such offer is not made liability does not attach. And so it might well be argued and maintained on the construction of this section alone, a section imposing a tax, that it clearly only contemplates such cases and ships as might require or could utilize a pilot\u2019s services, and did not apply to those cases where such services could not either be required or utilized. And so, in the case of one, two or three barges being towed from any one of the specified points to Saint John, each barge being a \u201cship navigating within the pilotage district\u201d and separately liable to pilotage dues as contended, it would seem absurd for as many licensed pilots as there were barges to tender their services as pilots, and unnecessary and unrequisite in the case of one barge.\nWhat would the two or three pilots do? Which would control and direct the tow, and which be responsible for wrongful orders and bad navigation? These considerations would indicate that the ship navigating the pilotage district and so becoming liable for dues is a ship having independent practical moving or sailing powers which a pilot could direct and control, and not one or more barges towed by a tug and relying for its or their motion or propulsion practically and substantially, if not absolutely, upon the power generated and applied in the tug.\nIn point of fact, the barge, or ship if you like so to call her, when being so towed, either by a line behind the tug or lashed to the tug, is no different from a raft or congeries of logs or deals not coming within the statutory definition of a ship. Such a barge is not being \u201cnavigated\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in this section.\nBut, if there were any doubts upon the point, they seem entirely to vanish in the light of section 59, the exempting clause. Here, by sub-section (c) \u201cships propelled wholly or in part by steam employed in trading\u201d between any of the specified ports are exempt from liability to pilotage dues.\nNow, these barges are admittedly ships, admittedly propelled in large part, if not altogether, by steam, and admittedly engaged in trading between the specified ports. They would seem, therefore, to come within the very letter as well as the spirit of the exempting section.\nBut, it is said by Mr. Coster, the propelling power which moves them must be a power within themselves and not in a steamer to which they may be lashed or which is towing them. Why? If Parliament desired to exclude barges being towed from the exemption, surely they would have used language shewing their desire. By what rule of construction could the courts put an artificial and arbitrary meaning upon the words \u201cships propelled wholly or in part by steam,\u201d and confine it to ships in which the steam is generated and the power applied on board of itself? The barge or line of barges moves, navigates, is propelled, and except in certain favourable weather when they can use their small sails as auxiliary power, alone by steam generated and applied by the controlling tug which has them in tow or lashed to it, as the case may be.\nThe case seems to us a clear one, not admitting of reasonable doubt, and the fact so much relied upon that under certain favourable conditions of weather, wind and tide, the barges might, independently of a tug, move along at the rate of from three to five, and possibly, even six miles an hour cannot alter the conclusion we have reached.\nIf any such barge attempted to trade between any of the specified points independently and without a tug she, being a ship navigating the pilotage district and not moved or propelled by steam, would, of course, be liable, provided she successfully overcame the danger of navigation and reached Saint John.\nBut no such case occurred here or was suggested could reasonably occur.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitor for the appellants: C.

The Picton (4 Can. S.C.R. 648) followed.\nA steamer coming up Halifax harbour ran into a schooner striking her stern on the port side. No sound signals were given. The green light of the schooner was seen on the steamer\u2019s port bow and the latter starboarded her helm to pass astern and then ported. She then was so close that the engines were stopped but too late to prevent the collision.\nHeld, that the steamer alone was to blame for the collision.\nHeld, also, that though under the rules the schooner should have kept her course and also was to blame for not having a proper lookout neither fault contributed to the collision.\nAppeal from a decision of the local judge for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action was brought by the owners of the schooner \u201cAlexander R,\u201d sunk by in Halifax Harbour by collision with the SS. \u201cArranmore.\u201d It was tried before the local judge for the Nova Scotia district assisted by Commander E. B. Tingling, as nautical ; assessor, who filed the following report.\n\u201cAfter carefully considering the evidence given by various witnesses, also the arguments used by counsel relating to the collision between SS. \u2018Arranmore\u2019 and the Schooner \u2018Alexander R.\u2019 in Halifax Harbour, on April 2nd, 1906, I beg to state that, in my opinion, the loss of schooner and cargo rests entirely on the Arranmore.\u2019 The reasons for this finding are based on the fact that the \u2018Arranmore,\u2019 by the evidence of Captain Couillard (which is very plain and straightforward) saw a green light about three points on the port bow ( exonerating the schooner from not complying with article 10 as the \u2018Arranmore\u2019 was not an overtaking vessel) ; on seeing the light, although the \u2018Arranmore\u2019s\u2019 helm was starboarded to allow her to pass astern of the schooner, thereby bringing her a little on the \u2018Arranmore\u2019s\u2019 starboard bow, yet by meeting her with port helm and then giving her port helm he acted unwisely, thus bringing about the collision. Stopping the \u2018Arranmore\u2019s\u2019 engines to prevent going too far to westward when he altered his course was correct, but the fact of his placing the engines full speed astern within such a short period of stopping shews that he found himself so close to the schooner that he apprehended danger of a collision. Doubtless, by rule 21, the non-giving-way-vessel has to keep her course, yet there are occasions when a vessel finding herself in imminent danger has to depart from this rule (see article 27). In this case the schooner cannot be held in default for putting her helm down and coming in to the wind, as although she did not escape the collision, yet the fact of her receiving the blow on the port side of her stern shews that had she kept her course the blow would have been delivered on her star- board side- a point entailing greater danger for the saving of the crew.\n\u201cOne part of the evidence endeavours to shew that the \u2018Alexander R.\u2019 was filling on the starboard tack and had acquired stern way. The evidence to the contrary of this must be accepted as a heavily laden vessel would carry headway for a considerable distance whilst in stays, and if on starboard tack would be headed somewhere W. by N., bringing her port side to the \u2018Arranmore\u2019s\u2019 bow.\n\u201cPrevious to the new edition of the rules and regulations for the prevention of collisions it was optional for vessels to use sound signals when in sight of one another, but the amendment of 1896 makes this rule compulsory. The \u2018Arranmore\u2019 ought to have sounded two (2) blasts of her whistle and then abided by the same. Halifax does not come under the heading of a narrow water. Nowhere, except passing George\u2019s Island, is the channel less than half a mile Avide.\n\u201cNot seeing the \u2018Arranmore\u2019 reflects on the lookout kept on board the \u2018Alexander R,\u2019 but does not materially bear on this case, as the sole cause of this disaster was the improper use of port helm on board the \u2018Arranmore.\u2019\u201d\nThe local judge found the \u201cArranmore\u201d solely to blame for the collision and gave judgment for the plaintiffs, damages to be assessed by the registrar. The \u201cArranmore\u201d appealed.\nHarris K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellant. We contend that the schooner should have kept her course and speed. Articles 22 and 29 were violated by her. The local judge gave no opinion on these questions, and he is mistaken in saying that the issue is merely technical and turns on the propriety of the handling of the respective vessels. The assessor did not answer the questions submitted to him, but undertook to decide, as a matter of law, which ship was at fault.\nThe burthen of proof is not on the steamship: Inman v. Reck[1]; Marsden, pp. 33, 407, 409, 412; The \u201cIllinois\u201d[2]. See also The \u201cSaragossa\u201d[3]; The \u201cHighgate\u201d[4]; The \u201cKhedive\u201d[5], at page 894, and Belden v. Chase[6].\nIt is taken as a fault against the \u201cArranmore\u201d that she did not obey article 28 and indicate her course on her whistle. The rule only comes into operation when there is danger of collision and until the schooner was brought up in the wind there was no danger of collision. The signal would then be of no use, and the non-observance of this rule did not contribute in any way to the collision. The \u201cCuba\u201d v. McMillan[7], at page 661. The great weight of testimony as well as the position of the vessels before and after collision even under the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses shew that a collision would not have taken place had the schooner kept on her course. The assessor\u2019s finding that because the schooner received the blow on the port side, she would have received it on her starboard side if she had not come about is upon the face of it ill founded. The reasoning is only applicable to an otherwise stationary schooner turning on a pivot. His suggestion that the \u201cArranmore\u201d was wrong in reversing her engines, or at least that the reversal of her engines can be regarded as an admission of a previous mistake on behalf of the steamer, is disposed of by the consideration of the fact that the engines were only reversed after the schooner executed the unexpected man\u0153uvre of \u201ccoming about.\u201d\nWe rely also on The \u201cAtlas\u201d[8], at pages 464-466; The \u201cCape Breton\u201d v. The Richelieu & Ont. Nav. Go.[9], at page 576; The \u201cAgra\u201d v. The \u201cElizabeth Jenkins\u201d[10]; The \u201cSamuel Dillaway\u201d[11]; Malzard v. Hart[12], and The North British and Mercantile Ins. Co.v. Tourville[13].\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.G. for the respondents. The particular manoeuvring of the \u201cArranmore\u201d shews that it was her duty to keep out of the way, and if she kept her course until she was so close to the \u201cAlexander R.\u201d as to cause well founded alarm to the schooner that she was being run down and must do something to save the lives of those on board, this was amply sufficient to establish plaintiff\u2019s case.\nThe assessor has found against the contention that the collision was caused by the schooner coming up in the wind, and that but for this action on her part the \u201cArranmore\u201d would have gone clear of her, and he refers, as applicable to this case, to article 27, and that the judgment of the captain of the schooner was well founded, that if she had kept her course she would have received the blow on her starboard side, entailing greater danger to the lives of her crew. See Marsden (5 ed.), pages 3, 51, 52; The \u201cBywell Gastle\u201d[14], at page 219. The absence of a lookout had nothing to do with the collision ; Marsden ( 5 ed.), pages 293, 394, 464; The \u201cFarragut\u201d[15]. Under the Canadian statutes, a vessel which has violated the rules is only deemed to be in fault if it appears to the court that the collision was occasioned by the non-observance of any of the rules prescribed. R.S.C. ch. 79, sec. 5; The \u201cCuba\u201d v. MacMillan[16], pages 660-662; The Hamburg Packet Company v. Des-Rochers[17].\nAs to the \u201cAlexander R\u201d not having a stern light, this is an alleged violation of article 10. The assessor has found that the \u201cArranmore\u201d saw a green light about three points on the port bow and exonerates the schooner from not complying with article 10, as the \u201cArranmore\u201d was not an overtaking vessel.\nThe \u201cArranmore\u201d violated article 28 in not sounding any blast on her whistle, and the question of whether the \u201cAlexander R.\u201d was also to blame depends entirely upon whether her coming up in the wind was under the special circumstances a man\u0153uvre reasonably necessary to avoid immediate danger. That is purely a question of fact, which the court below was peculiarly fitted to determine, and the finding of that tribunal should not be disturbed. The \u201cPicton\u201d[18], at page 653, per Eitchie, C.J.; The \u201cSisters\u201d[19], per Mellor J.; The \u201cEsk\u201d v. The \u201cNiord\u201d[20], per Colville L.J., at page 440; The \u201cSantandarino\u201d v. Vanvert[21]; The Dominion Coal Co. v. The \u201cLake Ontario\u201d[22].\nHarris K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellant\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.G. for the respondents\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice,\u2014We are of opinion, although we get little or no assistance from his notes, that the conclusion reached by the local judge in Admiralty as to the responsibility of the \u201cArranmore\u201d for the collision complained of is justified by the evidence irrespective of the finding by the nautical assessor.\nI must, however, observe that there is authority for the rule that this court will not (in a case involving difficult questions of navigation) interfere with the finding of a nautical assessor when adopted by the trial judge, unless the appellant can literally \u201cput his finger\u201d on the mistake and shew irresistibly that the judgment complained of is not only wrong, but entirely erroneous. The \u201cPicton\u201d[23]; The \u201cReliance\u201d v. Conwell[24], at page 657, and Lord Chelmsford in Gray v. Turnbull[25], page 54.\nThe collision out of which these proceedings arose occurred in the Harbour of Halifax at about 1.40 on the morning of April 2nd, 1906, between the \u201cAlexander R.,\u201d a schooner of 74 tons burden and the \u201cArranmore,\u201d a passenger and freight steamer of about 900 tons burden.\nThe weather was fine and when first seen the schooner was proceeding across the harbour close hauled on the port tack, at a speed of about three knots, and on a course N.N.E. with a moderate breeze from the north.\nThe course of the \u201cArranmore\u201d was about N. half W., her speed nine knots ; the schooner bore about one point on her starboard bow and was distant about one cable and a half\u2014both vessels had the regulation lights.\nThe channel at the place where the collision occurred is stated by the assessor to be over half a mile wide and does not come under the heading of a narrow water.\nIf both vessels kept on their respective courses there was danger of collision.\nWhen those on board the \u201cArranmore\u201d saw the schooner and ascertained the course she was pursuing then rules 20-23 and 28, which were the rules applicable to the circumstances, at once became binding on them and it was the duty of the steamer to keep out of the way of the schooner, and if necessary to slacken her speed, or stop or reverse, and to give proper sound signals. The co-ordinate obligation of the schooner was to keep her course. The contention on the part of the appellant is that if she had complied with this obligation the collision would have been avoided. The \u201cArranmore\u201d has been found by the nautical assessor to be in fault in several respects, and he holds that the schooner was not in any way responsible for the accident.\nWhen the \u201cAlexander R.\u201d was first seen according to the preliminary act \u201cthe helm of the \u2018Arranmore\u2019 was put to starboard to go astern of the schooner and her engines were stopped for about a minute,\u201d and in his evidence the captain tells us that he then found it necessary to give this order to the man at the wheel, \u201cstarboard your helm\u2014there is a vessel on the port side\u2014starboard your helm\u2014give her the helm quick,\u201d indicating that he must have found himself in dangerous proximity to the schooner. His duty then was to stop and reverse, that being the only man\u0153uvre that could have prevented the collision which occurred within a minute or two afterwards. Instead of doing what prudence suggested he put his helm to starboard to pass under the stern of the schooner and then to port to steady her, or, as he says, \u201cto prevent the sheer.\u201d When he attempted to pass, he admits he was so close that it was necessary to stop his engines to let the schooner get away from him which shews that in the circumstances his action was unjustifiable. If to this we add that no sound signal was given either when the steamer was directed to port or when her head was brought again to starboard to indicate her course, the conclusion seems irresistible that the \u201cArranmore\u201d was in fault.\nThe next question is: \u201cWas the \u2018Alexander R.\u2019 also in fault?\u201d It has been strenuously argued before us that the failure to keep her course, thereby violating article 21, makes her responsible. The captain says that he brought his schooner up in the wind only to lessen the effect of the collision which was then inevitable and the nautical assessor finds as a fact that if this man\u0153uvre had not been adopted \u201cthe blow would have been delivered on the starboard side at a point entailing greater danger for the saving of the crew,\u201d and there is nothing in the evidence that I have seen to satisfy me that this conclusion is erroneous.\nI have carefully read the case of \u201cThe Khedive\u201d[26], which was much; relied upon and very properly so by the appellant, and I understand the rule in that case to be as explained by Bowen L.J. in The \u201cBenares\u201d (1888)[27], that it must be shewn conclusively that obedience to the regulations would and could not have avoided the collision: Windram v. Robertson[28], Court of Sessions Oases, affirmed in H.L. (Sc), 1906 W.N. 140. I do not think it.necessary to consider whether or not, as said by King J., in 26 Can. S.C.R. on page 661, it would be necessary under our statute to consider whether the non-observance of the rules complained of did or did not in fact contribute to the collision. On the evidence I am convinced that to have kept her course would not have avoided the collision, and further that for the consequences of a step taken in the agony of a collision and due entirely to the imminence of the danger, the schooner must not be held in fault. Marsden 51 and 52 (5 ed.). I admit that The \u201cKhedive\u201d[29] in effect decides that the regulations issued as orders in council are law and consequently to disobey any article is to break the law, and when any article is involved the exact letter must be observed, but all the articles of the \u201cRegulations for preventing collisions at sea\u201d must be read together as one Code, and if article 21 requires a ship to keep her course, other articles prescribe that she shall take such action as will best aid to avert a collision and that due regard must be had to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the rules necessary to avoid immediate danger. As Lord Bowen said in the case of The \u201cBenares\u201d[30], a captain is not obliged to sail with his eyes open into the jaws of death. Here the captain tells us that to have obeyed article 21 meant almost certain death for his crew, and that to disobey that particular rule was the one chance left open to him to save their lives and in this he is confirmed by the nautical assessor.\nWith reference to the lookout the schooner was in fault, although it is quite true that the whole crew, consisting of four men, were on deck at the time of the collision. It has been laid down, however, that a man on the lookout should have no other duty and should not be called away to attend sheets or braces when a vessel is tacking. The \u201cConstantia\u201d (1)[31]. But in the circumstances I adopt the principle stated by Marsden, (5 ed.) page 464:\nBut if the absence of lookout clearly had nothing to do with the collision, it will not be deemed to be a fault contributing to the collision.\nHere the nautical assessor says:\nNot seeing the \u201cArranmore\u201d reflects on the lookout kept on board the \u201cAlexander R.\u201d but does not materially bear on this case, as the sole cause of this disaster was the improper use of port helm on board the \u201cArranmore.\u201d\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Churchill (Defendants) Respondents.\n1906: December 10, 11 & 26.\nPresent: Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan, and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nBanks and banking\u2014Security for advance\u2014Assignment of goods\u2014-Claim on proceeds of sale\u201453 V. c. 31, s. 74(D.).\nA bank to which goods have been transferred as security for advances under sec. 74 of the Bank Act, 1890, can follow the proceeds of sale of said goods in the hands of a creditor of the assignor to whom the latter has paid them when the purchaser knew, or must be presumed to have known, that the same belonged to the bank.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant Spinney.\nThe defendant Churchill carried on business at Yarmouth, N.S., as a wholesale purchaser of corn, manufacturing the same into cornmeal and other products and selling the same. He formerly did his banking business with the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Bank of Yarmouth, and raised money there by the indorsements of three persons of whom the defendant, Spinney, was one.\nOn the death of one of the three of these endorsers, he applied in June, 1902, to the manager of the plaintiff bank for accommodation, and it was agreed that the plaintiff bank should advance money to Churchill on the security of the corn purchased by him, the bank taking security under section 74 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d on the corn and on the indorsements of the defendant, Spinney, and two others, Wyman and Stoneman.\nAdvances were made by the bank to Churchill from time to time on the security of corn under section 74 of the Bank Act. The bank allowed Churchill to grind the corn into cornmeal and sell the meal for the bank, and take drafts, which were deposited with the plaintiff bank by Churchill and collected by the bank.\nAbout the 26th September, 1903, Churchill was told by Allen, the agent of the plaintiff bank, that he would have to reduce his account, and the last of September or first of October he applied to Allen for a further advance on corn and was informed by Allen that he was instructed not to advance him any more money. At this time a cargo of corn had just arrived and there was a draft for $5,487.47 for this cargo in the Bank of Nova Scotia. Churchill urged Allen to pay this draft and said that he would pay in some securities and that he had accounts on his customers, which he would hand into the bank to cover the advance. Allen, relying on this promise paid the draft. At this time Churchill owed the bank a large sum and there was a large shortage in the corn which, however, was not known to the bank. Churchill had ground up the corn, sold the meal and applied the proceeds for other purposes, and he was then and for a long time had been insolvent.\nOn the same day that he induced Allen to pay the draft for $5,487.47, Churchill immediately went to Stoneman, one of his indorsers and told him how he was situated and sold Stoneman a large quantity of meal, the product of corn pledged to the bank, a much larger quantity than Stoneman had been in the habit of buying\u2014for the sole purpose of protecting Stoneman against his liability as indorser of a note then held by the plaintiff bank, and also, either on the same day or the next day he went to the defendant, Spinney, and says he reported to Spinney the position of affairs, and arranged to give Spinney drafts on the people to whom the corn meal of the bank had been sold for the amount due for such meal. Spinney knew that he had pledged all his corn to the bank\u2014that he was short in his account and had not the corn\u2014that Churchill was insolvent and that Churchill had induced Allen to pay the $5,487.47 draft by promising to hand in drafts for the corn meal that had previously been sold.\nChurchill and Spinney thereupon arranged that Churchill should, instead of drawing the drafts payable to the bank on the form supplied by the bank, draw drafts to the order of Spinney, and instead of handing them to the bank hand them over to Spinney to secure him against his liability as indorser of a note then held by the plaintiff bank. There was no other consideration. Accordingly a number of drafts were drawn by Churchill on the persons who had purchased the bank\u2019s meal and these drafts were turned over and collected by Spinney to the amount of $2,011.77. This action is brought by the bank to recover these moneys so collected.\nThe action was tried at Yarmouth by Mr. Justice Graham without a jury, and he gave judgment for the plaintiff bank for the amount of the drafts, $2,011.77 with interest and costs. From this judgment an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc and the appeal was allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Graham set aside.\nThe plaintiff bank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHarris K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.J. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the bank against Spinney to recover from him the proceeds of certain drafts or bills of exchange drawn by one Churchill on certain of his customers for the price of meal sold to them and which drafts or bills had been handed by Churchill to Spinney, under the following circumstances and by him had been collected.\nChurchill was a dealer in corn, in Yarmouth, N.S., which he placed, as purchased in his warehouse or small elevator and ground into meal, which meal he, afterwards, sold in lots to suit purchasers.\nTo enable him to make the necessary purchases of corn he obtained advances from the plaintiff bank from time to time, which advances he secured by signing to the bank, at the time they were made, the security provided for under section 74 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d and by depositing his own notes for the amount of each advance and also notes indorsed by third parties, of whom Spinney was one, as collateral security.\nThe course of business followed for some year and a half between the bank and Churchill was for the latter to grind the corn into meal, sell the meal on time to his customers and make drafts on them for the amount of their purchases in forms supplied him by the bank, and which drafts were made payable to the order of the bank. As between the bank and its customer it was well understood that the bank was entitled to these drafts, they representing the proceeds of the sale of the corn and meal which they held as security for their advances.\nThese drafts were accordingly, from time to time, deposited by Churchill with the bank and collected by it and the proceeds placed to Churchill\u2019s credit. As between the bank and Churchill it was the right of the bank to receive these drafts and, as between it and Spinney and the other indorsers of Churchill\u2019s notes held as collateral security it was the duty of the bank to place the proceeds of these drafts to the credit of the advances on the corn made by it.\nAbout the beginning of October, 1903, Churchill was notified by the bank that the state of his account was unsatisfactory and that further advances would not be made to him. A cargo of corn had about that time arrived and a draft dated 2nd October, for $5,487 for its price was lying in another bank and, after some negotiations and relying upon certain promises made by Churchill, the plaintiff bank advanced the money to pay this draft. At this time Churchill was hopelessly insolvent and there was a large shortage in the corn and meal which should have been in the warehouse, but although these facts were known to himself the bank was in ignorance of both of them.\nAbout a fortnight previously to this advance being made, namely, on the 26th September, 1903, Spinney had renewed in the bank, for three months, his indorsement of a note of Churchill\u2019s for 2,800, he had and which was then lying in the bank, overdue. He alleges that he was only induced by Churchill to indorse this renewal note by the latter\u2019s promise \u201cto give him security of drafts for the payment of it.\u201d Churchill, on the contrary, says that his only promise was in general terms to \u201cprotect him (Spinney) in case I got into difficulties.\u201d\nImmediately, however, Churchill obtained the advance of $5,487 from the bank, or within a few days afterwards, he went directly to Spinney and, after talking his financial condition over with him, and especially those with the bank, returned to his mill, made drafts upon his customers for meal sold by him to them sufficient to cover the amount of Spinney\u2019s liability and handed these drafts to Spinney which the latter, subsequently, collected and with the proceeds paid off the note for $2,990 which he had indorsed to the bank about a fortnight previously.\nChurchill also took care, after getting the latter advance of $5,487, by similar and analogous practices to protect his other indorsers and creditors, thus leaving the bank with only a fraction of the grain and meal they should have had as security and a similar fraction of the proceeds of the sales of the meal.\nThe learned trial judge found, on evidence which to my mind fully justified his finding, that Spinney knew from the first that the bank held security upon Churchill\u2019s corn and meal and that\nhe was being paid out of corn the price of every particle of which should have been applied to the reduction of Churchill\u2019s indebtedness to the bank. He knew it was the bank\u2019s corn, that money had been obtained from the bank\u2019s agent to pay for the cargo of the \u201cJosie\u201d on a special promise to repay the advance by collections, and he diverted those collections to his own pocket at the expense of the bank. He knew that Churchill was insolvent and could not pay off the bank in any other way; that he had been making losses. The question is whether these findings are sustainable by the evidence. It seems quite clear and to be the only fair and reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence of both Spinney and Churchill, or at any rate from their evidence if read both together, that almost immediately after the large advance of $5,487.47 was made to Churchill he, knowing the desperate condition of his affairs, went to Spinney and discussed his whole financial situation with him. Spinney had been intimately connected with Churchill in business and had been indorsing Churchill\u2019s notes to the bank for advances made to buy this corn for over a year. Spinney then knew of the bank\u2019s security on the corn and meal, knew Churchill was then hopelessly insolvent and it was, then and there, arranged between them that Churchill should make drafts on his customers for meal sold them and hand them to Spinney to secure him as Churchill\u2019s indorser.\nChurchill expressly states that after his conversation with Spinney he returned to the mill, made the drafts, of course payable to Spinney\u2019s order and not to the bank\u2019s, and handed the drafts over to Spinney by whom they were collected and who, with their proceeds, paid off the collateral note he had indorsed to the bank.\nThe only conclusion I have been able to draw is that a gross and manifest fraud was carried out by Churchill upon the bank and that the proceeds of the meal which Churchill was bound to pay over to the bank were fraudulently diverted from the bank to Spinney and Churchill\u2019s other indorsers and creditors, and that, so far as Spinney is concerned, with whom alone we have to deal, he had either full knowledge of all the essential facts which went to make up the fraud, or, at the very least, such knowledge as put him upon inquiry. The authorities seem to be quite plain that, when it is said a person is from the circumstances put to inquiry, as Lord Herschell said in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[1], at page 220:\nthe reason in point of law is that he is deemed to know the facts which he would have ascertained if he had made inquiry. He cannot better his position by abstaining from doing so.\nSee, also, The Earl of Sheffield v. London Joint Stock Bank[2]; and Boursot v. Savage[3].\nI am utterly unable to agree with the following statement of the law by Russell J., in his reasons for judgment:\nAssuming it to be true that Spinney knew down to the minutest particular, the method by which the bank was accustomed to recoup itself for the moneys advanced on the security of the corn and thus effect the object for which the Bank Act is, in itself, not sufficient, namely, that of extending the lien of the security to the proceeds of the sale as well as to the property itself in specie, I do not yet see under what principle the possession of this knowledge would prevent him from competing with the bank in the effort to secure a share of these proceeds.\nI should say that the principle was that his knowledge of the facts made it inequitable and unjust for him to conspire with Churchill to divert the proceeds of the meal sold by Churchill from the bank where he should have placed them and where he was bound by his obligation to the bank to place them, to the pockets of a third person. Churchill\u2019s action in so diverting these proceeds was, in my judgment, fraudulent, and the knowledge which Spinney either actually had or which the law imputes to him under the circumstances makes it contrary to all equity that he should be allowed to retain moneys which he knew or ought to have known belonged to the bank.\nThe meal being admittedly the bank\u2019s, the conditional authority it gave to Churchill to sell the same to his customers and turn over, either the moneys received in payment or the drafts made upon the customers for the price of the meal sold them, gave the bank an equitable right to these proceeds and these drafts as between it and Churchill.\nA payment to Churchill either of the price of meal bought or the draft given for the price by a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice would, no doubt, discharge the purchaser from further liability.\nBut Spinney was not such a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser or a purchaser at all. He was a volunteer simply. A man who had incurred a collateral liability to the bank for advances made on the security of certain meal, the proceeds of the sale of which he knew or must be held under the circumstances to have known, the bank was entitled to receive from Churchill whom they had authorized to sell the meal and, with this knowledge, conspired with Churchill to divert these proceeds into his own pocket without, as far as I can see, any consideration.\nThe authorities, English, United States and Canadian, are alike uniform and I think conclusive upon the law.\nAs Mr. Justice Brewer says in delivering the judgment of the court in The Union Stock Yards Bank v. Gillespie[4]:\nJustice demands that the bank receiving from a factor in payment of a debt from the factor to itself, moneys which it must have known were the proceeds of the property received from his consignor and principal account to that principal for the money so received and appropriated.\nSee, also, Lewin on Trusts (11 ed.), pp. 1074-5; Re Hallett\u2019s Estate[5]; Harris v. Trueman[6], per Manisty J., at page 356; Hancock v. Smith[7]; Trader\u2019s Bank v. Goodfallow[8].\nThe cardinal error, if I may say so, underlying the judgments of the court below is that the bank\u2019s security did not, under the circumstances, cover the proceeds of the sale of their corn and meal, but only the corn and meal in specie. They failed to appreciate the effect of the conditional authority to sell given to Churchill upon those persons who were either purchasers of the meal without valuable consideration or with notice actual or legal of the facts or were mere volunteers, such as Spinney was here.\nThe full protection of the court will be extended to bon\u00e2 fide purchasers without notice either express or constructive, but it will not be extended, under such circumstances as exist in this case, to persons who purchase with full knowledge of the facts or obtain, as Spinney did, the proceeds of the sales with such knowledge.\nIf Churchill had held this meal subject to the bank\u2019s claim, as is admitted, or the proceeds of the meal, when sold, subject to his obligation to pay them to the bank as the owner of the meal, as I hold he then did, it is clear beyond reasonable doubt that no one, not being a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value and without notice, could succeed by an agreement with Churchill in diverting such proceeds into his own pocket. It would be a fraud, deliberate and manifest, on Churchhill\u2019s part, and ignorance alone would enable the party agreeing with him to escape liability for the fraud; but if the alienee was a mere volunteer, such as Spinney, he would be liable for the funds which came to his hands, with or without notice.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of Graham J. restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lewis Chipman.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Sandford H.

In. order to hold some of the areas it became necessary to borrow money and the lender exacted a bonus in stock and bonds which the defendant gave him out of those he received for conveyance of the properties to the company. After deducting a ratable contribution towards this bonus, the defendant delivered to the plaintiffs the remainder of their proportion of stock and bonds, but did not then inform them that such deductions had been made, and they, consequently, made no demand upon him for the balance of the shares and bonds until some time afterwards when they brought the action to recover the securities or their value.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that whether the defendant was to be regarded as a trustee or as the agent of the plaintiffs, he was not entitled, without their consent, to make the deductions, either by way of salvage or to idemnify himself for expenses necessarily incurred in the preservation of the properties; and that, under the circumstances, their failure to demand delivery of the remainder of the securities before action did not deprive the plaintiffs of their right to recover. If the defendant is to be considered a trustee wrongfully withholding securities which he was bound to deliver, he is liable for damages calculated upon the assumption that they would have been disposed of at the best price obtainable. If, however, he is to be regarded as a contractor who has failed to deliver the securities according to the terms of his agreement, he is liable for damages based on the selling price of the securities at the time when his obligation to deliver them arose. Nant-Y-Glo. and Blaina Ironworks Co. v. Grave (12 Ch. D. 738); The Steamship Carrisbrooke Co. v. The London and Provincial Marine and General Ins. Co. ((1901) 2 K.B. 861) and Michael v. Hart & Co. ((1902) 1 K.B. 482) followed.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] which affirmed the judgment of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia ordering judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs for $1,350, with interest and costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment now reported. The learned Chief Justice, at the trial, without entering into any consideration of the facts proved in evidence, merely directed a reference. Upon this reference it appeared that the price paid for the mining properties in question was $444,444 in bonds and stock of the company formed for the operation of the mines, which, at ninety cents in the dollar, amounted to the value of $400,000. The referee reported that the price obtained for the three areas in dispute was $27,000, in bonds and stock of the company, from which the plaintiffs claimed the right of deducting $1,000 as the plaintiffs\u2019 proportion of the expenses incurred in order to obtain money he was compelled to raise by way of the loan for the benefit of the plaintiffs as well as of all others interested in the scheme. The Chief Justice refused to allow this deduction, found that the price of the areas in dispute was $27,000 and directed that the plaintiffs should have judgment against the defendant for $1,350 with interest from the 1st of April, 1903, with costs. The judgment appealed from affirmed this decision.\nNesbitt K.C. and Gormully K.C. (Terrell with him), for the appellant.\nMellish K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014In the year 1899 the defendant (being, with others, interested in some coal lands near Port Hood, C.B.) acquired on behalf of himself and some associates three licenses to search for coal in three several submarine areas in the vicinity of those lands. The licenses were acquired under an arrangement with the defendant\u2019s associates, including one Buckley, the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in title, by which the licenses were to be held in the name of the defendant in trust for all concerned, Buckley being entitled to an undivided one-sixth share of the whole.\nSubsequently it was agreed between the defendant and his associates that, in the event of a consolidation and sale of coal areas near Port Hood, then in contemplation, being carried out, the submarine areas in which Buckley was interested should be included in it at the price of $27,000 to be paid in the securities of a company to be formed to acquire the consolidated properties.\nThe consolidation and sale, promoted by the defendant and some associates, were effected and the whole property was transferred to the Port Hood Coal Co., Limited.\nThe learned judges of the court below, agreeing with the trial judge, the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, have found that the consideration for this transfer consisted of bonds of the company of the face value of $444,444, these being regarded by the promoters concerned as equivalent to $400,000 in cash, which the sale of the bonds at 90 cents on the dollar was expected to realize; with a bonus of shares in the capital stock of the company of a like face value which were not regarded as likely to be immediately saleable.\nNotwithstanding some obscurity in the evidence relating to the transaction, I am not satisfied that this finding ought to be disturbed.\nI think, moreover, that the fair inference from McNeil\u2019s evidence is that, by the arrangement between McNeil and his co-promoters, providing for the distribution of these securities and shares, the owners of the areas in question were to receive the equivalent of $27,000 cash; that is to say, bonds of the face value of $30,000 and shares of a like value. The plaintiff being the owner of an undivided one-sixth share of this property would seem on the face of this state of facts to be entitled to receive a like share of the securities; that is to say, bonds of the value of $5,000 and shares of the same value. They did, in point of fact, receive bonds of the face value of $3,500 and shares of an equivalent amount; and the question of substance raised by this appeal is whether or not the defendant is accountable for the difference.\nIt is plain that the defendant had no general authority to deal with the plaintiffs\u2019 property.\nThe plaintiffs acquired Buckley\u2019s interest after the negotiations looking to the consolidation and sale were under way; and\u2014if not in express words, at least by their conduct\u2014approved of the disposal of that interest for the sum of $27,000 payable in bonds and shares of the purchasing company. But there is no evidence that the defendant was, at any time, authorized to transfer that interest on terms less advantageous to the plaintiffs.\nIt is argued that the parties had in contemplation bonds and shares of the face value of $27,000 only; and the evidence is not explicitly directed to point whether, as between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the price was to be securities of the face value of the sum mentioned, or securities which should be equivalent to that sum in cash.\nI pass without further comment the inherent weakness of the suggestion that a price expressed in bonds and shares in the capital stock of a company to be formed should be fixed without reference to their saleable value or to the total amount of the capital stock or of the bond issue. It is sufficient, on this point, to say that it is not disputed that McNeil was bound to account for the securities actually allotted and received by him in respect of the areas in question; and my view of the evidence being, as I have said, that the bonds and shares which, under the arrangement among the promoters, were to be allotted in respect of these areas, were to be the equivalent of $27,000 in cash, it follows that McNeil is accountable on that basis unless, at all events, it should appear that the agreement was not in point of fact as between him and his co-promoters carried out. On this the evidence is not explicit; but the information being in McNeil\u2019s keeping, I think the court below was justified in inferring, in the absence of any denial by him, that it was carried out. McNeil admits that the division of the securities was made under his direction and he is, I think, accountable on the assumption that those to which the plaintiffs were entitled came into his hands.\nBut the contention is made on the defendant\u2019s behalf that he was entitled to retain out of the plaintiffs\u2019 securities a proportionate part of them as a contribution to a bonus which, it is said, it became necessary to give, in the circumstances to be presently mentioned, after the purchase price of the consolidated properties had been fixed and the allotment in respect of the areas in question agreed upon.\nThe facts on which this contention is based are said to be these.\nAt one stage of the transaction it became necessary to borrow money to meet payments required to be made to prevent the lapse of one or more options under which some of the lands affected by the consolidation were held; the failure to make these payments, it is said, would have been fatal to the success of the scheme, including the sale of the areas in which the plaintiffs were interested.\nThe defendant succeeded in obtaining the necessary loan; but, it is said, the lenders exacted as a bonus, the delivery to them of bonds of the face value of $12,500; and\u2014it is argued\u2014this bonus, being in the nature of a salvage payment of which the defendant\u2019s property got the benefit, that property ought, with the other properties benefited, to supply its proportional contribution. The argument is ingenious; but the principles of the maritime law governing the liability to contribution by way of general average in respect of properties sacrificed or moneys expended for the common safety have obviously no application to the case of a trustee or agent dealing with property under a strictly limited authority and in constant communication with his cestuis que trustent or principal. Nor is there, in my opinion, any room in this case for the application of the principles under which a trustee is entitled, out of the trust property, to indemnity for moneys expended in preservation of it.\nThe bonus was, in my opinion, simply an item in the expense of flotation the burden of which, in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, the promoters had no right to cast upon the owners of the properties transferred. McNeill admits that out of the sum of $400,000 paid by the company, the sum of $200,000 was allotted to the promoters alone in respect of profits and expenses of flotation; and with the exception of those interested in the areas referred to, there is no evidence that it was suggested that any owner of any of the consolidated properties should contribute to this bonus out of the proceeds of the sale of his property.\nMcNeill had plainly no authority from the plaintiffs to charge against the proceeds of the areas in question any such contribution; and in view of the share of the purchase price allotted by the promoters to themselves, it is highly unlikely that, with a knowledge of the facts, they would have assented to such a charge had it been proposed. The deduction is one which, in my opinion, cannot, in the absence of evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 consent, be justified.\nThe plaintiffs are, therefore (subject to the question, which I will deal with, whether or not by laches they have lost their right), entitled to recover the difference between that which the defendant received and that which he accounted for; that is to say, bonds of the face value of $1,500 and shares of a like amount. The judgment of the court below is also impugned on the ground that, while the court has given judgment against the defendant for the cash value of the bonds and shares unaccounted for, calculated upon the basis of their selling value at the date of the defendant\u2019s default, he can be properly called upon only to deliver these bonds and shares in specie; and in default (since no demand was made for the delivery of them before the commencement of the action) to pay damages based upon their value at that date. On this point also, I think, the judgment below is right. The evidence of the plaintiffs, which the court below seems to have accepted, is that they were told that the bonds and shares delivered to them were all that had been received by the defendant on their account; and the fair inference is that they made no demand because they were ignorant of the facts. On the other hand the defendant was under an obligation to account to the plaintiffs at once for that which he received as trustee for them. Treated as a trustee wrongfully withholding property which he was bound under his trust to deliver to his cestuis que trustent, he is liable to make reparation for the loss suffered by the trust by reason of his breach of trust; and (every presumption being made against him as a wrongdoer), that loss must be calculated on the assumption that the securities would have been sold at the best price obtainable. Nant-Y-Glo and Blaina Ironworks Co. v. Grave[2] at page 750; The Steamship Carisbrook Co. v. The London and Provincial Marine and General Ins. Co.[3], at page 866; and in appeal, Michael v. Hart & Co.[4], per Collins L.J., at page 488. Treated simply as a contractor who had agreed to deliver the bonds he is clearly liable to pay damages for the breach of his contract based upon the selling price of the bonds at the time when the obligation to deliver arose. Mayne on Damages, at page 195.\nThere remains the contention that the plaintiffs by their laches have lost their right to relief. The defence is not raised by the pleadings; and it may be that the state of the pleadings accounts for the fact that the evidence does not clearly shew when the plaintiffs first became aware of their rights. The evidence, as I have said, does, I think, fairly lead to the conclusion that at the time of the delivery to them of the shares and bonds which they received they were told and believed that the defendant was giving them all he had got on their account.\nIn the absence of evidence shewing when they became aware of the facts there seems to be no basis of fact to support the defence suggested.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Terrell.\nSolicitor for the respondents: W.

Ry. Co. applied for liberty to build a bridge over the Otanabee, a navigable river, undertaking to construct a draw in it should the Government deem it necessary. An order in council was passed providing that \u201cthe company * * shall construct either a swing in the bridge now in question * * the cost to be borne by themselves or else a new swing bridge over the contemplated canal (Trent Valley Canal) in which case the expense incurred over and above the cost of the swing itself and the necessary pivot pier therefor shall be borne by the Government.\u201d\nA new swing bridge was constructed over the canal by agreement with the company.\nHeld, that the words \u201cthe cost of the swing itself and the necessary peir\u201d included, under the circumstances and in the connection in which they were used, the operation and maintenance also of the swing by the company.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada in favour of the Crown.\nThe suppliants by their petition of right claimed a return of moneys expended in the operation and maintenance of the swing bridge over the Trent Valley Canal and a direction that the expense thereof should be borne by the Crown in future. The circumstances under which such claim arose are set out in the above head-note and in the judgment on this appeal.\nChrysler K.C. for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C., Dep. Minister of Justice, for the respondent.\nGirouard J. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. I do not share the doubts suggested as to the meaning of the agreement with respect to the cost of the operation of the swing in the bridge. The railway company in the first instance applied for liberty to build a bridge over the Otanabee River, which was navigable, undertaking to construct a draw in the bridge should the Government at any time consider this necessary. The order in council granting the application recited the application and that the engineer in charge of the works for the improvement of the navigation while holding the construction of a swing in the proposed bridge unnecessary owing to the proposed construction of a canal, urged that provision should be made for the construction of a swing bridge over the contemplated canal on the Peterborough section of the improvements.\nThe order in council then went on to give the necessary consent to the construction of the bridge over the river on the plans submitted, conditionally\nthe company at the time within two months after being called upon by the Minister of Railways shall construct either a swing in the bridge now in question * * * the cost to be borne by themselves, or else a new swing bridge over the contemplated canal in which case the expense incurred over and above the cost of the swing itself and the necessary pivot pier therefor shall be borne by the Government.\nAn agreement was then entered into between the Government and the company in which, after reciting the application of the company for permission to construct the bridge over the river, the recital went on to declare that in case of the carrying out of the proposed canal for the improvement of the Trent River navigation, a swing in the said bridge might not be necessary, but in that case there should be a swing bridge over the canal. The agreement then recited the conditional permission of the Governor in Council for the construction of the bridge and \u201cfor the fulfilment of certain of the said conditions\u201d and went on to provide\nthat the company should either construct a swing in the proposed bridge or a new swing bridge over the proposed canal (and that) in case of a new swing bridge over the said canal the cost of the swing itself and the necessary pivot pier should be borne by the company and the balance by the Government.\nI think there can be no doubt that the balance here spoken of means the balance of the cost of the construction of the bridge, abutments, approaches, etc.\nNo special words are used as to who shall pay for the cost of operating the swing. The learned counsel for the company frankly concedes that if the swing had been required by the Crown to have been put in the river bridge the cost of operating it would have had to be borne by the company. He does so because as he says its operation would be required for the purposes of navigation. He denies, however, that such concession applies to the swing in the canal bridge. The latter swing was an alternative and substituted one for the river bridge swing. Its object was precisely the same for the purposes of navigation. It was expressly for the purposes of improving the navigation at the point of the river that the canal was constructed and the condition on which the permission to build the river bridge was given at once applied. The same provision as to the construction of a swing in the river bridge which admittedly involved its maintenance and operation must, in my opinion, necessarily carry the same obligation when the alternative and substituted canal bridge was built.\nThe objects of the swing in both cases were the same, the facilitation of navigation and the prevention of its obstruction. The provision for it was expressly made for that object with the privilege left with the Government of choosing in which bridge the swing should be put. The obligations arising as to the operation of the swing are the same in each case and are necessarily involved in the language used.\nThe canal was substituted for the river and the swing in the former bridge substituted for that originally contemplated in the latter. If the construction of the latter necessarily involved its operation, as conceded, so must the substitution of the canal swing carry the same obligation, the object the parties were seeking to attain being the maintenance and improvement of the navigation and the consent to the creation of the river bridge being given conditionally on that paramount right being maintained by means of a swing in whichever bridge the Government elected it should be placed.\nIn short I think \u201cthe cost of the swing itself and the necessary pivot-pier\u201d which the agreement provided the company should bear included under the circumstances and in the connection in which they were used, the operation and maintenance of the swing.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed. I agree also in the general reasoning of my brother Sir Louis Davies, in his judgment herein, but cannot find, as he does, in the closing sentence thereof, that the operation and maintenance of the swing are covered by the expressions used in the agreement.\nI fail rather to find any obligation upon respondent to bear such costs of operation and maintenance or any part of it.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Scott & Curle.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Co., of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, hereinafter for brevity called the second party. Witnesseth\u2014\nSaid first party appoints said second party its sole agent for the sale and lease of the Barr Cash & Package Carriers in the Dominion of Canada, on the terms following, to wit:\u2014\nSaid second party is to manufacture the Barr Cash & Package Carriers at a cost of not over four dollars ($4.00) per line for Cash Carriers, and not over nine dollars ($9.00) per line for Package Carriers.\nSaid second party, in addition to the cost of manufacturing as above ($4.00 for Cash Carriers, and $9.00 for Package Carriers), shall charge to the joint account the cost of any material furnished for erection, such as gas pipe, wire etc., but all other expenses, such as salaries and travelling expenses, shall be borne by the said party of the second part.\nA report of the business done shall be made quarterly, and at such accounting the balance of profit shewn shall be divided equally, one-half going to the credit of the party of the first part, and the other half to the credit of the party of the second part. Said party of the first part to have the right for any representative it may appoint to audit the account of the party of the second part, in so far as any Cash or Package Carrier business may be transacted by said second party.\nFor the non-fulfillment of any of the requirements of this agreement, either party can annul the same by serving notice on the other party.\nTHE HAMILTON BRASS CO., THE BARR CASH & PACKAGE\nLIMITED, CARRIER CO.,\nT.J. Carroll, F.W. Pierson,\nGeneral Manager. General Manager.\nThey acted under it, and accounts were rendered as it provides for, and settlements were had of these accounts, up to some time in August, 1895.\nThis mode of proceeding ceased, and the respondents brought this action on the 13th July, 1900.\nThe late Mr. Justice Street, who tried the action, referred the taking of accounts to the Master in Hamilton, and he proceeded therewith. By virtue of a clause in the judgment he was entitled and bound to have regard to the defence of the Statute of Limitations, which had been set up by appellants.\nHe ruled that the Statute of Limitations barred accounting for anything beyond six years next preceding the action.\nThe appellants had attempted at the trial also to shew that the contract above set forth had been terminated, but this contention was not upheld by the learned trial judge.\nAmongst other things he pointed out that the appellants had no right to terminate it save for cause, and then only by electing to do so, and giving notice. The chief cause assigned to justify termination was that respondents had invaded territory covered by the agreement, by making sales directly, from their own office or place of business, and not through the appel- lants. They had in fact, when complaint was made on this score, agreed to account to and with appellants for profits so received. And I would infer that that branch of the differences between them was at an end, or very easy of solution, if other things had gone forward in an agreeable manner.\nAt all events, the appellants asked for and got in this action judgment for an account of the dealings they had so complained of.\nWithout waiting for any further or future breach they wrote, immediately after the judgment, a letter of which the following is a copy:\nHAMILTON, November 13th, 1901.\nTO THE BARR CASH AND PACKAGE CO.,\nMansfield, Ohio:\nTake notice that, whereas it has recently been held in an action in the High Court of Justice wherein you, the Barr Cash and Package Company, are plaintiffs, and we, The Hamilton Brass Manufacturing Company (Limited), are defendants, that the agreement dated the 10th day of August, 1892, made between you of the first part and ourselves of the second part, for the sale and lease of the Barr Cash and Package Carriers, was not annulled, cancelled and put an end to as was by us contended in said action, therefore, although we do not relinquish our contention that the said agreement was put an end to, to protect ourselves against any future claim being made hereafter, we hereby give you notice that we hereby annul, cancel and put on end to the said agreement.\nDated at Hamilton this 13th day of November, 1901.\nHAMILTON BRASS MFG. CO., LTD.\nT.J. Carroll, General Manager.\nThey then contended before the Master that this terminated the contract, and also any accounting beyond the date of the service of the letter.\nThe Master upheld this contention. On appeal to the late Mr. Justice Street against these rulings of the Master, the appeal was dismissed. The respondents appealed from that decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe latter court allowed the appeal, and held that the Master should not have had regard to the Statute of Limitations, but should have taken the accounts from the beginning of the dealings arising out of the above agreement and continued the same to the date of his report.\nI have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the holding of the Court of Appeal as to the taking of the accounts down to the date of the Master\u2019s report is correct.\nIt is to my mind a matter of practice and procedure. Even though jurisdiction may exist to hear, such an appeal, this court has uniformly refused, unless where natural justice was violated, to entertain such an appeal.\nThe Master would not seem to have had any right to try such an issue as this notice of termination involved. He was merely directed to take accounts, which the court below hold, as matter of practice and procedure of that court, was to extend to the date of his report.\nThe reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice on this and other grounds touching this branch of the appeal seem to me entirely satisfactory.\nI am not so fortunate in regard to the other branch of this appeal. It is by no means so easily disposed of.\nI cannot read the contract between these parties as the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal reads it. Even if I could do so, I am by no means convinced that the case so comes within any exception to the operation of the Statute of Limitations as to enable me to maintain the results arrived at. With the greatest respect, I must differ, and say I can neither accept the process of reasoning by which the learned Chief Justice comes to the conclusions he does, nor see how that conclusion is a necessary result of the train of reasoning he has adopted and set forth.\nThe Pongola Case[1] seems clearly distinguishable.\nThe continuous relationship is a feature common to that case and this, but almost all else seems different in the two cases.\nIt is to be observed that the above quoted agreement makes no reference to patents or rights thereunder.\nIt may further be observed that there are many possible things respecting which such a contract could have been formed, in the language used, and yet not rest on patent or have anything to do with rights under a patent.\nA very slight modification, such as a contract based on a requirement for the use of a piece of wire, made by the respondents, entering into the construction of machines to be made by them, and giving thereto some value they could not otherwise have, though not the subject of a patent, is a conceivable case.\nThe incorporating in such a contract the use of a label or badge of any kind to identify each machine thus contracted for, as approved by the party of the first part, and give it a standing, so to speak, in the market place, would be another.\nHow could the relationship this contract before us creates, if based upon some imaginary thing of that kind, apart from patent altogether, constitute a partnership or agency relation of any kind, that would take the periodical breaches of such a contract (no matter how continuing the contract might be or the relation it created), out of the Statute of Limitations? How much further can an interest in a patent carry it?\nThe relationship created is not in the ordinary sense a partnership. Nor is it a fiduciary relationship, though as in Knox v. Gye[2] the elements of faith and trust in the ordinary sense may have existed and may be found provided for, or rather unprovided for.\nWhere is agency other than that of a fiduciary character or that concrete form of agency that exists in a partnership, excepted from the Statute of Limitations? And how is it there?\nThe origin of the exception as regards partners is explained by Lord Chelmsford in the case of Knox v. Gye2, at p. 684, as follows:\nThe statute 21 Jas. 1, ch. 16, sec. 8, which limited actions of account to six years after the cause of action, contains an exception of such accounts as concern the trade of merchandise \u201cbetween merchant and merchant, their factors and servants\u201d, as to which there was no statutory bar till the 19 & 20 Vict. ch. 97, the 9th section of which Act enacts that all actions and suits for such accounts shall be commenced and sued within six years after the cause of such actions or suits. Now, although the action of account at the time of the passing of the statute of James was one of a peculiar description in the courts of common law (which has since become obselete), the courts of equity, upon bills for an account, considered \u201cthat they were bound to act\u201d\u2014not merely by analogy to the statute, but, in the words of Lord Redesdale in Hovenden v. Lord Annesley[3], \u201cin obedience to it\u201d; and he adds: \u201cI think the statute must be taken virtually to include courts of equity, for when the legislature by statute limited the proceedings at law in certain cases, and provided no express limitations for proceedings in equity, it must be taken to have contemplated that equity followed the law, and therefore it must be taken to have virtually enacted in the same cases a limitation for courts of equity also.\u201d\nHe proceeds to shew by cases I need not refer to, how this was observed; for the cases are covered by Knox v. Gye2, and the discussions therein. Lord Westbury in the same case referred to the statute as follows[4]:\nBy the Statute of Limitations (21 Jas. 1, ch. 16), it is enacted that all actions of account and upon the case (with an exception which has been since repealed) shall be commenced and sued within six years next after the cause of such action or suit, and not after. This enactment is, in effect, repeated in the 9th section of the 19 & 20 Vict. ch. 97 (passed in 1856), with this additional provision, namely, that \u201cno claim in respect of a matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of such action or suit shall be enforceable by action or suit by reason only of some other matter or claim comprised in the same account having arisen within six years next before the commencement of such action or suit.\u201d I deem this provision most material, and therefore I will call your Lordships\u2019 particluar attention to it. It forbids any claim in respect of a matter which arose more than six years before the action.\nThe statutes of limitations having been introduced into Upper Canada (now Ontario), amendments to the law relating to limitations of actions were made from time to time, but without expressly repealing the Statute of James above referred to. These amending enactments are now consolidated in R.S.O., [1897] ch. 72, and the second section thereof contains what is almost identical with section 9 of the \u201cMercantile Amendment Act\u201d upon which Lord Westbury put such stress in the above quotation.\nThis section 2 of R.S.O., [1897] ch. 72, is as follows:\n2. All actions of account or for not accounting, or for such accounts as concern the trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant, their factors and servants, shall be commenced within six years after the cause of such actions arose; and no claim in respect of a matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of the action, shall be enforceable by action by reason only of some other matter or claim comprised in the same account, having arisen within six years next before the commencement of the action.\nIt would seem as if very much of the basis, upon which the exception of partnership dealings out of the statute rested, had passed away. It is not necessary to go further just now in regard to that than to say that these considerations of the matter leave the operation of the exception within very narrow limits.\nSo far as the relations of partners in this regard are concerned, I would adopt the rule laid down by Mr. Justice Lindley in his work on partnership, as follows (p. 552):\nBut now by 19 & 20 Vict. ch. 97, sec. 9, merchants\u2019 accounts are placed on the same footing as other accounts; and partnership accounts, whether they are or are not merchants\u2019 accounts, are within the Statute of Limitations; and those statutes are a bar to an action for an account extending to a period more remote than six years before the commencement of the action, unless there has been a breach of an express trust, or fraud, or payment, or an acknowledgment, such as required by Lord Tenterden\u2019s Act, or unless the partnership articles are under seal. So long, indeed, as a partnership is subsisting, and each partner is exercising his rights and enjoying his own property, the statute of limitations has, it is conceived, no application at all; but as soon as a partnership is dissolved, or there is any exclusion of one partner by the others, the case is very different, and the statute begins to run.\nI find this last sentence met with the approval of Malins V.C. in Noyes v. Crawley[5], at p. 39.\nDoes this last sentence of the quotation from Lindley not mean that there can be no cause of action as between partners as such whilst the relation exists? So long as there is no cause of action there can run no time against it. So far from the argument pressed upon us as to the special forms of so called partnerships, that have not in them the usual elements of any legal definition of partnership, supporting any widening of this exception of partnership from the statutes of limitations, it suggests the possibility in these specialized forms, so to speak, of the relation, con- taining in them covenants between such partners out of which causes of action might arise and the statute become operative.\nI do not express any opinion as to that, but desire by way of noticing the chief argument presented to us, and of illustrating my meaning, to suggest the tendency of the law since the amendment referred to.\nThis contract now in question, as clearly as possible, anticipates a quarterly reckoning, and accruing liability to pay, and payment, or such a breach, by reason of default of payment or default to report, as will give a right to sue therefor. Each such breach comes within the very words of the section just quoted above.\nI think the appeal, so far as it relates to the right of appellants to set up the Statute of Limitations, should be allowed, and effect be given to said statutes. Giving effect thereto does not imply that if there were fraud the account could not go beyond the six years. No case of fraud, however, was presented or pressed on us. It would seem as if the omission to report, or defective report, had arisen from a misunderstanding or misconstruction of the contract.\nAs success seems thus divided, there should be no costs either here or in the Court of Appeal. And especially so as the ground on which I proceed was not raised or argued.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Staunton & O\u2019Heir.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Denton, Dunn & Boultbee.\n[1] 73 L.T. 512.\n[2] L.R. 5 H.L. 656.\n[3] 2 Sch. & Lef. 607, 631.\n[4] At p. 672.\n[5] 10 Ch.

M., who had not been a competitor in that race, came along the same track, from an opposite direction to that in which N. was going, driving his vehicle at excessive speed and, in attempting to pass in a narrow space between the ridge formed by the snow and N.\u2019s sleigh, collided with it, causing injuries to N. and damaging his sleigh and harness.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (39 N.S. Rep. 133) that even if M. was lawfully upon the track in question he was responsible for damages as the accident was solely attributable to his improvident carelessness and want of judgment.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], by which, on an equal division of opinion, the judgment of Meagher J. at the trial, in favour of the plaintiff, was affirmed.\nThe circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported. James A. McLean K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. and Kaulbach for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014At the close of the appellant\u2019s argument we did not think it necessary to call upon the respondent, plaintiff\u2019s counsel. No such prim\u00e2 facie case was made out as would warrant our reversing the judgment of the trial judge, although the judges of the court in banc were equally divided. On the contrary, we thought that judgment perfectly sound.\nAssuming for the sake of argument the appellant\u2019s contention to be correct, that on the horse-race day in question (which took place in winter on a public harbour frozen over, there being five straight tracks lying alongside of each other, divided by ridges of snow 18 to 20 inches wide and less than a foot high, with sloping sides) he, the appellant, was in the exercise of his rights driving along No. 4 track at a speed of about 2.50, does that exonerate him from responsibility for the collision?\nThe question is not, was he a trespasser in driving on that track at the time he did but whether he so exercised and used his rights as not to injure his neighbour who was also there possessing equal rights.\nIt was not necessarily an act of negligence per se to drive at the rate of 2.50 per mile. But it was clearly negligence under the circumstances of this case, even adopting the appellant\u2019s own evidence as a correct account of the accident. The defence consisted solely in the assumption of contributory negligence by the plaintiff. In what did that negligence consist? We asked during the argument time and again for evidence of that.\nPlaintiff was driving along at a walk on No. 4 track, by the evidence of himself and his witnesses, and on his proper side of the track. Defendant was meeting him driving at a great speed, shewing to some friends what his horse could do as a trotter. He says he saw plaintiff a couple of hundred yards ahead of him coming along with his horse. He says he slackened\nhis horse\u2019s speed as they approached, but could not rightly say how far away from him. I did not think there was going to be a collision. I certainly thought I was going to go right past him.\nNow appellant was not charged with wilfully causing the collision, but with negligently causing it. He may have been rightly where he was, but if he drove at the rate he admits under the circumstances, and while thinking he would go past all right found he had entirely misjudged, and collided with and injured the plaintiff, how could the latter be held responsible?\nIt was, under the circumstances, the improvident carelessness and want of judgment of the appellant which caused the accident, and not any negligence of the plaintiff who was walking his horse, on his own side of the track and, at any rate, leaving in defendant\u2019s judgment, as stated by himself, plenty of room, so that he thought he could safely pass. He must take the consequences of his own carelessness and bad judgment.\nWe have stated shortly the grounds of our decision in deference to the differences of opinion in an equally divided court below. Otherwise we were quite ready to dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by Meagher J. who tried the case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs in this court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James A.

L.R. 524) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and enter a nonsuit or make art order for a new trial.\nThe- action was for trespass by the railway company by constructing and operating their railway across lands in the Parish of St. Hilaire in the County of Madawaska, N.B., without taking proceedings for its expropriation and making compensation for the land taken by the company for their line of railway. The company denied the plaintiff's title and also contended that, even if he was in possession of the land in question at the time of their entry and the construction of the railway thereon, he had acquiesced and stood by without objecting for fifteen years before action and that he could not, at so late a date, bring an action for trespass or claim damages.\nUpon the answers of the jury to questions put to them at the trial, Mr. Justice Landry entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff and gave him damages assessed at the rate of ten dollars per annum for the six years preceding the institution of the action.\nBy the judgment appealed from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in bane, refused to set the verdict aside and enter a judgment of nonsuit or to order a new trial.\nThe judgment in the court below was rendered on the 15th of June, 1906, and notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was given on the 21st June, 1906. No proceedings towards the prosecution of the appeal were taken until the 17th of August, 1906, when a summons was taken out, returnable on the 23rd of that month, to settle the case on appeal and, on 27th August, 1906, Mr. Justice McLeod, one of the judges of the court appealed from, made an order under section 42 of the \"Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,\" granting leave for the appeal and approving the security bond filed by the appellants.\nOn the present appeal coming on for hearing a motion to quash was made on the ground that the appeal had not been properly taken within the sixty days limited by the statute and that the order so made by Mr. Justice McLeod, after the expiration. of the sixty days, was ultra vires and could not then be made under or in virtue of said section 42.\nHazen K.C. for the motion,\nStevens K.C. contra.\nThe court ordered that the appeal should be heard upon the merits.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgment now reported.\nStevens K.C. for the appellants.\nHazen K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDAVIES J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument I was strongly of the opinion that the plaintiff (respondent), whose only claim to the lands, for trespass upon which he brought this action, was alleged possession, had entirely failed to make out a case to go to the jury and should have been nonsuited. Mr. Hazen, for the respondent, submitted that there was some evidence, however slight, for the jury and urged very strongly that the evidence subsequently given by the appellants sheaved that there had been some negotiations on the part of the railway company with the plaintiff to buy out his claim, and that the Government of New Brunswick had a year or two ago recognized plaintiff's claim to the remainder of the block of land not taken by the railway company, and that all this evidence, combined with the plaintiff's user of that block of land for the last fourteen or fifteen years, together constituted sufficient evidence to warrant the finding of the jury that, at the time the railway company entered upon and took possession of the strip of land required by them for the track of their railway the plaintiff was in possession of it.\nThe question upon which the case largely, if not entirely, turned was whether or not the plaintiff was at the time of the taking of the land in question by the railway company its actual possessor. If he was not, then no other question need be considered and he must be nonsuited.\nThe evidence shews to my mind, beyond any doubt, that plaintiff was not only not in possession of the land at the time referred to, but that he knew that he was not, and that it was not till many years afterwards that the idea first entered into his mind that he could have any claim for damages for the land against the appellants. In his evidence he says he was working with Ritchie, a sub-contractor of the railway, near, but not on, the locus and goes on to say:\nThere was no question about them taking possession. I never said a word. I didn't think I had possession of the point at the time.\nAnd then, being asked the question :\nQ.\u2014And you didn't think so until just here about a year ago when this question came up about selling it to the Government?\nA.\u2014Yes. I had a notion two or three years ago, four or five years ago. I always thought I would try and get my pay out of them. I have had that in my mind the last seventeen years, and Mr. Laforest was going around getting persons to sign the deeds, and Denis Hebert, next door neighbor, paid him a hard $l00.\nLater, being asked as to whether Daniel Chisholm was not in possession at the time the railway was built, he said: Yes; when I would go on there, Chisholm wouldn't interfere with me and I didn't with him. I knowed my father gave Chisholm permission to go on and use the point and I didn't interfere with Chisholm and he didn't with me. I guess everybody had a hand in the soup then; they would go on there and I didn't bother any body and nobody bothered me.\nNot a single overt act of possession was attempted to be proved by plaintiff before and up to the time the railway company entered beyond the vague claim that he had used the land for pasture one summer in common with Chisholm and others. As the land was vacant and admittedly being used also for pasture by Chisholm and others at the same time, it would be difficult to hold such vague evidence of casually pasturing cattle on it as evidence of possession.\nThe fact was that such evidence as there was of actual possession in any one of the land in question at the time the railway entered sheaved it to have been in Chisholm who paid rent for it to another man.\nChisholm left there and abandoned the possession in 1893, two years after the railway company had entered and built their track and with respect to such part of the \"point\" as the railway company had not taken, it was after that possessed and occupied by plaintiff.\nSuch rights as he had in these lands outside of the railway belt and specially excepting that belt, were purchased from the plaintiff by the provincial Government about a year or more before this action was commenced.\nIt would be impossible, however, to infer possession by the plaintiff of the railway belt at the time the railway company entered on the land under the evidence given by the plaintiff himself, from the subsequent user by him of the remainder of the land or from the purchase of his squatter's rights in such remainder by the Government.\nHis possession previously to defendants' entry seems to have been purely imaginary and such as he did have arose subsequently and never embraced the railway track which has been fenced off for the past fifteen years or more. The finding of the jury on the point was not one which reasonable men could fairly have come to under the evidence and must be set aside and the appeal allowed with costs and a judgment of nonsuit entered as proposed by Chief Justice Tuck in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Stevens & Lawson. Solicitors for the respondent: Laforest & Jones.\n[1] 1 East. L.R. 524.\n"}

In 1904 the bridge was reconstructed and made wider, being brought to within from 14 to 20 inches of the wires, which had become worn and ceased to be insulated. G., a boy under nine years of age, while playing on the bridge, put his arm through the railing and his hand touching the wire he was badly injured.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont. L.R. 413), that the plans and deeds in evidence shewed a dedication as a public highway of the bridge and land of each side of it and such highway included the land over which the wires passed.\nHeld, also, that the wires in the condition in which they were at the time of the accident were dangerous to those using the highway and the company were liable for the injury to G.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside the verdict for the plaintiffs at the trial and dismissing the action.\nThe facts are stated as follows by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal. The facts of the case lie in a comparatively narrow compass. Several years before the occurrence which gave rise to the action, a private corporation known as the Scottish Ontario Land Company were the owners of a large plot of ground in the Township of York near the City of Toronto, part of which they laid out into building lots, laying out streets thereon which connected with existing highways in the township. They had also in order to provide for access to and from the city built a substantial bridge 24 feet in width over a wide and deep ravine on their property. Neither the street (Glen Road) as laid down on the plan through the ravine nor the bridge over it had been assumed by the defendant township as a public highway though the latter as the settlement in the township grew up came into constant and extensive use. After the bridge was built and some nine or ten years before action, the defendants, the Toronto Electric Light Company, carried their wires west of the bridge across the ravine on poles along the sides and bottom of the ravine, the wire as it came up the incline at the north end of the bridge being between six and seven feet from the west side of the bridge according to the recollection of such witnesses as could speak to its position at that time. The right of the defendants to erect these poles and carry their wires across the ravine in this manner was not in dispute and they or some of them were connected with poles for arc lights a short distance beyond the north and south ends of the bridge.\nIn course of time the bridge became out of repair and dangerous and while it had become of great importance to a large section of the public in the city and township, the company who had built it had ceased to have much, if any, interest in its mainten- ance and had put up a notice that persons using it did so at their own risk, and the township disclaimed any obligation to repair it. The legislature finally intervened and by the 3 Edw. VII. ch. 89, after reciting that the bridge had become to all intents a public highway, enacted that the township without passing any by-law for the purpose should re-construct and repair it as a local improvement, assessing the cost upon the property benefited as described in the Act. The works were to be performed under the supervision of a competent engineer to be appointed by the county judge, but their construction was not to impose upon the township any liability for their future maintenance and repair.\nThe new bridge thus built by the township under the authority of the Act was being practically used for traffic of all kinds by the end of the first week in August, 1904, though some work remained to be done upon it and it was not finally approved by the engineer in charge until the middle of September, subject to some painting being done upon it which seems not to have been completed before the 1st of October.\nThe bridge was an iron structure four feet wider on each side than the old one, or in all a trifle more than 32 feet wide. On each side it was protected by a lattice-work iron railing 4 ft. 1 in. in height above the side walk of the floor of the bridge with lozenge shaped openings therein 16\u00bc in. in height by 10\u00bc in. in width. The distance between the railing and the defendant company\u2019s wire as reduced by the widening of the bridge was variously stated as from 14 to 20 inches, the wire being at the place where the plaintiff touched it a little lower than half way between the top of the railway and the floor of the bridge. On the 8th of October, 1904, the plaintiff, a boy of between 8 and 9 years of age, who was crossing the bridge or playing thereon with some companions, pushed his arm through one of the lower openings in the lattice work of the railing and touched or took hold of the wire. There was some reason to suppose from his examination before the trial that he was attempting to reach it with a small metal toy he had in his hand, but this he would not admit or did not remember when giving his evidence at the trial. The insulation of the wire being imperfect the result was that the boy\u2019s hand, where it had taken hold of the wire, and his head, which rested upon or touched part of the iron work of the railway, were very severely burnt.\nMillar and J.D. McDougall for the appellants referred to Nelson v. Branford Lighting and Water Co.[2]; Thomas v. Wheeling Electrical Co.[3]; Schweitzer\u2019s Administrator v. Citizens\u2019 General Electric Co.[4]\nHellmuth K.C. and G.L. Smith, for the respondents. Smith v. Hayes[5], collects the cases on negligence to date of the decision.\nDefendants had no notice of the widening of the bridge. Styles v. Cardiff Steamboat Co.[6]; City of Toronto v. Toronto Electric Light Co.[7]\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the reasons stated by Davies J. DAVIES J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment ordered by the trial judge based upon the findings of the jury restored.\nThe action was brought to recover damages sustained by an infant boy of 8\u00bd years of age through his hand coming in contact with an uninsulated wire of the defendant company carried near to a public bridge crossing a deep ravine in the outskirts of Toronto and over which bridge the boy was lawfully passing when the accident occurred.\nThis bridge had shortly before the accident been re-constructed and widened at the upper part over which the public passed by the Township of York under special legislation passed for the purpose.\nBefore the bridge was so widened the defendants\u2019 wires were stretched across this ravine, but at a distance from the bridge which prevented any such accident occurring, and it was the widening of the bridge which brought it and the wires to the close proximity which existed at the time the accident occurred.\nThe bridge as widened had been in use by the public for some months and there was evidence that the trimmer employed by the defendants crossed this bridge daily during that time in the discharge of his duties and ought to have seen and reported to his employers the danger.\nThe jury, after a charge to which no objection is made, found the defendants guilty of negligence and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the boy.\nThere was an iron fence about four feet high along the sides of the bridge in which were lattice-work diamond-shaped openings 16\u00bc inches long by l0\u00bd inches wide, and it was through one of these openings that the boy put his hand which came in contact with the uninsulated wire.\nThe ground upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeded was that the bridge was the extreme width of the highway and that while if the wires had been so close to the bridge that any one lawfully crossing it might accidentally touch them, a jury might find negligence, such a finding could not be made where the wire was beyond the side of the bridge outside of the highway and\ncould not be reached or touched by any one without intending to do so or without stretching out through the railing beyond the side of the bridge and therefore outside of the highway.\nWithout expressing any opinion as to whether this statement of the law could be upheld or not, it is sufficient to say that in some strange way the facts were misapprehended by the Court of Appeal.\nThe plan with the writings from the owners and others put in evidence at the trial dedicating the lands across the ravine as a highway shews the latter to be of the same width across the ravine as the streets leading up to the ravine on each side. This plan was before us, having been returned amongst the exhibits, and leaves no doubt upon that point. Coupled with the legislation authorizing the enlarging and widening of the bridge there does not seem to be any reasonable doubt either of the dedication of these lands as a highway, or their acceptance as such by the township or the fact that the highway was much wider than the bridge. If these facts had not been misapprehended by the Court of Appeal, I think from the language and reasoning used by them their judgment would have been different.\nA question was raised as to whether the defendant company had had notice of the widening of the bridge, but the bridge had after its re\u2011construction been used by the public as a highway for several months, and I have no doubt under the evidence that they must be taken to have had knowledge or at any rate ample means of knowledge of the material facts.\nThe defendant company transmitting such a dangerous element as electricity through their wires thus strung along a public highway fall short of being insurers, but are bound to exercise the greatest possible care and to use every possible precaution for the protection of the public.\nTheir wires in the condition in which they were at the time and place where the boy was so badly injured constituted a danger to those using the highway and were in fact a nuisance. They had become worn and defective and had ceased to be insulated and to offer any protection in case they came into contact with any one. These uninsulated wires were within a few inches, between 14 and 20, of the railing of the bridge, and it ought to have been present to the minds of the defendant company that if not grown up people at any rate children crossing the bridge or playing upon it would be exceedingly likely to touch the wires. To my mind the maintenance of these dangerous uninsulated wires charged with deadly electricity within a few inches of the bridge over which a large number of people daily passed for some months after its re-construction had been completed, and coupled with the other facts proved, fully justified the findings of the jury.\nThe observations of the judges of the Court of Appeal which decided the case of Harrold v. Watney[8] are much to the point. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant has taken before as a ground that seems to have been ignored in the court below.\nMr. Justice Osler, who writes the judgment of that court, says:\nthe highway near which the wire was erected was a bridge. It extended to the width of the bridge and no further.\nIt seems to me that the return of the plans and deeds to the registry office, after the trial, kept out of sight of the Court of Appeal very important pieces of evidence, and hence, I am inclined to think, this conclusion of fact arrived at by Mr. Justice Osler, upon which his judgment rests.\nIn light of the documents I refer to I cannot arrive at the same conclusion of fact as Mr. Justice Osler proceeds upon, and hence I arrive at a very different result from that he concludes with.\nUnquestionably the highway extended far beyond the side of the bridge at the time of the accident.\nA company known as the Scottish, Ontario and Manitoba Land Co., Limited, acquired, in the Township of York, a tract of land to be developed as a residental district outside of Toronto. A part of this land was surveyed into lots and plans were registered, of which plan No. 661, filed herein was one that was registered by the company in 1886. The land thus surveyed stretched northerly from a point about 600 or 700 feet beyond the line dividing that township from the City of Toronto. A deep ravine filled the intervening space between this line and that land.\nAt about that time this company acquired a strip of land eighty feet wide, stretching across the ravine and connecting the land plotted, as in plan No. 661, and other plans referred to, with the end of Glen Road (a street in Rosedale, now in the City of Toronto), which had run up to the boundary line between Toronto and York township.\nThe company opened from the ravine, through their land on the northerly side of the ravine, in the course of the surveys just referred to, a road running northerly under the same name of Glen Road.\nObviously, the acquisition by the company of the strip across the ravine was for the express purpose of using it as a highway and by means of building thereon a bridge (on a level high enough to make it easy of access to travellers), to connect thereby the Rosedale end of Glen Road and the extension of Glen Road on the surveyed lands of the company on the north side of the ravine. The bridge was built at a height of about 125 feet above the deeper parts of the ravine.\nThe conclusions I draw from all the facts before us relative to this strip of land, and especially the conformation of the ground; the improbability, if not impossibility, of its use for building purposes; that it was intersected by a public highway, and the temporary device of granting by deed the use of this bridge to each purchaser of a lot of these surveys, are that the company never intended to use it for any other purposes than to subserve the uses of a public highway; that the future appropriation of the entire strip, for such purpose, was intended by the company; and its dedication also intended so soon as the development of the settlement being created would induce some public authority to accept, for the public, such dedication and save the company from the burthen of maintenance of such a structure as this bridge.\nAs things progressed the settlement came to need light. The respondents furnished the light. They were, under the law by virtue of which they had become incorporated, entitled to use any street, highway or public place subject to agreement between them and the municipality in which the street, highway or public place lay, for erecting poles and stringing thereon the necessary wires to conduct their electric current.\nThey used Glen Road, clearly then a public highway, on either side of this ravine, for stretching thereon the electric wire of which the connecting part is now in question.\nThis use of Glen Road is, I think, attributable to an exercise of the right I advert to. In process of exercising that right, I have no doubt, they stretched across this ravine alongside of the bridge and over the strip thus intended for dedication, the wire they were putting up on Glen Road, as already stated, under the impression that the strip referred to across the ravine formed part of the public highway. The place where they thus stretched the wire across the ravine, some ten years or more after the bridge was built, would present the appearance of a public highway to any one looking at it then, used as it was, as part of the public highway known as Glen Road.\nIt would be manifestly absurd to suppose that such a company as respondents, at every step, verified the public title to the highway, rather than accept the appearances as facts.\nSuch being the interpretation I put upon the facts as a matter of historical research gathered from the evidence, now in the case, what follows? Can the respondents claim that they are not bound by the events that followed as clearly as if they had built along and upon what was an actual public highway? Whether built under license such as would be conformable to the purpose of the company, or as of right, looking at the place in question as part of the highway, the company are clearly subject, in light of what happened afterwards, to the liability that attaches to them in every case where they use the public highway.\nWhat happened is this. The bridge was needing reconstruction; the public needs were growing; the company and other owners of lands were getting tired of so irksome a situation. They agreed to dedicate, and so far as they could dedicated, by making a plan, dated 28th July, 1902, and registered as No. 1,248, in the registry office on the 22nd July, 1903.\nThis plan bears upon it the following certificate:\nThis plan shews the lands coloured pink which by this plan and registered plans numbers 528, 661 and 1135 are laid out as Glen Road, Pelham Place, Bin-Scarth Road, Scholfield Avenue, Edgar Avenue and Maclennan Avenue and all parts of the said roads, avenues and place which are not or have not already been dedicated as public highways are hereby dedicated as public highways and for such purpose all estate and interest therein is hereby assigned and conveyed to the corporation of the Township of York, as witness the hands and seals of the parties hereto. Dated the 28th of July, A.D. 1902. (Signed, sealed and delivered, in the presence of R.J. Maclennan.)\nIt is executed by the company affixing their seal and many other owners signing and sealing the same. It is certified to by a surveyor as correct. The roads or road allowances referred to as pink coloured include the eighty foot wide strip across the ravine which has been referred to so frequently already.\nLands were thereafter sold and deeds thereof registered in accordance with said plan in a way that, by the terms of R.S.O. ch. 181. sec. 39, constituted this strip of land a public highway.\nBut we find, side by side with these events, others marching along to fit into and so supplement these acts as to complete the dedication of the entire strip.\nThat intended dedication was acted upon by the legislature of Ontario, by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 89, being \u201cAn Act respecting Glen Road Bridge, in the Township of York.\u201d\nI think a good deal might be said in support of the position that this Act might be taken as a legislative declaration that the bridge had long before the passing of the Act which was assented to on the 12th June, 1903, become to all intents a public bridge, and, therefore, to be presumed as dedicated at an earlier stage than the date of this legislation.\nI do not conceive it necessary to do more than indicate that a consideration of the various dates, and the order of events I have related might be taken to indicate that this legislation as well as this declaration, emanating from the company who owned the land, was in truth the fulfilment of a long settled purpose that something like this should happen to the bridge and the land in question. Clearly, as if it had been admitted on the pleadings, I take it these acts, at all events coupled with the action of the township council in obeying the mandate of the legislature by reconstructing the bridge, may be looked upon as a final and conclusive acceptance by the public of the proffered dedication.\nLet us see how that bears on the company and its obligations now in question. It is not now, as the result of all this, the case of an owner of a highly dangerous wire adjoining or adjacent to the highway, but of an owner, whose highly dangerous wire has, by reason of neglect, become a public nuisance on the highway, even assuming it to have been in some way or other brought there in the first place lawfully. The statute enabling the company to use the public highway enables them to maintain works so constructed and must, I think, be taken, by implication, to mean a maintenance in a proper manner so as not to become a public nuisance.\nIt seems needless to argue that a wire of the character in question, fourteen or twenty inches from a bridge, such as that in question, strung along and over a public highway, is a nuisance. Companies engaged in such operations must conduct them with due regard to the public safety when enjoying the liberty of using the public highway in common with the rest of the public.\nThis solution of the highway question changes the whole aspect of the case. The question of notice can hardly be said to arise upon such a solution.\nThe conceivable case of a company having a clear grant of right to use a piece of private property a distance from the public highway, and that highway being suddenly enlarged in width, so as to render a continuation of the wire dangerous, although on private ground, might raise the question of the necessity for notice in a way that is not now raised in this case.\nThis case is: The company believing all the time that they were on the public highway and for over a year, at least, before the accident actually being thereon, chose to set up that they had not notice of the changes of structure upon the highway. I think the company are not relieved from their duty to the public by simply constructing properly. They must observe what experience teaches them more than anybody else the possibility of wires of this character getting out of repair, breaking down, or in many other ways becoming a source of danger to the public. If they choose for a long period of time to neglect that duty, I think they must, when on a public highway, in like manner as municipal corporations, be presumed to know that which it was their duty to know in relation to the want of repair of their property on the public highway. The obligation to repair in such a case is analogous to the obligation of a municipal corporation bound to repair. I think the analogy may well be, in relation to notice, treated as complete.\nThe facts are found by the jury, on evidence proper to be left to the jury, and I think the judgment of the learned trial judge thereon ought to be restored. The appeal should be allowed with costs; but I cannot help remarking that the proof adduced might well have been made clearer and ought to have been, when once made, kept before the court.\nMACLENNAN and DUFF JJ. concurred with His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smith, Rae & Greer.\n[1] 12 Ont.

Walcott v. Robinson (11 L.C Jur. 303); Miller v. D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne (8 Q.L.R. 18); Turcotte v. Dansereau (26 Can. S.C.R. 578); and King v. Dupuis (28 Can. S.C.R. 388) followed. The Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. v. Turcotte (Q.R. 2 Q.B. 305); Allan v. Pratt (13 App. Cas. 780), and King-horn v. Larue (22 Can. S.C.R. 347) distinguished.\nGirouard J. dissented.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Gasp\u00e9, by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was maintained with costs, the attachment before judgment therein quashed, an intervention by the present respondents maintained and the respondents declared to be owners of a quantity of spool-wood which had been seized under the provisional attachment.\nOn the appeal coming on to be heard, a motion was made on behalf of the respondents to quash the appeal on the ground that the sum or value demanded by the action being only $850.49 the judgment was not appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada, although the value of the wood seized and claimed by the intervention exceeded the sum or value of $2,000.\nThe questions raised upon the motion are fully discussed in the judgments now reported.\nStuart K.C. for the motion.\nFlynn K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court, upon the motion, was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The plaintiff Cot\u00e9 brought, in July, 1905, an action in the Superior Court, at Gasp\u00e9, against one Dionne to recover the sum of $804.49, and at the same time procured a writ to attach, by way of saisie-arr\u00eat before judgment, the goods of his debtor on the alleged ground of fraud and secretion. Thereupon certain spool-wood was attached as the property of the defendant, and subsequently The James Richardson Company, Limited, applied for and obtained leave to intervene in the suit between Cot\u00e9 and Dionne, alleging that the wood seized was really their property. By the intervention and exhibits filed in support the value of the wood is alleged to be over $4,000.\nThe plaintiff in the main suit then became defendant on the proceedings in intervention. He contested the claim of the intervenants to the wood and denied that they had any title to it.\nOn these issues the parties went to trial. After the evidence was practically all in, the grounds of intervention were, by leave of the court, amended and the amended intervention and a new plea were filed, but the issue as to the ownership of the wood remained substantially the same.\nThe defendant in the main action suffered judgment by default, but the attachment was set aside, the intervention maintained and The Richardson Company declared to be the owners of the wood seized.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench this judgment was confirmed, Lacoste C.J. and Blanchet J. dissenting, and from this judgment the present appeal is taken.\nOn the appeal to this court the question of jurisdiction is raised. I take it to be settled now beyond doubt that the extent of our jurisdiction depends upon the amount in controversy and that, by the amendment 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 3, sub-sec. 4, is determined by the amount demanded.\nOn the issues now before us what is the demand? Undoubtedly that contained in the intervention. The suit between Cot\u00e9 and Dionne was disposed of by the judgment in the Superior Court and the judgment appealed from is that rendered by the court of appeal on the merits of the intervention in which the matter in controversy is the title of the intervening parties to the lumber seized. It was to assert this title that they intervened and the issue between them and the plaintiff, defendant in the proceedings in intervention, is as to the validity of that title. If the judgment appealed from is confirmed they, the intervening parties, re- main in undisputed possession of the lumber; if on the contrary it is reversed then the property does not revert to the plaintiff, defendant in the intervention to be disposed of as his interest may appear, but remains vested in the original defendant Dionne and liable to the claims of all his creditors, the plaintiff bringing his attachment securing to himself priority of satisfaction unless the debtor is insolvent, in which case he would only be entitled pari passu with the rest of the creditors. The course of proceeding when insolvency is alleged is to give notice to the creditors to come in and prove their debts by a particular day after which a final distribution of the property is made among them. Articles 672 and 673 C.P.Q.\nAn intervention is \u201ca judicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning of section 29 of the \u201cSupreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\u201d\nThe intervening party stands in the same position as a plaintiff. L\u2019intervention n\u2019est que Vexerciser d\u2019une action; Rousseau & Laisney, Vol. 5, p. 494, n. 8[1]. When, as in the present case, the intervenant is a third party who comes into the case, not to maintain nor contest the principal demand, but to assert a right personal to himself, new issues are raised which may be disposed of independently of the main suit: Walcot v. Robinson[2]. The proceeding in intervention was to all intents and purposes an action in revendication; Miller v. D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne[3]. It has been held that the withdrawal of the principal demand does not put an end to the intervention: Mulholland v. Benning[4]; Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, Adolphe, T. 3, Q. 12734. On doit distinguer le cas o\u00f9 la demande principale est repouss\u00e9e par des motifs tir\u00e9s du fond, de celui o\u00f9 elle est rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 raison d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une fin de non-re\u00e7evoir.\nDans le premier cas, auquel se rapportent les deux esp\u00e8ces jug\u00e9es par la Cour de Bourges, les 2 avril, 1828 ( J. de cette Cour. 7e Ann\u00e9e, p. 237; S.V. 29, 2, 248), et 13 mai, 1831 (J. Av. t. 42, p. 249; Devill., 1832, 2, 45), on decide, sans difficult\u00e9 qu\u2019un jugement d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la demande principale n\u2019emp\u00eache pas qu\u2019il soit statu\u00e9 sur l\u2019intervention.\nEn effet, l\u2019intervention d\u2019un tiers dans une instance n\u2019a pas toujours pour objet de soutenir l\u2019action principale; elle tend souvent \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers, et forme ainsi une action diff\u00e9rente et nouvelle, d\u2019o\u00f9 il faut conclure que si le demandeur principal succombe, le tribunal n\u2019en doit pas moins examiner les droits de l\u2019intervenant.\nS\u2019il s\u2019agit du rejet de la demande principale par un moyen de nullit\u00e9 ou par une fin de non-re\u00e7evoir, les opinions se divisent.\nThe head note in The Atlantic & North-West Railway Go. v. Turcotte[5], would give the impression that the contrary doctrine was laid down there, but Boss\u00e9 J. speaking for the court, at page 319, makes practically the same distinction as Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, loc. cit. Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 said:\nCe n\u2019est plus le cas d\u2019une partie qui r\u00e9clame sa chose dans un litige r\u00e9gulier devant un tribunal comp\u00e9tent entre deux autres parties qui se la disputent, et qui, en raison de son droit, se fait adjuger la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, objet du litige entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur. C\u2019est le cas du tiers intervenant dans un litige qui, sans collusion entre les parties principales, est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne plus exister en raison d\u2019un d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation de la part du demandeur principal, d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorisation \u00e9quivalant au d\u00e9faut de juridiction du tribunal pour d\u00e9cider sur cette m\u00eame demande principale, et entra\u00eenant, partant, le m\u00eame d\u00e9faut de juridiction pour les. demandes accessoires et leurs cons\u00e9quences.\nThis case is one in which\nla partie r\u00e9clame sa chose dans un litige r\u00e9gulier devant un tribunal comp\u00e9tent entre deux autres parties qui se la disputent, et qui, en raison de son droit se fait adjuger la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, objet du litige entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur. Here the proceeding in intervention is to all intents and purposes an action in revendication. Miller v. D\u00e9ch\u00e8ne[6].\nAt the argument much reliance was placed upon Allan v. Pratt[7]. In my opinion that judgment has no application in the present case. There the appeal was to the Privy Council from a judgment of the court of appeal for Quebec in a case in which the amount in dispute, that is to say, the amount of the judgment appealed from was $1,100 while the amount of the original demand was $5,000.\nThe question of want of jurisdiction turned in that case entirely upon article 1178 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, now article 68, C.P.Q., which enacts that the judgment of the court of appeal of the province shall be final in all cases where the matter in dispute shall not exceed the sum or value of five hundred pounds sterling. Their Lordships held that in determining the question of the value of the matter in dispute upon which the right to appeal depends the correct course to adopt is to look at the judgment as it affects the interests of the parties who are prejudiced by it and who seek to relieve themselves from it by an appeal. But that rule does not apply to this court. 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 3, sub-sec. 4, fixes the mode of determining the amount in controversy and if the appeal in Allan v. Pratt7 had been taken to this court we undoubtedly would have had jurisdiction to hear it because the amount of the original demand $5,000 must have been held to be the amount in controversy. The same principle had been previously applied by the Privy Council in the case of Macfarlane v. Leclaire[8]. If in this case Cot\u00e9 had, on the principal demand, obtained judgment for an amount exceeding $2,000, but if the value of the wood seized and, claimed by The Richardson Company\u2019s intervention was only $1,000, Cote\u2019s interest under the rule in Allan v. Pratt[9] would be of an appealable amount, but would there be an appeal here in such circumstances? Here I would draw attention to the significant observation of Taschereau J. in King v. Dupuis[10], at page 394, where referring to the cases of Cham-poux v. La\u2019pierre[11], and Gendron v. McDougall[12], relied on by the respondent at the argument on the question of jurisdiction, he says, at page 394 :\nIt was at that time, I may premise, though perhaps unnecessarily, the amount in controversy upon the appeal to this court that ruled not, as it is now, the amount of the original demand, when the extent of our jurisdiction depends upon the amount in controversy.\nBy sub-section 4 of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 3, Parliament, for the first time, fixes a statutory mode of determining the amount in controversy which was that laid down in Joyce v. Hart[13]; Levi v. Reed[14], and apparently uniformly acted upon in this court until Allan v. Pratt9; Gilbert v. Oilman[15] per Taschereau J. at page 195. This last case was decided in 1888 and the statute 54 & 55 Vict, was passed in 1891.\nIn Kinghorn v. Larue[16], at page 349, Taschereau J., rendering the judgment of the court, adopted the rule laid down in Macfarlane v. Leclaire[17], and said:\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be quashed according to the well settled jurisprudence on this point, viz., that it is the interest of the party appealing from a judgment that has to he taken into consideration, to determine whether the case is appealable or not.\nFurther, at page 351 Taschereau J. says: \u201c54 & 55 Vict. does not affect this case.\u201d In Kinghorn v. Larue[18] the amount demanded and the amount granted were, as Taschereau J. says, not different. Kinghorn having obtained judgment against Hall & Co. for $ 1,129 seized under a writ of execution certain immovable property which realized at the sale the sum of $ 950. Larue, a judgment creditor of the defendants for the sum of $24,000 was collocated as a creditor au marc la livre on this sum of $950, hence the appeal by Kinghorn, and there was nothing in issue either below or here except the right of Larue to be collocated. The amount of Kinghorn\u2019s judgment was not within the appealable limit nor was the amount of the collocation. The amount of Larue\u2019s claim was appealable, but was not in controversy and could not be in any way affected by any judgment this court could render. So clearly there was no appeal here and from a casual observation of Taschereau J. in such a case, I do not draw the conclusion that this court has decided that the statute was not intended to apply a rule by which the amount in controversy was to be fixed whether that amount was demanded in the original declaration which accompanied the writ of summons or in the conclusions to an opposition or intervention or other like judicial proceeding. Taschereau J. says in King v. Dupuis[19], at page 396:\nI do not see how, on this appeal, (upon what is clearly a judicial proceeding, Turcotte v. Dansereau[20]), it can be denied that the matter in controversy, and demanded by that opposition, is of the value of $2,000 or over.\nTurcotte v. Dansereau20 is very much in point here. By the declaration the plaintiff claimed from the defendant the sum of $1,997.92 with interest and costs, but when the opposition was filed the amount due on the judgment which it sought to have annulled amounted to upwards of $2,000, and it was held by this court that an opposition filed for the purpose of vacating a judgment entered by default is a \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d and that the appellate jurisdiction of this court depended on the matter in controversy in that proceeding without reference to the amount demanded by the action in the principal suit.\nIt is not necessary that the amount in controversy should be a sum of money. The statute was intended to cover also the value of the thing demanded, the object being to give this court jurisdiction to hear and decide appeals in cases where the issues involved a consideration of sufficient value to justify the appeal.\nIn King v. Dupuis19, at page 395, Taschereau J. says:\nHere it is the ownership of $3,500 worth of lumber that is in question (as in the present case); the appellant, by his opposition intervened in the original case to assert his right to this lumber that the respondent had caused to be seized.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that this court has jurisdiction to try the issue as to the ownership of the lumber and that King v. Dupuis19 and Turcotte v. Dansereau20 are authority for this opinion. Girouard J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal raises a very nice question of civil procedure upon which it is my misfortune to have to dissent from the court. I quite agree with the learned Chief Justice that an intervention, which I believe corresponds to the \u201cinterpleader\u201d or \u201cthird party\u201d proceedings of the English practice under the modern Judicature Acts, is a demand, and in a case like the present one, it is to a certain extent distinct from that formed by the plaintiff. I say to a certain extent, for by its conclusion the intervening parties pray that the seizure before judgment made by plaintiff be declared illegal, and in this respect I think the intervening parties take the position of defendants in the case. But whether that be correct or not, it seems to me it cannot be denied that this intervention, or distinct demand, does not constitute a new suit, but is a mere incident in a pending suit. If there was any doubt upon this point under the old law of France, there is none under the new Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec.\nIn order to better understand its provisions, I think it is not out of place to make a short recapitulation of the laws governing interventions.\nThe authority of Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, Vol. 3, p. 214, Q. 1273, is invoked to establish that the withdrawal of the principal cause does not put an end to the intervention. This may not be important, for there may be several different demands in a pending suit, and because one of them is decided before another, it does not mean that they do not all exist in the same suit. But Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, if I understand them well, do not absolutely hold that the withdrawal of the principal demand does not put an end to the intervention. They make distinctions. They quote decisions both ways. And how can it be otherwise when we consider the legislation upon the subject in France under and before the Code?\nThe old ordinance of Civil Procedure of 1667, Tit. 11, has only one short article (art. 28) upon the subject of interventions, which has been reproduced by the Code of Civil Procedure of France. Article 339:\nL\u2019intervention sera form\u00e9e par requ\u00eate qui contiendra les moyens et conclusions dont il sera donn\u00e9 copie ainsi que des pi\u00e8ces justificatives.\nThe only difference from the ordinance of 1667 is to be found in article 340:\nL\u2019intervention ne pourra retarder le jugement de la cause principale, quand elle sera en \u00e9tat,\nthat is, ready for judgment.\nUnder these various provisions it is not surprising to find a very conflicting jurisprudence upon questions connected with interventions. The decisions will be found in Gilbert sur Sirey, Carr\u00e9 & Chauveau, and the other annotators and commentators of the Code of Civil Procedure of France. They are of very little assistance to us. For over fifty years, the Province of Quebec has been governed by a very different Code of Procedure.\nThe want of new provisions was felt as early as 1849, when 12 Vict. ch. 38, sec. 82, was passed, and amended in 1853 by 16 Vict. ch. 194, sec. 22. These enactments are summarized in the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, ch. 83, and sec. 71. Under these statutes one decision was rendered by the court of appeal which I believe deserves some attention. That is Mulholland v. Benning[21] decided in 1864 by Duval C.J., Meredith, Drummond, Mondelet and\nBadgley JJ., where it was held, reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Smith in the Superior Court, that the withdrawal of the principal action did not put an end to an intervention filed for the purpose of revendicating the thing seized by the plaintiff.\nIn 1867 more complete enactments were introduced by the Code of Civil Procedure, articles 154-158 These articles form part of chapter 4, relating to \u201cIncidents\u201d in a pending suit. It is, I believe, the first time that the legislature did so declare, although it is pretty hard to conceive that an intervention could be anything else, as the very word means, that is, inter venire, to come between.\nThe provisions of the new Code are more comprehensive and more precise than any legislation we had before; in fact they are all given as new law, or amending the old law.\nArticle 220:\nEvery person interested in an action between other parties may intervene therein at any time before judgment. C.C.P. 154 amended 156, in part.\nArticle 222:\nIt cannot stay the proceedings in the principal action unless. it is allowed by the judge. New C.C.P. 156.\nArticle 224:\nThe proceedings are subject to the same rules as the action during which they are made, and the delays for pleading are computed from the date of the service of the intervention. New C.C.P. 158 amended.\nIf an intervention is a mere incident, it seems to me impossible to conceive that it can survive the principal demand. The above articles shew that two causes then exist in a pending suit, that is the principal cause or the demand of the plaintiff, and the intervention. And so the Quebec courts have held even under the old code of 1867.\nIn 1884, Mr. Justice Torrance decided that where the principal action is of a summary nature, the proceedings on an intervention therein are governed by the same rules: Stephen v. Montreal, Portland & Boston Rly. Co.[22].\nIn 1890, Mr. Justice Mathieu decided that the contestation of an intervention, and the merits of the principal cause must be adjudged at the same time: Stein v. Bourassa[23].\nFinally, in 1892, the court of appeal, Baby, Boss\u00e9, Blanchet, Hall and Wurt\u00e9le JJ., held that where the principal action is dismissed for an irregularity, the intervention must likewise disappear, whatever may be the grounds on which it is based, the court holding that it does not introduce a new suit or instance, but that it is only an appendix to the principal demand: The Atlantic and North-West Rly. Co. v. Turcotte[24].\nFor these reasons, interventions, although constituting judicial demands, and subject to the same rules of procedure as the principal demand, are mere incidents in the principal suit, like incidental and cross demands, improbations, inscriptions de faux, disavowals of attorneys, and reprises d\u2019instance. Articles 216, 219, 228, 233, 257, 271, C.P.Q. All these may happen in the same suit. In fact the case of The Atlantic & North-West Go. v.Turcotte24 is an example of three or four incidents upon which issues were joined. The practice has been to dispose of them all by one final judgment as was done in this case. Even oppositions to judgment or to seizure and sale, or upon the distribution of moneys, known as oppositions afin d\u2019annuler, afin de charge, afin de dis traire or afin de conserver, which admittedly form distinct demands, are not incidents of the principal action[25], but they are so intimately connected with it that they bear the same title, the name of the opposant being only added. They are always the inevitable sequence of the judgment or of its execution; they constitute what may be called the last phase of the same law suit. All the parties in the original cause are entitled to a notice from the opposant that the opposition has been returned by the seizing officer, and they are all entitled to be heard and to have the same rejected or dismissed upon proper issues. Articles 650, 651, 653 C.P.Q.\nFinally, in determining the actual interest of the party contesting an opposition, due regard is always had to the judgment he is endeavouring to execute. It is especially when estimating the appealable interest of a plaintiff in the main action, that courts of justice have invariably looked at the final judgment, irrespective of the interest of the opposing party, a proposition which the decisions quoted hereafter will amply demonstrate.\nThese observations will help us, I hope, to reach an intelligible interpretation of our statutes granting the right of appeal.\nIt is enacted by 12 Vict. ch. 39, sec, 82 (1849), that where\nthe right of appeal from any judgment of any court is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different. This enactment is substantially reproduced in article 1142 of the Code of Procedure of 1867, and, article 44 of the Code of 1897.\nBy 34 Geo. III. ch. 6, sec. 30, and 12 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 19, an appeal lies in several cases to His Majesty in His Privy Council, and among others \u201cwhere the matter in dispute exceeds \u00a3500 sterling.\u201d This enactment is re-enacted in the code of 1867, art. 1178, and in the code of 1897, art. 68.\nIn 1851, in Gugy v. Gugy[26], the court of appeal, composed of Sir James Stuart C.J., and Rolland, Panet and Aylwin JJ., four of the ablest judges who adorned the Quebec Bench, held that the right of appealing to the Privy Council from a judgment upon an opposition made by the defendant to judgment, is settled by the nature and quality of the principal demand. The defendant, opposant, had alleged that the principal sum had been compensated by a sum due to him by the plaintiff, and far exceeding \u00a3500.\nSir James Stuart said:\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le jugement fut rendu pour une somme de \u00a3200, pour laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e fit \u00e9maner un bref (writ) d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, et c\u2019est sur une opposition faite \u00e0 cette ex\u00e9cution par l\u2019appelant qu\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjette. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution ici est la demande, et l\u2019opposition n\u2019est qu\u2019une exception \u00e0 cette demande.\nThe same principle has been adopted by article 1173 of the Code of Procedure.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court Act,\u201d as amended and now in force, section 29, sub-section 1, in so far as it relates to the amount involved, says:\nNo appeal shall lie under this Act from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec, in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, wherein the matter in controversy doe\u2019s not amount to the sum or value of two thousand dollars. And in sub-section 4, added by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 3, subrsec. 4, the Act adds:\nWhenever the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount shall be understood to be that demanded and not that recovered, if they are different.\nIt seems to me that only sub-section 1 applies to this case, as there is no difference between the amount demanded and the amount recovered. The appellant obtained a judgment for exactly the full amount of his demand.\nI take it for granted that our own decisions, especially a long array of them, are binding upon us, especially when they follow those of the Privy Council. I do not hesitate to say, with due deference, that if we receive this appeal we reverse the well settled jurisprudence, not only of the Quebec courts, but also of this court and of the Privy Council.\nIt is contended that such a conclusion is supported by the authority of Turcotte v.Dansereau[27], and King v. Dupuis[28].\nI cannot understand how Turcotte v. Dansereau28 can be invoked at all. The appellant was not the plaintiff, but the defendant, whose interest was calculated at the time of the making of his opposition to judgment. Our decision was not based on the fact that the amount was not sufficient\u201d. Quite the reverse. Interest was allowed to make up the appealable amount, as the Privy Council had done in Boswell v. Kilborn[29], and Bank of New South Wales v. Owston[30]. Turcotte v. Dansereau28 may be at variance with Gugy v. Gugy[31], but this does not help the present appellant, as he is not an opposant to judgment. In King v. Dupuis[32], which is a case somewhat similar to this one, a lumberman by the name of King was opposing by an opposition afin de distraire, the seizure and sale of a certain quantity of logs of the value of $3,500. The plaintiff, Dupuis, had obtained judgment for the amount of his demand, namely, $119.50. We decided that King could appeal, but we did not decide that the plaintiff, Dupuis, could, the point not being even involved in the case. Mr. Justice Taschereau, who rendered the judgment of the court, refers to the decisions in McGorkill v. Knight[33]; Kinghorn v. Larue[34], and Macfarlane v. Leclaire[35], and when we read the judgments in these cases there cannot be any doubt what the learned judge had in his mind. His Lordship has in fact recapitulated the whole jurisprudence in Kinghorn v. Larue35, which is a case exactly in point The question of appeal came up on an opposition afin de conserver, which is a judicial proceeding or demand, perhaps more independent of the main action than any other opposition. It was contested by the plaintiff who had obtained judgment for $1,129, and the opposition was for $24,000. It was held that the plaintiff had no appeal. Mr. Justice Taschereau, for the court, said:\nHere the appellant\u2019s judgment is for $1,129, and to that amount and that amount alone, is he pecuniarily interested in the present case. The case of Gendron v. McDougall[36] is clearly in point. In that case Gendron had obtained a judgment against one Ogden for $231, and in execution thereof seized an immovable worth $2,000. McDougall filed an opposition afin de distraire, claiming the land so seized as his property. Gendron contested the opposition. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench dismissed his contestation and maintained Mc-Dougall\u2019s opposition. Gendron then appealed to the Supreme Court, but, though the question at issue on McDougall\u2019s opposition was one of title to a piece of land, and that piece of land was worth $2,000, this court quashed Gendron\u2019s appeal, on the ground that his pecuniary interest on his appeal was limited to $231, the amount of his judgment. That case, which is binding upon us, seems conclusive upon the question.\nAnd referring to the case of Macfarlane v. Leclaire[37], the learned judge observes that the Privy Council intimated, though, of course, without determining, that had the judgment been against Leclaire, a party just in the position of the present appellant,. and of Kinghorn, Leclaire would not have had a right to appeal, as his pecuniary interest would not amount to \u00a3500 sterling. Finally, the learned judge concludes:\nThe statute 54 & 55 Vict. does not affect this case. This is not a case where the amount demanded and the amount granted are different.\nIn Allan v. Pratt[38], an appeal decided in 1888 from the Quebec court of appeals, Lord Selborne said:\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the appeal is incompetent. The proper measure of value for determining the question of the right of appeal is, in their judgment, the amount which has been recovered by the plaintiff in the action and against which the appeal could be brought. Their Lordships, even if they were not bound by it, would agree in principle with the rule laid down in the judgment of this tribunal delivered by Lord Chelmsford in the case of Macfarlane v. Leclaire38, that is, that the judgment is to be looked at as it affects the interests of the party who is prejudiced by it, and who seeks to relieve himself from it by appeal.\nTrue, Allan v. Pratt39, in so far as this court is concerned, is no longer law in a similar case, that is, where the amount demanded is different from that recovered?, This change has been effected in 1891 by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25. But out of the special case provided for by that statute, I cannot see that the general principle affecting the right to appeal, as laid down by the Privy Council, is not yet sound. Until the Privy Council declares the contrary, I do not intend to I doubt its meaning and jurisprudence, especially in face of Beauchemin v. Armstrong[39] decided by this court in 1904. The action of Armstrong was for $2,217 and was dismissed by the trial court, whose judgment was confirmed in appeal, except as to certain costs amounting to $631, which were ordered to be borne by the defendant. The plaintiff acquiesced in this judgment. On appeal to this court by the defendant, which was quashed for want of jurisdiction, Chief Justice Taschereau, speaking for the court, said:\nThis is not a case where the amount demanded originally governs as to the jurisdictional pecuniary limitation under sub-section 4 of section 29 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d but it is a case falling within the decision of the Privy Council in Allan v. Pratt[40], which was followed by this court in the case of Mouette v. Lefebvre[41]\nThe interest of the party appealing is for a sum less than $2,000, and, therefore, the appeal must be quashed.\nThe principal laid down in Macfarlane v. Leclaire[42] also clearly covers this case. Lord Chelmsford said:\nIn determining the question of the value of the matter in dispute upon which the right to appeal depends, their Lordships consider the correct course to adopt is to look at the judgment as it affects the interests of the parties who are prejudiced by it, and who seek to relieve themselves from it by an appeal. If their liability upon the judgment is of an amount sufficient to entitle them to appeal, they cannot be deprived of their right because the matter in dispute happens not to be of equal value to both parties; and, therefore, if the judgment had been in their favour, their adversary might possibly have had no power to question it by an appeal. In the present ease only one judgment was rendered maintaining the plaintiff\u2019s demand for $804.49, quashing his saisie-arr\u00eat, maintaining the intervention and declaring the respondents proprietors of the lumber so seized, admitted to be of the value of about $4,000.\nIt is suggested that the plaintiff, now appellant, represents the mass of the creditors. He does not so far, because he has not alleged insolvency or d\u00e9confiture of the defendant. The creditors are not parties to this case in any shape or form. We do not even know that there are other creditors. The allegation that the defendant, Dionne, has been secreting his goods\navec l\u2019intention de frauder ses cr\u00e9anciers en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le demandeur en particulier,\nis not sufficient to put creditors in the case for distribution pro rat\u00e2: Arts. 673, 694 C.P.Q. The plaintiff represents only himself, and to the extent of his judgment, that is $804.49, and nothing more. Moreover,\u2014Where is the proof that the interest of all the creditors, if others exist, amounts to $2,000?\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the motion to quash should be granted, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Auguste Beaudry.\nSolicitor for the respondents: A. &. Garneau.\nOn the 29th of November, 1906, the appeal was heard upon the merits. Flynn K.C. appeared for the appellant.\nStuart K.C. and Garneau K.C. appeared for the respondents.\nOn the 29th of November, 1906, upon an equal division of opinion among the judges, the appeal stood dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\n[1] Art. 220 C.P.Q.\n[2] 11 L.C.

C.R. 390) that, as there was statutory authority for the issue of the debentures in question, knowledge of any such breach of trust or misapplication by the advisers of the Crown could not be set up as a defence to the action.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] maintaining the action with costs. The action was on information by the Attorney-General of Canada, to recover interest due upon debentures purchased by the Government of the late Province of Canada, under the circumstances stated in the judgments now reported, from the defendants. In the Exchequer Court judgment was rendered in favour of the Crown, on 11th January, 1904[2], on which an appeal was taken by the defendants to the Supreme Court of Canada. On 13th of May, 1904, when that appeal came on for hearing, the argument of counsel for the appellants was stopped and it was announced by the court that the appeal could not be further proceeded with until the other bondholders were made parties, and, on 16th May, 1904, it was ordered that the judgment then under appeal should be opened and the matter remitted to the court below for the purpose of having all necessary parties represented in the cause, according to the practice of that court, before final judgment should be rendered.\nSubsequently, the other appellants, above named, were added (each for the purpose of representing certain classes of the other bondholders interested), and, on the 9th of October, 1905, the judgment now appealed from was rendered, in terms similar to those of the judgment referred to above and in the Exchequer Court report above cited. The said last mentioned judgment proceeded as follows:\n\u201c1. This court doth order, adjudge and declare that in any future payment or distribution of interest on the debentures, or any of them, issued by the defendants, His Majesty the King is entitled, in respect of the debentures held by him and mentioned in the in-formation herein, to share in such payment or distribution of interest pari passu with other holders of debentures of a like class. \u201c2. And this court doth further order, adjudge and declare that with respect to the Montmorency Bridge debentures held by His Majesty the King, His Majesty is also entitled to payment of the arrears of interest for which the defendants have, pending the proceedings herein, made provision, unless it should appear that such provision has been made out of funds not applicable to the payment of such interest, and that on the proper taking of the accounts the tolls and revenues of the said bridge have not been sufficient to enable the defendants to make such provision therefrom.\n\u201c3. And this court doth further order, adjudge and declare that with reference to the bond for \u00a35,000 mentioned in the information of the Attorney-General of Canada fyled herein, His Majesty the King is entitled to payment thereof when there are funds available for that purpose after provision is made for other prior charges upon the tolls and revenues of the said trust or of the said defendants, the Quebec North Shore Turnpike Road Trustees.\n\u201c4. And this court doth further order and adjudge that His Majesty the King do recover his costs of the action to be taxed.\u201d\nThe questions raised upon the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nStuart E.G., Lafleur E.G. and C. E. Dorion E.G. appeared for the several appellants.\nShepley K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I regret I have to dismiss this appeal. I say so intentionally, for I feel that the public who sought for investment in the Quebec Turnpike Trust debentures had every reason to presume that the interest on the debentures was not to be supplied by the Crown directly or indirectly. I must confess that I have a strong sympathy for the ordinary bondholders who naturally looked upon these debentures as Government securities. But we are not here to administer sympathy or even equity, but the laws of the land. Their expectation is not sufficient to determine the right of the Crown to invest in these debentures the funds of which it was trustee, and to hold and claim under the same. All the statutes which have been quoted at the bar and in the factums, enact that the prohibition to the Crown is limited to the payment of the interest on the said debentures out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\nIn 1841, by 4 Vict. ch. 17, sec. 21, it is provided that the trustees may borrow, money\nnot to be paid out of or to be chargeable against the general revenue of the province.\nIn 1851, by 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 132, it is declared\nthat no money shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the -purpose of paying the said interest.\nDuring the same session of Parliament, by 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 133, sec. 2, the trustees are authorized to issue certain debentures with this proviso:\nAnd neither the principal nor interest of the debentures to be issued under this Act shall be guaranteed by the province or payable out of any provincial funds.\nIn 1853, by 16 Vict, ch. 235, sec. 7, the trustees-may again issue debentures\nprovided nevertheless that * * * no money shall be advanced out of the provincial funds for the payment of the said interest. Therefore, according to the old maxim expressio unius exclusio est arteritis, the Crown had a perfect right to invest in and hold the debentures of the Turnpike Trust out of the funds of which it was trustee, for instance, the Common School Fund, even for the purpose of providing for the payment of interest on its debentures past or future.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, but, under the circumstances, without costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and only desire to add a few words to the reasons given for his judgment by Burbidge J. I feel that I need not add anything to what that learned judge has said upon the point of the want of authority in the late Province of Canada to invest Common School Fund moneys in the appellants\u2019 debentures.\nOn the other point argued before us, that the issue of debentures for the purpose of raising money to pay interest on other debentures was ultra vires of the appellants and a breach of trust and that the Crown being a party to that breach of trust could not assert a valid title to the debentures the learned judge was of the opinion that, assuming the responsible advisers of the Crown to have had knowledge or means of knowledge of such an intended diversion by the appellants of the proceeds of the debentures, this could not affect the Crown\u2019s title because the issue of the debentures was clearly intra vires and such a breach of trust as that suggested could not be imputed to the Crown.\nThe appellants\u2019 argument before us substantially was that the transaction was really and truly an advance of moneys from the public chest to the trustees for the payment of overdue interest on debentures previously issued; that the original ordinance of 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 72 of the then Province of Canada authorized such advances, and that the order in council of 1st September, 1857, under which the moneys now in question were paid, when read in connection with the applications made to the Government by and on behalf of the trustees, sufficiently shewed these facts. The order in council referred to is no doubt, so far as its introductory statements are concerned, couched in ambiguous terms which, if accepted as literally true and not qualified by the operative part of the order in council or otherwise explained, are calculated to mislead.\nBut an examination of the statutes and the previous order in council recited in that of September, 1857, shews that the statements in the latter relied on by the appellants were based upon several misconceptions and were altogether inaccurate. The ordinance to which it refers incorrectly as 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 72, was no doubt intended to be 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 17, sec. 27, and the provisions of sections 26 and 27 of that ordinance were, I think, clearly applicable only to debentures issued under it and not to debentures authorized and issued under subsequent Acts. At the date of the order in council in question the Act of 12 Vict. ch. 15, and the two Acts, that of 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 132, and that of 16 Vict. ch. 235, had all been passed and are those under which the debentures now in question were issued. All of these Acts contained express prohibitions against paying interest on the debentures. out of the public funds.\nThe order in question further assumed that what was done by the order of 3rd February, 1855, was an exercise of this supposed statutory authority to advance moneys out of the public funds to pay overdue interest which it plainly was not. The operative part of the order, however, authorizes the investment from time to time in the debentures of the trust of a sum not exceeding \u00a311,500 out of the Common School Fund as the sales of the lands of that fund permitted.\nThe only possible conclusions to be drawn, therefore, from a study of these later statutes and documents is that the statutes under which the debentures in question were issued contained express prohibitions against the advance by the Government of moneys from the public funds towards the payment of overdue interest on the debentures authorized by them to be issued involving an entire change in public policy from that sanctioned by sections 26 and 27 of the earlier ordinance, 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 177, and that the order in council of 1857 authorizing the purchase of the debentures in question expressly limited the moneys to be paid for their purchase to those of the Common School Fund which the Crown held in trust merely. It is true these debentures were not amongst those which were expressly authorized as investments for these trust funds nor were they expressly prohibited. But even assuming the investments to have been unauthorized by the statutes creating the trust I cannot see how the appellants can for that reason successfully contend that they, as trustees of the turnpike trusts who issued the debentures, can repudiate liability on the debentures. The want of authority on the part of the Crown to invest in the particular manner it did cannot be a defence to an action on the debenture itself. At the utmost it would be a breach of trust for which the Crown might, in the event of the loss of the money, be held liable by its cestui que trust the beneficiaries of the Common School Fund.\nI do not think the inference drawn by the appellants from such documentary evidence as is forth- coming with respect to the application of the moneys received for the debentures in question an unfair one, but it is only an inference or suggestion. There is no direct evidence on the point. I agree, however, with the judgment appealed from that, accepting the suggestion or inference, it cannot be imputed to the Crown that it was a party to such breach of trust.\nI do not see any evidence which justifies the assumption of the appellants that the transaction was not really and bona fide an investment of trust funds in the debentures of the turnpike trust.\nAs I have said all the Acts passed subsequently to that ordinance of 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 17, and under which the debentures in question were issued, contained express provisions prohibiting any advances from the public funds for the payment of overdue interest, and the Government of the day was advised by its Attorney-General at the very time the investment was made of the existence of these express prohibitions. The order in council of September, 1857, authorizing the investment of \u00a311,500 in appellants\u2019 debentures expressly stated that the moneys to be advanced were those belonging to the Common School Fund and were to be made from time to time\nas sales of land shall be effected and payment made to the credit of the Common School Fund.\nIt is not, therefore, in my opinion, open to any doubt that the moneys intended to be invested and which were actually paid were those of the Common School Fund held by the Government in trust only. Whatever claim the beneficiaries of the trust might have against its trustee for an improper investment of the funds in case there was a loss from the investment such an impropriety or wrongful act could afford no possible ground for a repudiation by the debtor of his debenture debt.\nThe statutory prohibition against the use of the public funds for the purpose of paying overdue interest and the express language of the order in council directing the advance from time to time out of the Common School Funds as they became available through the sales of land, constitute a sufficient answer to the assumption appellants ask us to make.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The Crown in the years 1855 and 1857 bought, from the appellants, debentures which they admittedly had power to issue and sell.\nIt is now set up as an answer to the claim of the Crown to enforce the payment of interest upon these debentures that the sales thereof were in truth made in violation of an express statutory prohibition against their raising money to pay interest, and bought by the Crown either with actual notice of this violation of the statute or with the intention of actually aiding in the evasion of the statute.\nI do not see evidence to support any such contention.\nIt is contended that the frame of the applications to the Crown for advances coupled with the words of the orders in council prove this.\nThe first application to the Crown was in the nature of an appeal to the generosity of the Crown for an advance which would undoubtedly if given as asked have practically resulted in a total loss thereof. It was not at first an application to the Crown to buy from appellants their debentures. The result of a full consideration of the application was that the Crown expressly refused to have anything to do with the payment of interest. The Attorney-General to whom the matter was referred, after an order in council had been passed, but before anything done under it, clearly advised that there could be no such dealing as a purchase of debentures issued to pay or raise money to pay interest. At the same time it was quite manifest that money was needed for other purposes than the payment of interest.\nIt appears by the application for the first advance that three thousand pounds was needed for interest. It also by the same application appears that \u00a35,959 \u201cfor interest and other charges\u201d was urgently needed.\nWhat the Crown practically said in answer to this and after hearing the opinion of the Attorney-General was this: \u201cWe cannot entertain your application so far as it relates to interest, but as you evidently need in all \u00a36,000 you must, as to interest, provide for that, but as to the other three thousand pounds we will buy from you, of your debentures that have become of less than par value to your contractors and others you owe, to the amount of three thousand pounds. This will relieve the financial situation by legal methods and thereby attain part of the results sought for.\u201d Such I infer quite clearly was the position taken by the Crown.\nHow can such a dealing be attacked as a violation of any statute or in any way vitiate the Crown\u2019s title to the debentures?\nThe order in council was not at all limited to interest, but the other charges were also within its very words and purpose. No doubt it may be said that it would have been better to have avoided expressly the very shadow of the appearance of evil by rescinding the order and adopting another, limited to the execution of the secondly named and only purpose in hand, after the opinion of the Attorney-General was received.\nThat is, alike with the question of the propriety of using the Common School trust funds for so precarious an investment, a mere matter for criticism that in no way goes to the root of the matter how in hand, in such a way as to entitle the appellant to succeed. Both criticisms we have nothing to do with here.\nThe second purchase of similar debentures would seem to have originated in an application which is now lost. The orders in council under which the lot of debentures secondly in question herein were issued authorized the Receiver-General\nto invest from time to time in the debentures of the Trust, a sum not exceeding in the whole $11,500 as sales of land shall be effected and payment made to the credit of the Common School Fund.\nThe recitals in this order contain such a grossly mistaken statement of the first transaction and the basis on which it rests that I can attach no importance to its statements.\nIts first recital might be read as in another application for aid to pay interest had as in the first instance been made to the Crown.\nAssuming it so I cannot after what had transpired only about two years before infer that improper methods were resorted to.\nThe recital, coupled with the wording of the order looking to the future rather than the then immediate needs and purposes, may also be read as shewing that such a balance sheet had been exhibited, that the appellants\u2019 debentures could be looked to as a safe investment of the funds referred to.\nThe utmost that can be said is that the wording of the recital is of doubtful import or the production of a hand that wrote the gross misconceptions of the facts that follows it in the next few sentences.\nThen are we at this distance of time to impute to the Crown, even if permissible, the doing of what was improper? Are we when two very obvious courses, one clearly right and the other wrong, were open to the officers of the Crown to conclude that they selected the wrong course? Are we to suppose that they invested in prohibited debentures when the probabilities are that these free from taint of any such prohibition were available and just as serviceable for the purposes in hand?\nI will not, on the slender basis of these recitals, so full and so very obviously full of error that one is surprised to find such errors in such a place, draw the conclusion it is necessary to draw in order that this appeal can have any support.\nI would not under the like circumstances in the case of a private individual whose witnesses and papers and means of explanation as well as possibly he himself had all passed away, draw such conclusions.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J. concurred for the reasons stated by Davies J.\nDuff J. concurred for the reasons stated by Idington J. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Caron, Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. L. Newcombe.\n[1] 8 Ex. C.R. 390.\n[2] 8 Ex. C.R. 390\n"}

The river almost, crossed the lot at a point near its northern boundary and, at another point, about nineteen arpents further south, it again crossed the lot, completely. In an action to eject, the licensee from the portion of the lot between the first and second bends of the river and to recover damages,\nHeld, that, under the circumstances, there was no ambiguity in the designation of the quantity of the land affected by the license and, in any event, the language of the instrument must be literally construed in favour of the grantee and the party bound thereby could not be permitted to shew a different intention by evidence of surrounding circumstances.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side (Lacoste C.J. and Hall J. dissenting), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgment of the court now reported. C. E. Dorion K.C. for the appellant.\nL. P. Pelletier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The respondent brought an action in the Superior Court at Quebec to revendicate, as against the appellant, the western half of lot 36 in the Parish of Ch\u00e2teau Richer, County of Montmorency.\nIn answer the appellant admitted that he had no title to the land; denied that he had ever exercised or ever pretended to exercise any act of ownership with reference to it, and affirmatively alleged that he had acquired from the respondent, through one V\u00e9zina the right to cut the standing timber on a certain portion of the property in question, and that he had not cut beyond the limits covered by the agreement sous seing priv\u00e9, under which this right had been conveyed On these issues the parties went to trial.\nAll the courts below held that V\u00e9zina\u2019s interest was vested in the respondent and the only doubt suggested turned upon the solution of the question\u2014 What are the true boundaries to be assigned to the coupe de bois conveyed by the respondent to V\u00e9zina? The appellant mainly relied on the literal construction of the words used in the sous seing priv\u00e9. The respondent urged that the language used in delimiting the tract is equivocal and that the intention of the parties must be gathered from the surrounding circumstances.\nThere was a long and tedious enqu\u00eate; many witnesses were examined, and each party employed a surveyor to make a plan of the locality. In my opinion the intention of the parties is to be gathered from the plain meaning of the words used by them in the document set up by the appellant and effect must be given to these words if possible.\nThe description of the property within the limits of which the wood is to be cut is :\nborn\u00e9 au sud \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re Sault \u00e0 la Puce, \u00e0 l\u2019ouest \u00e0 M. Octave Gravel, \u00e0 l\u2019est \u00e0 M. Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Lefran\u00e7ois, et au nord au trait quarr\u00e9, avec droit de passage jusqu\u2019\u00e0 chez M. Lapointe.\nIn my opinion this wording is clear and plainly describes the complete boundaries. There is no doubt on the evidence that Am\u00e9d\u00e9e. Lefran\u00e7ois is the proprietor of the land to the east\u2014Octave Gravel of that to the west, and that the property extends to the trait quarr\u00e9 on the north has never been denied. What is the reason of the difficulty with respect to the southern boundary which is said to be a river? Does that river not exist, and is it not easily traceable on the ground? Is there not a part of the property of which it is the southern boundary; and were not both parties, at the time they made their agreement, aware of its existence and exact position? All these questions must be answered in the affirmative.\nBy the plans of both surveyors it appears that the River Sault \u00e0 la Puce enters the land of the plaintiff at and recrosses its eastern boundary without touching its western limit and, after crossing the eastern boundary, again enters the plaintiff\u2019s land and traverses it in a westerly direction to the westerly boundary. The tract bounded on the south by that portion of the river intercepted between the eastern and western boundaries (and having the other boundaries described in the document in question) obviously answers the description we have to apply. If there is any doubt with respect to the description and designation of the premises sold it will be found on reference to the authorities cited in the judgment of Mr. Justice Andrews, in the Superior Court, that doubts in the circumstances of this case should be held against the respondent.\nI agree with the three judges in review and the minority in appeal that there is no ambiguity in the language of the deed; that the respondent was entitled to rely on the literal construction of the words used; that the description does not bear more than one necessarily exclusive meaning; and that the appellant did not cut any timber beyond the limits of the tract covered by the agreement with V\u00e9zina.\nThe action should be dismissed and the appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant; Dorion & Marchand.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drouin, Pelletier, Baillargeon & St.Laurent.\n"}

The circumstances in which the action was instituted and the questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe judgment of the Gold Commissioner which was affirmed by the judgment appealed from, ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff, McDonald, was en titled to the first 200 inches of water flowing into Hunker Creek, at the point in dispute, under his grant of 9th August, 1904, and that the defendant had no standing to raise the question whether or not the plaintiff was wasting water until the said defendant became the holder of a water grant; that the defend ant's counterclaim asking for an injunction enjoining the plaintiff from maintaining a dam on the land of the defendant and penning back the waters of Hunker Creek, and from maintaining a power-house and other buildings and a flume on said lands should be dismissed; that the defendant, its servants and agents should be restrained from diverting and conveying below the plaintiff's said dam the first two hundred inches of water from Hunker Creek at any place above or upstream from the point at which the plaintiff is entitled to divert water and from interfering in any way with the plaintiff's right in virtue of his grant to divert water; that the defendant should permit at least two hundred inches of the said water of Hunker Creek to flow uninterruptedly to the point at which the plaintiff is entitled to divert such water, and that the defendant, its servants, workingmen and agents, should be and were thereby restrained from destroying the dam used by the plaintiff under his grant and from interfering with his flume.\nEwart K.C. and Chrysler K.C. for the appellant. There is no question that the defendant was entitled to the water under the first lease. That lease has never been surrendered, except so far as a surrender is implied by the acceptance of the second lease, as the acceptance of a new lease is a surrender of a former lease of the same property, but if a lease covers two properties, acceptance of a new lease of one of them is not a surrender of the lease of the other. So here an acceptance of a new lease of the land is not a surrender of the right of the defendant to the water which is held under the first lease, unless by the second lease the water is re-granted to the defendant. Lyon v. Reed ([1]); Baynton v. Morgan ([2]); the cases cited in a foot note to Beach v. The King ([3]), at page 324; 12 Encyc. Laws of England, 56.\nBy the second lease the defendant has a right to use the water on or flowing over the land covered by the lease. There is in such lease no reservation of the water, although it has a provision by which the things demised are to be held subject to certain regulations. If the water is not granted by the second lease, then the defendant falls back upon the first lease and submits that his rights under it to the water have never been surrendered and that, as to the water, the first lease is still in force. In any case, the plain tiff has no right to build a dam on the defendant's land, and thereby to pen back and spread the water of the stream over the defendant's land.\nWe refer to the following authorities, in addition to those quoted by Mr. Justice Craig: Blackstone's Commentaries at p. 18; Liggins v. Inge ([4]), at page 692, per Tindal C.J.; Mason v. Hill ([5]), per Denman C.J.; Embrey v. Owen ([6]); Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun ([7]); Bradford v.

Gilmour ([11]), per Kingsdown L.J., at p. 156.\nA. Noel for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. concurred in the reasons stated by Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants accepted, on 12th February, 1900, from the Crown, a lease of mining lands in the Yukon, in substitution for another lease of which they were then the assignees. I think they thereby surrendered the latter lease.\nThe lease of the 12th February, 1900, in its operative part, reads as follows:\u2014\nNow this indenture witnesseth that in pursuance of the premises and in consideration of and subject to the rents, covenants, provisos, exceptions, restrictions and conditions hereinafter reserved and contained, and by the lessee to be paid, observed and performed, Her Majesty doth grant, demise and lease unto the lessee the said tract of lands and the exclusive right and privilege of extracting and taking there from, by hydraulic or other mining process, all royal or precious metals or minerals from, in, under or upon the tract of lands hereby demised and leased, with regard to which the said rights and privileges are hereby granted, which said tract is described as follows; that is to say: * * *.\nThen follows a description of the land thus demised and the usual habendum and redendum clauses.\nMany provisions follow next after this redendum, but none of them, save that I am about to quote, need, I think, be noticed, though touched upon in the argument. The one I refer to is the following:\nProvided, also, that this demise is subject to all other regulations contained and set forth in the said order in council of the third day of December, A.D. 1898, as fully and effectually to all intents and purposes as if they were set forth in these presents.\nAmongst those regulations of the 3rd day of December, 1898, thus explicitly incorporated into this document is one which reads as follows:\n10. The lessee's right to water on his location or to the diversion of water in connection with his operations thereon shall be subject to the regulations approved by order in council of the 3rd August, 1898.\nLet us now read this demise (with the restrictive and excepting words), which are part of the sentence constituting it, together with this clear and explicit regulation, as if inserted next after the redendum.\nCan we do so and find any difficulty in this case? The questions raised anent the ordinary presumptions in favour of a lessee or grantee of land upon or over which is running water, can have little or no existence or effect in such a document as this reading presents. These presumptions are, at any time, but prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the meaning of the contract.\nWhen the question raised is whether or not the water on the land demised went by virtue of such a restricted demise as this with the land as against all persons who might, by license from the Crown, procure under the water regulations then and there in force, the right to use the same, let us ascertain what water is referred to in the regulation just quoted. Can it, when forming part of this document, refer to water elsewhere than on the land described in the document of which it forms a part? Why should any one concerned in such a lease provide for anything as to water elsewhere than on the land the lease covered?\nIf private waters were to be found elsewhere by these lessees, and brought on to this land, the Crown could have nothing to say to that.\nAnd, if the waters of the Crown, to be got else where, were intended to be referred to, we may ask;\u2014Why should they be referred to? The waters of the Crown were the subject of acquisition only by and through the law of the land. It was entirely unnecessary to refer to such waters beyond the land in question.\nIt is clearly because the waters on this land so demised and no others are meant, that there is need to refer to them and thus lay down the rule that is to govern their use in relation to this contract and make clear that the usual presumptions relative thereto in an unrestricted demise must not arise.\nReading this exception in this way, and I think it can be read in no other way, the water that is thus to be applied for is not given with out a further application in which the lessees, just as any other person concerned, must define what quantity they desire to use.\nIn the light of the clear restrictions put in this lease and probably all such leases in the Yukon, and of the nature of the general regulations of December, and the water regulations of August, which together constitute, in that regard, the law of the land there, no difficulty or misapprehension can arise.\nIn view of these considerations there is no injustice done the appellants by the Crown, though a serious loss to the appellants may arise from the granting of the water in question to their neighbour. The appel- lants have only themselves to blame. They knew of the applications that have resulted so injuriously for them. The only step pretended to have been taken by the appellants for their protection is denied by the officer on whom blame was attempted to be put.\nIn none of the cases referred to on the question of presumptions were the operative part of the grant or demise restricted as here. In the case of Lord v. The Commissioners for the City of Sydney ([12]), there is a very instructive branch of it that deals with rights springing out of a Crown grant where the Crown had reserved, for specific purposes, and limited time, the right to use or apply the use of a part of the water that would have passed to the grantee but for the reservation. It was held this had the effect of preventing the grantee from claiming any compensation there for though getting allowed compensation for riparian rights held by the same grantee by virtue of an unrestricted grant further down the same stream.\nThe case exemplifies both phases of such rights and also at page 497 lays down the rule to guide us in the interpretation of such grants, that intention should be the supreme rule.\nHaving no doubt of the intention in this case, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The plaintiff is the holder of five hillside claims on Hunker Creek in the Yukon Territory, located under the regulations relating to placer min- ing. For the purpose of mining these claims he acquired on the 9th August, 1904, under the law in force in the Territory (embodied in the regulations passed 3rd August, 1898) a grant of the right to divert, at a point named in the grant, 200 miner's inches of the waters of the creek. The defendant is the lessee of a location for hydraulic mining extending two and a half miles along the valley of the same creek, including both of its banks, and embracing the point of diversion referred to, under a lease dated the 12th February, 1900, issued pursuant to the regulations governing the leasing of such locations, passed in December, 1896. The plaintiff, having constructed a dam and other works and machinery to divert the waters of the creek and convey them to the place of his mining operations, the defendant's manager, at a point above the point of diversion (but within the defendant's location), was proceeding to divert the creek from its natural course in such a way as to pre vent it flowing into the plaintiff's flume when this action was commenced and an injunction was granted by the Gold Commissioner of the Territory restraining the defendant from effecting the threatened diversion.\nThe principal question in controversy between the parties is, whether or not the plaintiff's grant confers upon him the right, as against the defendant, to divert the waters of Hunker Creek at the place referred to for use in mining his hillside claims. That he has such a right is undisputed, unless by virtue of its lease the defendant has a better right.\nThe defendant's lease provides:\nthat this demise is subject to all other regulations contained and set forth in the said order in council of the third of December, A.D. 1898, as fully and effectually to all intents and purposes as if they were set forth in these presents. By the regulations referred to it is enacted that leases granted under them may be in such form and contain such conditions, not inconsistent with them, as may be approved of by the Minister of the Interior.\nIt is not necessary to decide whether this clause authorizes the Minister of the Interior, by any such lease, to grant any right in respect of the Crown lands within the limit of the location demised regarding which the regulations themselves are silent. This much, I think, is clear, viz.: that where a particular subject matter is dealt with by the regulations, the rights of the lessee, as regards that subject matter, are governed by the provisions respecting it contained in the regulations.\nThe tenth clause of the regulations is as follows:\n10. The lessee's right to water on his location or to the diversion of water in connection with his operations thereon shall be subject to the regulations approved by order in council of the 3rd August, 1898.\nIf, therefore, this clause applies to water flowing through or past an hydraulic location, it is to the regulations referred to in it that we must have recourse to ascertain the conditions to which the defendant is subject in diverting the waters of Hunker Creek for use in working its property and particularly for the purpose of determining the relative priorities of the defendant's rights under its lease and the rights of the plaintiff in respect of those waters under his grant.\nIt is argued on behalf of the defendant that the clause applies only to water brought upon the location from outside sources; and has no application to water flowing through or past it. It is sufficient to say, I think, with regard to this contention that all such flowing water is plainly within the language used, and no satisfactory reason has been suggested for restricting its natural import in the manner proposed.\nThe view of Craig J., who delivered a dissenting judgment in the court below, requires a fuller examination. The law-making authority could not, the learned judge thinks, have intended to deprive the lessee of an hydraulic location of the right to divert and use such water for the purposes of mining his location; and must, therefore, in the absence of ex press reservation, be held to have left him the rights of a riparian proprietor in respect of such water subject to any rights granted under the regulations referred to in clause 10.\nTurning then to the grant on which the plaintiff rests his right to divert the water in question here\u2014 (which, following the form prescribed by the regulations, contains the proviso,\nit is expressly the condition of this water right that the same is issued subject entirely to all rights subsisting at this date to the water in respect to which this right is issued,)\nthe learned judge concludes that, since the defendant's riparian rights were in existence at the date of the plaintiff's grant, the riparian rights are, by virtue of the proviso quoted, paramount.\nThis view, I think, proceeds upon an inadequate appreciation of the scope and object of the last mentioned regulations.\nAt the time these regulations came into force, the law provided for the acquisition by free miners of rights to mine, by various methods, the Crown lands in the Yukon Territory. One set of regulations (providing for the acquisition of \"mineral claims\"), conferred upon holders of such claims the right to mine them for mineral in place, and the exclusive right of entry upon them for the purpose of such mining. A second set of regulations relating to placer mining conferred the right upon holders of claims located under them, to mine alluvial deposits for the precious metals within the limits of their claims. A third set of regulations authorized the leasing of beds of creeks and rivers; and conferred upon the lessees the right to mine the alluvial deposits in such beds, by the process of dredging, for the precious metals. And a fourth set, those relating to the grant of the leases of locations for hydraulic mining, already referred to, be came law a few months later.\nThe efficient exercise of any of these rights of mining would depend, in almost any given case, upon the existence of an available supply of water; and it was to secure the application of the water found in natural streams and lakes to practical use in mining and in the treatment of the products of mining, as well as its equitable distribution among those engaged in that industry, that the regulations of the 3rd of August, 1898, were passed. From that date those regulations, I think, constituted a code, subject to the exception presently to be mentioned, governing the acquisition of the right to divert and use such water for the purposes mentioned.\nOne exception is recognized. By the regulations relating to placer mining, the holder of a placer claim was given the right to use so much of the water flowing through or past his claim as the mining recorder should think necessary to enable him to work his claims. These provisions the regulations of August 3rd do not displace, and the rights of the grantee of a water privilege are by them expressly made subject to the rights of placer miners working on occupied creeks above or below the point of diversion at the date of his grant.\nBut I do not agree that the language of the regulations justifies the view that grants made under them were intended to be subject to the common law rights of riparian owners respecting the flow of the waters to which such grants should apply.\nThe learned judge bases his view upon the proviso which I have already quoted from the form of grant prescribed by the regulations. This proviso has not, I think, any application to the rights of riparian proprietors as such.\nThe natural rights of a riparian proprietor as such are not primarily rights of user (says Cotton L.J. in Kensit v. Great Eastern Ry. Co. ([13]), at page 133), but rights incidental to the ownership of property;\nand such rights are not, I think, aptly described by the words of the proviso.\nMoreover, the language of clause 5 of the regulations indicates, I think, that, both in the proviso and in the clause, the law-making authority was dealing with substantive rights of user and not such rights in respect of the flow of a stream as are merely incidental to a riparian proprietorship.\nSubstantive rights of user of the waters of particular streams may well have been vested in individuals at the time the regulations came into force. The regulations relating to quartz mining, for example,\u2014the provisions of which in this respect were displaced by the last mentioned regulations\u2014provided for the acquisition of such rights in connection with the working of quartz claims or operations incidental thereto. And there may have been other cases. Such vested rights\u2014at least so long as they are in exercise for a beneficial purpose\u2014are protected. And, of course, prior grants under the regulations themselves are within the clause and the proviso.\nThe language of the provisions in question may, therefore, be given its full effect without extending it to embrace riparian rights\u2014a class of rights, as I have said, to which it does not fitly apply.\nIt must be apparent, moreover, that if the rights of grantees of water privileges under the regulations are in every case subordinate to the existing common law rights of riparian owners the purpose of the regulations must in the practical administration of them be largely, if not wholly, frustrated. We ought not, unless compelled by intractable language, to attribute to the legislative authority an intention to promulgate a scheme so obviously futile, and a construction leading to that result must, I think, be rejected. See Salmon v. Duncombe ([14]), and Martly v. Carson ([15]), at page 658.\nIn this view of the regulations, on which the plain tiff's grant is based, no difficulty, I think, arises in the construction or application of clause 10 of the regulations respecting the leasing of hydraulic locations; that clause can only be read as a recognition that, notwithstanding the provisions of any lease of an hydraulic location, the natural waters on or flowing through or past such a location are subject to be dealt with under the regulations of August, 1898, relating to the diversion and use of water; and consequently that the rights conferred by such lessees are A minor question arises upon the defendant's counterclaim, that is to say: Whether or not the defendant is entitled to an injunction compelling the plaintiff to remove his dam, flume and certain building and machinery he has erected within the limits of the defendant's location?\nAs to the buildings, the plaintiff alleges they were erected with the consent of the defendant's manager, and although upon this there is some conflict of evidence, there is, I think, so much in the circumstances pointing to acquiescence on the part of the defendant that we should not, as against the view of the two courts below, be justified in granting a mandatory injunction to compel the plaintiff to remove them. As to the flume, the construction of it appears to be expressly authorized by the plaintiff's grant.\nThe penning back of the water of the creek presents a case not quite so obvious. If it clearly appeared that, in constructing the dam, the plaintiff was exceeding the rights conferred, by his grant, and there had been no other answer to the defendant's claim under this head, it might have been necessary to consider the question whether the defendant, by its lease, acquired any rights of occupation other than those defined by clause 9 of the regulations, and whether so long as its mining operations are not interfered with it has any rights of which the erection of such a structure would be an invasion. That question is, however, in my opinion, not presented by this appeal. The grant of the right to divert the waters of the stream at a place within the defendant's location, as well as a right to convey the water so diverted, by flume through that location, would seem to involve the grant of the subsidiary right to use such reason able means as may be necessary to turn the water from the bed of the creek into the plaintiff's flume. It is quite clear that the dam complained of does not affect the defendant's mining operations; and I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has done more than is necessary to enable him to take the benefit of his rights under his grant. In these circumstances the Gold Commissioner acted rightly in refusing the relief asked.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. W. C.

On approaching the track he looked both ways, but did not look again just before crossing when he could have seen an engine approaching which struck his team and he was killed. In an action by his widow and children the jury found that the statutory warnings had not been given and a verdict was given for the plaintiffs and affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont. L.R. 71), Fitzpatrick C.J. hesitante, that the findings of the jury were not such as could not have been reached by reasonable men and the verdict was justified.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nIn the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Mr. Justice Garrow the facts are stated as follows:\n\u201cThe facts are simple and not seriously in dispute. On 13th August, 1904, about 2 p.m., Robert Misener, aged 48 years, a farmer, was driving with a team of horses and a waggon along a highway in the County of Welland, which is crossed by defendants\u2019 line of railway, and at the intersection he was struck by an engine in charge of defendants\u2019 servants and instantly killed, his horses killed and his waggon and harness destroyed.\n\u201cThe engine was unattached and was running through from Niagara Falls to St. Thomas at a high rate of speed ; one witness, Mrs. Louisa Pew, who had resided near the crossing for 13 years, stating that she had never seen an engine going so fast since she lived there, and even the trainmen admitted that they were going at from 35 to 40 miles an hour.\n\u201cDeceased, as he approached the track, was driving at a pace of about three miles an hour. Immediately behind him, going in the same direction was one William Locke, also driving, who was called as a witness by plaintiffs. Asked to tell what took place, Mr. Locke said; \u2018Well, the engine gave toot-toot and then the crash came about the one time.\u2019 The engine ran, after the collision, from a quarter to a half a mile. When it struck the waggon, it made it \u2018go up in splinters,\u2019 and deceased was thrown up the track \u2018out of our sight.\u2019 Locke did not stop because the sight had made his wife, who was with him, ill. He saw deceased as he approached the crossing look towards the \u2018Falls\u2019 (the direction from which the engine came) and then look the other way. He (the witness) also looked at the same time and saw and heard nothing on the track. At the time deceased looked, his horses \u2018were going on to the rails, I could not say how far.\u2019 On cross-examination he became a little more definite as to the exact place at which deceased looked, which was, he said, at the raise of the road to go up to the track, which would be at least as far back as the railway fence. Until the line of the railway fence is reached, there are obstructions to a clear view, such as the fences themselves, an orchard which approaches but does not reach the corner, and a walnut tree, which was then in leaf, as was also the orchard. But when the fences are reached and passed, and before the rails are actually reached, there is an unobstructed view for a considerable distance, perhaps a quarter of a mile, along the track in the direction from which the engine came, and if deceased had looked again when at or past the fence and before he reached the rails, this witness deposed that he could have seen the approaching engine, and could, as his horses were going at a slow pace, have turned towards the side, and thus have avoided the collision.\n\u201cThere was no evidence that deceased looked more than once, and the substantial point in the case is whether, under the circumstances, his failure to look again is fatal, the defendants contending at the trial and before us that such failure to look again was conclusive proof of contributory negligence, and that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury. The judge refused a motion for nonsuit, holding that there was evidence proper to be submitted to the jury.\n\u201cThe jury in answer to questions found that the whistle was not sounded nor the bell rung, and that such neglect was the proximate cause of the injury, and that deceased could not by the exercise of ordinary care have avoided the injury. Other questions based upon the possibility of an affirmative answer to the question as to contributory negligence were also put and answered, but they apparently became of no consequence when contributory negligence was nega- tived. And the jury assessed the damages as follows : To the widow, Isabella Misener, $800; daughter Ethel, $300; daughter Flossie, $500; son Norman Robert, $800; and the damages to personal property, $440.\u201d\nRose for the appellants. The evidence was not sufficient for submission of the case to the jury and the judge should have withdrawn it. Giblin v. McMullen[2]; Wakelin v. London & South West Railway Co.[3]\nThe late case of Andreas v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4] is in point.\nGerman K.C. for the respondents referred to Peart v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is certainly \u201cas weak a case as can well be conceived\u201d and almost involves the proposition that \u201cgiven an accident at a railway crossing of a nature consistent with the absence of negligence, the company is presumed to be guilty of negligence in respect of it.\u201d I concur in the judgment, but with much hesitation. No specific defect in the roadbed or in the construction or equipment of the locomotive is complained of. The accident is alleged to have been occasioned through the negligence of the defendants\u2019 employees with respect to the ringing of the bell and blowing of the whistle. To ring the bell and blow the whistle at a highway crossing is a statutory duty, the neglect of which renders the engineer and fireman of a locomotive liable to a criminal prosecution. The legal presumption is, therefore, that they performed their duty and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the plaintiff\u2019s action must be dismissed. The most that can be said in this case is that it is proved negatively, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that certain witnesses did not hear the bell or the whistle, and, affirmatively, it is proved by those best in a position to know, the engineer and the fireman, that the requirements of the statute in that respect were strictly complied with. In view of the cases, however, I assume that this is a question which must be submitted to the jury and by their answer we are bound.\nBut the onus is on the plaintiffs to shew, assuming that the negligence of the defendants is proved, that such negligence was the determining cause of the accident, and, on the evidence, I should have been strongly inclined to the view that the state of things existing at the time of the accident was consistent with the theory that the death was caused by the deceased\u2019s own negligence, and, at the most, that the event occurred through the joint negligence of the deceased and of the servants of the defendant company.\nThe question for the jury was: Could the deceased by a reasonable use of his senses have discovered the proximity of the approaching train in time to avoid the accident?\nApproaching the line at one hundred feet from the crossing there is a clear view of the track for a distance of one thousand three hundred and fifty feet, and, at the railway fence, which is about seventy-two feet from the crossing, there is a clear line of sight to a point 1,700 feet away.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 own witness, Locke, the only one examined of the two persons who were eye-witnesses of the accident, proves that at any point between the railway fence and the southern rail there was a clear view in the direction from which the train was coming of 1,700 feet, and this same witness gives evidence to the effect that the deceased could, had he looked when there, have seen as far as the second whistling post, a quarter of a mile distant. He also admits, on cross-examination, that the horses of the deceased, which were then moving at a slow walk, could have been turned aside and the accident avoided. Approaching this crossing the deceased was bound \u201cto use such faculties of sight and hearing as he was possessed of.\u201d If he did not do so he was negligent. If, having done so, he saw the train, as he must have done according to the evidence of the sole witness of the accident, and he went recklessly forward, then he voluntarily incurred the risk and must suffer the consequences. Cooper v. The North Carolina Railroad Co.[6]; Schmidt v. Missouri Pacific Railway Co.[7]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[8].\nI assume, however, that to reach a conclusion as to which of the two parties is responsible for the accident, admitting that both were negligent, a comparison of the facts by the jury was necessary and, by their finding, the cases seem to hold that the court was bound.\nFor all these reasons I entertain grave doubt and, were it not for the conclusion reached by the careful and learned trial judge, adopted by the Court of Appeal, I would have held that the judge, on a preliminary question of law, should have decided that there was no evidence on which the jury could properly find for the plaintiffs, but I defer to my brother judges and adopt their view.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I do not desire, even by implication, to cast a doubt upon the reasonable and salutary rule so frequently laid down by this court as to the duty which the law imposes upon persons travelling along a highway while passing or attempting to pass over a level railway crossing. They must act as reasonable and sentient beings and, unless excused by special circumstances, must look before attempting to cross to see whether they can do so with safety. If they choose, blindly, recklessly or foolishly to run into danger, they must surely take the consequences.\nIn the case at bar the jury found that the statutory requirements as to the engine sounding the whistle and ringing the bell before coming to the crossing had not been complied with, and further, that the deceased who was killed at the crossing had not been guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe appeal was not sought to be allowed because of anything wrong or misleading in the judge\u2019s charge except with respect to his direction as to looking and listening. That charge was very clear and, in my opinion, covered all the disputed points in a manner leaving nothing to be desired.\nThat learned judge did not indicate any disapproval of the findings of the jury. On the contrary he directed judgment to be entered upon them for the plaintiffs for the amount of the damages, having previously refused to nonsuit.\nAn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed and we are now asked to reverse the judgment of two courts founded on findings of facts by a jury on matters peculiarly within their province.\nThe only question open to us to consider is whether the findings are such as, under the circumstances of the case, reasonable men might fairly find.\nIn deference to the strong argument pressed by Mr. Rose upon us, I have gone over the evidence with great care and the conclusion I reached was not one that the findings were such as, in the face of the conflicting evidence, reasonable men could not fairly have found.\nThere were two or three points in the case to which the appellants did not seem to me to attach sufficient importance. One was that the railway crossed at art acute angle and not at right angles and that a traveller going northwesterly, when crossing the railway tracks, would have his back turned almost to the approaching train. Another was the unwonted speed with which the unattached engine which killed the deceased approached the highway and another that he could not have seen the approaching train until he was past the railway fence at the crossing.\nNow, assuming the findings of the jury as to the signals to be correct, the only question remaining would be as to the manner in which deceased discharged his duty of looking along the track behind him. At best the moments when he could have seen the engine at all might be counted by seconds and I think the evidence as to the degree of care exercised by him, in view of these facts, quite sufficient to justify the finding of the absence of contributory negligence.

By the judgment appealed from, this decision was affirmed and it was held that the agreement of which the enforcement was sought was intra vires; that the defendants were obliged to sell the tickets in question and to receive them from all persons tendering the same in payment of passenger fares during the specified hours of each day; that the action could be maintained without the aid of the Attorney-General of the province, and that specific performance of the contract could be enforced by injunction.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the parties, on the appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs.

The learned trial judge considered the evidence unsatisfactory, as the plaintiff did not produce the books of account shewing how the consideration for the note was made up, and as there was evidence to support the plea of illegality. The appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banc, was heard before five judges, but, at the time the judgment appealed from was rendered, one of these judges had resigned and there was an equal division of opinion among the remaining judges who had heard the appeal. The appeal, therefore, stood dismissed without costs, and the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nNewcombe K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellant.\nHarris K.C. and Lovett for the respondents. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of Graham J., the trial judge, confirmed. An appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against that judgment resulted in an equal division of that court, the Chief Justice Weatherbe, and Longley J. being of opinion that the trial judge who dismissed the action should be reversed and judgment entered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, while Townshend and Russell JJ. were for confirming the judgment.\nThe action was one brought upon a note of hand signed by the defendants in plaintiff\u2019s favour, for $568.68. That note was one of several renewals of a note originally signed by the defendants in favour of one McKenzie for $960.\nThe defence was that Ross was the son-in-law and clerk of McKenzie, the payee of the I960 and came to the defendants\u2019 house and personally induced them to sign this note and also another one for $409.70 as an accommodation for him. McKenzie subsequently became insolvent and Ross purchased his estate and debts. When the $409.70 came due, Ross claimed that they should pay it because it really represented the aggregate amounts of several store accounts which Gannon and his sons, one of whom was dead, had incurred at McKenzie\u2019s store. On being satisfied that this was correct, and a statement being rendered of the several accounts, the Gannons paid this $409.70 note.\nWith regard to the other note for $960, they repudiated any liability on the ground that they never had received any consideration for it and that it was expressly signed by them for Ross and at his request as an accommodation merely. Ross contended that it too represented a debt which the deceased son Dan Gannon owed McKenzie and of which he had become the assignee.\nJoseph Gannon, the father of the three boys and one of the defendants, gave this evidence:\nI remember the transaction about note of $960 and different renewals. Mr. Ross came in to me and asked if I would put my name to a note of that amount, and I said, \u201cNo\u201d ; and he said, \u201cYou might, your son Dan always accommodated me\u201d; and I said, \u201cIt is too big, and I won\u2019t sign it.\u201d Ross said, \u201cThere is a vessel down in the dock that I want to buy\u201d; and I said, \u201cSupposing you would die?\u201d; and he said \u201cMy wife will look after it.\u201d I said I would not sign it, and my son asked me then to put my name to it, and he said that Captain Carlin and himself will put our names to it, and you will never hear of it again; and I did. When the note came due, I came to Ross, and said, \u201cWhat about the note?\u201d and he said, \u201cYour son Dan owed me more than that.\u201d I said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you promise I would not be troubled about it?\u201d; and he said, \u201cYour son Dan owed me.\u201d I said \u201cIf my son owed you anything, and you bring an honest bill, I will pay you\u201d; and he said he could not bring an honest bill because it was smuggling; and I said, \u201cIf you say anything more about it I will put you behind the bars.\u201d I never had any dealings with Ross. The first time he spoke to me about my son Dan owing him anything was when the first note came due. I asked him what my son owed him for, and he said, \u201cWe were into the smuggling, and it was my money that went into it\u201d; and I said, \u201cI know nothing about that.\u201d\nJohn Gannon, defendant, and Pius Gannon, another son, who was present at the time of the signing of the note, corroborated the old man Joseph that Ross had induced the father and son to sign the note as an accommodation for him merely representing that he, Ross, would protect the note when it fell due and they would not be called upon for it.\nWhen Ross was called he denied that the note was signed as an accommodation for him and contended it was for a debt which the deceased son Dan owed McKenzie.\nHe did not deny, however, in any way the sworn statement of the old man that when the note fell due he had come to Ross and asked what about the note, and that his only reply was, \u201cYour son Dan owed me more than that,\u201d and that when taxed by Gannon with having promised when the note was signed that he, Gannon, would not be troubled about it he had only replied, \u201cYour son Dan owed me,\u201d or the further statement, \u201cIf my son owed you anything and you bring an honest bill I will pay you,\u201d and his reply that he could not bring an honest bill because it was smuggling.\nThese statements remained uncontradicted, and were believed by the trial judge. The only book Ross produced of the Gannon\u2019s dealings with McKenzie was a ledger shewing accounts due by the several members of the Gannon family including the deceased Dan, amounting in the aggregate to the $409.70 note which they had paid.\nRoss contended that there was another book of McKenzie\u2019s either a day book or ledger, containing other accounts between McKenzie and the deceased Dan, but his story as to this book was, as the trial judge said, unsatisfactory, and I fully agree with him. There was no pretence of there having been any consideration for the note other than the alleged account due by the deceased boy Dan to McKenzie which Ross himself in the uncontradicted evidence stated was for smuggling.\nOn the whole evidence I think the findings of the trial judge fully sustained by the evidence, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. L. McPhee.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. H. Butts.\n[1] 39 N.S. Hep. 65.\n"}
