At the trial, the appellant and some other witnesses were heard in support of appellant\u2019s explanation that he had bought these goods in good faith and without any knowledge that they were stolen effects. The appellant appealed to the appellate court on the ground that his explanation was a reasonable one, that the Crown had failed to discharge the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the accused\u2019s guilt and that the explanation was equally plausible as to his innocence or to guilt. The majority of the appellate court affirmed the conviction, one judge dissenting on the ground that there was no evidence upon which the appellant could be convicted.\nHeld, that the appeal should be dismissed. The question to which it was the duty of the trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be true; or, in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the appellant could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.\u2014Rex v. Schama (11 C.A.R. 45); Rex v. Searle (51 C.C.C. 128) and Re Ketteringham (19 C.C.C. 159) ref. and app.\u2014 Under all the circumstances of the case, it cannot be held that there was no evidence that the explanation offered by the appellant was one that the trial judge might not find could not reasonably be accepted as true.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming (Pratte (ad hoc) J. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant for the offence, under section 399 of the Criminal Code, of receiving or retaining in his possession stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nLucien H. Gendron K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn Crankshaw K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The proper direction on the trial of an accused charged under section 399 of the Criminal Code with receiving or retaining in his possession stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen, is explained in three judgments to which our attention was called by Mr. Gendron.\nIn the Schama case[1], the Lord Chief Justice explained the rule as follows:\u2014\nWhere the prisoner is charged with receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner\u2019s guilt.\nThis passage was applied by the Appellate Division of Alberta in a judgment delivered by Harvey C.J. in Rex v. Searle[2].\nIn the Ketteringham case[3], Avory J. said:\nThe question which should have been left to the jury was simply: \u201cDid the appellant receive the goods in such circumstances that he must then have known them to have been stolen?\u201d The question, however, which was left was whether the jury thought that the account given by the appellant\u2019s son in evidence of the manner in which he became possessed of the goods could be accepted. The jury should have been told not only that they could acquit, but that they ought to acquit, the appellant if they were satisfied that his explanation was consistent with his innocence.\nThe question, therefore, to which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.\nThe dissenting judge did not put his dissent on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected himself on any point of law, or that he had not applied his mind to the precise question which it was his duty, as indicated in what has just been said, to determine. He dissented on the ground that there was no evidence upon which the accused could be convicted and I assume that to mean that there was in point of law no evidence to support a verdict of guilty. After considering all the circumstances, I am unable to agree with this view; in other words, I am not satisfied that there is no evidence that the explanation offered was one that the trial judge might not find could not reasonably be accepted as true.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nCannon, J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gendron, Mouette & Gauthier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Jacques Fournier.\n[1] (1914) 11 C.A.R. 45, at 49.\n[2] (1929) 51 C.C.C. 128 at 131.\n[3] (1926) 19 C.A.R. 159, at 160.\n"}

McGregor Stewart K.C. and C. P. Plaxton K.C. for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nAuguste D\u00e9silets K.C. and C. A. S\u00e9guin K.C., for the Attorney-General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ. (Crocket J. concurring) was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The reference with which we are concerned arises out of a controversy between the Dominion and the province of Quebec touching the question whether the Eskimo inhabitants of that province are \u201cIndians\u201d within the contemplation of head no. 24 of section 91 of the British North America Act which is in these words, \u201cIndians and Lands Reserved for Indians\u201d; and under the reference we are to pronounce upon that question.\nAmong the inhabitants of the three provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Canada that, by the immediate operation of the British North America Act, became subject to the constitutional enactments of that statute there were few, if any, Eskimo. But the British North America Act contemplated the eventual admission into the Union of other parts of British North America as is explicitly declared in the preamble and for which provision is made by section 146 thereof.\nThe Eskimo population of Quebec inhabits (in the northern part of the province) a territory that in 1867 formed part of Rupert\u2019s Land and the question we have to determine is whether these Eskimo, whose ancestors were aborigines of Rupert\u2019s Land in 1867 and at the time of its annexation to Canada, are Indians in the sense mentioned.\nIn 1867 the Eskimo population of what is now Canada, then between four and five thousand in number, occupied, as at the present time, the northern littoral of the continent from Alaska to, and including part of, the Labrador coast, within the territories under the control of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, that is to say, in Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory which, under the authority given by section 146 of the British North America Act, were acquired by Canada in 1871. In addition to these Eskimo in Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory, there were some hundreds of them on that part of the coast of Labrador (east of Hudson Strait) which formed part of, and was subject to the Government of, Newfoundland.\nThe British North America Act is a statute dealing with British North America and, in determining the meaning of the words \u201cIndians\u201d in the statute, we have to consider the meaning of that term as applied to the inhabitants of British North America. In 1867 more than half of the Indian population of British North America were within the boundaries of Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory; and of the Eskimo population nearly ninety per cent were within those boundaries. It is, therefore, important to consult the reliable sources of information as to the use of the term \u201cIndian\u201d in relation to the Eskimo in those territories. Fortunately, there is evidence of the most authoritative character furnished by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company itself.\nIt will be recalled that the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, besides being a trading company, possessed considerable powers of government and administration. Some years before the passing of the British North America Act, complaints having been made as to the manner in which these responsibilities had been discharged, a committee of the House of Commons in 1856 and 1857 investigated the affairs of the Company. Among the matters which naturally engaged the attention of the Committee was the Company\u2019s relations with and conduct towards the aborigines; and for the information of the Committee a census was prepared and produced before it by the officers of the Company showing the Indian populations under its rule throughout the whole of the North American continent. This census was accompanied by a map showing the \u201clocations\u201d of the various tribes and was included in the Report of the Committee; and was made an appendix to the Committee\u2019s Report which was printed and published by the order of the House of Commons. It is indisputable that in the census and in the map the \u201cesquimaux\u201d fall under the general designation \u201cIndians\u201d and that, indeed, in these documents, \u201cIndians\u201d is used as synonymous with \u201caborigines.\u201d The map bears this description:\nAn Aboriginal Map of North America denoting the boundaries and locations of various Indian Tribes.\nAmong these \u201cIndian Tribes\u201d the Eskimo are shown inhabiting the northern littoral of the continent from Labrador to Russian America. In the margin of the map are tables. Two are of great significance. The first of these is headed \u201cStatement of the Indian Tribes of the Hudsons Bay Territories.\u201d The tribes \u201cEast of the Rocky Mountains\u201d are given as \u201cBlackfeet and Sioux groups comprising eight tribes, Algonquins comprising twelve tribes\u201d and \u201cEsquimaux.\u201d\nThe second is headed \u201cIndian Nations once dwelling East of the Mississippi.\u201d The list is as follows:\nAlgonquin\nDahcotah or Sioux\nHuron Iroquois\nCatawba (extinct)\nCherokee\nUchee (extinct)\nNatches (extinct)\nMobilian\nEsquimaux\nKoloocb\nAthabascan\nSioux\nAlgonquin\nIroquois\nThe census concludes with a summary which is in these words:\nThe Indian Races shown in detail in the foregoing census may be classified as follows:\nThickwood Indians on the east side of the Rocky\nMountains \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 35,000\nThe Plain Tribes (Blackfeet, etc.) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 25,000\nThe Esquimaux \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 4.000\nIndians settled in Canada\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 3,000\nIndian in British Oregon and on the North West Coast.. 80,000\n________\nTotal Indians 147,000\nWhites and half-breeds in Hudson\u2019s Bay Territory 11,000\n________\nSouls 158,000\nAs already observed, the appointment of the Committee was due in part at all events to representations made to the Imperial Government respecting the conduct of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company towards the Indians and the condition of the Indian population was one of the subjects with which the Committee was principally concerned. They were also concerned with representations made by the Government of Canada urging the desirability of transferring to Canada all the territories of the Company, at least as far west as the Rocky Mountains. Chief Justice Draper was present at the sittings of the Committee representing the Government of Canada. The Committee, as is well known, reported in favour of the cession to Canada of the districts of the Red River and the Saskatchewan River.\nSeven years later, the scheme of Confederation, propounded in the Quebec Resolutions of October 10th, 1864, included a declaration that provision should be made\nfor the admission into the Union on equitable terms of Newfoundland, the North-West Territory, British Columbia, and Vancouver.\nThis declaration, was renewed in the Resolutions of the London Conference in December, 1866, and in the British North America Act specific provision was made, as we have seen, in section 146 for the acquisition of Rupert\u2019s Land as well as the North-West Territory and, in 1868, a statute of the Imperial Parliament conferred upon the Queen the necessary powers as respects Rupert\u2019s Land.\nThe British North America Act came into force on the 1st of July, 1867, and, in December of that year, a joint address to Her Majesty was voted by the Senate and House of Commons of Canada praying that authority might be granted to the Parliament of Canada to legislate for the future welfare and good government of these regions and expressing the willingness of that Parliament to assume the duties and obligations of government and legislation as regards those territories. In the Resolution of the Senate expressing the willingness of that body to concur in the joint address is this paragraph:\nResolved that upon the transference of the Territories in question to the Canadian Government, it will be the duty of the Government to make adequate provisions for the protection of the Indian Tribes, whose interest and well being are involved in the transfer.\nBy Order in Council of the 23rd of June, 1870, it was ordered that from and after the 15th of July, 1870, the North West Territory and Rupert\u2019s Land should be admitted into, and become part of, the Dominion of Canada and that, from that date, the Parliament of Canada should have full power and authority to legislate for the future welfare and good government of the territory. As regards Rupert\u2019s Land, such authority had already been conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by section 5 of the Rupert\u2019s Land Act of 1868.\nThe vast territories which by these transactions became part of the Dominion of Canada and were brought under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada were in-habited largely, indeed almost entirely, by aborigines. It appears to me to be a consideration of great weight in determining the meaning of the word \u201cIndians\u201d in the British North America Act that, as we have seen, the Eskimo were recognized as an Indian tribe by the officials of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company which, in 1867, as already observed, exercised powers of government and administration over this great tract; and that, moreover, this employment of the term \u201cIndians\u201d is evidenced in a most unequivocal way by documents prepared by those officials and produced before the Select Committee of the House of Commons which were included in the Report of that Committee which, again, as already mentioned, was printed and published by the order of the House. It is quite clear from the material before us that this Report was the principal source of information as regards the aborigines in those territories until some years after Confederation.\nI turn now to the Eskimo inhabiting the coast of Labrador beyond the confines of the Hudson\u2019s Bay territories and within the boundaries and under the government of Newfoundland. As regards these, the evidence appears to be conclusive that, for a period beginning about 1760 and extending down to a time subsequent to the passing of the British North America Act, they were, by governors, commanders-in-chief of the navy and other naval officers, ecclesiastics, missionaries and traders who came into contact with them, known and classified as Indians.\nFirst, of the official documents. In 1762, General Murray, then Governor of Quebec, who afterwards became first Governor of Canada, in an official report of the state of the government of Quebec, deals under the sixth heading with \u201cIndian nations residing within the government.\u201d He introduces discussion with this sentence:\nIn order to discuss this point more clearly I shall first take notice of the Savages on the North shore of the River St. Laurence from the Ocean upwards, and then of such as inhabit the South side of the same River, as far as the present limits of the Government extend on either side of it.\nIn the first and second paragraphs he deals with \u201cSavages\u201d on the North Shore and he says: \u201cThe first to be met with on this side are the Esquimaux.\u201d In the second paragraph he deals with the Montagnais who inhabited a \u201cvast tract\u201d of country from Labrador to the Saguenay.\nIt is clear that here the Eskimo are classified under the generic term Indian. They are called \u201cSavages,\u201d it is true, but so are the Montagnais and so also the Hurons settled at Jeune Lorette. It is useful to note that he speaks in the first paragraph of the Esquimaux as \u201cthe wildest and most untamable of any\u201d and mentions that they are \u201cemphatically styled by the other Nations, Savages.\u201d\nThen there are two reports to His Majesty by the Lords of Trade. The first, dated June 8th, 1763, discusses the trade carried on by the French on the coast of Labrador. It is said that they carried on\nan extensive trade with the Esquimaux Indians in Oyl, Furs, & ca. (in which they allowed Your Majesty\u2019s Subjects no Share).\nIn the second, dated the 16th of April, 1765, in dealing with complaints on the part of the Court of France respecting the French fishery on the coast of Newfoundland and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, their observations on these complaints are based upon information furnished by Commodore Palliser who had been entrusted with the super-intendency of the Newfoundland fishery and the government of the island. In this report, this sentence occurs:\nThe sixth and last head of complaint contained in the French Ambassador\u2019s letter is, that a captain of a certain French vessel was forbid by your Majesty\u2019s Governor from having commerce with the Eskimaux Indians;\nand upon that it is observed that the Governor \u201cis to be commended for having forbid the subjects of France to trade or treat with these Indians.\u201d \u201cThese Indians\u201d are spoken of as \u201cinhabitants * * * who are under the protection of and dependent upon your Majesty.\u201d\nThen there is a series of proclamations by successive Governors and Commanders-in-Chief in Newfoundland, the first of which was that of Sir Hugh Palliser of the 1st of July, 1964. The Proclamation recites,\n* * * Advantages would arise to His Majesty\u2019s Trading Subjects if a Friendly Intercourse could be Established with the Esquemeaux Indians, Inhabiting the Coast of Labrador * * *\nand that the Government\nhas taken measures for bringing about a friendly communication between the said Indians and His Majesty\u2019s subjects.\nAll His Majesty\u2019s subjects are strictly enjoined \u201cto treat them in the most civil and friendly manner.\u201d\nThe next is a Proclamation by the same Governor dated the 8th of April, 1765, which recites the desirability of\nfriendly intercourse with the Indians on the Coast of Labrador\nand that\nattempts hitherto made for that purpose have proved ineffectual, especially with the Esquimaux in the Northern Ports without the Straits of Belle Isle\nand strictly enjoins and requires\nall His Majesty\u2019s subjects who meet with any of the said Indians to treat them in a most civil and friendly manner.\nOn the 10th of April, 1772, Governor Shuldham in a Proclamation of that date requires\nall His Majesty\u2019s subjects coming upon the coast of Labrador to act towards the Esquimaux Indians in a manner agreeable to the Proclamation issued at St. John\u2019s the 8th day of July 1769 respecting the savages inhabiting the coast of Labrador.\nIn this Proclamation it should be noted that \u201cEsquimaux savages\u201d and \u201cEsquimaux Indians\u201d are used as convertible expressions.\nIn 1774, the boundaries of Quebec were extended, and the northeastern coast of Labrador and the Eskimo population therein came under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Quebec and remained so until 1809. Nevertheless, the Governor and! Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland, who at the date was Admiral Edwards, acting under the authority of that Order in Council of the 9th of March, 1774, took measures to protect the missionaries of the Unitas Fratrum and their settlements on the coast of Labrador from molestation or disturbance and, on May 14th, 1779, Admiral Edwards issued a Proclamation requiring\nall His Majesty\u2019s subjects coming upon the Coast of Labrador to act towards the Esquimaux Indians justly, humanely and agreeably to these laws, by which His Majesty\u2019s subjects are bound.\nHere again it is to be observed that the words \u201csavages\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d are used as equivalents.\nA further Proclamation by Admiral Edwards on January 30th, 1781, employs the same phrases, the Eskimo being described as \u201cEsquimaux savages\u201d and as \u201cEsquimaux Indians.\u201d On May 15th, 1774, Governor Campbell, as Governor and Commander-in-Chief, issued a Proclamation in terms identical with that of 1781.\nOn the 3rd of December, 1821, a Proclamation was issued by Governor Hamilton as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland (now again including the Labrador coast) relating to a \u201cfourth settlement\u201d by the Moravian missionaries requiring all His Majesty\u2019s subjects \u201cto act towards the missionaries and the Esquimaux Indians justly and humanely.\u201d\nThere are other official documents. In a report in 1798 by Captain Crofton, addressed to Admiral Waldegrave, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland, the phrase \u201cEsquimaux Indians\u201d occurs several times and the Eskimo are plainly treated as coming under the designation \u201cIndians.\u201d\nA report to Lord Dorchester, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and their dependencies, in 1788, upon an application by George Cart-wright for a grant of land at Touktoke Bay on the coast of Labrador by a special Committee of the Council appointed to consider the same refers to the applicant\u2019s exertions in\nsecuring friendly intercourse with the Eskimaux Indians and his success in bringing about a friendly intercourse between that nation and the Mountaineers.\nEvidence as to subsequent official usage is adduced in a letter of 1824 from the Advocate General of Canada to the Assistant Civil Secretary on some matter of a criminal prosecution in which \u201cEsquimaux Indians\u201d are concerned; and in a report of 1869 by Judge Pinsent of the Court of Labrador to the Governor of Newfoundland in which this sentence occurs:\nIn this number about 300 Indians and half-breeds of the Esquimaux and Mountaineer races are included.\nReports from missionaries and clergymen are significant. I refer particularly to two. There is a communication in 1821 by the Unitas Fratrum sent to Admiral Hamilton, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland and Labrador, on a visit by H.M.S. Clinker to their settlements. In this the Eskimo are mentioned as \u201cEsquimaux Indians\u201d and \u201cEsquimaux Tribes\u201d and the report concludes with a table giving the numbers of \u201cEsquimaux Indians who have embraced the Christian religion\u201d at the various stations. In 1849, a report from the Bishop of Newfoundland was printed and published in London for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel by the Bishop of London with a prefatory letter and seems to have been put into circulation through Rivingtons and other booksellers. Extracts from this report, which describes a visit to Labrador, are produced in the Quebec case, and as these passages exemplify in a remarkable way the use of the term Indian, as designating the Eskimo inhabitants of Labrador as well as other classes of Indians there, it is right, I think, to reproduce them in full:\np.17.\u2014At St. Francis Harbour, where we next stopped, we celebrated the Lord\u2019s Supper, as there were several members of the Church from Newfoundland fishing in the neighbourhood; and the agent and his lady also communicated, (Mr. and Mrs. Saunders). Several Esquimaux Indians were here admitted into the Church, and married. One of them afterwards accompanied us as pilot to Sandwich Bay.\nI was obliged very reluctantly to leave the Church ship at St. Francis Harbour (the wind blowing in), and proceeded in a boat twenty-five miles to the Venison Islands, where I remained three days on shore, before the Hank could join us, and, with Mr. Hoyles, was very kindly entertained by Mr. Howe, Messrs. Slade\u2019s agent. Here all the females are either Esquimaux or mountaineer Indians, or descended from them. With the exception of Mrs. Saunders, there is not an Englishwoman on the coast, from Battle Harbour to Sandwich Bay; all, or nearly all, are Indians (Esquimaux or mountaineer), or half Indians, and of course the children are the same mixed race.\np. 40.\u2014Wednesday, August 2.\u2014The wind blew so strong last night, with heavy rain, that our captain, who was on shore, could not return to the ship. I had intended to proceed this morning, but, partly on account of the high sea, and partly because there was yet work to be done here, I was persuaded to delay my departure. I went on shore with my Chaplains after breakfast; and while I remained at the house of Mr. Ellis, the merchant of Newfoundland, they visited an Englishman, who was married, or united, to a poor Indian woman, an Esquimaux, and who we understood, had children to be baptized.\np. 49.\u2014Mr. Bendle also informed us of the character &c, of the Indians who dwell in or resort to his neighbourhood. There are three distinct tribes\u2014the Micmacs, Mountaineers and Esquimaux. The first two are generally Roman Catholics, but the Esquimaux owe their instruction and conversion to the Moravian Missionaries. These Missionaries (on the Labrador coast) have four stations and establishments, the nearest about 400 miles to the north of Battle Harbour, and the most distant nearly 400 miles farther, or 800 from this place. There are three families of the Moravians at each of their stations, who live together in a stone house, and have large trading concerns in fish, &c, with the Esquimaux.\np. 63.\u2014Tuesday, August 15.\u2014The wind came round again to the westward this morning, but was very light. We got under way at ten o\u2019clock, and did not reach the Seal Islands till five. Mr. Howe kindly furnished a pilot. Here, as in every other harbour, are several vessels from Newfoundland. Messrs. Hunt also keep a small \u201ccrew\u201d here; 74868\u20143 that is, a few men dwelling together to prosecute the fishery in the summer and kill seals in the winter. Five Englishmen remained together here last winter, who killed 500 seals. In the first three months of the year they are in the woods, to cut timber and firewood. Besides this crew, the only residents are Indians (Esquimaux) and half Indians, who live together, crowded in two huts, with an Englishman who has taken one of the half Indian women as his wife. Guided by the skipper of Mr. Hunt\u2019s crew, we visited these Indians. Nearly all (twenty out of twenty-three) crowded together in one small hut, with our two guides, Messrs. Harvey and Hoyles, and myself. A strange group, or crowd, we were. Indians will compress into the smallest possible compass; but still we were brought into painfully close proximity.\np. 68.\u2014A few years ago the Esquimaux women, generaly wore a cloak, or cope, of seal-skin, with the hair outwards, the tail hanging down behind, and the flippers on their arms; but now all rejoice in European dresses, shawls and gowns of many colours. The only remains of Indian dress is the sealskin boot, which even the smallest children wear; it is of great use in the snow, being quite impervious to wet. In the race of mixed blood, or Anglo-Esquimaux, the Indian characteristics very much disappear, and the children are both lively and comely.\np. 69.\u2014The afternoon service commenced soon after three o\u2019clock, and was not concluded till seven o\u2019clock, in consequence of the numbers to be christened and added to the Church. I admitted six adults myself, who were able to answer for themselves; three were Esquimaux. All made the proper answers correctly and seriously, and not the least so the poor Indians.\nHaving regard to the well established usage of designating the Esquimaux of Labrador as Indians or Esquimaux Indians, evidenced by the Proclamations of the Governors of Newfoundland, and other official and unofficial documents, one finds little difficulty in appreciating the significance of the phraseology of the correspondence, in 1879, between Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Hector Langevin on the subject of the Eskimo on the north shore of the St. Lawrence. The phrase \u201cEsquimaux Indians\u201d is employed in this correspondence as it had been employed for a hundred years in official and other documents to designate the Labrador Esquimaux. In .1882, three years after the date of this correspondence, the sale of intoxicating liquors to \u201cEsquimaux Indians\u201d was prohibited by an Act of the Legislature of Newfoundland.\nNewfoundland, including the territory inhabited by these Labrador Eskimo was, as already pointed out, one of the British North American colonies the union of which with Canada was contemplated by the British North America Act. Thus it appears that, through all the territories of British North America in which there were Eskimo, the term \u201cIndian\u201d was employed by well established usage as including these as well as the other aborigines;\u2019 and I repeat the British North America Act, in so far as it deals with the subject of Indians, must, in my opinion, be taken to contemplate the Indians of British North America as a whole.\nAs against this evidence, the Dominion appeals to the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as furnishing the clue to the true meaning and application of the term \u201cIndians\u201d in section 91. The Indians therein referred to are said to be\nthe same type of aborigines as are described in that Proclamation as \u201cthe several nations or tribes of Indian with whom We are connected and who live under Our protection.\u201d\nFirst, it is said that the terms \u201cnation\u201d and \u201ctribe\u201d are not employed in relation to the Eskimo. That is a proposition which finds no support in the documents produced dealing with the Labrador Eskimo; and, as regards the Eskimo inhabiting the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s territories, they, as already pointed out, are (in the tables in the margin of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2019s aboriginal map) included in the statement of \u201cIndian tribes\u201d in those territories and they are in the list of \u201cIndian nations\u201d once dwelling east of the Mississippi.\nThen it is said they were never \u201cconnected\u201d with the British Crown or \u201cunder the protection\u201d of the Crown. I find some difficulty in affirming that the Eskimo and other Indians ruled by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, under either charter or licence from the Crown, were never under the protection of the Crown, and in understanding how, especially in view of the Proclamations cited, that can be affirmed of the Esquimaux of northeastern Labrador. I cannot give my adherence to the principle of interpretation of the British North America Act which, in face of the ample evidence of the broad denotation of the term \u201cIndian\u201d as employed to designate the aborigines of Labrador and the Hudson\u2019s Bay territories as evidenced by the documents referred to, would impose upon that term in the British North America Act a narrower interpretation by reference to the recitals of and the events leading up to the Proclamation of 1763. For analogous reasons I am unable to accept the list of Indian tribes attached to the instructions to Sir Guy Carleton as controlling the scope of the term \u201cIndians\u201d in the British North America Act. Here it may be observed parenthetically that if this list of tribes does not include Eskimo, as apparently it does not, neither does it appear to include the Montagnais Indians inhabiting the north shore of the St. Lawrence east of the Saguenay or the Blackfeet or the Cree or the Indians of the Pacific Coast.\nAnother argument advanced by counsel for the Crown is based upon the supposed contrast between the language used in Articles 31 and 32 of the Instructions to Sir Guy Carleton and that used in relation to the Eskimo in Article 37. It has already been pointed out that, in the official documents relating to the Labrador Eskimo, the words \u201csavages\u201d and \u201cIndians\u201d are used convertibly; that in General Murray\u2019s Report in 1762 the Montagnais, the Hurons and the Eskimo are all spoken of as \u201csavages\u201d; and in Article 31 of Sir Guy Carleton\u2019s Instructions, the term \u201csavages\u201d is applied to the Indians of Illinois, the straits of Detroit, Michilimackinac and Gaspe; and, in Article 32, the term \u201csavages\u201d is applied to the Indians affected by the Royal Proclamation in 1763 and within the scope of the plan of 1764. I can find nothing in the language of these instructions which militates against the inference which, as already explained, seems to me to arise from the documents mentioned above having relation to the Labrador Eskimo.\nNor do I think that the fact that British policy in relation to the Indians, as evidenced in the Instructions to Sir Guy Carleton and the Royal Proclamation of 1763, did not contemplate the Eskimo (along with many other tribes and nations of British North American aborigines) as within the scope of that policy is either conclusive or very useful in determining the question before us. For that purpose, for construing the term \u201cIndians\u201d in the British North America Act in order to ascertain the scope of the provisions of that Act defining the powers of the Parliament of Canada, the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1857 and the documents relating to the Labrador Eskimo are, in my opinion, far more trustworthy guides.\nNor can I agree that the context (in head no. 24) has the effect of restricting the term \u201cIndians.\u201d If \u201cIndians\u201d standing alone in its application to British North America denotes the aborigines, then the fact that there were aborigines for whom lands had not been reserved seems to afford no good reason for limiting the scope of the term \u201cIndians\u201d itself.\nFor these reasons I think the question referred to us should be answered in the affirmative.\nCannon, J. (Crocket J. concurring).\u2014The question referred to us for hearing and consideration pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act is:\nDoes the term \u201cIndians\u201d as used in head 24 of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, include Eskimo inhabitants of the province of Quebec?\nI answer the question in the affirmative.\nIn the evidence given by Sir George Simpson before the Select Committee of the Hudson Bay Company, it appears that in 1857, the Eskimos were included amongst the so-called Indian races classified in the census prepared by the Company and the report of the Committee must have been known to the legislature at Westminster in 1867.\nThe correspondence between Sir John Macdonald and Sir Hector Langevin with reference to the relief to be given to the Montagnais and Eskimo Indians of the Lower St. Lawrence would show that these two Fathers of the Confederation always understood that the English word \u201cIndians\u201d was to be construed and translated as \u201csauvages\u201d which admittedly did include all the aborigines living within the territories in North America under British authority, whether Imperial, Colonial, or subject to the administrative powers of the Hudson Bay Company.\nI do not insist on these two points which have been well treated by my brother Kerwin with whom I agree. I would like to add the following considerations.\nAs to the exact meaning of the word \u201cIndians\u201d at the time of Confederation, I believe that we have in the official documents \u201crespecting the Proposed Union of the British North American Provinces\u201d presented to both Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 8th of February, 1867, all we need to form an opinion of the significance of this word and its scope.\nIn the English Text of the Report of the Resolutions adopted at a Conference of Delegates from the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and the Colonies of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, held at the City of Quebec, October 10, 1864, as the Basis of a proposed Confederation of those Provinces and Colonies, Resolution 29 reads as follows:\nThe General Parliament shall have power to make Laws for the peace, welfare and good Government of the Federated Provinces (saving the Sovereignty of England), and especially Laws respecting the following subjects:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n* * * *\n29. Indians and Lands Reserved for the Indians.\nThe official French translation of this resolution, as I find it in \u201cD\u00e9bats Parlementaires sur la Question de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Provinces de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, imprim\u00e9s par Ordre de la L\u00e9gislature par Hunter, Rose et Lemieux, Imprimeurs, Parlementaires, 1865,\u201d follows:\n29. Le parlement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aura le pouvoir de faire des lois pour la paix, le bien-\u00eatre et le bon gouvernement des provinces f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9es (sans toutefois, pouvoir porter atteinte \u00e0 la souverainet\u00e9 de l\u2019Angleterre), et en particulier sur les sujets suivants:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n* * * *\n29. Les Sauvages et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Sauvages.\nThe petition to the Queen passed on the 13th of March, 1865, by the Legislature reproduces, as to this sub-paragraph, word for word the Quebec resolutions, and the French translation also gives to the General Parliament under Section 29,\u2014\"Les Sauvages et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Sauvages.\u201d\nThis, I think, disposes of the very able argument on behalf of the Dominion that the word \u201cIndians\u201d in the British North America Act must be taken in a restricted sense. The Upper and Lower Houses of Upper and Lower Canada petitioners to the Queen, understood that the English word \u201cIndians\u201d was equivalent to or equated the French word \u201cSauvages\u201d and included all the present and future aborigines native subjects of the proposed Confederation of British North America, which at the time was intended to include Newfoundland.\nThe official French version of the British North America Act also translates \u201cIndians\u201d by \u201cSauvages.\u201d See Statut du Canada, ler Parlement, 31 Victoria, 1867-1868, Imprim\u00e9 par Malcolm Cameron, Imprimeur de Sa Tr\u00e8s Excellente Majest\u00e9 la Reine\u2014Ottawa, 1867, page 24, section 91, sous-paragraphe 24.\nCrocket, J.\u2014I am of opinion that the question referred to us should be answered in the affirmative for the reasons stated by my Lord the Chief Justice and my brothers Cannon and Kerwin.\nKerwin, J. (Cannon and Crocket JJ. concurring)\u2014The question should be answered in the affirmative. In my opinion, when the Imperial Parliament enacted that there should be confided to the Dominion Parliament power to deal with \u201cIndians and lands reserved for the Indians,\u201d the intention was to allocate to it authority over all the aborigines within the territory to be included in the confederation. The fact that there were no Eskimos within the boundaries of the provinces that first constituted the Dominion is beside the point as provision was made by the British North America Act to include the greater part, if not all, of the territory belonging to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. And whether the Eskimos as now known emigrated directly from Asia or inhabited the interior of America (originally coming from Asia) and subsequently migrated north, matters not, however interesting it may be to follow the opinions of those who have devoted time and study to that question.\nFrom the date of the visit of Champlain to this country in 1625 when he discovered \u201cune nation de sauvages qui habitent ces pays, qui s\u2019appellent Exquimaux,\u201d and of Radisson who in an account of his travels and experiences refers to \u201cIndians called Esquimos\u201d; through the reports of the missionaries and the correspondence between France and New France, the Indians are referred to as \u201csauvages\u201d and the Eskimos as \u201csauvages esquimaux.\u201d Later we find by referring to such books as might be expected to be known to the Fathers of Confederation and to the British Parliament statements indicating that the Eskimo was considered as one of the Indian tribes. The following is a partial list of such books:\u2014\n1855.\u2014Webster\u2019s American Dictionary of the English language defines the Esquimaux: \u201cA nation of Indians inhabiting the northwestern parts of North America.\u201d 1855.\u2014Adrien Guibert in his Geographical Dictionary, classifies the Eskimos among the Indians of America.\n1856.\u2014In \u201cThe Indian Races of North and South America,\u201d Charles de Wolf Brownell, an American author, speaks of the Esquimaux Indians and devotes a chapter to the study of their manners and personal appearance.\n1857.\u2014In the \u201cGazetteer of the world,\u201d published in London by A. Fullerton & Co., the Eskimos are dealt with as Indians, who are the aboriginal people of the New Continent; mentions are made of Eskimos in opposition to \u201ccommon Indian\u201d and to \u201cother Indians.\u201d\n1857.\u2014In an Imperial Blue Book is a Report from the Select Committee on the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company in which the Eskimos are enumerated among the Indians, are classified with the Indian races and are shown on a map denoting the boundaries and locations of various Indian tribes.\n1857.\u2014In the evidence given before a Select Committee of the House of Commons (Imperial), appointed to consider the state of the British Possessions in North America, Sir George Simpson, Governor of the territories of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, includes the Eskimos in the Indian population.\n1869.\u2014In an \u201cEsquisse sur le Nord-Ouest de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique\u201d by Mgr. Tach\u00e9, Bishop of St. Boniface, Manitoba, reference is made to the aboriginal tribes being called Indians (Sauvages) and the Esquimaux are dealt with at length as one of the five linguistic Indian families.\nA word should be added as to Webster\u2019s Dictionary. Counsel for the Dominion pointed out that in the 1913 edition of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, as well as the 1923, 1925, and 1927 editions, \u201cIndian\u201d is defined as being \u201ca member of any of the aboriginal American stocks excepting the Eskimauan.\u201d However, in the earlier 1855 edition, then known as The American Dictionary of the English Language, appears the following:\u2014\n\u201cIndian\u201d, A. General name of any native of the Indies;; as an East Indian or West Indian. It is particularly applied to any native of the American continent. In the 1865 edition of what had then become the Dictionary of the English Language, \u201cIndians\u201d were defined as\nIndians are the aboriginal inhabitants of America so called originally from the idea on the part of Columbus and the early navigators of the identity of America with India.\nIt was only in the 1913, 1923 and 1927 editions that the earlier definition was departed from while in the 1934 edition of Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, \u201cIndian\u201d is defined as follows:\u2014\nIndian. 5. A member of the aboriginal American race; an American, or Red, Indian; an Amerind * * * About 75 linguistic families or stocks are recognized in North America, and about 75 more in South America and the West Indies. Some stocks comprise many tribes speaking distinct, but related, languages. The 16 stocks listed below occupied more than half the area of the continent and comprised a large majority of the Indians at the time of the discovery of North America, Algonquian, Athapascan, Eskimauan, Iroquoian, Mayan, Muskhegean, Siouian, and Uto-Aztocan.\nIt is true that in the New English (Oxford) Dictionary, volume 5, under the heading \u201cIndian\u201d appears the following:\u2014\nA.* * *\n2. Belonging or relating to the race of original inhabitants of America and the West Indies.\nB. * * *\n2. A member of any of the aboriginal races of America or the West Indies; an American Indian.\nThe Eskimos, in the extreme north, are usually excluded from the term; as are sometimes the Patagonians and Fuegians in the extreme south.\nThere are also a few other publications to which our attention has been called where \u201cIndians\u201d and \u201cEsquimaux\u201d are differentiated but the majority of authoritative publications, and particularly those that one would expect to be in common use in 1867, adopt the interpretation that the term \u201cIndians\u201d includes all the aborigines of the territory subsequently included in the Dominion.\nAs pointed out in a memorandum of November 1st, 1918, by the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to the Minister, the Eskimos had never been mentioned in any legislation up to that time but by chapter 47 of 14-15 George V, assented to July, 1924, section 4 of The Indian Act, Chapter 81, R.S.C., 1906, was amended by adding thereto the following subsection:\u2014\n(2) The Superintendent General of Indian Affairs shall have charge of Eskimo affairs. This was afterwards repealed and even if the repeal had never occurred perhaps no argument could be adduced from the provisions of the amending statute but it is significant that in 1879 a letter from the Very Reverend Edmond Langevin to the Postmaster General of Canada, referring to the necessitous condition of \u201cthe Montagnais and Esquimaux Indians on the north coast of the St. Lawrence below the Saguenay\u201d was sent by the addressee to Sir John A. Macdonald as Superintendent General of Indian Affairs with the following covering letter:\u2014\nOttawa, 20 January, 1879.\nMy dear Sir John,\nThe enclosed letter from the Very Reverend Edmond Langevin, Vicar General of Rimouski, calls my attention to the position of the Montagnais and Esquimaux Indians on the north coast of the St. Lawrence, below the Saguenay. He says that the amount that used to be given to these Indians was seventy eight cents a head, and that now it is only thirty eight cents. These poor people are starving they can\u2019t cultivate the land, which in that region is hardly cultivable, and have had no provision made for them by the Government, and he requires on their behalf that we should come to their help. Will you kindly see that they are treated as well as we treat the Indians of our new territories. Of course I leave the whole matter in yours hands.\nYours truly,\nHector L. Langevin.\nRight Honble Sir John A. Macdonald, K.C.B., Ottawa.\nThe matter referred to was commented upon by the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs in the following report:\u2014\nTo the Right Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald, K.C.B.\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, 24 jany, 1879.\nWith reference to the letter of the 20th Instant (placed herewith) from the Honourable Hector Langevin, enclosing a letter of the 13th Instant, from the Very Reverend Edmond Langevin, of Rimouski, in the province of Quebec, relative to the insufficient relief given to the Montagnais and Esquimaux Indians of the Lower St. Lawrence, the undersigned has the honor to report that frequent representations to the same effect have been made to the Department and that last year he endeavoured to induce the then Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to ask Parliament for a larger grant, but that when the proposed estimates for the year 1878-79 were submitted to Council for revision, the proposed increase of $2,000 to the Parliamentary Grant for these Indians was struck out.\nThe present Government has however sanctioned the Supplementary Estimates for 1878-9 which will be submitted to Parliament at the approaching Session being anticipated by granting the said sum of $2,000.00, and the undersigned has moreover increased the grant for those Indians by that amount in the proposed estimates for the year 1879-80, with the hope that the Government will sanction and Parliament confirm the same.\nAll respectfully submitted,\nL. Van Koughnet,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nThat so soon after Confederation the position of Eskimos should be treated in this manner is significant. It not only more than counter-balances any reference made later as to the Department\u2019s attitude but, to my mind, is conclusive as to what was in the minds of those responsible for the drafting of the Resolutions leading to the passing of the British North America Act, at that time and shortly thereafter.\nSpecial attention should also be paid to the report of the Select Committee on the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company to the Houses of Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, presented in 1857. As appears from the Imperial Blue Books on Affairs Relating to Canada, the Committee reported:\u2014\nIt is a matter of great difficulty to obtain reliable information respecting the Indian population, their migratory habits, and the vast extent of country over which they are spread, misleading the calculations, and rendering it almost impracticable to prepare a satisfactory census. The following estimates have been compiled with great care, from a mass of documents and the actual personal knowledge of several of the Company\u2019s officers, tested by comparison with published statements, especially those presented to Government in 1846 by Messrs. Warre and Vavasour, and those of Colonel Lefroy, R.A., contained in a paper read before the Canadian Institute.\nThe estimates referred to are headed \u201cEstablishments of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company in 1856 and number of Indians frequenting them.\u201d After a long list of the names of the posts and localities and of the number of Indians frequenting each post is appended the following:\nAdd Whites and half breeds in Hudson\u2019s Bay Territory,\nnot included \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 6,000\nAdd Esquimaux not enumerated \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 4,000\nTotal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... 158,960\nThe Indian Races shown in detail in the foregoing Census may be classified as follows:\u2014\nThickwood Indians on the east side of the Rocky Mountain\u2026\u2026 35,000\nThe Plain Tribes (Blackfeet, &c) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 25,000\nThe Esquimaux \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 4,000\nIndians settled in Canada \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 3,000\nIndian in British Oregon and on the Northwest Coast \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 80,000\nTotal Indians \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... 147,000\nWhites and half-breeds in Hudson\u2019s Bay Territory \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 11,000\nSouls \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 158,000 The Esquimaux, it will be seen, are included among the Indian races and this is based apparently upon the evidence of Sir George Simpson, which had been taken before the Committee. Questions 1062 and 1472, together with the answers, are as follows:\u2014\n1062. Mr. Gregson: What mode have you of ascertaining of the population of the Indians? We have lists of the Indians belonging to various posts; we have compared and checked them with the report of the Government officers who went to Vancouver\u2019s Island some years ago, as regards the tribes to the west of the mountains, and with Colonel Lefroy\u2019s lists, as regards those on the east side, and we have arrived at this estimate of the population.\n1472. Mr. Roebuck: Will you state the total?\u2014The Indians, east of the mountains, 55,000; West of the mountains, 80,000; Esquimaux, 4,000.\nWhile counsel for the Dominion sought to draw from the answer to Question 1472 the inference that Sir George Simpson had not treated the Esquimaux as one of the Indian tribes, I think the answer is not susceptible of that interpretation and it is certainly not the one that the Committee adopted.\nAfter considering the reports of missionaries, explorers, agents, cartographers and geographers, included in the cases submitted on behalf of the Dominion and province of Quebec, I do not believe anything further may be usefully added. The weight of opinion favours the construction which I have indicated is the proper one of head 24 of section 91 of the British North America Act but the deciding factor, in my view, is the manner in which the subject was considered in Canada and in England at or about the date of the passing of the Act.\nThe question referred was answered in the affirmative.\n"}

V, c. 47, s. 6) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 251, and therefore his statement was not voluntary.\nSubs. 5 of said s. 88 enacted that \u201cany written reports or statements made or furnished under this section shall be without prejudice, shall be for the information of the Registrar, * * * and the fact that such reports and statements have been so made or furnished shall be admissible in evidence solely to prove compliance with this section, and no such reports or statements, or any parts thereof or statement contained therein, shall be admissible in evidence for any other purpose in any trial, civil or criminal, arising out of a motor vehicle accident.\u201d\nHeld: The said evidence of the police constable was admissible. Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1938] O.R. 636, ordering a new trial, affirmed.\nStatements made under compulsion of statute by a person whom they tend to incriminate are not for that reason alone inadmissible against him in criminal proceedings. Generally speaking, such statements are admissible unless they fall within the scope of some specific enactment or rule excluding them (Reg. v. Scott, Dearsley & Bell\u2019s Crown Cases 47; Reg. v. Coote, L.R. 4 P.C. 599, at 607).\nWhether or not, in point of grammatical construction, oral as well as written statements are within the privilege created by s. 88(5), yet, having regard to s. 40 of said Act and s. 285 (2) of the Criminal Code (as to a driver\u2019s duty, on the occasion of a motor car accident in which he is involved, to give his name and address\u2014of which enactments the Ontario legislature must be presumed to have been aware when enacting s. 88) and to the manifest primary purpose of s. 88 (to provide for procuring information for record for statistical and rating purposes,. etc.), s. 88 has not in its true construction the effect of rendering such statements as that now in question under the circumstances in question inadmissible in evidence. Sec. 88(5) should not be read as intended to qualify the duty imposed by said s. 40 (1) for the purposes and in the interests there contemplated, or the duty recognized by said s. 285(2), Cr. Code. Sec. 88(5), which is expressly limited to reports and statements made under s. 88, should in its operation be strictly confined thereto, and its general terms should not be construed as having the intention of creating a privilege in respect of the specific class of statements contemplated by said other enactments.\nOn the trial of an accused, if the trial judge decides that there is no evidence to go to the jury, the proper practice is for him to direct the jury to acquit and discharge the accused (The King v. Comba, [1938] S.C.R. 396, at 397-8). But where (in the present case) the trial judge, deciding that there was no admissible evidence of guilt to go to the jury, withdrew the case from the jury and gave judgment for acquittal, it was held that there was an acquittal within the meaning of ss. 1013 and 1025 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, as amended) and that under s. 1013 (4) an appeal lay to the Court of Appeal and, that court having directed a new trial on the ground that the trial judge had improperly held certain evidence to be inadmissible, an appeal lay to the Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1025 (3).\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which allowed the appeal of the Attorney-General for Ontario from the judgment of MacKay J. at trial acquitting the accused, and ordered a new trial.\nThe accused was charged with manslaughter under the Criminal Code (s. 268) arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle at about midnight of July 16 or early in the morning of July 17, 1937, in the township of Tiny, county of Simcoe, province of Ontario, and was tried before MacKay J. and a jury at Barrie, Ontario. The driver of the car in question failed to negotiate a turn and the car went off the highway into a ditch and overturned, resulting in the death of two persons in the car. The trial judge held that there was no evidence as to who was the driver of the car and withdrew the case from the jury and discharged the accused. He had held that certain evidence given by a police constable of an alleged admission by the accused (shortly after the accident, when there was no charge against accused and he was not under arrest) that he was the driver of the car was not admissible; on the ground that the accused must be presumed to have known that he was required under penalty to give the information by virtue of s. 88 (as enacted by 20 Geo. V, c. 47, s. 6) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 251), and therefore his statement was not voluntary. On appeal by the Attorney-General of Ontario, the Court of Appeal, Henderson J.A. dissenting, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial[2]. The accused appealed to this Court.\nE.A. Richardson K.C. and B. O\u2019Brien for the appellant.\nC.R. Magone and J.C. Anderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014As to jurisdiction: This question depends upon the effect of section 1013, subsection 4, and section 1025, subsection 3. These enactments are severally in these words:\n1013. (4) Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the Attorney-General shall have the right to appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone.\n1025. (3) Any person whose acquittal has been set aside may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the setting aside of such acquittal.\nThe proper practice, where the trial judge decides that there is no evidence to go to the jury in the well understood meaning of those words, is to direct the jury to acquit and discharge the accused (The King v. Comba[3]).\nThe basis of Mr. Justice MacKay\u2019s order was that there was no such evidence and it is common ground that he intended to pronounce a judgment of acquittal finally disposing of the charge in the indictment found against the appellant.\nIt is clear that, the learned trial judge having intended to pronounce, and having considered he was pronouncing a valid judgment of acquittal, what he did cannot be treated as a nullity. Presiding in a court of general jurisdiction, having authority to pronounce on its own juris- diction, and his judgment being one which under appropriate conditions could competently be given, it was in its nature susceptible of being the subject of appeal (re Padstow[4]); and the Court of Appeal rightly dealt with it upon the footing that it constituted a judgment or verdict of acquittal. The proper conclusion would appear to be, as counsel for the Crown as well as counsel for the accused contend, that there was an acquittal within the meaning of sections 1013 and 1025. It is to be observed that the question with which the trial judge was dealing was a question of law alone, a question upon which it was the duty of the jury to act under his direction; their duty, in other words, to render a verdict of not guilty upon a direction given by him; his judgment, therefore, was appealable under section 1013 (4), and this appeal lies under section 1025 (3).\nAs to the merits: The Court of Appeal directed a new trial on the ground that the learned trial judge improperly held to be inadmissible the evidence of Constable Beatty touching an alleged admission by the accused that he was the driver of the car at the time of the accident and, consequentially, decided that there was no evidence implicating the accused.\nIn order to clear the ground, it seems to be necessary to observe at the outset that statements made under compulsion of statute by a person whom they tend to incriminate are not for that reason alone inadmissible in criminal proceedings. The term \u201cvoluntary,\u201d as employed in the summary description of the class of statements by accused persons which are admissible in criminal proceedings, is well understood by lawyers as importing an absence of fear of prejudice or hope of advantage held out by persons in authority and is interpreted and applied judicially according to lines traced by well-known decisions and by a well settled practice. But there is no rule of law that statements made by an accused under compulsion of statute are, because of such compulsion alone, inadmissible against him in criminal proceedings. Generally speaking, such statements are admissible unless they fall within the scope of some specific enactment or rule excluding them (Reg. v. Scott[5]; Reg. v. Coote[6]). The question of substance on the appeal is whether or not the alleged statement made by the accused to Constable Beatty was inadmissible in evidence by force of subsection 5 of section 88 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O., 1927, ch. 251, as amended by 20 Geo. V, ch. 47, s. 6). Textually, the subsection is in these words:\n88. (5) Any written reports or statements made or furnished under this section shall be without prejudice, shall be for the information of the Registrar, and shall not be open to public inspection; and the fact that such reports and statements have been so made or furnished shall be admissible in evidence solely to prove compliance with this section, and no such reports or statements, or any parts thereof or statement contained therein, shall be admissible in evidence for any other purpose in any trial, civil or criminal, arising out of a motor vehicle accident.\nI do not disagree with the view that, in point of grammatical construction, the preferable reading of subsection 5 would be that it applies only to statements in writing; but grammatical considerations are not necessarily conclusive. If section 88 were to be considered by itself and apart from the enactments I am about to discuss, a good deal might be said for the view that the adjective \u201cwritten\u201d qualifies the word \u201creports\u201d only, and that, consequently, oral as well as written statements are within the privilege created by subsection 5.\nIt is not necessary in the present appeal to examine the general question whether the prima facie or literal construction of subsection 5 as above indicated (namely, that it is limited in its operation to written reports and written \u201cstatements made or furnished under this section\u201d) gives the true effect of the section. We have to consider the admissibility of a statement of a particular class: a statement alleged to have been made by the driver or person in charge of a motor car directly concerned in a motor accident to the police constable engaged in the course of his ordinary duties in investigating the accident immediately after it occurred in which the driver is alleged to have identified himself as such.\nWe have to address ourselves to the question whether such statements or statements of a similar character made in similar circumstances are inadmissible by force of subsection 5, and this judgment, as will appear, is rigorously confined to the discussion and decision of that question.\nMy brother Kerwin has called our attention to the genesis of section 88 and has also called our attention to section 40 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act and section 285, subsection 2, of the Criminal Code; which were not discussed on the argument.\nBy section 40 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act it is enacted:\n40. (1) If an accident occurs on a highway, every person in charge of a vehicle who is directly or indirectly a party to the accident shall remain at or return to the scene of the accident and render all possible assistance and give in writing upon request to any one sustaining loss or injury or to any police constable or any officer appointed for the carrying out of the provisions of this Act or to any witness, his name and address, and also the name and address of the owner of such vehicle, and the number of the permit if any.\n(2) Any person who violates any of the provisions of subsection 1 shall incur for the first offence a penalty of not less than $25 and not more than $100, and shall also be liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding thirty days and in addition his licence or permit may be suspended for any period not exceeding sixty days; and for any subsequent offence, a penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $500 and shall also be liable to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, and in addition his licence or permit may be suspended for any period not exceeding one year.\nThe duty arising out of this enactment is obviously imposed in the public interest as well as in the private interest of persons injured. It is a reasonable presumption that the Legislature was not ignorant of the rule of law by which, in the absence of some provision to the contrary, statements made in execution of the duty imposed by this section would (as explained above) be admissible in evidence against the person making them. It seems clear enough that the enactment is a measure for securing information which may be employed for the purposes of legal proceedings, instituted either privately or ad vindicatam publicam.\nLeaving section 40 for the moment, and turning to section 285, subsection 2, of the Criminal Code. That subsection is in these words:\n285. (2) Whenever, owing to the presence of a motor car on the highway, an accident has occurred to any person or to any horse or vehicle in charge of any person, any person driving the motor car shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty dollars and costs or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding thirty days if he fails to stop his car and, with intent to escape liability either civil or criminal, drives on without tendering assistance and giving his name and address.\nThis enactment presupposes the existence of a duty resting upon the driver of a motor car not to withhold his name and address (in the circumstances mentioned) with the purpose of escaping legal liability, civil or criminal: a duty, it may be of imperfect obligation, but still a duty. It is not easy to reconcile the existence of such a duty with a rule of law having the effect of preventing statements made in conformity with it being adduced as evidence in criminal proceedings against the person making them.\nThe Ontario Legislature is presumed to know the statute law, and accordingly is presumed to have been aware, when enacting section 88, of the law as laid down in section 285 (2) of the Criminal Code as well as, needless to say, in section 40 (Wilberforce, Statute Law, pp. 30 and 31; 31 Hals. pp. 456 and 491). The primary purpose of section 88 is, manifestly, to make provision for procuring information for record with the Registrar which may be useful for statistical and rating purposes, and other purposes of general public interest in relation to motor traffic. Subsection 5 is aimed, no doubt, at silencing the apprehensions of people from whom such information must be obtained. Such being the purpose and effect of section 88, it ought not to be read as intended to qualify the duty imposed by section 40 of the Highway Traffic Act for the purposes and in the interests mentioned above or that recognized by section 285 of the Criminal Code. Subsection 5, which is expressly limited to reports and statements made under section 88, ought to be strictly confined in its operation to such statements and reports and its general terms should not be construed as having the intention of creating a privilege in respect of the specific class of statements contemplated by section 40 of the Highway Traffic Act or by section 285 of the Criminal Code; by which a driver or person in charge of a motor car in the circumstances envisaged by those enactments gives his name and address or simply identifies himself as such.\nHad such been the intention of the Legislature in enacting subsection 5, that intention, we must presume, would have been stated in explicit words.\nThe proper conclusion seems to be that subsection 5 has not in its true construction the effect of rendering such statements inadmissible in evidence. Nothing is de- cided and no opinion is intimated touching the effect of the subsection as to statements dealing with other matters or made in different circumstances.\nIn this view it is unnecessary to discuss section 35 of the Canada Evidence Act or sections 599 and 685 of the Criminal Code; nor is it necessary to examine the question whether, if subsection 5 of section 88 on its proper construction applied to statements such as that under consideration, this could have the effect of excluding such statements as evidence in criminal proceedings proper. For these reasons, since the evidence adduced was admissible, a new trial was rightly ordered and the appeal should be dismissed.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I agree that in the circumstances of this case the judgment entered upon the learned trial judge\u2019s withdrawal of the case from the jury must be deemed to have been an acquittal within the meaning of s. 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code and that an appeal therefore lay to the Court of Appeal and from the judgment of that Court under s. 1025 of the Code.\nAs to the admissibility of Constable Beatty\u2019s evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged admission that he was the owner of the car involved in the accident, I am of opinion that it does not fall within the privilege created by section 88 (5) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act for any written reports or statements made under the provisions of that section to any police officer or to the registrar and that that privilege ought to be strictly confined to communications which are required to be made for the purposes of and in accordance with the provisions of that section. The statement alleged to have been made by the defendant to Constable Beatty, which the learned trial judge held inadmissible under the provisions of s. 88 (5), related only to the defendant\u2019s identification as the driver of the car involved in the accident. The trial judge\u2019s attention was not called to the provisions either of s. 40 (1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act or to s. 285 (2) of the Criminal Code; neither were they called to the attention of the Court of Appeal nor to our attention during the argument here, but, having, as my Lord the Chief Justice has stated, been brought to our attention by my brother Kerwin since the argument, they must be given due effect in arriving at a conclusion as to the admissibility of Beatty\u2019s evidence. The clear object of both the two last indicated enactments was to require the driver of any motor vehicle involved in an accident on a highway to stop his car at the scene of the accident and there identify himself as its driver. Neither of these enactments created any privilege regarding the driver\u2019s duty to do so.\nS. 285 (2) of the Criminal Code was in force at the time of the enactment of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, and, as pointed out by my Lord the Chief Justice, the Legislature must be presumed to have been aware of its provisions when it enacted its Highway Traffic Act. S. 88 (5) having expressly confined the privilege created thereby to written reports or statements made under s. 88, I cannot see how the privilege created by s. 88 (5) in respect of communications made for the purpose of and in accordance with the provisions of that section can well be extended to specific communications required by either s. 40 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act or s. 285 (2) of the Criminal Code for another purpose.\nApart, therefore, from the question as to whether the privilege provided by s. 88 (5) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act embraces oral as well as written reports or statements, which it is not now necessary to decide, I am of opinion for the reasons stated that the evidence of Constable Beatty, confined as it was to the defendant\u2019s alleged admission touching his identification as the driver of the car at the time of the accident, was admissible.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Phelan, Richardson, O\u2019Brien & Phelan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.B.

Each member was required to devote his time, labour, etc., to the corporation and its purposes. In said Act the preamble stated that \u201ca religious community of farmers exists * * * who have associated themselves together for the purpose of promoting and engaging in the Christian religion * * * according to their religious belief, and of having * * * all things in common\u201d; and the objects of the corporation were stated to be \u201cto promote, engage in and carry oh the Christian religion * * * according to the religious belief of the members of the corporation\u201d and \u201cto engage in, and carry on farming, stock-raising, milling, and all branches of these industries; and to manufacture and deal with the products and by-products of these industries,\u201d with other subsidiary and incidental objects. Held (Cannon J. dissenting): Appellant corporation was a \u201cfarmer\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934 (Dom.), c. 53 (and amendments); and was entitled to take advantage of that Act.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 45 Man. R. 619, reversed, and judgment of Roy, C.C.J. (ibid), restored.\nThe definition of \u201cfarmer\u201d in said Act as \u201ca person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil\u201d may include a body corporate and politic, including a corporation of such a nature as that of appellant. Such inclusion is justified by the meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d (definition of which in the Bankruptcy Act, s. 2 (cc), as including \u201ca body corporate and politic\u201d and a \u201ccorporation\u201d as defined by s. 2 (k) of that Act, is brought into The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act by s. 2 (2) of the latter Act, \u201cunless it is otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires\u201d) and by the fact (as held) that, on consideration of The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (various provisions thereof dealt with in this regard), such inclusion is consistent with and not obnoxious to the provisions and objects of that Act.\nThe application to appellant of said definition of \u201cfarmer\u201d was not affected by the fact that, in the incorporating Act, appellant\u2019s firstly expressed object was with regard to engaging in the Christian religion according to the religious belief of its members. Farming was appellant\u2019s temporal object and occupation, and, being such, was its \u201cprincipal occupation \u201cwithin said definition.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): Having regard to the preamble and the provisions of the incorporating Act, and the evidence, it must be held that the primary object of appellant corporation is a religious one, and, being a religious body, it cannot get the benefit of The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, which applies only to a person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil. Further, being a religious body, appellant is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act or The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act. Further, the latter Act, in view of the nature of its provisions, was intended to help only natural persons.\nAPPEAL by the Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation, incorporated as \u201ca body corporate and politic\u201d by special Act, Man., 1931, c. 103, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] which allowed the appeal taken by certain creditors of the said corporation from the order of Roy C.C.J.[2] whereby the Official Receiver appointed under The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, c. 53 (Dom.), was directed to proceed with the application of the said corporation, which had filed a proposal under the last mentioned Act. The order of Roy C.C.J. was made on an application, under Rule 42 of the Rules and Regulations under the last mentioned Act, for an order for directions, in consequence of objection by some creditors to the Official Receiver\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that said corporation was not a \u201cfarmer\u201d within the meaning of that Act.\nNo written reasons were given in the Court of Appeal. According to its formal judgment, it was adjudged that the said corporation is not a \u201cfarmer\u201d within the meaning of The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments thereto, and it was ordered that the order of Roy C.C.J. be reversed.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by a Judge of this Court.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. T. Thorson K.C. for the respondent creditors.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the Minister of Finance.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I have no doubt that by the combined operation of section 2, subsection 1 (\u0192), of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments, section 2 (cc) and section 2 (k) of the Bankruptcy Act, a corporation may be a \u201cfarmer\u201d within the meaning of section 6 and the correlated provisions of the former statute. It is sufficient to refer to the reasons given by my brother Kerwin for this conclusion.\nThe question of substance is whether the particular corporation with which we are concerned (the appellants) is a \u201cfarmer\u201d within the contemplation of the statute and entitled to take advantage of its provisions. This question subdivides itself into two: whether, in point of verbal construction, that corporation comes within the definition of \u201cfarmer\u201d in section 2(1) (\u0192); and, if so, whether there is anything in the provisions of the statute which impliedly excludes it from that category.\nThe corporation, the Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation, was created by Cap. 103 of the Statutes of Manitoba, 1931. The character and objects of the corporation appear from the provisions of this incorporating statute. The first paragraph of the preamble is in these words:\nWhereas a religious community of farmers exists in this province under the name of Barickman Colony of Hutterian Brethren, who have associated themselves together for the purpose of promoting and engaging in the Christian religion, Christian worship and religious education and teachings according to their religious belief, and of having, holding, using, possessing and enjoying all things in common, and who are desirous that the said religious community may foe incorporated.\nThe preamble proceeds to state that certain persons, whose names are given and who are said to be members of this religious community, have by their petition prayed that they be incorporated for the objects set forth in the statute By section 1, it is enacted that the persons named in the preamble and all others who shall become members of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of the statute and the by-laws, rules and regulations shall be constituted a corporation with the normal capacities of corporations constituted by the Manitoba Legislature.\nThe objects set forth are:\n2. (a) to promote, engage in and carry on the Christian religion, Christian worship and religious education and teachings, and to worship God according to the religious belief of the members of the corporation;\n(b) to engage in, and carry on farming, stock-raising, milling, and all branches of these industries; and to manufacture and deal with the products and by-products of these industries;\nwith other subsidiary and incidental objects.\nIt is provided that all property owned by or held in trust for the Barickman Colony of Hutterian Brothers shall be vested in the Corporation and that the Corporation shall assume and be liable for the debts and obligations of the Colony and all debts and obligations guaranteed by the Hutterian Brethren Church in Manitoba.\nThe Act provides that no individual member of the Corporation shall have any assignable or transferable interest in the Corporation or in any of its property. The property, affairs and concerns of the Corporation are to be managed by, and its business is to be carried on by, a board of five directors elected by the members who are to have full authority to exercise all the powers of the Corporation subject to the by-laws, rules and regulations of the Corporation and the provisions of the Statute.\nThe peculiar nature of the relations between the Corporation and its members appears from certain provisions which it is desirable to set forth verbatim. Section 12 provides as follows:\n12. All property, both real and personal, that each and every member of the corporation has or may have, own, possess or may be entitled to at the time that such member becomes a member of the said corporation, and all the property, both real and personal, that each and every member of the said corporation may have, obtain, inherit, possess or be entitled to after such person becomes a member of the said corporation shall be and become the property of the said corporation to be owned, used, occupied and possessed by the said corporation for the common use, interest and benefit of each and all the members thereof.\nBy section 13, if any member of the Corporation ceases to be a member he shall not be entitled to withdraw any of the property of the Corporation and, in the case of the death of a member, no interest in the Corporation or the property of the Corporation shall pass to the heirs or the legal personal representatives of such member.\nBy section 14,\nEach and every member of the said corporation shall give and devote all his time, labour, services, earnings and energies to the said corporation and the purposes for which it exists, freely, voluntarily and without compensation or reward of any kind whatsoever other than as herein provided or in the by-laws, rules and regulations of the said corporation expressed.\nThe members of the Corporation constitute a religious community and it appears from the evidence, when read with the provisions of the statute, that as a religious community they aim at pursuing a way of life broadly conforming, as they conceive, economically as well as spiritually, to the \u201cChristian principles described in the New Testament.\u201d Their tenets and their practice include ownership of all things in common, the administration of their goods and their worldly affairs generally by persons nominated by themselves for that purpose. It is freely admitted, and it may be assumed, that the arrangements for the administration of their temporal affairs are only a means to enable them to govern their lives by what they believe to be the primitive Christian plan.\nOn the other hand, the members of the Corporation are farmers dependent for their livelihood and the livelihood of their families upon revenues derived from their labours and those of their brethren in farming and in necessarily incidental pursuits; the Corporation being the depositary of the title to all the property and all the revenues of the community, which it holds and administers for their benefit. The Corporation (which takes the place of the former trustees) is simply the legal instrumentality by which this autonomous community of farmers manages under the law its affairs and those of its members (according to the plan of community of property); and I can see no impropriety in designating it as a \u201cfarmer,\u201d as a \u201cperson\u201d whose principal occupation is farming. In a temporal sense, farming (with necessarily incidental pursuits) is not only the \u201cprincipal,\u201d it is said to be the exclusive occupation of the members of this community.\nI humbly think the application of the definition is not affected by the fact that the economic constitution and canon of the community are dictated by the religious beliefs and purposes of its members, or that one of the objects of the Corporation is to promote the religious objects of the community; because I am quite satisfied that the word \u201coccupation\u201d in the intendment of that definition is limited in its scope to temporal affairs. It should be observed that the provision of the statute enabling the Corporation to apply funds in support of religious objects is a very necessary provision in view of the fact that the title to all the property of the members is vested in the Corporation.\nNor do I think this application of the definition of \u201cfarmer\u201d is obnoxious to the enactments or the objects of the statute considered as a whole. The principal argument to the contrary is that the main purpose of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act is disclosed by one sentence in the preamble in these words:\nand whereas it is essential in the interest of the Dominion to retain the farmers on the land as efficient producers and for such purpose it is necessary to provide means whereby compromises or rearrangements may be effected of debts of farmers who are unable to pay:\nand it is said that this affirmation cannot possibly envisage a corporation such as the (appellants. I am unable to agree with this. Indeed, I should have thought that, in the case of a group of persons organized as this community is, the considerations upon which the statute appears to be founded might well be supposed to have greater force than in the case of an individual.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the County Court Judge restored with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The question on this appeal is whether the appellant, the Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation, is a farmer within the meaning of that word as used in The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, and amendments thereto, hereinafter referred to as the Act. Subsection 1 (\u0192) of section 2 defines a farmer as \u201ca person whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil.\u201d By special Act of the Manitoba Legislature (chapter 103 of the Statutes of 1931), the appellant was declared to be a body corporate and politic, and the first point presented for determination is whether the word \u201cperson\u201d in the definition clause of the Act includes as well a body corporate and politic as a natural person.\nBy subsection 2 of section 2 of the Act, \u201cunless it is otherwise provided or the context otherwise requires,\u201d expressions contained in the Act are to have the same meaning as in the Bankruptcy Act, and by section 2 of the latter it is provided:\u2014\nIn this Act, unless the context otherwise requires or implies, the expression\n* * *\n(cc) \u201cperson\u201d includes a firm or partnership, an unincorporated association of persons, a corporation as restrictively defined by this section, a body corporate and politic, the successors of such association, partnership, corporation, or body corporate and politic, and the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representative of a person, according to the law of that part of Canada to which the context extends.\nThe word \u201cimplies\u201d probably neither enlarges nor restricts the meaning of \u201crequires\u201d but in any event it is applicable only to a consideration of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. It is not otherwise \u201cprovided\u201d and unless, therefore, the context otherwise \u201crequires\u201d (Act section 2, subsection 2), this clause in the Bankruptcy Act makes it clear that a body corporate and politic is covered by the word \u201cperson\u201d in the Act.\nIt is true that, as a rule, one does not speak of such a body having an occupation; the reference is generally to its objects or business; but there is nothing to prevent the legislature using the word \u201coccupation\u201d as applicable to it, if the general intention, upon a reading of the whole of the Act, is clear. It was argued that the use of the word \u201cresides\u201d in subsection 2 of section 3, in section 5, and in subsection 11 of section 12, indicates that only a human being was envisaged. However, the courts have had no hesitation in determining, for the purpose of allowing service out of the jurisdiction! under the rules, that a corporation is domiciled or ordinarily resident where it has its head office, and for the purpose of income tax that a company resides where its real business is carried on. One or other of these meanings may well be ascribed to the word in the Act when dealing with a body corporate and politic. Similarly the expression \u201chis liabilities\u201d in section 6 may be read \u201cits liabilities.\u201d\nBy subsection 1 of section 11, \u201con the filing with the official receiver of ia proposal, no creditor whether secured or unsecured, shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor.\u201d While the latter part is clearly inapplicable to a corporate body, it was evidently inserted in order to prevent the pursuit of any remedy by a creditor against a farmer who was an individual.\nThe mischief the Act sought to relieve and the remedy proposed may be ascertained from the preamble wherein, after reciting that in view of the depressed state of agriculture the present indebtedness of many farmers is beyond their capacity to pay, it is further recited that it is essential, in the interest of the Dominion, to retain the farmers on the land as efficient producers. There is nothing incongruous in speaking of a corporate body being retained on the land or as being an efficient producer; each expression is applicable, in my opinion, as well to such an artificial person as to a natural one. How is it proposed to retain the farmers on the land? By permitting them, with the permission of a Board of Review, to scale down their debts to a point where they will be able gradually to liquidate them while continuing their farming operations. There is no reason why these advantages should not be enjoyed as well by sa corporate farmer as by an individual unless there is something in the context that requires us to hold otherwise.\nIn addition to the expressions to which I have already referred, our attention has been called to subsection 8 of section 12, which provides:\u2014\nThe Board [of Review] shall base its proposal upon the present and prospective capability of the debtor to perform the obligations prescribed and the productive value of the farm.\nIn my view, it is possible for a Board to consider the present and prospective capability of a corporate body as well as that of an individual. While such a body may stop its farming operations or carry on another business, there is nothing to prevent either of these things being done by an individual. Provision is made by Rule 48 of the Rules and Regulations, approved by the Governor in Council in pursuance of section 15 of the Act, for the receiver or any creditor to apply to the Court for an order setting aside a proposal if \u201c(d) the debtor has conducted himself, to the satisfaction of the official receiver, in such manner as indicates bad faith towards his creditors.\u201d I do not pause to consider the rules and regulations further because, while the word \u201cresides\u201d is used therein in many instances, the power to make rules is given only so far as \u201cprocedure\u201d is concerned and \u201cto give effect to the provisions of this Act.\u201d\nIt was urged that as Parliament had provided a means of compromising the debts of a company by The Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933, it was not intended that the Act should apply to bodies corporate and politic. As to this, it appears sufficient to point out that in 1934 Parliament was dealing with an entirely different matter. In my opinion it intended to say, and did say, that bodies corporate and politic might take advantage of the provisions of the Act as well as individuals.\nIs the appellant, then, such a body whose principal occupation consists in farming or the tillage of the soil? The evidence is uncontradicted that not only the principal occupation but the sole occupation of all its members is farming. It is true that the preamble to the special Act of Incorporation recites:\u2014\nWhereas a religious community of farmers exists in this province under the name of Barickman Colony of Hutterian Brethren, who have associated themselves together for the purpose of promoting and engaging in the Christian religion, Christian worship and religious education and teachings according to their religious belief, and of having, holding, using, possessing and enjoying all things in common, and who are desirous that the said religious community may be incorporated;\nand in section 2 of the Act of Incorporation the first object \u201cof the corporation\u201d is stated to be:\u2014\n(a) to promote, engage in and carry on the Christian religion, Christian worship and religious education and teachings, and to worship God according to the religious belief of the members of the corporation;\nThis, I think, may be taken to be the spiritual object. So far, however, as the temporal object of the \u201ccorporation\u201d and its temporal occupation and chief business are concerned, the \u201ccorporation\u201d was by clause (b) of section 2 authorized:\u2014\n(b) to engage in, and carry on farming, stock-raising, milling and all branches of these industries; and to manufacture and deal with the products and by-products of these industries; subsequent clauses authorized the \u201ccorporation\u201d to carry on any other business (whether manufacturing or otherwise) which might seem capable of being conveniently carried on in connection with its business, etc., but its principal occupation as carried on by its members does consist in farming or the tillage of the soil. I see nothing, therefore, to withhold the benefit of the Act from the appellant merely because of the reference in its objects to the promotion, etc., of the Christian religion.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the County Court Judge with costs throughout.\nCannon, J. (dissenting)\u2014The Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation was incorporated by Chapter 103 of the Statutes of Manitoba, assented to on the twentieth of April, 1931. The petition to the Legislature for incorporation was signed by Samuel J. Hofer and others, not as farmers, but as members of a religious community. The preamble says that they have associated themselves for the purpose of promoting and engaging in the Christian religion, Christian worship and religious education, and teachings, according to their religious belief, and of having, holding, using, possessing, and enjoying all things in common.\nThe petitioners, according to the preamble, were desirous that the said religious community may be incorporated.\nAll the properties belonging to, or held in trust for the said Barickman Colony of Hutterian Brethren before incorporation were vested in the corporation. The trustees who held real or personal property for the said Brethren at the time of the passing of the Act, were authorized and directed to transfer, set over and assign to the Said corporation all such real and personal property held by them.\nSection 2 of the Charter sets up the object of the corporation as follows:\n(a) to promote, engage in and carry on the Christian religion, Christian worship and religious education and teachings, and to worship God according to the religious belief of the members of the corporation;\n(b) to engage in, and carry on farming, stock-raising, milling, and all branches of these industries; and to manufacture and deal with the products and by-products of these industries;\nUnder section 6, the corporation was liable for the debts incurred by the. Barickman Colony, and section 8 says that no individual member of the corporation shall have any assignable or transferable interest in the corporation or in any of its property, real or personal.\nSection 12 reads as follows:\nAll property, both real and personal, that each and every member; of the corporation has or may have, own, possess or may be entitled to at the time that such member becomes a member of the said corporation, and all the property, both real and personal, that each and every member of the said corporation may have, obtain, inherit, possess or be entitled to after such person becomes a member of the said corporation shall be and become the property of the said corporation to be owned, used, occupied and possessed by the said corporation for the common use, interest and benefit of each and all the members thereof.\nD. Decker, heard as a witness, as President of the appellant corporation, stated that it owns 2,780 acres of land situated about twelve miles off Headingly, and that no land belongs to any of the individual members, each of whom may be expelled from the corporation without taking anything. Decker says that he cannot deny that the primary object of the corporation is a religious one, although he says, \u201cWe are farmers at the same time.\u201d\nIn view of this admission, two conclusions cannot be escaped:\n1\u00b0 Being a religious body, the corporation cannot get the benefit of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act which applies only to a person whose principal occupation consists in farming and tillage of the soil.\n2\u00b0 The individual farmers who join this religious community are not farmers within the meaning of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, for they own no farm, they owe personally no debts and have no obligation from which to be relieved. Indeed none of the farmers have made any application in the premises.\nThe appellant relies upon section 2 of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act for the purpose of bringing the definition of \u201cperson\u201d as contained in the Bankruptcy Act into the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, but as the appellant is not a person within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act, being a religious body, the Bankruptcy Act is not applicable.\nMoreover, my definite view after a careful perusal of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, as amended, and of the regulations and forms approved by the Governor General in Council, is that the Act applies only to a person whose principal occupation is farming, and who is being unable to meet his liabilities as they become due. The object of the Act was to retain the individual farmer on the land as an efficient producer.\nThe Board of Review appointed by the Governor in Council under section 12 of the Act are supposed to inspect and investigate all the circumstances of each case and base a proposal upon the present and prospective capability of the debtor to perform the obligation prescribed, and also upon the productive value of the farm. The capability of a farmer to perform his obligations depends not only on the productive value of the farm, but also on his qualities and characteristics, e.g., a man who is an habitual drunkard would not have the same capability as a normal sober individual. His physical, moral qualities, his age, his experience must be considered. Also, whether he can depend on the help of a wife and of a more or less large number of children, or contrariwise, being a bachelor, cannot or can do without hired help. The farmer who could perform his work himself without any hired help would have more merit and deserve more consideration than the lazy fellow who would rely on others to do his work and pay them wages. The personal character, the honesty and record of the farmer making a proposal to his creditors are certainly to be weighed by the Board in making an award or approving a proposal and compelling the creditors to accept it. This test cannot apply to a corporation.\nThe application of this extraordinary piece of legislation cannot be extended beyond the obvious and natural intent of the legislator. Nothing shows that it was intended to help other than natural persons, citizens of Canada in difficult circumstances beyond their control.\nThe individual farmers who are employed in the tillage of the soil belonging to the Barickman Hutterian Mutual Corporation are not before us. They have made no application for relief, and there is no means to retain them on the land which does mot belong to them, or to compel them to pay an indebtedness which is not theirs. These individual farmers have formed the corporation not for the main purpose of farming, but of constituting a religious body, as it appears clearly in the preamble of the Charter. Por the above reason the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ernest A.

A letter from defendant\u2019s solicitors to plaintiff\u2019s solicitor agreed that plaintiff was to have the right for a period of three months to purchase the land upon payment of the mortgage, including all interest, taxes and costs up to date. There was no payment or tender within said period. In an action for redemption, plaintiff attempted to show that by the true arrangement the mortgage debt remained undischarged and the period for redemption was extended for three months; that the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee still subsisted.\nHeld: On the evidence, plaintiff\u2019s said attempt must fail; the true arrangement must be held to be that disclosed by the documents, namely, that the land became vested in defendant in fee simple in possession free from the equity of redemption, but that plaintiff had the option of re-purchase according to the terms in said letter.\nIt is true, in principle, that a conveyance absolute in form may be shown even by parol evidence to have been, according to the real agreement between the parties, accepted as security only, and the Statute of Frauds will not prevent the proof of this by parol evidence (Flynn v. Flynn, 70 D.L.R. 462; Wilson v. Ward, [1930] S.C.R. 212); but for this purpose convincing evidence is always required; and in the circumstances of the present case it behooved plaintiff to adduce evidence of the most cogent character (Barton v. Bank of New South Wales, 15 App. Cas. 379, at 381).\nA plaintiff invoking the aid of the court for the enforcement of an option for the sale of land to him must show that the terms of the option as to time and otherwise have been strictly observed; the owner incurs no obligation to sell unless the conditions precedent are fulfilled or as the result of the owner\u2019s conduct the holder of the option is on some equitable ground relieved from the strict fulfilment of them (Cushing v. Knight, 46 Can. S.C.R. 555; Hughes v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., 2 App. Cas. 439; Bruner v. Moore, [1904] 1 Ch. 305). In the present case, plaintiff relied upon the existence of a lease made by defendant while mortgagee in possession and before the date of the quit claim deed and creation of the option. Whatever the relevancy of this lease on a question of title if an obligation on defendant\u2019s part to sell had arisen, it could not affect the conditions of the option, because until these conditions were fulfilled no obligation to sell could arise and the relation of vendor and purchaser did not come into existence (Cushing v. Knight, supra). Moreover, it was highly probable, in view of the terms of the lease, that, had the conditions of the option been complied with, this objection would have been removed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of MeFarland J. dismissing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the Report of the Local Master.\nThe plaintiff claimed the right to redeem certain land. He had, on March 17, 1925, mortgaged the land to defendant to secure the sum of $5,500 and interest. On May 5, 1933, there being interest in arrear upon the mortgage, defendant issued a writ for foreclosure, and on June 23, 1933, entered judgment in the action against plaintiff, for default of appearance, for foreclosure and immediate possession. At this time there was due to defendant for principal, interest and taxed costs the sum of $5,142.37. On July 12, 1933, defendant issued a writ of possession in said foreclosure action and under its terms took possession on July 14, 1933, and has remained in possession of the land.\nOn September 28, 1933, defendant made a lease of the land to one Bentley for three years from October 1, 1933. The lease contained a provision that,\nIn the case of a sale to a purchaser other than the Lessee before the completion of the term of this Lease the said Lessee shall receive at least one month\u2019s notice prior to the end of the terms year and the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100).\nBy quit claim deed bearing date January 8, 1934 (executed, according to plaintiff, on January 11, 1934), the plaintiff granted, released and quit claimed all his estate, interest, etc., in said land to the defendant. Its recitals stated that plaintiff was indebted to defendant under the mortgage, and that plaintiff was unable to pay the mortgage and had requested defendant to accept a quit claim deed and to release plaintiff from all actions, claims and demands up to the date of the deed, which the defendant had agreed to do by her acceptance of the deed. By a letter dated January 8, 1934, from defendant\u2019s solicitors to plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, it was stated that it was understood that plaintiff was to have the right for a period of three months from the date of the quit claim deed to purchase the property from defendant upon payment of the full amount of the mortgage, including all interest, taxes and costs up to date, upon sending defendant reasonable notice in writing of his intention to do so before the expiration of said period of three months. There was raised in the present action the question as to what was the real nature and effect of this transaction or of the arrangement between the parties.\nOn April 26, 1934, plaintiff issued a writ in the Supreme Court of Ontario claiming for redemption and damages.\nOn the action coming on for trial, it was by consent referred to the Local Master at Goderich to decide all questions involved in the action. He found in favour of the plaintiff and that upon payment to defendant of the sum found by him as due on the mortgage account, less the costs of the action, there should be a re-conveyance by defendant to plaintiff of the premises freed from the claim of any person claiming under or through defendant. Defendant\u2019s appeal from the Local Master\u2019s report was dismissed, and the report confirmed, by McFarland J. Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of McFarland J. and the Master\u2019s report, and dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nP.J. Bolsby and J.D.W. Cumberland for the appellant.\nG.T. Walsh K.C. and J.A.E. Braden K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The grounds on which counsel for the appellant based his appeal were:\nFirst, the Court of Appeal was wrong in holding that, by virtue of the documents of the 8th day of January, 1934, the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee had been brought to an end and the respondent had become the owner of the property subject to an option to purchase under the terms of the letter of that date addressed by Braden & McAlister to Mr. Dancey; and,\nSecond, in the alternative, that the appellant was ready and willing to exercise the option and was relieved on equitable grounds from the strictness of its terms as to notice and payment by the conduct of the respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument, the Court being satisfied that neither of these grounds of appeal was established, the appeal was dismissed. The parties were then informed that reasons in writing would be handed down.\nAs regards the first ground of appeal, the deed of the 8th of January, 1934, is absolute in terms and contains this recital:\nAnd whereas the said Party of the First Part is unable to pay the said mortgage and the arrears of interest due thereon, and has requested the said Party of the Second Part to accept a quit claim deed of the said lands and to release the Party of the First Part of and from all actions, claims and demands up to this date, which the said Party of the Second Part has agreed to do by her acceptance of these presents.\nThis deed was drawn by the solicitors for the mortgagee and was sent by them to the solicitor for the mortgagor for execution by him. It was duly executed and returned. The letter of the solicitors for the mortgagee forwarding the document to the solicitor for the mortgagor for execution contained this clause:\nIt is also understood that your client, Mr. Pierce, is to have the right for a period of three months from the date of the quit claim deed to purchase the property from our client upon payment of the full amount of the mortgage, including all interest, taxes and costs up to date, upon sending our client reasonable notice in writing of his intention to do so before the expiration of the said period of three months.\nWe do not doubt that this undertaking formed part of the arrangement by which the equity of redemption was released and the mortgage debt discharged and that it was binding upon the mortgagee as part of that arrangement. These documents by themselves, the deed and the letter, evidence in the plainest way the intention of both parties that the land was to be vested in the mortgagee in fee simple in possession free from the equity of redemption, but that the mortgagor was to have an option of repurchase according to the terms set forth as quoted above. It is important to observe also that the documents passed through the hands of the solicitors of the respective parties. Some loose expressions in subsequent letters are of no importance.\nIn these circumstances, the attempt on the part of the mortgagor to show that the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee still subsisted would appear to have been a hopeless one. True it is, in principle, a conveyance absolute in form may be shown even by parol evidence to have been, according to the real agreement between the parties, accepted as security only and the Statute of Frauds will not prevent the proof of this by parol evidence (Flynn v. Flynn[1]; Wilson v. Ward[2]); but for this purpose convincing evidence is always required, and in the circumstances mentioned it behooved the appellant to adduce evidence of the most cogent character (Barton v. Bank of New South Wales[3]).\nThe second ground is not suggested in the pleadings and was not really put forward at the trial. Mr. Dancey, the solicitor for the appellant, insisted in his evidence that the arrangement was not that appearing on the face of the documents by which the equity of redemption was released and the mortgage debt discharged and by which the appellant was to have an option to purchase; but that by the true arrangement the mortgage debt remained undischarged and the period for redemption was extended for three months. The learned County Judge, to whom the action was referred for trial, found that such was the arrangement and granted the relief claimed in the statement of claim. His report was affirmed by Mr. Justice McFarland. The Court of Appeal held that the true arrangement was that disclosed by the documents and in this we agree.\nIn the circumstances, it is at least doubtful whether the appellant was entitled to put forward his alternative claim based on the option in the Court of Appeal. Having regard to the course of the case in the courts below, it is at least incumbent upon the appellant, assuming the alternative claim to be open to him here, to show that all the available evidence is before us and that it establishes the essential facts in a convincing way. It is well settled that a plaintiff invoking the aid of the court for the enforcement of an option for the sale of land must show that the terms of the option as to time and otherwise have been strictly observed. The owner incurs no obligation to sell unless the conditions precedent are fulfilled or, as the result of his conduct, the holder of the option is on some equitable ground relieved from the strict fulfilment of them (Cushing v. Knight[4]; Hughes v. Metropolitan Rly. Co.[5]; Bruner v. Moore[6]).\nThe appellant relies upon the existence of a lease for three years executed by the respondent while mortgagee in possession and before the date of the release of the equity of redemption and the creation of the option. Whatever the relevancy of this lease on a question of title, once an obligation to sell on the part of the mortgagee had arisen, it could not affect the conditions of the option, because until these conditions were fulfilled no obligation to sell could arise and the relation of vendor and purchaser did not come into existence (Cushing v. Knight4). Moreover, it is highly probable, in view of the terms of the lease, that, had the conditions of the option been complied with, this objection would have been removed.\nThe condition as to notice was not observed, but there was evidence of waiver and that condition need not be considered.\nAdmittedly, the condition as to payment was not fulfilled either strictly or in substance. There was no payment and no tender. The respondent had good reason to believe at the time the documents of the 8th of January went into effect that the appellant would be unable to get the necessary funds. She was expressly so informed by a letter from the appellant\u2019s solicitor of the 15th of December. Another letter from the appellant\u2019s solicitor of the 15th of March was calculated to confirm the impression that the appellant was hoping for a still further postponement of the date of payment. There is no evidence that the appellant was led by the respondent to believe that such indulgence would be granted, and, as already observed, the case put forward at the trial on the part of the appellant was not that he had an option and that the respondent had waived strict fulfilment of the conditions, but that his equity of redemption was still subsisting.\nThe evidence adduced all points to the conclusion, and on that evidence the proper conclusion is, that the appellant was not in a position to pay or to tender the amount due under the mortgage, either on the date agreed upon or afterwards. The date agreed upon in January, 1934, was, as contended by the appellant, the 11th of April of that year and the appellant down to this moment has neither paid nor tendered any part of the option price nor manifested in any tangible way his ability to do so.\nThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dancey & Bolsby.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Braden & McAlister.\n[1] (1922) 70 D.L.R. 462.\n[2] [1930] S.C.R. 212.\n[3] (1890) 15 App. Cas. 379, at 381.\n[4] (1912) 46 Can.

Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1939: Jan. 25, 26; 1939: June 27.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nIncome tax\u2014Deduction in computing assessable income\u2014Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, s. 6\u2014Expenses \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d laid out \u201cfor the purpose of earning the income\u201d\u2014Expenditures by brewery company for treating in hotels selling its product, to promote sales of product\u2014Manner of payment\u2014Provincial statutory prohibitions as affecting the question.\nAppellant company brewed and sold beer in Manitoba. Nearly all its shares were owned by R., who also controlled other corporations, each of which owned a hotel in Manitoba licensed to sell beer. During the taxation period in question appellant spent $4,206.40 through its officers or employees treating to beer frequenters of said hotels and other licensed hotels and clubs, the beer so purchased being nearly always of appellant\u2019s manufacture, though other beer was bought when, occasionally, a person being treated expressed a preference for it. Such treating was practised generally by brewers in the province, as they found it maintained or increased their sales, whereas discontinuance of the practice decreased their sales.\nHeld (reversing judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada) (Rinfret and Davis JJ. dissenting): The said sum should be allowed to appellant as a deduction in estimating its profits or gains assessable for tax under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97. It was \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\u201d within the meaning of s. 6 of that Act.\nWith regard to The Government Liquor Control Act, 1928 (Man.) (as amended), and the Crown\u2019s contention that appellant\u2019s policy was an evasion of s. 141 (against canvassing, advertising, etc., except as authorized); and that its procedure was in contravention of s. 84 (1) (4) (against a beer licensee taking anything except current money in payment or directly or indirectly allowing credit, etc.) in view of the facts that, in purchases in hotels controlled by R., instead of cash a chit was handed in and it then became a matter of accounting between the particular hotel corporation and appellant, and that in other hotels sometimes cheques were subsequently given by R. for the purchases:\nHeld (per The Chief Justice, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.): This Court should not, in the present proceedings, undertake the responsibility of determining the guilt or innocence of appellant under the provincial enactment; legality of the payments must be assumed. (Per The Chief Justice: It was incumbent upon the Crown to establish an actual violation of the statute in respect of the payments it contends should be disallowed. Moreover, it would seem that the Minister could not enter into the investigation of such an issue: Minister oj Finance v. Smith, [1927] A.C. 193).\nPer Rinfret and Davis JJ. (dissenting): Appellant adopted a system of treating which was largely based upon inducing the proprietors of hotels and clubs to sell on credit in breach of s. 84 (as amended) of The Government Liquor Control Act, 1928, Man. (s. 181 also referred to); under which Act alone the beer could be lawfully sold to the public; and in view of this the payments for its purchases cannot properly be said to have been \u201cnecessarily\u201d made for the purpose of earning the income, within the contemplation of s. 6 of the Income War Tax Act. (If provincial laws, such as the prohibition against the usual advertising and publicity of brewers, which gave rise to this unusual treating system, are not to be taken into account, then the expenditures were of such an abnormal nature in the brewery business that they cannot be said to come within the contemplation of the Dominion statute as expenses for the purpose of earning income.) Further, appellant\u2019s treating system was, in part at least, to prevent a diminution of the sales of the business from which income would be earned, and therefore its expenditures in question could not be said to be \u201cexclusively\u201d incurred for the purpose of earning the income (Ward & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 39 T.L.R. 90, referred to). APPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming the disallowance of an item of $4,206.40 claimed by appellant as a deduction in computing its income subject to tax under the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, and amendments). Appellant company carried on the business of brewing and selling beer in the province of Manitoba, and expended the said sum in treating, in places where beer manufactured by it was sold, for the purpose of promoting sales of its product.\nA. Sullivan K.C. and B. B. Dubienski for the appellant.\nW. C. Hamilton K.C. and J. R. Tolmie for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The question presented by this appeal is by no means free from difficulty, which it is perhaps needless to observe in view of the differences of judicial opinion to which it has given rise. After fully considering the questions involved, I find myself in agreement with the judgment of my brother Kerwin.\nAs to the point based upon provisions of the Manitoba Government Liquor Control Act, 1928, I think it was incumbent upon the Crown to establish an actual violation of the statute in respect of the payments it contends should be disallowed. I do not see, moreover, in view of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Minister of Finance v. Smith[1], how the Minister could enter into the investigation of such an issue.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Davis JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nDavis, J.\u2014This appeal raises the question whether certain expenditures of the appellant brewery, alleged to have been made for the purpose of encouraging the sale of its beer, can be set up as deductions against gross profits for the purpose of arriving at net profits for Dominion income tax purposes. The Minister of National Revenue disallowed the deductions ($4,206.40) claimed in respect of the appellant\u2019s income tax assessment for the fiscal year which ended October 31st, 1933. Upon an appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada from the decision of the Minister, that Court, by a judgment of the President, Mr. Justice Maclean, delivered April 12th, 1938, affirmed the Minister\u2019s decision, and the appellant appealed further to this Court.\nThe appellant is a company incorporated under the laws of the province of Manitoba, with its head office at the City of Winnipeg in the said province, and carried on in the said province the business of brewing and selling beer.\nDuring the taxation period in question the appellant adopted the practice of having its officers or employees from time to time purchase its own manufactured beer in different beer parlours and licensed clubs throughout the province for the purpose of then and there treating those who were at the time on the premises, with the object of making the appellant\u2019s beer better known to the beer-drinking public and of creating and fostering a taste among beer-drinkers for its particular beer. The appellant\u2019s total sales for the said period amounted to $154,254.55 and the amount expended for \u201ctreating,\u201d $4,206.40, was, in the circumstances, a very moderate sum. The total advertising expenses of the appellant for the period in question amounted to only $331.29.\nThe said treating expenditures were made in 67 different licensed premises in the province by Mr. Riedle, now deceased, the then President of the company, or by the Assistant Manager or by one of the travellers of the company. The proprietors of these premises handled and sold the beer of several, if not all, of the brewers operating in the province and the customers who were treated by the appellant\u2019s officers or employees were supplied with either draught or bottled beer manufactured by the appellant which was being sold on the premises. In this way the appellant\u2019s beer was brought to the attention of and kept before the beer-consuming public and in the case of bottled beer the consumers, in addition, could see the appellant\u2019s labels on the bottles when these bottles were placed on the tables by the servers in the beer parlours.\nHowever objectionable this treating system may be, the evidence is plain that it was general and widespread in the province of Manitoba and that most, if not all, of the brewery companies whose beer was on sale at the different licensed beer parlours and clubs had adopted this same practice (because of the virtual prohibition against advertising\u2014sec. 141 (3) of the Manitoba Government Liquor Control Act, 1928) to maintain or increase their sales.\nDominion income tax, under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, is assessed upon the annual net profit or gain, and in computing the amount of the profits or gain to be assessed, sec. 6 provides that a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) Disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nThere cannot be any doubt upon the evidence that the expenditures by way of \u201ctreating\u201d made by the appellant during the taxation period in question were made for the purposes of the business of the appellant; there was nothing charitable or benevolent about the expenditures.\nThe Privy Council in Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies, Bombay, v. Income Tax Commissioner, Bombay Presidency and Aden[2] adopted and applied the test laid down in Robert Addie & Sons\u2019 Collieries, Ld. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[3]:\nWhat is \u201cmoney wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of the trade\u201d is a question which must be determined upon the principles of ordinary commercial trading. It is necessary, accordingly, to attend to the true nature of the expenditure, and to ask oneself the question, Is it a part of the company\u2019s working expenses; is it expenditure laid out as part of the process of profit earning?\nCertain statutory prohibitions contained in the (Man.) Government Liquor Control Act present a difficulty to me in determining whether the expenditures in question here can properly be considered to be disbursements \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d incurred for the purpose of earning the income of the appellant company. \u201cNecessarily\u201d in sec. 6 means, I am satisfied, necessarily in a commercial sense, and if the practice of treating had become generally adopted in the province by most, if not all, of the brewers doing business in that province, it would be reasonable to regard such treating expenditures as necessarily incurred within the meaning of the statutory provision. As Lord Sumner said in the Usher case[4]:\nIt is all very well for the tax-gatherer to reap where he has not strawed; it is too much (unless the legislature says so) that he should tax not only the harvest, but also the seed.\nBut the real difficulty in this appeal which presents itself to me is the question whether or not the expenditures can be said to have been necessary even in a business sense where the system adopted was in contravention, if not of the exact letter of the law, certainly of the spirit of the law of the province. The Government Liquor Control Act provides by sec. 84, as amended in 1933, that\n(1) No beer licensee shall take, receive or accept anything except current money in payment for or on account of any beer supplied by such licensee, and no beer licensee shall directly or indirectly give or allow credit in whole or in part for or on account of any beer sold, supplied or to be supplied by such licensee nor advance any money for the purchase of such beer.\n\u201cCurrent money\u201d means cash. Now what happened in this case? The late Mr. Riedle, during the taxation period with which we are concerned, owned practically all the shares of the appellant company; he also owned or controlled the shares of eleven other corporations, each of which owned or operated a licensed hotel in the province of Manitoba. The expenditures for treating with which we are concerned were made in some 67 different licensed premises in the province, as before stated, of which these eleven hotel corporations formed a part. Riedle apparently dealt with the brewery company (the appellant) and the eleven other corporations as if they were his own personal business, because the common method of payment for the beer that was bought in these eleven hotels was, at least in large part, to have the accounts between each of these hotel corporations and the brewery company set off one against the other at the end of each month. As to other hotels in which the beer was purchased for the purpose of treating the customers, it was paid for, very frequently at least, by securing credit and ultimately giving a cheque to clean up the indebtedness. The evidence as to this practice was given in the cross-examination of John Popp, the manager of the appellant company, as follows:\nQ. Now going back again to the method by which this was done. In your own hotels no payment was made at all?\nA. No, sir, but that money was accounted for.\nQ. The manager\u2019s account would show that he had given away that much beer at some one else\u2019s direction?\nA. Yes, but it was paid for.\nQ. How?\nA. We have a stores account at the brewery covering groceries which we send to the various hotels. Now those groceries are charged against them and they are rendered an account at the end of the month and they present a contra account for the free beer served.\nQ. But no payment was made when the beer was bought?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. In reality it amounts to this: The Hotel Manager carries that item as a charge against Riedle Brewery until the end of the month when it is adjusted?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You mentioned that in some instances, say the case of independent hotels, cheques would subsequently be given in payment?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did that happen pretty frequently?\nA. Yes, this bundle of cheques represent such payments.\nQ. It runs into quite a large amount?\nA. Yes, quite a sum.\nQ. And these cheques would not be given until a few days after the purchases were made?\nA. In a week or two, probably after two or three visits had been made. Some of these cheques are to our own hotels.\nQ. But, in respect to the independent hotels, the Manager would make a charge against you and this charge would stand until a cheque came in to square off the account?\nA. Yes.\nMr. Sullivan suggested during the argument that if we thought this practice of buying beer on credit had the effect of depriving the appellant of the right to have the expenditures treated as proper deductions, there should be a reference to ascertain what portion of the amount claimed as a deduction was paid in cash and what portion was incurred on credit transactions; it being quite plain that some of the purchases of beer were undoubtedly paid for in cash at the time of their purchase. But in a matter of this sort, where it is a question whether or not certain expenditures are legitimate deductions, I do not think the Court should direct a reference in an attempt to separate the numerous items that have gone to make the total amount claimed for the deduction. It is plain that a substantial portion of the expenditure was incurred in credit transactions. The real difficulty is whether or not we are entitled to take into account the system adopted for the repurchase by the appellants of their own beer for treating purposes. The prohibition of the provincial statute is against the licensee and not against the purchaser or consumer. Strictly, it is only the licensee who is prohibited; he must not sell the beer for anything \u201cexcept current money.\u201d But sec. 181 provides that every one is a party to and guilty of an offence against the Act who does or omits any act for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence or who abets any person in commission of the offence. Subsection (4) of sec. 84 further provides that any money paid or given in contravention of the section may be recovered from the licensee by the person making the payment. The appellant adopted a system of treating which was largely based upon inducing the proprietors of hotels and clubs (i.e., the licensees) to sell on credit in breach of the provincial statute under which alone the beer could be lawfully sold to the public, and I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the payments for such purchases can properly be said to have been \u201cnecessarily\u201d made within the contemplation of the Dominion Income War Tax Act provision (sec. 6) which expressly provides that in computing the profits or gain of the taxpayer, disbursements or expenses shall not be allowed as a deduction unless they were \u201cnecessarily\u201d laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income. The Dominion Income War Tax Act has added \u201cnecessarily\u201d to the adverbs \u201cwholly\u201d and \u201cexclusively\u201d used in the English Income Tax Act and has changed the words in the English Act \u201cfor the purposes of the trade\u201d to the words \u201cfor the purpose of earning the income.\u201d The narrowing effect of the additional adverb must always be kept in mind. As Lord Hanworth said in Thomas Merthyr Colliery Co. Ltd. v. Davis[5]:\nIt is necessary to tread a narrow path in these income tax cases. It is that stern rule which must be followed.\nIf we are not to take into account local or provincial laws, such as the prohibition in Manitoba against the usual advertising and publicity of brewers which gave rise to this unusual treating system, then the expenditures were of such an abnormal nature in the brewery business that they cannot be said to come within the contemplation of the Dominion statute as expenses for the purpose of earning income.\nA further question arises, was the expenditure under consideration \u201cexclusively\u201d incurred in earning income? In Ward and Company Limited v. Commissioner of Taxes[6], the Privy Council had to consider a New Zealand case where the appellants, who were brewers and maltsters, had spent money in canvassing, advertising, printing, etc., with a view to defeating a prohibition proposal and then sought to deduct the same in computing their assessable income. The New Zealand statute, sec. 86 (1) (a), provided that no deduction should be made in respect of \u201cexpenditure or loss of any kind not exclusively incurred in the production of the assessable income.\u201d Their Lordships, putting aside the circumstance that the expenditure was not of such a nature as to produce income in the actual tax year in which it was incurred, agreed with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand that it was quite impossible to hold that the expenditure was incurred exclusively, or at all, in the production of the assessable income. Their Lordships said:\nThe expenditure in question was not necessary for the production of profit, nor was it in fact incurred for that purpose. It was a voluntary expense incurred with a view to influencing public opinion against taking a step which would have depreciated and partly destroyed the profit-bearing thing. The expense may have been wisely undertaken, and may properly find a place, either in the balance-sheet or in the profit and loss account of the appellants; but this is not enough to take it out of the prohibition in section 86 (1) (a) of the Act. For that purpose it must have been incurred for the direct purpose of producing profits. The conclusion may appear to bear hardly upon the appellants; but, if so, a remedy must be found in an amendment of the law, the terms of which are reasonably clear.\nUnder our statute, the expenditure must have been incurred \u201cexclusively\u201d\u2014to use the words of the Privy Council in the above case, \u201cfor the direct purpose\u201d of earning the income. The evidence makes it abundantly plain that the treating system adopted by the appellant was, in part at least, to prevent a diminution of the sales of the business from which income would be earned. Its sales, it was said, would fall away and its business greatly decrease if it failed to indulge in this voluntary treating system.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal, with costs. The judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin, J.\u2014The appellant company, carrying on the business of brewing and selling beer in Manitoba, filed a return of its income for the 1933 taxation period under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. In assessing the company to income tax, the Minister disallowed a sum of $4,206.40, which appellant had inserted in its statement of operating expenses, and upon appeal to the Exchequer Court the Minister\u2019s decision was affirmed.\nThe great majority of the shares of the company were owned by A. W. Riedle who also controlled a number of other corporations each of which owned a hotel in Manitoba and each of which was licensed under provincial authority to sell beer by retail. Officers or employees of the appellant expended the sum in question at these and other licensed hotels and clubs for the purpose of treating frequenters of these premises to beer. As pointed out by the President of the Exchequer Court:\nOccasionally, it was said, if a person being treated expressed a preference for a beer other than that produced by the appellant, he would be supplied with the beer designated by him, but this would rarely occur;\nthat is, in practically all cases the beer purchased for the purpose of treating was beer of the appellant\u2019s manufacture. It appears that this is a practice adopted by the brewers in the province and continued because the brewers found that, if followed consistently, their sales would either be maintained or increased, whereas when the practice was discontinued, their sales would materially decrease. The evidence upon this point is uncontradicted. It was pointed out that the hotels controlled by Riedle used the appellant\u2019s draught beer exclusively, although carrying some beer bottled by other brewers, and that in these hotels nearly sixteen hundred dollars of the total sum in question was expended; the respondent\u2019s argument being that this amount particularly could not have been laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nIt is perhaps convenient at this stage to point out that by section 9 of the Income War Tax Act a tax is to be assessed, levied and paid upon \u201cincome,\u201d which by section 3 means, for our present purpose: \u201cThe annual net profit or gain * * * being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business.\u201d By section 6:\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of (a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nNowhere in the Act is there a statement of what deductions are allowable in computing the annual net profit or gain but, if in any particular case they are shown to have been in fact and in law \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income,\u201d then they should be allowed.\nIn coming to a conclusion upon that question in this case, I find the many decisions referred to by counsel of little assistance, as the enactments under consideration in them are expressed in terms varying, if not entirely different, from the Income War Tax Act.\nNow upon the evidence, it appears to me that the appellant company disbursed the sum in question for the purpose of earning income and not as a capital expenditure. As to the words \u201cwholly\u201d and \u201cexclusively,\u201d it is not suggested that the appellant desired to give away its funds, or any part of them, nor is it contended that there was any fraud or bad faith, or that any part of the expenditures was fictitious. The learned President of the Exchequer Court held that the expenditure was not necessary but, with respect, I find it impossible to agree. As already mentioned, the practice followed by appellant is one adopted by the other brewers in Manitoba, and followed by all as something considered by them, not merely as advisable, but as obligatory, to increase, or at least sustain, the volume of their sales. Being considered thus in a commercial sense, I think it should be similarly held for the purposes of the Act.\nThere remains the question as to whether the money was thus laid out for the purpose of earning the income, that is, the income for the 1933 taxation period. In any consideration of this question, a certain degree of latitude must, I think, be allowed. For instance, in the case of a manufacturing company employing travellers to solicit business, meticulous examination of the latter\u2019s expense accounts might easily disclose that sums expended towards the end of one taxation period were not productive of orders or of the filling of the orders or of the payment for the goods supplied,\u2014in the same period. That result should not prevent the company deducting such expenses in its returns under the Act. The statutory provisions may be given a reasonable and workable interpretation by holding that, as long as the disbursements fulfil the requirements already discussed, the taxpayer expended them \u201cfor the purpose,\u201d i.e., with the object and intent that they should earn the particular gross income reported for the period. In my opinion, the $4,206.40 was expended for that purpose in the circumstances of this case.\nFinally, it was argued that the policy pursued by the appellant was an evasion, and in the manner of its procedure was a contravention, of the provisions of the Government Liquor Control Act, 1928, of Manitoba. Section 141 (1) (a) thereof provides as follows:\nExcept as permitted by this Act or the regulations made thereunder, no person within the Province shall:\n(a) canvass for, receive, take or solicit orders for the purchase or sale of any liquor or act as agent or intermediary for the sale or purchase of any liquor, or hold himself out as such agent or intermediary.\nand the contention is that the evidence discloses that the appellant\u2019s officers or employees visited the beer parlours in an endeavour to promote sales. Section 84, subsections 1 and 4, provides:\n(1) No beer licensee shall take, receive or accept anything except current money in payment for or on account of any beer supplied by such licensee, and no beer licensee shall directly or indirectly give or allow credit in whole or in part for or on account of any beer sold, supplied or to be supplied by such licensee nor advance any money for the purchase of such beer.\n(4) Any money, security or any deposit paid, given or pledged in contravention of this section, or the full value thereof, may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction by the person making the deposit, payment, gift or pledge, as aforesaid, from the licensee, free of all claims of the licensee in respect thereof, and in addition the beer licensee shall be liable to any penalty provided for the breach of this section.\nWith reference to these provisions, it is stated that a large part of the beer was bought on credit and the submission is that such a method is a direct contravention of the section. This refers to the evidence that, for each purchase made in hotels controlled by Riedle, instead of cash a chit was handed in and it then became a matter of accounting between the particular hotel corporation and the appellant, at whose office the main book-keeping of the hotel corporation was done. As to other hotels, the evidence is that on some occasions cheques were given by Riedle for the purchases.\nIn my view, it is unnecessary to decide these questions. This Court should not, in these proceedings, undertake the responsibility of determining the guilt or innocence of appellant under the provincial enactment. I assume the legality thereunder of the payments made and for the reasons given above would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dubienski & Popp.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Boucher, [1939] S.C.R. 265\nDate: 1939-06-27\nAndrew Pritchard (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJoseph Boucher and Ethel Boucher (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1939: June 6, 27.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Collision at street intersection\u2014One car making left hand turn\u2014Statutory requirements\u2014Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, s. 39(1).\nThe action was for damages by reason of a motor car collision at a street intersection in Ottawa, Ontario. Defendant, whose car had been going easterly on L. avenue, was turning left at the intersection to go northerly on O. street, when his car, and plaintiffs\u2019 car going westerly on L. avenue, collided. At the trial the jury found that the accident was not caused by negligence of defendant, and the action was dismissed. Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was allowed, and judgment given to plaintiffs for damages to be assessed at a new trial for that purpose. Defendant appealed.\nHeld: The judgment at trial should be restored. No error was shown in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, the case was eminently one for a jury, and the jury could on the evidence properly make the finding which they did as aforesaid.\nThe requirements of s. 39 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 288, discussed in regard to defendant\u2019s duty in making the left hand turn in question. After defendant had entered and come within the intersection to the right of the centre line of L. avenue, he was obliged (besides observing the precautions required by s. 39 (1) and the law as to reasonable conduct in the circumstances) upon leaving the intersection to pass to the right of the centre line of O. street, but was not obliged, as an act necessary in itself, to continue beyond the centre of the intersection before turning to the left.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the judgment of McTague, J., following the trial of the action with a jury, dismissing the action.\nThe action was for damages by reason of a motor car collision at a street intersection in Ottawa, Ontario, on May 29, 1937, at about 3.50 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. Defendant, whose car had been going easterly on Laurier avenue, was (the green signal-light then being shown facing east and west) turning left at the intersection to go northerly on O\u2019Connor street, when his car and that driven by the plaintiff Joseph Boucher (whose wife, the other plaintiff, accompanied him in the car), which car was going westerly on Laurier avenue, collided. At the trial, to the first question put to the jury, \u201cWas the accident caused by the negligence of the defendant?\u201d the jury answered \u201cNo\u201d (and in view of that answer, they did not answer the other questions put to them); and judgment was given dismissing the action. Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict and judgment at trial, and ordered that a new trial with a jury be had, limited to an assessment of damages only, and that plaintiffs recover from the defendant the amount of the damages so assessed. Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the defendant by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. and J.D. Watt for the appellant.\nR.V. Sinclair K.C. and Auguste Lemieux K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN, J.\u2014This action arises out of a collision between two motor vehicles at the intersection of Laurier avenue and O\u2019Connor street in the City of Ottawa. At the trial certain questions were submitted to the jury, to the first of which only they found it necessary to give an answer. That answer was \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201cWas the accident caused by the negligence of the defendant?\u201d On appeal by the plaintiffs the Court of Appeal for Ontario delivered the following oral judgment:\nAppeal allowed with costs here and below as far as trial is concerned and goes back for trial on question of damages alone. Mr. Justice Gillanders expressed the opinion that there should be a general trial.\nBy special leave of that Court, the defendant now appeals.\nSeveral points had been taken by the plaintiffs in their notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal but before us Mr. Sinclair suggested that the real grounds upon which the Court of Appeal must have proceeded were: (1) The trial judge erred in that part of his charge to the jury where he interpreted the relevant parts of what is now section 39, subsection 1, of the Highway Traffic Act. While the accident occurred in 1937, no change has been made in the applicable statutory provisions, and for convenience I refer, therefore, to the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, chapter 288. (2) The verdict was such as no reasonable jury doing their duty could have returned.\nThese two grounds may well be considered together. Subsection 1 of section 39 is as follows:\n(1) Where two persons in charge of vehicles or on horseback approach a crossroad or intersection, or enter an intersection, at the same time, the person to the right hand of the other vehicle or horseman shall have the right-of-way.\n(a) The driver or operator of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to the left across the path of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction may make such left turn only after affording a reasonable opportunity to the driver or operator of such other vehicle to avoid a collision. 1930, c. 48, s. 8 (1), part.\n(b) The driver or operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the right into an intersecting highway shall approach such intersection and turn as closely as practicable to the right curb or edge of the travelled portion of the highway. 1931, c. 54, s. 10, part.\n(c) The driver or operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left into an intersecting highway shall approach such intersection as closely as practicable to the centre line of the highway and the left turn shall be made by passing to the right of such centre line where it enters the intersection, and upon leaving the intersection by passing to the right of the centre line of the highway then entered. 1931, c. 54, s. 10, part; 1933, c. 20, s. 4(1).\n(d) The driver or operator of a vehicle upon a highway before turning to the left from a direct line shall first see that such movement can be made in safety, and if the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement shall give a signal plainly visible to the driver or operator of such other vehicle of the intention to make such movement.\n(e) The signal required in clause (d) shall be given either by means of the hand and arm in the manner herein specified or by a mechanical or electrical signal device which has been approved by the Department.\n(f) Whenever the signal is given by means of the hand and arm the driver or operator shall indicate his intention to turn by extending the hand and arm horizontally from and beyond the left side of the vehicle. 1931, c. 54, s. 10, part.\nIn this connection it is important to note the definition of the word \u201cintersection\u201d in section 1(g):\n\u201cIntersection\u201d shall mean the area embraced within the prolongation or connection of the lateral curb lines or, if none, then of the lateral boundary lines of two or more highways which join one another at an angle, whether or not one highway crosses the other.\nAs applied to the scene of the accident, the intersection means the area embraced within the prolongation of the lateral curb lines on Laurier avenue and O\u2019Connor street. According to the evidence of the defendant, who was proceeding easterly on Laurier avenue, he stopped his vehicle before entering the intersection,\u2014because the red traffic light situated at the southeast corner of the two streets was showing,\u2014bringing his vehicle to a stop on the south side of Laurier avenue and close to the centre line thereof. Upon the red light disappearing and the green light showing, he stated that he passed to the right of that centre line where it entered the intersection. If his evidence on this point was believed by the jury, he had complied with the first part of paragraph (c). Being then within the intersection as mentioned in paragraph (a) and intending to turn to the left across the path of the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle which he saw approaching from the east on Laurier avenue, he was entitled to make such left turn \u201conly after affording a reasonable opportunity (to the plaintiffs) to avoid a collision.\u201d By paragraph (d), the defendant was first to see that such movement could be made in safety, and since the operation of the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle might be affected by such movement, he was obliged (paragraph (e)) to give a signal, plainly visible to the driver of the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle, which signal was to be given either by means of the hand and arm in the manner specified by paragraph (f) or by a mechanical or electrical signal device which had been approved by the Department of Highways. According to the evidence of the defendant, which the jury was entitled to believe, he gave the hand and arm signal mentioned in paragraph (f) \u201cby extending the hand and arm horizontally from and beyond the left side of the vehicle.\u201d The defendant\u2019s explanation, which the jury could weigh against the evidence of the plaintiffs, was that he saw the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle approaching at a distance of at least one hundred feet away and considered that he had ample time to cross in safety, and the jury, therefore, might very well adopt the view that the defendant had afforded the driver of the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle the reasonable opportunity to avoid a collision mentioned in paragraph (a).\nThere was no obligation on the part of the defendant, after entering the intersection and before turning to the left, to keep to the south of the centre line of Laurier avenue until he reached the very centre of the intersection and then to keep to the centre of O\u2019Connor street. According to the evidence of the defendant, he had complied with the first part of paragraph (c) of subsection 1 of section 39 and, so far as that paragraph is concerned, the only other obligation upon him was, upon leaving the intersection, to pass to the right of the centre line of O\u2019Connor street. Any doubt as to the correct construction of this paragraph is swept aside by a consideration of the fact that as originally enacted in 1931, by chapter 54, section 10, it read as follows:\n(c) The driver or operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left into an intersecting highway shall approach such intersection as closely as practicable to the centre line of the highway and continue beyond the centre of the intersection before turning;\nand in 1933, by chapter 20, section 4, the words italicized were stricken out and words added so that the paragraph appears as it is now found in the Revised Statutes.\nThe trial judge explained paragraph (c) to the jury in this sense. He also not only called their attention to the other requirements of subsection 1 but reiterated them by saying:\nLet us summarize briefly: The man intending to turn to the left may do so, but he must afford a reasonable opportunity to the other man to avoid a collision; he must exercise that care.\nSecondly, he must come into the intersection in a certain way, and he must leave it in a certain way. Thirdly, he must take due precautions to see that he is not going to run into someone else or permit someone else to run into him; and he must make the signal which is provided in this act by extending the left hand horizontally from the car (indicating).\nHe referred to the contradictions between the evidence on behalf of the parties as to whether these requirements were met by the defendant and also generally as to what was stated to have occurred. In the latter connection, in addition to having referred in the opening passages of his charge to what would be expected of a reasonable man under the circumstances as the jury would find them, he stated later:\nI do wish to emphasize to you that mere observance of what the statute provides is, in certain circumstances, not the whole duty. Always persists the obligation in the circumstances of a man conducting himself as an ordinary reasonable man would do.\nNo error being found in the charge, the case was eminently one for a jury and, with respect, we are of opinion that in the exercise of their duty the jury could very properly come to the conclusion that the accident was not caused by the negligence of the defendant.\nWe have had the advantage of a very complete argument by Mr. Lemieux on the other points taken by the plaintiffs in their notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, but, after consideration, we are unable to discover in them any adequate ground upon which that Court could have set aside the verdict and judgment at the trial.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson, Herridge, Gowling & MacTavish.\nSolicitor for respondents: Auguste Lemieux.\n"}

VI, c. 42).\nIn s. 37 (3) of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, as amended by I Geo. VI, c. 42), the words \u201chighest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province \u201c(from which court only, save as provided, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada) mean the highest court of appeal having jurisdiction generally in the province, and do not refer to the highest court in the province to which appeal can be taken in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the decision of a County Court Judge in Ontario dismissing an appeal from the decision of a court of revision affirming an assessment made under a city by-law passed under the provisions of s. 120a (enacted in 1934, c. 1) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 238, was quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nMOTION on behalf of the Corporation of the City of Toronto, respondent, for an order quashing the appeal herein from the decision of His Honour. Judge Denton, a Judge of the County Court of the County of York, dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Court of Revision for the City of Toronto affirming an assessment of appellant in respect of income for the year 1936, made under a by-law of the city passed in 1934 under the provisions of s. 120a (enacted in 1934, c. 1) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 238. Corresponding provisions are now in R.S.O., 1937, c. 272, s. 123.\nThe first two grounds of the motion were: (1) that the Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 272, s. 123, subs. 8, provides that no appeal shall lie from the decision of the County Court Judge; (2) that the judgment of His Honour Judge Denton is not a judgment of the highest court of final resort established in the province of Ontario within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, ss. 35 to 41, as amended by 1 Geo. VI, c. 42.\nJ. P. Kent K.C. for the motion.\nH. F. Parkinson K.C. and H. C. F. Mockridge contra.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014In Farquharson v. Imperial Oil Co.[1], Strong C.J. said:\nIn the case of Danjou v. Marquis[2], which was an appeal to this court from a judgment of the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec, instituted before the original Act had been amended by the addition of the provision now contained in subsection 3 of section 26, it was held that the words \u201chighest court of last resort\u201d were to be construed as meaning the highest Court of Appeal having jurisdiction generally in the province, and not as referring to the highest Court of Appeal in the particular case sought to be appealed; thus excluding jurisdiction in a case in which the Court of Review was by provincial legislation made the court of last resort in the province.\nThe phrase \u201chighest court of last resort\u201d is not distinguishable from the phrase \u201chighest court of final resort\u201d in section 37 (3) of the Supreme Court Act as it now stands. The words \u201cwhether the judgment or decision in such proceeding was or was not a proper subject of appeal to such highest court of final resort\u201d appearing in the section as it formerly stood were discarded as being surplusage in the amending Act of 1 Geo. VI, ch. 42, s. 1. Nevertheless, their presence in the section in its earlier form would be sufficient to demonstrate that the words \u201chighest court of final resort in the province\u201d had and have the meaning ascribed to \u201chighest court of last resort\u201d by Strong C.J. in the passage quoted.\nPearce v. City of Calgary[3], cited on behalf of the appellant, was a decision of the Registrar upon the construction of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139) which has since been repealed. The phrase under consideration there was \u201cthe judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes.\u201d That decision has no relevancy to the question now decided.\nThe appeal is quashed with costs.\nCannon, J.\u2014I would quash the appeal with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

After argument on said questions of law, judgment was given dismissing the action (except as against certain defendants whose position was not then under consideration), it being held in effect that no cause of action was disclosed by the statement of claim. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba, being of opinion that said questions of law should not have been disposed of before the trial, set aside the judgment, and directed that defendants should be entitled to raise on the trial of the action \u201cany demurrer or points of law taken by them in their statement of defence\u201d and that plaintiff should \u201chave leave to amend his statement of claim as he may be advised.\u201d\nHeld: The judgment of the Court of Appeal was not a final judgment nor a \u201cjudgment directing a new trial\u201d within the contemplation of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35); and there could be no appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMOTION by certain of the defendants for an order granting special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nIn the action the plaintiff alleged that he was a fireman and a member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen and that a certain agreement covering reorganization of Seniority Districts of Engineers, Firemen, etc., had been wrongly interpreted and acted upon, and he claimed damages against certain defendants, certain declarations and other relief. Adamson J., of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, ordered that the demurrer contained in the statement of defence of certain defendants and certain questions of law arising in the action should be argued and decided before any evidence was given in the action or any question or issue of fact was tried. Argument was heard by Adamson J. on said demurrer and other questions of law and judgment was delivered thereon dismissing the action (except as against certain defendants whose position was not under consideration in the application). The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. That Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of Adamson J. Its judgment provided that \u201cnotwithstanding this order and judgment\u201d defendants should be \u201centitled to raise on the trial of this action any demurrer or points of law taken by them in their statement of defence and that plaintiff \u201chave leave to amend his statement of claim as he may be advised.\u201d The view of the Court of Appeal was that the questions dealt with by Adamson J. ought not to have been disposed of before the trial. Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused on an application to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, and the present application was made to this Court.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the motion.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nThe question to be decided is whether the judgment is an appealable judgment under section 36 of the Supreme Court Act. Admittedly, it is not a final judgment, but it is argued that it is \u201ca judgment * * * directing a new trial\u201d within the meaning of that section. By an order of the 16th of July, 1937, Mr. Justice Adamson directed that the\ndemurrer contained in the statement of defence of the defendants other than Canadian National Railway Company, Ferguson and Hay and the following questions of law * * * shall be argued and decided before any evidence is given in the action or any question or issue of fact is tried and that the said questions of law be set down * * * for argument\non a date mentioned.\nThis order was obviously made under marginal rule 466 of the Manitoba Rules of Court.\nThe learned judge heard argument on all the questions and held in effect that no cause of action was disclosed by the statement of claim. By his formal judgment of the 17th of January, 1938, he dismissed the action against all the defendants other than the Canadian National Railway Company, Ferguson and Hay.\nOn appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal, that Court set aside the judgment of Mr. Justice Adamson and directed that the defendants should be at liberty to raise on the trial of the action \u201cany demurrer or points of law taken by them in their statement of defence,\u201d and that the plaintiff should \u201chave leave to amend his statement of claim as he may be advised.\u201d\nThe view of the Court of Appeal was that the questions dealt with by Mr. Justice Adamson ought not to have been disposed of before the trial.\nWe are satisfied that this judgment is not a \u201cjudgment * * * directing a new trial\u201d within the contemplation of section 36. The application will, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nCannon, J.\u2014I would dismiss the motion with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the applicants: Hudson, Ormond, Spice, Swift and Macleod.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Andrews, Andrews, Burbidge & Bell.\n"}

He sued defendant for damages. He gave evidence that on account of pit holes in the road the rear end of the truck jumped and struck a rut which was on or near the edge of the travelled part of the road and prevented him from coming back until he struck the culvert wall. The trial judge gave judgment for plaintiff, holding that the accident was caused by, the narrowing of the travelled portion of the road from 22 or 24 feet to the 16-foot culvert, absence of warning signs, absence of wings approaching the culvert (the wing walls did not extend beyond the ground level), and the condition of the road surface (pit holes and rut). His judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld: Plaintiff\u2019s appeal dismissed. The above conditions did not constitute default of defendant to keep the road in repair within the meaning of s. 469 (1) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 233. The depressions were all caused by normal user of the highway, and in the circumstances and time of year defendant was not guilty of default in permitting them to exist. To hold that the rut was a condition causing the road to be out of repair would be imposing too heavy a burden on county municipalities. Further, on the evidence the accident was the result of plaintiffs own lack of care.\nThe principle as to a municipality\u2019s duty to keep roads in repair discussed and cases referred to.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, reversing judgment of McFarland J. at trial, dismissed his action, which was brought against the defendant county municipality for damages by reason of a truck, which plaintiff was driving, striking a wall of a culvert on a county road, the plaintiff alleging negligence in defendant because of dangerous conditions on the road, causing the accident. The material facts and circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nW. Ross Macdonald K.C. for the appellant.\nPeter White K.C. and Miss G.E.M. Wilson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014About seven o\u2019clock in the evening of February 10th, 1937, the appellant (plaintiff) was driving his 1934 half-ton Chevrolet truck westerly on a county road under the jurisdiction of the respondent municipality. There was some wind but, although there were light snow flurries, there was nothing, according to the appellant, to obstruct his having a clear view of the highway for three hundred feet, the distance illuminated by the head-lights of his truck. He was alone, the truck was empty except for a bushel of apples, and he was travelling about twenty miles per hour. There was no ice or snow on the road, which the appellant said was \u201crough and pitted.\u201d When about fifty feet east of a culvert, the rear end of the truck \u201cjumped, with the pit holes, to the south.\u201d Later in his evidence the appellant stated: \u201cI hit another cross-rut; at least it was of dark construction. I seen it, but I couldn\u2019t say it was a rut. It hindered me from coming back.\u201d This rut was on or near the edge of the travelled part of the road. The truck struck the southerly cement wall erected on the culvert (and 3.9 feet in height from the floor of the culvert), and in this action the appellant seeks compensation for the injuries he sustained and for the damage done his truck as a result of the impact.\nAt the outset it should be emphasized that appellant\u2019s claim is based upon subsection 1 of section 469 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O., 1927, chapter 233:\u2014\nEvery highway and every bridge shall be kept in repair by the corporation the council of which has jurisdiction over it, or upon which the duty of repairing it is imposed by this Act, and in case of default, the corporation shall subject to the provisions of The Contributory Negligence Act be liable for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default.\nTo succeed, he must show that there was a default on the part of the respondent to keep the highway in repair. In addition to what has already been narrated, the evidence discloses that about 1922 or 1923 the road in question had been re-graded and gravelled, and that in the autumn of 1936 the surface had been stabilized by the addition of calcium chloride to an average width of twenty feet, although near, and for some distance easterly from, the culvert, the travelled part of the road was wider. The colour of the walls of the culvert merged into the colour of the road surface and complaint was made that this, together with the fact that the culvert itself was about sixteen feet in width, constituted a trap for users of the highway, in the absence of lights or reflectors on the ends of the walls of the culvert and in the absence of signs giving warning of the presence of what is termed on behalf of the appellant \u201ca narrow culvert or bridge.\u201d\nThe trial judge agreed with these contentions and found that the accident was caused by four things,\u2014one of them being the narrowing of the travelled portion of the road from 22 feet or 24 feet to the 16-foot culvert, and another, the absence of signs or warnings. Yet another he described as \u201cthe entire absence of wings approaching the culvert.\u201d There were wing walls which, however, did not extend above the level of the ground. Unless the suggestion be that if there had been wing walls a few feet in height above such level, a traveller on the highway might more easily be able to discern the presence of the culvert, it is difficult to see how the presence or absence of such wing walls had anything to do with the accident. In any event, these three matters have been mentioned merely to be put aside as I cannot agree that they constituted any default on the part of the respondent to keep the road in repair. The culvert was built on a stretch of straight roadway and no obligation existed to give warning of what might be expected by a motorist on a county road in Ontario.\nThe fourth matter mentioned by the trial judge requires more attention,\u2014the condition of the surface of the road. Undoubtedly there were a number of depressions,\u2014but all caused by the normal user of the highway. The evidence of the different witnesses did not vary materially as to their width or depth, and it is impossible to hold that the respondent was guilty of any default in permitting them to exist. They had been caused since the respondent\u2019s power maintainer had last been used on the road some time previous to January 1st, 1937, and such depressions are likely to occur in the wintertime when it would be impracticable to make and maintain the road surface smooth and even.\nIn speaking of the condition of the road, the trial judge found that the evidence had established \u201cthe fact that the accident was caused by the pit holes and the rut.\u201d This is the rut referred to by the appellant as having prevented him bringing the rear wheels of the truck back; to the centre of the travelled portion of the road. Its presence was testified to by other witnesses called by the appellant, including a son and two daughters, one of whom took a photograph of the locus on the day following the accident, in the presence of the other two. The respondent\u2019s engineer and an insurance adjuster inspected the locality on February 18th and they say there was no rut,\u2014calling what they saw a wheel mark. The respondent\u2019s officials were apparently of the opinion that the photograph must have been taken at a date later than February 19th when, because of a thaw, it was found possible for the man in charge of the maintainer to use the machine on the road. After perusing this photograph, the engineer testified that it showed an impression left by the dual wheels of the maintainer, which he identified from the appearance of a mark caused by a diagonal lug not in use on any truck. In substance he described what the photograph indicated as a mark and not a rut. He stated further that if the maintainer had made a rut of the depth described by the appellant\u2019s witnesses, it should and would have been removed by the respondent the same day. While the trial judge concluded that a rut existed at the time of the accident, he did not find that the maintainer had caused it; and I find it impossible, on the record, to make such a finding.\nFrom this and indeed from the pleadings, and the whole course of the trial, it is apparent that the appellant never claimed or suggested that the rut or mark had been caused by the maintainer or by any vehicle under the control of the respondent. This consideration renders it unnecessary to determine whether a claim could be eked out against the respondent for misfeasance, irrespective of the statute.\nAccepting, as did the trial judge, the evidence of the appellant\u2019s witnesses, the question remains as to whether this rut was a condition in or near the travelled portion of the road causing it to be out of repair. With respect, I think that question must be negatived. To hold otherwise would be imposing too heavy a burden on county municipalities. It is undoubted law that they are not insurers of the safety of the travelling public. The obligation of a municipality in Ontario has been considered in numerous cases in the courts of that province but the problem has always been to apply the principle as exemplified in the words of Chief Justice Armour in Foley v. East Flamborough[1]:\u2014\nI think that if the particular road is kept in such a reasonable state of repair that those requiring to use the road may, using ordinary care, pass to and fro upon it in safety, the requirement of the law is satisfied.\nThis statement of the rule was approved in this Court by Idington and Anglin JJ. in Raymond v. Township of Bosanquet[2]. To the same effect are the remarks of Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., and Duff J. in Oakville v. Cranston[3], the decision in which is merely noted in 55 Can. S.C.R. 630. The divergence of judicial opinion in that case is indicative of the difficulty experienced in applying the principle to particular circumstances. The trial judge had deemed it unnecessary to fix the exact dimensions of the hole or depression which was the cause of the accident but had found that the municipality had not kept the portion of the road, in which it was found, in proper and sufficient repair. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario an appeal from this judgment was dismissed on an equal division of opinion. This Court affirmed the order of the Court of Appeal with Davies J. dissenting. Sir Charles Fitzpatrick stated:\u2014\nBoth parties agree that the criterion by which the liability of the corporation is to be measured is safety and convenience for travel, having regard to the physical characteristics of the road, the public needs, the season of the year and the climatic conditions.\nThe present Chief Justice put the matter thus:\u2014\nThere is no controversy touching the fundamental principle governing the determination of the issues in this litigation. The duty of the municipality * * * is to maintain its roads in a reasonable state of repair, in other words, in a reasonably safe condition in so far as that can be done by the exercise of due diligence\u2014Jamieson v. Edmonton[4],\u2014safe, that is to say, for people using them lawfully and reasonably, due regard always being had in deciding what is reasonable in both these connections to the nature of the locality, the season of the year, the weather and the frequency of travel.\nIn the case at bar, I conclude that the appellant was not keeping a sufficient lookout as he did not see the culvert wall until he was within twelve feet of it; and that he did not have proper control of the steering-wheel of the truck as, otherwise, the pit holes would have caused no difficulty. I agree with the three judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario who, I assume, in reversing the trial judge, must have decided that there had been no default on the part of the respondent to keep the road in repair. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIS J.\u2014Counsel for the appellant in a very clear and forcible argument presented the appellant\u2019s claim against the respondent municipality, as indeed the claim was founded, on an alleged breach of the statutory duty of the municipality to keep in repair its highways. But in my opinion he put the duty far too high. The statutory imposition upon Ontario municipalities has remained unchanged from earliest times (except that in 1927, by chap. 61, sec. 50, by an amendment the provisions of the Con- tributory Negligence Act were made applicable) and the municipal law has long been established in Ontario as to just what is that duty, though, of course, the application of the general statement to particular facts may at times occasion some difficulty. The classic statement has always been that of Chief Justice Armour in the Township of East Flamborough case[5], where it was stated at page 141 that a municipality must keep the highway\nin such a reasonable state of repair that those requiring to use the road may, using ordinary care, pass to and fro upon it in safety.\nIf that is done, \u201cthe requirement of the law is satisfied.\u201d\nGarrow, J.A., in Hogg v. Township of Brooke[6], put the same principle in an equally clear statement when he said at p. 285:\nA corporation must, I think, at the peril of a charge of negligence, use the means at its command to supply that which the travelling public is entitled to demand, namely, an open and reasonably safe highway.\nI am satisfied on the evidence that what is complained of here did not constitute want of repair within the statutory obligation. What was so much emphasized as a \u201crut\u201d in the shoulder of the travelled portion of the road, caused undoubtedly by the wheel of some motor truck, was nothing different from the common variety of ruts so-called that the everyday motorist encounters on any country road. It would be, in my view, an unbearable burden upon our municipal corporations to impose so high a duty of repair as is contended for in this case.\nBut quite apart from this aspect of the case, the evidence is abundantly plain that the appellant was the author of his own injury. He had a clear, open, straight stretch of road before him. He had driven over it a few hours before as well as having driven up and down the same road the day before the accident. It was a bright night in February; he says his windshield was clear and that he was driving along the road carefully and that he could see, with his lights on, about three hundred feet ahead of him. There was no one else on the road. And yet, on his own evidence, when he came towards the small bridge over a culvert with the abutments standing three feet nine inches above the ground he ran right into the abutment on his left side of the road and he admits that he did not see it until he was about twelve feet from it.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously concluded that the action could not succeed. They apparently thought the case too plain to require written reasons for their judgment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe application of the statutory onus provision of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 251, sec. 42(1) (now R.S.O., 1937, ch. 288, s. 48(1)) that\nWhen loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the onus of proof that such loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver.\nwhich was raised in Groves v. County of Wentworth[7] (a case on its facts in many respects similar to the facts of this case) and carefully considered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case, was not raised in this case and consequently has not been considered by us in relation to the facts of this case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacDonald & MacDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.M.

APPEAL by the Superintendent of Insurance for Canada from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing the appeal of The Discount and Loan Corporation of Canada, the present respondent, from the recommendation or ruling of the Superintendent of Insurance, in a report made by him to the Acting Minister of Finance for Canada under the provisions of the Loan Companies Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 28, that the licence issued under said Act to said respondent corporation, which corporation was incorporated by special Act, 23-24 Geo. V, (Dom., 1933), c. 63 (amended by 24-25 Geo. V, c. 68), be renewed with a certain qualification or limitation with regard to charges to be made for expenses in connection with loans or renewals of loans under certain provisions in respondent\u2019s said special Act.\nThe facts and issues in question before the Exchequer Court are set out in the said judgment of Maclean J.1. He held that the said qualification or limitation was not justified upon the circumstances and the said special Act, and that the Superintendent was not empowered, in the facts and circumstances of the case, to refuse to respondent an unconditional licence or to impose the qualification or limitation which he did upon the grounds taken by the Superintendent; further, that the matters alleged to be contrary to respondent\u2019s Act of incorporation were not of the character contemplated by the Loan Companies Act as a ground for refusing an unqualified licence.

Defendant\u2019s street car, proceeding easterly along D. street (a \u201cthrough\u201d highway), struck the wagon as it was crossing the tracks. At the trial the street car motorman testified that when he saw the horse approaching the D. street line he shut off the power, \u201cfanned his brakes\u201d (braked car to check speed) and after slackening the car down sounded the gong; that the horse after entering D. street started to turn eastward but was jerked by the reins so that it crossed the tracks; that when he saw the horse was going to cross he applied the emergency brake. The case was tried with a special jury, who found that the motorman was guilty of negligence causing the collision, in that, as stated in their answer to question 2 submitted to them, \u201cthe evidence indicates that he was conscious of danger when he fanned his brakes and at that time did not bring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision\u201d; and that deceased was not guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision; and plaintiff recovered judgment. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1938] O.R. 694, which held that there was no reasonable evidence to support the finding against defendant\u2019s motorman, and that it did not constitute a finding of negligence in law, and that all the evidence indicated clearly that the deceased was guilty of negligence which was the proximate and effective cause of the accident. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld (Crocket and Kerwin JJ. dissenting): Plaintiff\u2019s appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer the Chief Justice: The jury\u2019s answer to question 2 should not be read as referring solely to the motorman\u2019s evidence or as founding the inference that he was \u201cconscious of danger when he fanned his brakes\u201d upon the fact that he fanned his brakes alone, or upon the motorman\u2019s evidence alone; it was stating an inference from the whole of the evidence. Considering all the evidence, there was evidence from which the jury might or might not conclude, according to their view of it, that the motorman realized what the deceased was doing (that he was in the act of crossing the street) in time to avoid a collision if he acted with reasonable promptitude. The jury taking the view that the motorman became aware of what the deceased was doing in time to enable him to bring his car under sufficient control to let the horse and wagon pass, and that his failure to do so was unreasonable and negligent, it was for the jury to say, on the whole evidence, whether, notwithstanding deceased\u2019s conduct, the motorman\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accident and whether deceased should be acquitted of contributory negligence in the legal sense (Calgary v. Harnovis, 48 Can. S.C.R. 494; Long v. Toronto Ry. Co., 50 Can. S.C.R. 224; Loach\u2019s case, [1916] 1 A.C. 719; Columbia Bitulithic v. B.C. Elec. Ry., 55 Can. S.C.R. 1; Leech v. Lethbridge, 62 Can. S.C.R. 123; Athonas v. Ottawa Elec. Ry. Co., [1931] S.C.R. 139; Nixon v. Ottawa Elec. Ry. Co., [1933] S.C.R. 154).\nPer Davis J.: Though lack of care on the part of deceased was closely relevant to the enquiry for the jury, the vital question was: whose negligence was the direct cause of the collision? The jury were the tribunal of fact. Their verdict should not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it. The jury were entitled, upon all the evidence, to find, as they did, that defendant was solely to blame. (The Eurymedon, [1938] P. 41, at 49-50, cited).\nComment with regard to the practice adopted in the case, in the jury visiting the locus and other places for inspections. Seneviratne v. The King, [1936] 3 All E.R. 36, at 51, referred to.\nPer Hudson J.: There was evidence on which, if taken together with what may well have been unspoken impressions properly influencing the minds of the jurors when seeing and hearing the witnesses, and taking into account the jurors\u2019 special qualifications in this case, they could reasonably come to the conclusion at which they arrived. (Clarke v. Edinburgh & District Tramways Co., 1919 S.C. (H.L.) 35, at 36; Powell v. Streatham, [1935] A.C. 243, at 257, cited as to the duty of a court of appeal when asked to reverse the decision of a trial tribunal).\nPer Crocket J., dissenting: The evidence established indisputably that the emergency out of which the accident arose was created by negligence of deceased. Only a valid unequivocal finding that the motorman, notwithstanding deceased\u2019s negligence in creating the danger, could by the exercise of due care have avoided the collision would justify fixing responsibility upon defendant. Such a finding of ultimate negligence against the motorman could not in the light of the evidence be fairly and reasonably spelled out of the jury\u2019s answers. Their answer to question 2 involved acceptance of the motorman\u2019s evidence that he fanned his brakes when he saw the horse approaching the street line, and also implied that the mere fact that he did so established that he must have then become conscious of some danger which made it his immediate duty to bring his car under such control that it could be stopped in time to avoid a collision in case he should find that deceased was actually going to take the risk of crossing in front of the street car. The assumption that under the circumstances there was such duty is not justifiable, and a finding of negligence based thereon is not valid. Also the jury\u2019s answer to question 2 cannot, having regard to the entire testimony, fairly be taken as involving a rejection of the motorman\u2019s statement as to the horse starting to turn eastward. The jury\u2019s finding exonerating deceased from all blame for the collision was perverse. The only verdict reasonably possible upon the evidence, including those portions of the motorman\u2019s evidence which the jury must, upon a fair interpretation of their answer to question 2, be taken to have accepted, was that the motorman could not by the exercise of reasonable care and skill have avoided the collision which followed deceased\u2019s unquestionable negligence in entering and blindly crossing a through highway without stopping, and that the collision was therefore caused solely by deceased\u2019s own fault.\nPer Kerwin J., dissenting: The evidence was such that no jury with a proper appreciation of their duties could make the finding they did. Further, the fact that the motorman, upon seeing the horse and wagon, took the precaution to \u201cfan\u201d his brakes is not evidence that he was negligent in not anticipating that deceased would cross the tracks in front of the on\u2011coming street car. The jury\u2019s finding that deceased was not guilty of negligence was perverse.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Roach J. upon the verdict of the jury at trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought to recover damages by reason of the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband as the result of a collision between a milk-wagon which he was driving and a street car of the defendant at about 8.30 a.m. on January 28, 1938, at the intersection of Dupont street and St. George street in the city of Toronto. The circumstances of the accident are set out and the evidence thereon discussed in the judgments now reported.\nThe plaintiff was the administratrix of the deceased\u2019s estate and sued to recover under the Fatal Accidents Act and also, on behalf of deceased\u2019s estate for deceased\u2019s loss of expectation of life, under the Trustee Act.\nThe case was tried before Roach J. and a special jury. The jury, in answers to questions submitted to them, found that the motorman of the street car was guilty of negligence that caused or contributed to the collision, in that\nthe evidence indicates that he was conscious of danger when he fanned his brakes and at that time did not bring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision with the milk-wagon.\nand that the deceased was not guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision. They assessed the damages of the plaintiff under the Fatal Accidents Act at $10,000 and under the Trustee Act (for the deceased\u2019s loss of expectation of life) at $5,000. Judgment was given for the plaintiff accordingly.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the action, holding that there was no reasonable evidence to support the finding against defendant\u2019s motorman, and that it did not constitute a finding of negligence in law, and that all the evidence indicated clearly that the deceased was guilty of negligence which was the proximate and effective cause of the accident[2].\nThe plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nR. Roy McMurtry and Ernest J.R. Wright for the appellant.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. and A.H. Young K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I do not read the jury\u2019s answer to question No. 2 as referring solely to the evidence of the motorman, or as founding the inference that the motorman was \u201cconscious of danger when he fanned his brakes\u201d upon the fact that he fanned his brakes alone, or upon the evidence of the motorman alone. I read it as stating an inference from the whole of the evidence.\nThe motorman says that, seeing the horse emerging into Dupont street, he fanned his brakes and threw off his power, or, as he also puts it, he \u201cimmediately checked\u201d his \u201cspeed and fanned\u201d his \u201cbrakes\u201d.\nThe jury evidently accepted as a fact that the motorman \u201cfanned his brakes\u201d. I think the fact that he did so in the circumstances mentioned, together with the circumstance that he gave this evidence, was something which the jury might take into account together with all the other facts in evidence in considering the question whether, when his attention was attracted to the horse and wagon, he did in fact become \u201cconscious of danger\u201d. The jury were not bound to accept the motorman\u2019s evidence as a whole, or to reject it as a whole. It was for them to decide whether the \u201cexcuse\u201d put forward by him was his real reason for not acting sooner, and if not, what significance was to be ascribed to his asseveration that he had no other \u201cexcuse\u201d.\nConsidering the motorman\u2019s admissions on cross-examination, together with the evidence of Miss McArthur, Mrs. Bateman and Edwards, there was evidence from which they might or might not conclude, according to their view of it, that the motorman realized what the deceased was doing, that is to say, that he was in the act of crossing the street, in time to avoid a collision if he acted with reasonable promptitude.\nEdwards\u2019 evidence is most important. He says the horse and wagon crossing Dupont street constituted an obstacle preventing him turning his car from Dupont street into St. George street, but at that time the street car was at such a distance, that it alone would have presented no obstacle to making this turn.\nIf the jury took the view, which I think they have expressed, that the motorman became aware of what the deceased was doing in time to enable him to bring his car under sufficient control to let the horse and wagon pass, and that his failure to do so was unreasonable and negligent, it was for them to say, on the whole evidence, whether notwithstanding the conduct of the deceased, the motorman\u2019s negligence was the sole cause of the accident and whether the deceased should be acquitted of contributory negligence in the legal sense (Calgary v. Harnovis[3]; Long v. Toronto Rly. Co.[4]; Loach\u2019s case[5]; Columbia Bitulithic v. B.C. Electric Rly.[6]; Leech v. Lethbridge[7]; Athonas v. Ottawa Electric Rly. Co.[8]; Nixon v. Ottawa Electric Rly. Co.[9])\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting)\u2014The evidence establishes beyond controversy that the emergency, out of which this tragic accident arose, was created by the negligence of the intestate himself in driving his horse and milk wagon from the south into a through east-west highway without stopping at the street line, when the windows of the wagon were so frosted as to prevent his seeing to the west, and then proceeding blindly to cross the street railway tracks when standing with his right foot on the outside step below the middle right side door and it was impossible for him to see the approaching eastbound tramcar, by which the wagon was hit and overturned.\nThe crucial issue between the parties as developed on the trial was as to whether, notwithstanding the indisputable negligence on the part of the intestate in entering and proceeding to cross Dupont street as he did, the tramcar motorman by the exercise of due care on his part could have avoided the collision. If he could have prevented it by exercising due care and failed to do so, his negligence in that regard would, of course, be its real and sole cause; otherwise the calamitous result would obviously be attributable only to the negligence of the deceased in creating an unavoidable danger. If the emergency were created by negligence on the part of both the intestate and the motorman and neither by exercising proper care could have avoided the result which followed, it would be a clear case of contributory negligence, and the jury\u2019s duty to apportion the damages under the provisions of the Negligence Act according to the degree of fault attach- ing to each. Only a valid unequivocal finding that the motorman, notwithstanding the negligence of the deceased in creating the danger, could by the exercise of due care have avoided colliding with the milk wagon would justify the fixing upon him of the sole responsibility for the unfortunate result.\nThe substantial question upon which, in my view, the decision of this appeal turns is whether or not such a finding of ultimate negligence against the motorman can in the light of the evidence be fairly and reasonably spelled out of the jury\u2019s answers to the three written questions which the learned trial judge submitted to them after conferring with the opposing counsel. These three questions and the answers thereto were as follows:\n1. Was the motorman guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision? Answer Yes or No.\nA. Yes.\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer fully.\nA. The evidence indicates that he was conscious of danger when he fanned his brakes and at that time did not bring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision with the milk wagon.\n3. Was the deceased Allen Sershall guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision? Answer Yes or No.\nA. No.\nThe important answer is the one to question 2, by which the jury purported to state what the particular negligence on the part of the motorman was that caused or contributed to the collision.\nAs knowledge of the motorman\u2019s own account of what transpired in relation to the operation of the tramcar and the movement of the horse and wagon immediately preceding the collision is so obviously essential in order to fully understand the import of this answer, I think the material features of his evidence should first be stated.\nThe tramcar had made its last stop at Huron street, which, according to the scale of the streets plan in evidence, is about 270 feet west of St. George street, measuring from curb to curb. The motorman says that when he left Huron street he went gradually from zero to about 18 to 20 miles per hour and attained his greatest speed (18 to 20 miles) when he was about half way to St. George street. When the front of the tramcar was 2\u00bd to 3 car lengths, roughly speaking, from the west sidewalk of St. George street (which would be from 112\u00bd to 135 feet), he first observed the horse and wagon on St. George street. The horse was then walking north on that street about 4 feet south of the south sidewalk of Dupont street, a shade to the east, as far as he could see, from the centre of St. George street. When he saw the horse approaching the Dupont street line he threw off his controller, i.e., shut off the power, \u201cstarted to brake (his) car up to check (his) speed\u201d\u2014fan his brakes, as he explained, and after slackening the car down sounded the gong. He estimated that immediately after shutting off the power and fanning the brakes his speed had been reduced to about 12 to 15 miles per hour. By this time, he said, the tram was about 1\u00bd car lengths from the west side of St. George street, (67\u00bd feet), as near as he could give it, not professing to state it exactly but only as his best judgment. At that moment the horse and wagon were coming up to the sidewalk (Dupont street), the horse\u2019s head being about the north edge of the Dupont street southerly sidewalk. There, he said, the horse started to turn east (on Dupont street) and proceeded in that direction until its head was jerked to the left by someone pulling the reins, when it \u201cpulled on the load and came across the track at a trot in a northwesterly direction.\u201d The horse\u2019s head when it was jerked and it started to trot, he estimated, was about 3 or 4 feet clear of the southerly rail of the street car track, which the plan shows is about 11\u00bd feet from the southerly curb at Dupont street. It seems to have been taken for granted by all that the length of the horse would be about 8 feet. At that moment, he testified, he was about a car length (practically 45 feet) from the path of the horse. Up to that moment, he swore, he had no indication whatever that the horse might cross the track. He immediately slapped the emergency on as fast as he humanly could and held it right over. While the car was slowing down the horse was coming across the track in a northwesterly direction at an angle in front of him and he said it was impossible for him to stop the car before he reached the path where the horse and wagon were crossing the track but that the car moved only about 1 or 2 feet after the impact, which took place between the front and rear wheels of the wagon, he thought about the middle of the wagon step. In cross-examination he was asked if it was not a fact that the only reason he had for not stopping sooner than he did was that the horse first turned to the east at the point where it did and answered that he had no other excuse. To a further question as to whether when he fanned his brakes he put a little pressure on the brake valve and dropped a little sand he answered \u201cNo.\u201d Asked if he could tell what his speed was when the car passed the west curb of St. George street or was approaching the west curb approximately, he said he could give a rough idea and imagined it was going about 4 miles per hour.\nThere seems to be no doubt that the collision occurred at or a little beyond the prolongation of the centre line of St. George street, which, according to the plan, measures 34 feet 6 inches.\nIt should be particularly noted that, according to the motorman\u2019s evidence, when he fanned his brakes he was about 2\u00bd to 3 car lengths or from 112\u00bd to 135 feet west of the west sidewalk of St. George street and that when he applied the emergency brake he was about a car length or 45 feet from the path of the horse, which at that moment, when its head was jerked and it started to trot to cross the track, was about 3 or 4 feet clear of the southerly rail.\nReverting now to the jury\u2019s answer to question 2, it is manifest in the first place that it involves the acceptance of the motorman\u2019s evidence regarding the fanning of his brakes when he first observed the horse walking north on St. George street about 4 feet south of the south line of Dupont street. It implies also, to my mind, that the mere fact that he fanned his brakes at that time established that he must have then become conscious of some danger, which made it his immediate duty to bring his car under such control that it could be stopped in time to avoid a collision in case he should find that the driver of the horse and milk wagon was actually going to take the risk of crossing the street car track in front of him. Indeed, the whole finding, it seems to me, is founded upon that assumption and would, if there were no other objection to it, be invalid as consonant with neither legal principles nor common sense.\nSurely it cannot reasonably be assumed that at any time a motorman driving a tramcar along a through high- way in such a city as Toronto sees from a distance of 112 to 135 feet a vehicle approaching the street line, he must take it for granted that the vehicle is actually going to cross the tram line without stopping, and at once bring his car under such control that it could be instantly stopped if this should actually turn out to be the case. If this finding, so obviously based upon that assumption, is to be recognized as a valid finding of negligence, it is difficult to see how the ever-increasing public demand for rapid transit in our larger cities can be satisfactorily met by street car systems at all. In any such case there is surely more likelihood of the vehicle turning right than there is of its entering the through street in flagrant violation of both the city by-law and the provincial Highway Traffic Act and proceeding without stopping at all directly across the tram car line regardless of the latter\u2019s dominant right of way.\nIn the case at bar the motorman swore that when the horse reached the southerly line of Dupont street it started to go round the corner to the right when it was suddenly jerked to the left by a pull of the reins and instantly was within about 3 or 4 feet of the southerly rail. Then and then only, according to his evidence, was it that he realized that the horse and wagon were going improperly to cross the track and it was at that moment that he applied the emergency brake.\nThe answer to question 2 which, as I have said, indicates an acceptance of the motorman\u2019s evidence as to the fanning of his brakes, cannot, in my opinion, having regard to the entire testimony, fairly be taken as involving a rejection of the motorman\u2019s statement that the horse on reaching the corner of the curb started turning east. In this connection a witness for the plaintiff, Lloyd, another milk delivery driver of the same company, disclosed in cross\u2011examination that the deceased sometimes in the course of his morning rounds had coffee with him at a restaurant on the south side of Dupont street about 150 to 200 feet east of St. George street and that usually when they came to the restaurant for coffee they left their horses around the corner on Davenport street, 25 or 30 feet away, where they were given something to eat. When asked, however, if this occurred more or less regularly, he replied, \u201cNot regularly, no.\u201d It is difficult to conceive what stronger confirmation there could be of the motorman\u2019s statement about the horse starting to turn east or how a jury, conscious of its duty to find a true verdict according to the evidence, could ignore this significant fact, disclosed by one of the plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses, and reject the positive statement of the motorman merely because the only other witness, who was specifically asked about it (Miss Rumsey, a passenger on the street car), said she did not notice the horse starting to turn east, though she did see the reins jerked and the horse hurried across the track. To anyone at all familiar with the peculiarly knowledgeable habits of horses constantly employed on regular delivery routes the fact disclosed by Lloyd would, I should think, commend itself as almost infallible proof of the horse\u2019s tendency and desire to turn east at this particular corner towards the restaurant and the place where it was frequently provided with food. I am not disposed, therefore, to read into this dubious answer, which the jury made to question 2, a rejection of the motorman\u2019s evidence that he saw the horse starting to turn east\u2014a fact which would surely seem to afford a much more convincing explanation of the real danger with which the motorman was confronted when he so suddenly and alertly applied his emergency brake than the highly improbable hypothesis that it was apparent to him even before the horse entered Dupont street that its driver was going to pay no attention either to the city by-law or the provincial statute or to the tramcar\u2019s undoubted right of way and take the risk of crossing ahead of him.\nThe answer not only contradicts the assumption, upon which it is so obviously based, but it is, in my opinion, manifestly inconsistent in itself. While it plainly implies that the actual cause of the collision was the motorman\u2019s inability to stop his car in time to avoid hitting the milk wagon, the only negligence it finds against him in that connection is that \u201cwhen he fanned his brakes\u201d he did not then \u201cbring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision.\u201d If this means anything it means that the necessity of the motorman\u2019s having to stop his car at all was not apparent when he fanned his brakes and did not become apparent until it was too late to avoid the collision. That surely is not a valid finding of negligence against the motorman either causing or contributing to the collision. No doubt if the motorman had disabled himself by a prior negligent act or omission from stopping his car by the use of his emergency brake his antecedent negligence might well be linked with his inability to thus stop the car as the proximate cause of the collision. But how could he reasonably be said to be guilty of any negligence at all when he fanned his brakes after shutting off his power and reduced his admittedly moderate speed of 18 to 20 miles per hour to 12 or 15 miles per hour if at that time there was no reason for him to anticipate that the use of the emergency brake to avoid a collision would be necessary at all? The \u201cdanger\u201d of which the jury found him to be conscious at that time, was quite apparently the mere possibility that the milk delivery driver might venture across the street and the railway line ahead of the approaching tramcar in defiance of the provisions of the city by-law and the provincial statute and the tramcar\u2019s right of way. The real danger with which the motorman was confronted when he applied the emergency brake was the eventual occurrence of this extraordinary and naturally unexpected and remote contingency. It was then impossible for him to avoid the collision, as the finding of the jury so clearly implies.\nFor the reasons which already, I think, sufficiently appear, I have concluded that the answer to question 3, by which the jury completely exonerated the intestate from all blame for the collision, is wholly unjustified. I agree with the appeal court that the finding must in the circumstances be considered perverse.\nThe only verdict reasonably possible upon the undisputed facts disclosed in the evidence and upon those portions of the motorman\u2019s own testimony, which the jury must upon a fair interpretation of their answer to question 2 be taken to have accepted, was that the motorman could not by the exercise of reasonable care and skill have avoided the unfortunate result, which followed the deceased\u2019s unquestionable negligence in entering and blindly crossing a through highway without stopping, and that the collision therefore was caused solely by the deceased\u2019s own fault.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs if demanded. DAVIS J.\u2014This was a case of a collision between a street car and a horse-driven milk wagon at the corner of Dupont and St. George streets in the City of Toronto. The driver of the milk wagon was killed and this action was brought by his widow as administratrix against the Toronto Transportation Commission for damages, alleging negligence in the operation of the street car which was owned and operated by the Commission. The plaintiff claimed damages under The Fatal Accidents Act on behalf of dependents and also damages under The Trustee Act on behalf of the deceased\u2019s estate for loss of expectation of life.\nThe case was essentially one of fact. It was tried with a special jury in Toronto. The jury not only heard a great deal of testimony from eye-witnesses, but they visited the locus and went to the street car barns and inspected and examined the street car in question, and they also inspected and examined the particular milk wagon. This was done, not only in the presence of the solicitors for both parties, but apparently with their full support. Each, no doubt, expected to gain by this procedure and in fact they raise no complaint now. I should not care to be taken, however, as approving the practice of a jury of twelve spending, as we were told by counsel during the argument, most of a morning during the course of a trial visiting different places and making inspections and examinations of their own. They are very apt to become separated in little groups and to discuss different angles of the case among themselves in groups. I cannot see any real difference between such a practice in a civil from that of a criminal case, and would refer to the observations in the Privy Council in a judgment delivered recently by Lord Roche in the criminal case of Seneviratne v. The King[10]. It was there said, at p. 51, that it is clear that precautions must be taken to secure that everything done upon such a view being had must be absolutely fair and impartial, and that no questions must be asked and answered in the absence of the other party, and that the jury must, as far as possible, be kept together and not be given the opportunity of discussing the matter in groups or making separate experiments in the matter of sounds, etc. I merely refer to this aspect of the trial of the present case so that it may not be taken that I approve of the practice adopted. But it was adopted; it is not suggested that it was not at the request of both parties. At any rate, it was not made the ground of any objection.\nThe jury found that the operator of the street car was solely to blame. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment entered upon the verdict on the ground that, in their opinion, there was no reasonable evidence to support the finding against the defendant\u2019s motorman and that it does not constitute a finding of negligence in law and that all the evidence indicates clearly that the deceased was guilty of negligence which was the proximate and effective cause of the unfortunate casualty which resulted in his death. From that judgment appeal has been taken to this Court.\nIt is not permissible for us to analyze all the conflicting evidence in the case in an endeavour to come to our own conclusions on the facts. It is not our duty or our right to re-try the case; the special jury was in this case the tribunal of fact. We have only to ask ourselves whether or not the jury, acting reasonably and justly, could have reached the conclusion they did upon the evidence.\nI am satisfied that if the jury accepted, as I think they must have accepted, the evidence of Miss McArthur and others who corroborated her on vital points, they could very fairly and reasonably have arrived at the conclusion they did. While there is a great deal of conflicting evidence, there was evidence upon which the jury was entitled to conclude, as they did, that the direct cause of the death of the driver of the milk wagon was not any act of negligence on his part but the failure of the operator of the street car\u2014seeing the horse and wagon in the path of his car\u2014to reduce the speed of the car at a time and to such an extent that the collision would have been avoided.\nMiss McArthur was a passenger in the street car and had a full view of the situation which confronted the motorman. She was sitting very near the vestibule of the car and was looking out the front windows of the car. She appears to have seen everything that the motorman himself saw or ought to have seen. The accident happened about eight-thirty o\u2019clock in the morning. Miss McArthur was on her way to her work. She was a graduate of the University of Toronto and had taken a teachers\u2019 course at the Ontario College of Education but was at the time secretary to Mr. R.S. Robertson, K.C. (now the Chief Justice of Ontario). She was a well-educated, intelligent young woman, and one can quite understand any jury accepting her story as perhaps more exact than that of some other witnesses.\nIt was cold\u2014zero weather; the street car was travelling easterly on Dupont street (on the southerly tracks); the horse and wagon had entered Dupont street from St. George street on the south; milk had been delivered at the house on the southeast corner of Dupont and St. George streets. When Miss McArthur first saw the horse and wagon they were \u201cjust entering Dupont street\u201d from St. George. The horse was out on Dupont street; she did not think it had then reached the car tracks but was only a few feet from them. The driver of the milk wagon, she says, was evidently in the act of making a left-hand turn. The horse and wagon was the only object moving in or about the intersection. The glass windows in the milk wagon were completely frosted and closed. There was nothing to obstruct in any way the view of the motorman. The front of the street car was then, Miss McArthur says, half-way between Huron and St. George streets. The motorman said that as near as he could describe it, when he first observed the horse and wagon the front of his car was two and a half to three car lengths from the west sidewalk of St. George street. Miss McArthur says the motorman did not slow down\u2014there was no perceptible diminution of speed. \u201cWe came very close to the wagon and the wagon seemed to clear\u2014the instant before we hit, he (the motorman) jammed on his brakes very suddenly. I would say that with a fraction of a second more, we would have cleared the milk wagon.\u201d Miss McArthur says that she could see it (i.e., the horse and wagon) herself \u201cfor some time before we hit it.\u201d She says the motorman \u201cfinally\u201d acted quickly, but \u201che didn\u2019t act soon enough. * * * He jammed on his brakes very quickly.\u201d She did not hear any gong sounded. The effect of the evidence of Miss McArthur is that the motorman had a full view of the horse and wagon in a position of danger and did not slow down his speed until it was too late.\nMr. Geoffrey Edwards, a partner in the firm of Edwards, Morgan & Co., of Toronto, Chartered Accountants, was motoring down town on the morning of the accident; he had come down Poplar Plains road from St. Clair avenue and had turned west on to Dupont street in order to proceed down town via St. George street. St. George street does not extend north beyond Dupont street. He had only a short block to go on Dupont street from Poplar Plains road before he could turn down St. George street. On Dupont street he was travelling in the opposite direction to that of the street car, and therefore had a view of the accident from a position opposite to that of Miss McArthur in the street car. He said that after he had gone along Dupont street \u201ca few feet, not very far along,\u201d he saw the street car \u201cdown in the distance, some distance down the track, and I saw a milk cart either entering or about to enter the intersection of St. George and Dupont streets.\u201d He proceeded along Dupont street a little farther west and then stopped on the northerly pair of street car rails. He stopped his car, he says, \u201cabout fifty odd feet from where the accident happened.\u201d He observed at that time that \u201cthe street car was coming towards me and the milk wagon was crossing from St. George street, making a curve to the left, apparently to go west on Dupont street.\u201d The milk wagon, he says, was \u201calmost clear of the north rail\u201d (obviously he means of the two southerly rails on which the street car was travelling easterly) \u201cwhen the street car struck it.\u201d He was asked in cross-examination:\nQ. When you arrived at the east side of St. George street, the street car was so near the intersection that you didn\u2019t consider it prudent to try to pass in front of it?\nAnd his answer was:\nA. As a matter of fact, my reaction was that the milk wagon was the chief obstacle in the way of my getting around. * * * Had it not been for the milk wagon I could have made my turn. It might have been running it slightly close with the street car, but I couldn\u2019t say.\nHaving seen the street car, as he said, \u201cdown in the distance\u201d and that the milk wagon was the chief obstacle which made him stop his car before turning into St. George street, the plain inference was open to the jury that there was a considerable distance at that time separating the milk wagon from the approaching street car.\nMiss Rumsey, who was the only eye-witness of the accident except the motorman called by the respondent, was a passenger in the street car. She was sitting on one of the cross seats which are some distance back from the vestibule of the car. She says that, judging from the speed of the street car, she would expect it \u201ccould stop pretty quickly.\u201d Having seen the horse and wagon, she said she \u201clooked to see what the motorman was doing.\u201d\nQ. And when did you look to see what the motorman was doing?\nA. Well, when I realized that the horse was going to keep on coming through.\nQ. You realized that the horse was going to keep on coming through and you wanted to see what the motorman was going to do?\nA. Yes.\nAs to the motorman\u2019s statement that he thought that the horse and wagon were going to turn east on Dupont street rather than attempt to cross, she was asked this question:\nWas there any indication of any kind to you that it was going to turn east, from your observation?\nTo which she answered:\nI didn\u2019t think so. I thought it was coming straight on through.\nThe evidence of the motorman was that he \u201cfanned the brakes\u201d at a point when the street car was about one and a half car lengths from the west side of St. George street, \u201cas near as I could give it. I am not stating it exactly.\u201d\nIn the case of The Eurymedon[11], Lord Justice Greer laid down several rules at pp. 49-50. It is sufficient if I quote two of these rules. The first is this:\n(i) If, as I think was the case in Davies v. Mann[12], one of the parties in a common law action actually knows from observation the negligence of the other party, he is solely responsible if he fails to exercise reasonable care towards the negligent plaintiff.\nAnd the second rule is this:\n(ii) Rule No. (i) also applies where one party is not in fact aware of the other party\u2019s negligence if he could by reasonable care have become aware of it, and could by exercising reasonable care have avoided causing damage to the other negligent party. After some discussion with counsel at the conclusion of his charge, the trial judge recalled the jury and explained to them contributory negligence at some length. No objection was taken by counsel for the respondent to what was then said by the learned judge. In part he said:\nIn other words, negligence that has no relation to, or was not a factor contributing to, the collision simply has no place in our consideration. The negligence that you may find must be negligence that caused or contributed to the collision.\nThe jury found that the motorman was guilty of negligence that caused the collision:\u2014\nThe evidence indicates that he was conscious of danger when he fanned his brakes and at that time did not bring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision with the milk wagon.\nThe jury also found specifically that the deceased driver of the milk wagon was not guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision. They might have found the deceased driver of the milk wagon guilty of contributory negligence, but that was for them to say. They might have taken what may appear to others to be a broad common-sense view of the case that both parties contributed to the result; but that is not to say that they were not entitled to regard the two negligences as successive rather than simultaneous. They were carefully and fully directed upon that aspect of the case. Although lack of care on the part of the deceased driver of the milk wagon was closely relevant to the inquiry, the vital question was: Whose negligence was the direct cause of the collision? And the special jury were the tribunal of fact.\nThe verdict of a jury should not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it. The jury in this case were entitled on the evidence to find as they did that the defendant was solely to blame.\nCounsel for the respondent contended that in assessing the damages under the Trustee Act and the Fatal Accidents Act, the effect of the jury\u2019s verdict is to allow the plaintiff a duplication of damages. Mr. Justice Gillanders pointed out in his judgment in the Court of Appeal that the learned trial judge had charged the jury that there must be no overlapping of damages, and after illustrating to the jury how that might come about he had pointed out to them that in determining the plaintiff\u2019s loss under the Fatal Accidents Act they must take into consideration the benefits that would accrue to her under the Trustee Act, and consequently, the jury having been specifically instructed to avoid duplication, the assessment of damages was not open to attack on that ground.\nThe accident had occurred and the action had been commenced before sec. 3 of The Trustee Amendment Act, 1938, 2 Geo. VI, ch. 44, had been enacted on April 8th, 1938. That amendment to subsec. (1) of sec. 37 of the Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 165, provided\nthat if death results from such injuries no damages shall be allowed for the death or for the loss of the expectation of life, but this proviso shall not be in derogation of any rights conferred by The Fatal Accidents Act.\nCounsel for the respondent further contended that there had been an election by the plaintiff to take compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and that the learned trial judge erred in refusing to admit further evidence in that regard. The point was carefully considered in the Court of Appeal and that Court agreed with the trial judge that the evidence did not establish that the plaintiff had made any election as contemplated by the Act, and with that I entirely agree.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting)\u2014The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal by the defendant, the Toronto Transportation Commission, from the judgment of Roach J. entered against the Commission upon the verdict of a special jury, and dismissed the action. The basis of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, as expressed by Mr. Justice Gillanders, is that there was no reasonable evidence to support the finding of the jury against the Commission\u2019s motorman. The plaintiff now appeals.\nIn answer to question No. 2, the jury found that the respondent\u2019s motorman was guilty of negligence, which they explained as follows:\u2014\nThe evidence indicates that he was conscious of danger when he fanned his brakes and at that time did not bring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision with the milk wagon. Each case must be determined upon its own circumstances, and without detailing the evidence, I am of opinion that it is such that no twelve men with a proper appreciation of their obligations and duties could make the finding set out above. Furthermore, in my opinion the fact that the motorman, upon seeing the horse and wagon, took the precaution to \u201cfan\u201d his brakes is not evidence that he was negligent in not anticipating that the deceased would drive across the south part of Dupont street and into the path of the oncoming street car. The finding of the jury that the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence is in itself perverse and confirms my view that the answer to the second question is such that no jury doing their duty could have returned.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, if demanded.\nHUDSON J.\u2014This action was tried before Mr. Justice Roach and a jury. On application of the defendants the jury was a \u201cspecial jury\u201d and to this extent the defendants chose their own forum. The evidence was very lengthy and contradictory. From the record it appears that the jurors displayed a keen and intelligent interest in the facts and in the law applicable thereto. They also examined the situs and the vehicles concerned in the accident. After a charge to the jury to which no exception is taken by the defendants, they brought in a verdict that the defendant\u2019s motorman was guilty of negligence, that caused or contributed to the collision. The answers of the jury were as follows:\n1. Was the motorman guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision? Answer Yes or No.\nA. Yes.\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer fully.\nA. The evidence indicates that he was conscious of danger when he fanned his brakes and at that time did not bring his car under such control that it could have been stopped, if necessary, in time to have avoided the collision with the milk wagon.\n3. Was the deceased Allen Sershall guilty of any negligence that caused or contributed to the collision? Answer Yes or No.\nA. No.\nOn this finding a judgment was entered against the defendants for $15,000 damages. This verdict was set aside by the Court of Appeal.\nThe duty of a court of appeal when asked to reverse the decision of a trial tribunal has been the subject of much discussion in the courts during recent years but, at the risk of repetition, I will quote two statements which, although given in appeals from a trial judge, apply with even greater force to an appeal where the tribunal of fact, as here, was a special jury.\nIn Clarke v. Edinburgh and District Tramways Co.[13], Lord Shaw of Dunfermline said:\nWhen a Judge hears and sees witnesses and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence, that judgment is entitled to great respect, and that quite irrespective of whether the Judge makes any observation with regard to credibility or not. I can of course quite understand a Court of Appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the Judge has announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses, having seen them and heard them, and does not believe another. But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a Court of justice. In Courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more evenly divided; witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their demeanour, in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the eyelid, left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page. What in such circumstances, thus psychologically put, is the duty of an appellate Court? In my opinion, the duty of an appellate Court in those circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, Am I\u2014who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case\u2014in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.\nThe present is a street accident case without any undue complications, and I do not see any reason for departing from this ordinary, simple, salutary rule. In the judgments of the Court below I have some doubt whether sufficient stock has been taken of this doctrine, or whether sufficient deference has been paid to the judgment of the learned Lord Ordinary.\nand Lord Macmillan in the case of Powell v. Streatham[14], himself quoting Lord Loreburn, Lord Chancellor, in Kinloch v. Young[15], stated:\nBut this House and other Courts of appeal have always to remember that the Judge of first instance has had the opportunity of watching the demeanour of witnesses\u2014that he observes, as we cannot observe, the drift and conduct of the case; and also that he has impressed upon him by hearing every word the scope and nature of the evidence in a way that is denied to any Court of appeal. Even the most minute study by a Court of appeal fails to produce the same vivid appreciation of what the witnesses say or what they omit to say. In the present case the Court of Appeal for Ontario, after reviewing the evidence, came to the conclusion that the verdict of the jury was clearly wrong. With respect, I cannot agree with their view. It seems to me that there was evidence on the record, if taken together with what may well have been unspoken impressions properly influencing their minds and taking into account the special qualifications of the jurors here, they could reasonably come to the conclusion at which they arrived. I do not feel that I would be justified in approving of a reversal of their finding and would, therefore, set aside the judgment in appeal and restore the judgment in the court below, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chitty, McMurtry, Ganong & Wright.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Irving S.

Under the provisions of the Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929 , the Governor in Council was authorized to \u201cprovide for the construction and completion by the Canadian National Railway Company * * * of terminal stations and offices\u201d etc.; and, more particularly, of viaducts, elevated railways and grade separations between certain streets, mentioned in the Act, situated in the city of Montreal. By order of the 27th of June, 1929, the Governor General in Council provided for \u201ccertain terminal facilities, grade separation and other works\u201d in the city of Montreal, as shown upon plans mentioned in the Order in Council; and for the execution of those works, orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners were required in respect of grade separation at street crossings. These orders were applied for by the appellant company and made. As the latter company proceeded with these works, the removal of plant and equipment of the respondents was found from time to time to be necessary; and orders to such effect were accordingly obtained from the Board, the question of the allocation of the costs involved in carrying out the orders being reserved for further consideration by the Board. By a subsequent order of the Board, now under appeal to this Court, it was directed that the appellant should \u201creimburse the respondents for their reasonable and necessary expenditure incurred and paid in the removal and replacement of their facilities\u201d necessitated by reason of the construction of the works authorized by the several orders of the Board. Leave to appeal to this Court was given by the Board to the appellants in respect of certain questions (contained in full in the judgment now reported) which, in the opinion of the Board, \u201cinvolve questions of law,\u201d but the order did not state that these questions were \u201cin the opinion of the Board * * * questions of law.\u201d\nHeld, dismissing the appeal from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners, that there is no rule or principle of law inconsistent with the findings and decisions of the Board to which the questions relate.\nHeld, also, that the questions submitted by the order of the Board were, ex facie, not questions of law.\nOn the assumption that the questions should be read in the following sense: Are the rulings of the Board to which the questions relate inconsistent with any rule of law by which the Board is bound as such?\nAccording to the opinion of the majority of the Board, the works authorized by it, the execution of which necessitated the expenditures to be allocated, were incidental or subsidiary to the primary and controlling purpose of reconstituting the terminal facilities of the appellant; and accordingly, the majority of the Board held that, under a rule upon which the Board had habitually acted in the allocation of costs in analogous cases, such costs ought to be borne by the appellant company.\nHeld that the question whether the Board in a given case has properly appreciated its own rule of practice, or the consideration upon which that rule is based, cannot be a question of law within the meaning of section 52 (3) of the Railway Act, nor can the question, whether in a given case the Board has properly appreciated the facts for the purpose of applying the rule, be a question of law. APPEAL, by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners, from an order made by the Board on May 19th, 1937, which directed the appellant to pay the respondents the expense incurred by them pursuant to orders of the Board in adjusting their telephone and electric light and power plant and equipment to certain works of grade separation carried out by the appellant under orders of the Board at the following street crossings in the city of Montreal: Mountain, Guy, St. Remi, Charlevoix and Hibernia. The appeal is on the following questions which in the opinion of the Board involved questions of law:\n1. Whether the Board was right in holding that the effect of the Canadian National-Montreal Terminals Act, 1929 , was to merge the whole question of grade separation in the general scheme for improvement and rearrangement of the railways\u2019 terminal facilities in Montreal.\n2. Whether there was evidence to justify the Board\u2019s opinion and finding that the \u201cprotection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d was not the paramount consideration for the works at the crossings in question, but that they were undertaken as part of a comprehensive scheme for the readjustment and improvement of the terminal facilities of the railway in the city of Montreal.\n3. Whether there was evidence to justify the Board\u2019s opinion and finding that the paramount purpose of the works at Guy, Mountain, St. Remi, Charlevoix and Hibernia street crossings was not the \u201cprotection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d within the meaning of the rule as to the allocation of costs laid down in the case of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Company et al.[1], and other decisions of the Board.\nI. C. Rand K.C. for appellant.\nP. Beullac K.C. and N. A. Munnoch for the respondent The Bell Telephone Company of Canada.\nH. Hansard for the respondent The Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014This is an appeal by the Canadian National Railways Company by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners from an order of the Board of the 19th of May, 1937, in respect of questions which the Board declares by its order, in the opinion of the Board, involve questions of law.\nIt is convenient, first of all, to state in a summary way the circumstances and the nature of the application upon which the order of the Board proceeded and the character of the questions raised by the controversy between the parties. By the Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929 , the Governor in Council was authorized to\nprovide for the construction and completion by the Canadian National Railways Company (hereinafter called the Company) of terminal stations and offices, local stations, station grounds, yards, tracks, terminal facilities, power houses, pipes, wires and conduits for any purpose, bridges, viaducts, tunnels, subways, branch and connecting lines and tracks, buildings and structures of every description and for any purpose, and improvements, works, plants, apparatus and appliances for the movement, handling or convenient accommodation of every kind of traffic, also street and highway diversions and widenings, new streets and highways, subway and overhead streets, and also approaches, lanes, alleyways, and other means of passage, with the right to acquire or to take under the provisions of section nine of this Act or otherwise lands and interest in lands for all such purposes, all on the Island of Montreal in the Province of Quebec, or on the mainland adjacent thereto, as shown generally on the plan or plans thereof to be from time to time approved by the Governor in Council under the provisions of section seven of this Act; the whole being hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe said works,\u201d and a short description whereof for the information of Parliament but not intended to be exhaustive, being set out in the schedule hereto.\nSubsections (b), (d), (e) and (\u0192) of the schedule, with which the order of the Board is particularly concerned, are as follows:\n(b) Viaduct and elevated railway between Inspector and Dalhousie Streets, and St. David\u2019s Lane and Nazareth Street to near Wellington Street, and thence along Wellington Street to Point St. Charles Yard and Victoria Bridge, crossing over existing streets, and with connections to existing railway facilities and Harbour Commissioners\u2019 trackage;\n(d) Grade separation by means of elevated, or depressed, or underground tracks, or streets, as may be determined on the existing railway between Bonaventure and Turcot and connection to the viaduct referred to in paragraph (b);\n(e) Grade separation by means of elevated, or depressed, or underground tracks, or streets, as may be determined between St. Henri and Point St. Charles;\n(\u0192) Railway from Longue Pointe yard to the North west and thence Southwest to connect with the existing railway at and near Eastern Junction.\nBy section 3, the Company was authorized to issue securities in respect of the construction and completion of the works authorized on the guarantee of the Government of Canada to an amount not exceeding $50,000,000. By order of the 27th of June, 1929, the Governor General in Council provided, under the authority of this statute (which I shall refer to as the Terminals Act) for \u201ccertain terminal facilities, grade separation and other works\u201d as shown upon plans mentioned in the Order in Council; and for the execution of those works orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners were required in respect of grade separation at street crossings. These were applied for by the Company and made.\nAs the Company proceeded with these works, the removal of plant and equipment of the respondents was found from time to time to be necessary; and orders to such effect were accordingly obtained from the Board. In each case the order provided that the question of the allocation of the costs involved in carrying out the order should be reserved for further consideration by the Board.\nBy the order now under appeal, it was directed that the appellants should\nreimburse the respondents for their reasonable and necessary expenditure incurred and paid in the removal and replacement of their facilities\nnecessitated by reason of the construction of the works authorized by the several orders of the Board.\nThe question for determination by the Board was, of course, whether the costs with which this order deals should be borne by the appellants or wholly or in part by the respondents. And the general principle by which the Board conceived itself to be governed in determining that question is lucidly stated by the learned Chief Commissioner in the following passages from his judgment:\nThe general principle upon which the Board has acted for many years may be briefly stated as follows: When an application is made for grade separation by a railway company, or by a municipality, either for the greater convenience or facility of the applicant in the movement of traffic or for the rearrangement of streets and which may ultimately result in affording greater protection and safety to the public who use the crossing, the Board deems that the matter of greater convenience or improved facility to the applicant constitutes the main purpose of the application, and that improved crossing protection is merely incidental to the main purpose. In such cases where the removal of the plant and equipment of utility companies is ordered, the cost of such removal is placed upon the applicant. Upon the other hand, where the paramount reason for grade separation appears to be the protection, safety, and convenience of the public in the use of the crossing, and where the removal of the plant and equipment of utility companies becomes necessary, the Board has decided in many cases that under such circumstances the cost of removal and erection of equipment should be borne by the utility companies. While it is true that utility companies neither create nor aggravate the danger at grade crossings, nor do they benefit from grade separation, the Board has always considered that where the project is in reality pro bono publico, utility companies should bear the expense of moving their plant and equipment for the free use of streets enjoyed by them.\n* * *\nIn my opinion the first question to be decided in regard to these applications is whether the work performed by the railway was essentially designed for the protection and convenience of the public at the various grade crossings in the city of Montreal which were affected by the general scheme, or whether the whole work was not one designed for the readjustment and improvement of the terminal facilities of the railway company in the city of Montreal. If the work was designed essentially for the purpose of grade crossing protection, in my opinion, following the authorities upon the subject and the general practice in such matters of this Board, the applicants cannot reasonably claim to be reimbursed for the cost of removal of their plant and equipment from the streets affected. They should each be called upon to contribute the cost of such removal for the purpose of granting protection and safety to the public at grade crossings. But, on the other hand, if the paramount purpose of the scheme authorized by the Act above referred to was the readjustment and improvement of the terminal facilities of the railway company in Montreal, the protection at grade crossings being only incidental to the general purpose, then I consider that, under the authorities and the practice of this Board, the railway company should pay the cost of the removal of plant and equipment as a part of the cost of the work authorized by Parliament.\nThe conclusion is stated as follows:\nMy view of the situation in regard to the questions which arise in the present applications is that the protection, safety and convenience of the public was not the paramount consideration which caused these works to be undertaken, but that they were undertaken, as stated in the judgment of the Privy Council, as a part of a comprehensive scheme for the readjustment and improvement of the terminal facilities of the railway in the city of Montreal. Any protection of railway crossings which might ultimately result from the carrying out of the work was purely incidental to the general scheme. It may have been to some extent a contributing factor but it certainly was not the paramount consideration.\nI think the whole terminal scheme should be considered as a single definite project for the betterment of the railway terminal facilities in Montreal. The estimates submitted covered the whole undertaking. The whole work was to be financed by the railway under the provisions of the Terminals Act, save in respect of contributions which might be made as provided in sections 7 and 8 of the Act.\nIn my opinion each of the applicants is entitled to be reimbursed for its reasonable and necessary expenditure incurred and paid in the removal and replacement of its facilities pursuant to the orders made from time to time by the Board. I think the applicants are also entitled to be paid interest upon the various amounts expended by them from the date of such payments until the date of repayment at the rate of 3\u00bd per cent per annum. The appeal, as already observed, comes before us in virtue of an order of the Board giving to the appellants leave to appeal in respect of certain questions which, in the opinion of the Board, \u201cinvolve questions of law.\u201d Before coming to an examination of the questions, it is convenient to advert to certain legal considerations.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners in respect of the works provided for by the Terminals Act was settled by a judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirming a judgment of this Court in Bell Telephone Co. v. Canadian National Railways[2]. In that judgment the contention was rejected that the sections of the Railway Act dealing with highway crossings were displaced by the Terminals Act. Lord Macmillan, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said (at p. 573):\nThe fact of the matter is that the purpose of the Terminals Act was to give Parliamentary sanction to the scheme as a whole and to provide means for raising the necessary capital * * * These essentials being secured by the Act, everything else is left to be worked out by the already existing machinery available for the purpose.\nThe Board of Railway Commissioners is a statutory court, but it succeeded to all the powers, authorities and duties of its predecessor, the Railway Committee of the Privy Council; and it is endowed with legislative powers (powers which in their nature are legislative) as well as large administrative powers.\nIt having been decided by the judgment mentioned (Bell Telephone Co. v. Canadian National Railways2) that the works provided for by the Terminals Act and the subsequent Order in Council are subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the Board of Railway Commissioners, and particularly to the powers of the Board under sections 39, 256, 257, and 259, it follows, and this is not at all disputed, that the Board had jurisdiction under the second subsection of section 39 to deal with the subject of the allocation of costs in question before it.\nAs Lord Macmillan observed in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Canadian Pacific Railway v. Toronto Transportation Commission[3], section 39 is obviously an administrative provision. The whole passage is important and should be quoted verbatim:\nSection 39 does not indicate any criterion by which it may be determined whether a person is interested in or affected by an order of the Railway Board. It does not even prescribe that the interest must be beneficial or that the affection must not be injurious. The topic has in a number of cases in the Canadian Courts been much discussed but inevitably little elucidated. Where the matter is left so much at large, practical considerations of common sense must be applied, especially in dealing with what is obviously an administrative provision.\nThese observations are concerned with the effect of the first paragraph of section 39, but they are also applicable to the second paragraph. It is equally true that the last mentioned paragraph affords no criterion or rule or canon by which the Board is to be guided in allocating costs. Its jurisdiction is restricted in two respects: first, where it is otherwise expressly provided the Board is not competent to act; and, second, orders under this subsection can only be made\non a company, municipality or person interested in or affected by the order directing the works\n(Toronto v. Toronto[4]; Canadian Pacific Railway v. Toronto Transportation Commission[5]).\nSubject to this, the Board is invested by the statute with jurisdiction and charged with responsibility in respect of such orders. The law dictates neither the order to be made in a given case nor the considerations by which the Board is to be guided in arriving at the conclusion that an order, or what order, is necessary or proper in a given case. True, it is the duty of all public bodies and others invested with statutory powers to act reasonably in the execution of them, but the policy of the statue is that, subject to the appeal to the Governor in Council under section 52, in exercising an administrative discretion entrusted to it, the Board itself is to be the final arbiter as to the order to be made.\nTurning now to the questions in respect of which leave to appeal was given. The order is that the Canadian National Railways are\ngranted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada * * * upon the following questions which, in the opinion of the Board, involve questions of law, viz.: 1. Whether the Board was right in holding that the effect of the Canadian National Montreal Terminals Act, 1929 , was to merge the whole question of grade separation in the general scheme for improvement and rearrangement of the railway\u2019s terminal facilities in Montreal.\n2. Whether there was evidence to justify the Board\u2019s opinion and finding that the \u201cprotection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d was not the paramount consideration for the works at the crossings in question, but that they were undertaken as part of a comprehensive scheme for the readjustment and improvement of the terminal facilities of the railway in the city of Montreal.\n3. Whether there was evidence to justify the Board\u2019s opinion and finding that the paramount purpose of the works at Guy, Mountain, St. Remi, Charlevoix, and Hibernia Street crossings was not the \u201cprotection, safety and convenience of the public\u201d within the meaning of the rule as to the allocation of costs laid down in the case of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Company et al.[6], and other decisions of the Board.\nThis order is made under the authority of section 52 (3) which is in these words:\n3. An appeal shall also lie from the Board to such Court upon any question which in the opinion of the Board is a question of law, or a question of jurisdiction, or both, upon leave therefor having been first obtained from the Board * * * and after notice to the opposite party stating the grounds of appeal; and the granting of such leave shall be in the discretion of the Board.\nIt will be observed that the order does not state that the questions in respect of which leave to appeal is granted are questions of law in the opinion of the Board. The order declares that \u201cthey involve the questions of law.\u201d\nThe phrase \u201cquestion of law\u201d which the Legislature has employed in this enactment is prima facie a technical phrase well understood by lawyers. So construed \u201cquestion of law\u201d would include (without attempting anything like an exhaustive definition which would be impossible) questions touching the scope, effect or application of a rule of law which the courts apply in determining the rights of parties; and by long usage, the term \u201cquestion of law\u201d has come to be applied to questions which, when arising at a trial by a judge and jury, would fall exclusively to the judge for determination; for example, questions touching the construction of documents and a great variety of others including questions whether, in respect of a particular issue of fact, there is any evidence upon which a jury could find the issue in favour of the party on whom rests the burden of proof. The determination of such a question seldom depends upon the application of any principle or rule of law, but upon the view of the judge as to the effect of the evidence adduced. Nevertheless, it falls within the category described by the phrase \u201cquestion of law.\u201d My own opinion is that, having regard to the provisions of section 44, the phrase \u201cquestion of law\u201d in section 52 does not embrace such questions: whether (that is to say) there is any evidence to support a given finding of fact. Section 44 is in these words:\nIn determining any question of fact, the Board shall not be concluded by the finding or judgment of any other court, in any suit, prosecution or proceeding involving the determination of such fact, but such finding or judgment shall, in proceedings before the Board, be prima facie evidence only.\n2. The pendency of any suit, prosecution or proceeding, in any other court, involving questions of fact, shall not deprive the Board of jurisdiction to hear and determine the same questions of fact.\n3. The finding or determination of the Board upon any question of fact within its jurisdiction shall be binding and conclusive.\nThe effect of this section is that where a question of fact is within the jurisdiction of the Board, then the determination of that question of fact by the Board is final and conclusive. I do not think it is consistent with this provision, according to its true intendment, that the determination, by the Board of an issue of fact within its jurisdiction should be susceptible of review on appeal to this Court, even by leave of the Board. The Board is not bound by the ordinary rules of evidence. In deciding upon questions of fact, it must inevitably draw upon its experience in respect of the matters in the vast number of cases which come before it as well as upon the experience of its technical advisers. Thus, the Board may be in a position in passing upon questions of fact in the course of dealing with, for example, an administrative matter, to act with a sure judgment on facts and circumstances which to a tribunal not possessing the Board\u2019s equipment and advantages might yield only a vague or ambiguous impression.\nThe questions submitted by the order of the Board are, ex facie, not questions of law. The order stated that they involve questions of law but, as already observed, the questions of law are not defined. It may be, perhaps, admissible to read the questions in this sense: Are the rulings of the Board to which the questions relate inconsistent with any rule of law by which the Board is bound as such? Examining the questions from that aspect, it is necessary, in order to ascertain the effect of them to read them by the light of the reasons given by the learned Chief Commissioner with which Mr. Commissioner Stoneman agreed. Read by that light, it immediately becomes clear that they present phases of a single question: the question, namely, whether the principle explained by the Chief Commissioner, which the Board has, in analogous cases, applied in the allocation of costs, has been properly applied in this case.\nAs already pointed out, the basis of the conclusion at which the Board arrived was that the works authorized by the Board, the execution of which necessitated the expenditures to be allocated, were incidental or subsidiary to the primary and controlling purpose of reconstituting the terminal facilities of the appellants in Montreal for the purpose of modernizing and improving them. From this it followed, the Board held, that under the rule upon which the Board had habitually acted in the allocation of costs in analogous cases, such costs ought to be borne by the Railway Company.\nIt has already been observed that, while it is, no doubt, the duty of the Board of Railway Commissioners to act reasonably in discharging the responsibility involved in the exercise of its powers and not arbitrarily and capriciously, the Railway Act does not afford any rule or guide, nor does the law afford any rule or guide, by which the Board is or can be governed in determining what, in the circumstances of any particular case, is the reasonable order to make under subsection 2 of section 39 in respect of the allocation of costs. The Board itself has adopted a principle fully explained in the passages quoted from the judgment of the Chief Commissioner which it has followed in making orders as to costs where works ordered by the Board in connection with highway crossings have involved in their execution the removal of the plants of what are commonly known as public utility companies. It is entirely within the competence of the Board to lay down and follow such a rule of practice which, no doubt, it has found to be a just and reasonable rule. But such a rule of practice is not and cannot be a rule of law binding on the Board as such and precluding the Board from departing from it when experience shows that the rule fails to take into account some factor which has been overlooked, or has not hitherto emerged, or where special circumstances require such a departure. In truth, it is plain that the rule upon which the Board has proceeded is one which is incapable of precise definition; and the application of it necessarily, as the Board proceeds from case to case, may involve not only an appreciation of the facts but an appreciation of the considerations upon which the rule itself rests.\nBut the question whether the Board in a given case has properly appreciated its own rule of practice, or the considerations upon which that rule is based, cannot be a question of law within the meaning of section 52 (3); nor can the question whether in a given case the Board has properly appreciated the facts for the purpose of applying the rule be such a question. That is so because, to repeat what has already been said, there is no statutory rule and there is no rule of law that prescribes the considerations by which the Board is to be governed in exercising its administrative discretion under section 39(2). The consequences of the opposite view of the powers of this Court under section 52 may be illustrated by reference to subsection 6, which is in these words:\nOn the hearing of any appeal, the Court may draw all such inferences as are not inconsistent with the facts expressly found by the Board, and are necessary for determining the question of jurisdiction, or law, as the case may be, and shall certify its opinion to the Board, and the Board shall make an order in accordance with such opinion.\nA negative answer to the questions before us would, apparently, in view of this enactment, have the practical effect of giving statutory force to the rule expounded by the Board in the case referred to in the third question. Obviously, the intention of Parliament was to charge the Board with responsibility in respect of this subject of allocation of costs, and there can be no ground for supposing that subsection 3 of section 52 was intended to make it possible to bring before this Court for determination as questions of law questions which, in pith and substance, are within the administrative discretion of the Board and in respect of which the Board, subject to the appeal to the Governor in Council, is charged by the Act with exclusive responsibility. The answer to these questions as a whole (read in the sense above explained) is, therefore, that there is no rule or principle of law inconsistent with the findings and decisions of the Board to which the questions relate.\nIt may not be improper to add this: There was in my opinion evidence before the Board upon which the findings of fact referred to in the questions could be based, although, as I have said, that is not, as I think, a matter which can be brought before this Court as a question of law under section 52 of the Railway Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: I.

Cannon, Kerwin and Hudson J.T.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Sales tax\u2014Moneys allegedly collected by manufacturer under colour of the Special War Revenue Act in excess of amount due by him\u2014Action by the Crown to recover same, plus penalty\u2014Section 119 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179 and amendments thereto.\nThe appellant brought an action against the respondent, a manufacturer, under the provisions of section 119 of the Special War Revenue Act, to recover the sum of $68,132.54, being $67,632.54 as moneys allegedly collected by the latter, under colour of the Act, in excess of the sum it was required to pay to the appellant as consumption or sales tax and $500 penalty. The Exchequer Court of Canada dismissed the claim for such excess taxes on the ground that that part of section 119 providing for the payment thereof to the appellant was ultra vires the Dominion Parliament, and His Majesty appealed to this Court; but the claim for $500 penalty was maintained by the trial judge and the respondent entered a cross-appeal from that judgment.\nHeld that, according to the facts as found in the record, the respondent company had not infringed the provisions of section 119 of the Act, even if consideration was given by this Court to some evidence, not properly admissible, as to the conduct of the respondent company prior to the coming into force of section 119. In view of such finding, it was unnecessary for the Court to deal with the question of the validity of such section.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1938] Ex. C.R. 177, reversed.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.[1], dismissing the appellant\u2019s claim for $67,632.54 under section 119 of the Special War Revenue Act, but giving judgment for a sum of $500 as penalty for infraction of the terms of the section.\nJohn G. Ahearn K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. and C. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014Section 119 of the Special War Revenue Act enacts as follows:\nEveryone liable under this Act to pay to His Majesty any of the taxes hereby imposed, or to collect the same on His Majesty\u2019s behalf, who collects, under colour of this Act, any sum of money in excess of such sum as he is hereby required to pay to His Majesty, shall pay to His Majesty all moneys so collected, and shall in addition be liable to a penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars.\nImperial Tobacco Company of Canada, Limited, is a manufacturer and importer of cigars, cigarettes, tobacco, etc., and at all relevant times was the holder of the annual licence prescribed by section 95 of the Act. It was liable under the Act to pay and did pay to His Majesty the King certain amounts as consumption or sales tax; but it is alleged that it collected, under colour of the Act, sums of money in excess of the amounts it was liable to pay (and did pay), and a claim was made in the Exchequer Court under section 119 for such sums and for the penalty. It was there determined that certain excess taxes had been collected under colour of the Act, and judgment was given for the penal sum of five hundred dollars. The claim for such excess taxes was, however, dismissed on the ground that that part of section 119 providing for the payment thereof to His Majesty was ultra vires the Dominion Parliament. His Majesty now appeals from the dismissal of that claim and the Company cross-appeals from the judgment against it for the penalty.\nSection 119 came into force on June 28th, 1934; the claim for excess taxes covers the period from July 1st of that year to December 31st, 1935, and relates to taxes payable by the Company as a manufacturer and as an importer. The taxes were imposed by subsection 1 of section 86 of the Act (as enacted by the Statutes of 1932, c. 54, sec. 11) on the sale price on all goods\n(\u0430) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the delivery of such goods to the purchaser thereof.\nand\n(b) imported into Canada, payable by the importer or transferee who takes the goods out of bond for consumption at the time when the goods are imported or taken out of warehouse for consumption.\nFor the purpose of calculating the amount of the tax, \u201csale price\u201d was defined in section 85 (a) (as enacted by the statutes of 1932-3, c. 50, sec. 15), which included the statement that \u201cin the case of imported goods, the sale price shall be deemed to be the duty paid value thereof.\u201d The expression \u201cduty paid value\u201d was defined by section 85 (b) (as enacted by the statutes of 1932-3, c. 50, sec. 15) as follows:\u2014\n\u201cduty paid value\u201d shall mean the value of the article as it would be determined for the purpose of calculating an ad valorem duty upon the importation of such article into Canada under the laws relating to the Customs and the Customs Tariff whether such article be in fact subject to ad valorem or other duty or not, and in addition the amount of the customs duties, if any, payable thereon: Provided that in computing the \u201cduty paid value\u201d of tea purchased in bond in Great Britain the amount of the customs duty payable on tea for consumption in Great Britain shall not be included in the value of such tea for purposes of this Part; and that in the case of goods subject to the excise taxes imposed by Parts X and XII of this Act, the amount of such taxes shall be included in the duty paid value.\nIt is admitted by counsel for the appellant that section 119 is not retroactive. What the Company did after that section came into force, during the period in question, is beyond dispute. With reference to cigarettes, cigars, tobacco and cigarette papers, it continued to use the price list issued by it the previous January. On the cover of that price list was the statement \u201cPrice includes sales tax\u201d and in the body of the document, opposite the names of the various brands, appeared the cost thereof to its customers per thousand, pound, roll or carton, under the heading: \u201cDirect price plus 2% per M\u201d or \u201cper lb.,\u201d or \u201cper roll,\u201d or \u201cper ct\u2019n,\u201d as the case might be. It billed its customers for purchases made by them at the rate quoted in the price list and added 2% to the total of the invoices opposite the wording \u201cplus 2%\u201d At the foot of the invoices was the legend,\u2014\u201cPrice includes freight and sales tax.\u201d It thus made its price a \u201ctax included\u201d or composite price, in accordance with a legitimate business practice well understood by the officers of the National Revenue Department of the Government and admitted by them as being in accordance with the Act. As an example, one hundred thousand cigarettes were invoiced at $766 plus 2% or $15.32, making a total price to the customer $781.32, Upon that composite price the Company paid a sales tax, at the current rate of 6%, of $44.22, ascertained by taking 6\/106 of $781.32.\nIt is not suggested that the Company was liable under section 86 to pay more than this in taxes but, as already mentioned, the claim is that the Company, collected, under colour of the Act, more than it was liable to pay. Upon that footing, evidence was tendered and admitted, subject to objection, of what the Company had done prior to the coming into force of section 119. I fail to understand how such evidence was properly admissible. Disregarding it, there is nothing in the record to justify even a suspicion that the Company infringed the provisions of section 119 as all it did was to tell its customers that the price of its goods, both manufactured and imported, was 2% more than a quoted figure. That conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the attack made upon the validity of the statute and might well suffice to dispose of the matter. However, in view of the nature of the claims advanced by the appellant, it appears only right to say that the evidence, if admissible, fails to establish them. The evidence covered various periods when the rate of taxation was 1%, 4% and 6% respectively, according to the following table:\u2014\nDate of coming\ninto force\nStatute\nRate\n20-21\nGeorge V, c. 40, s. 2\nMay 2, 1930\n1%\n21-22\nGeorge V, c. 54, s. 11\nJune 2, 1931\n4%\n22-23\nGeorge V, c. 54, s. 11\nApril 7, 1932\n6%\nDuring all this time the Company sold its goods at a composite price and its invoices bore the legend already referred to \u201cprice includes freight and sales tax.\u201d\nDealing first with manufactured goods, when the rate was 1%, one hundred thousand cigarettes were invoiced at $975 and upon that the Company paid, as taxes, 1\/101 or $9.66. The same practice was followed when the rate was increased from 1% to 4% except that the tax paid was 4\/104 or $37.50, upon the like quantity of cigarettes. When, however, the rate was increased to 6%, the Company notified its customers by circular dated April 7, 1932, that it had found it necessary to add 2% to the invoices for all its goods. Considerable importance was attached by appellant to that circular and it is therefore reproduced textually:\u2014\nApril 7, 1932.\nTo our Customers:\u2014\nYou are aware of the increase in the Sales Tax, from 4% to 6%, and other forms of taxation made effective to-day by the Federal Budget of yesterday.\nWe had hoped that in view of the abnormal tax burdens put upon the tobacco industry, the Government would be able to give some special consideration to it and not impose this added tax.\nLast June when the Sales Tax was increased from 1% to 4%, we absorbed this whole amount and did not increase our prices; but with this additional tax burden, we have found it necessary to add 2% to our invoices for all of our goods, effective to-day.\nWe are preparing a re-sale price list for the jobbing trade and feel that in fairness, they cannot expect to maintain the same margin of profit that they have enjoyed in the past, and will have to share part of this burden, and our suggested re-sale prices have been made up accordingly.\nYours very truly,\nImperial Tobacco Company of Canada, Limited. Accordingly, from April 7th, 1932, to August 17th, 1932, the invoices bore a notation \u201cadd 2% on a\/c sales tax,\u201d with the appropriate amount added to the total of the invoice. From August 18th, 1932, the notation was \u201cplus 2%\u201d\u2014again with the addition of the appropriate amount. The 2% added as a result of either of the notations \u201con a\/c sales tax\u201d or \u201cplus 2%\u201d made the total $944.50, upon which the Company paid sales tax of $56.29, i.e., 6\/106 of $944.50. In November, 1932, the price was reduced from $975 to $766 which with the addition of the 2% made a total of $781.32. Upon this latter sum, the tax calculated at 6\/106 of $781.32, or $44.23, was paid.\nThe appellant\u2019s submission is that the Company unalterably adopted as its sale price, upon which it could impose a percentage, the net sum received by it before the addition of the 2% when the rate of taxation was 4%, that is $975 less the tax, $37.50, or $937.50; and that therefore the sale price, after the addition of the 2% should be $937.50 plus $18.75, or $956.25, upon which the tax at 6% would be $57.37 instead of $56.29 as actually paid. Counsel for the appellant does not suggest that the Company should have paid $57.37 but argues that, if the Company had merely intended to increase the price of its goods by 2%, it would have adopted the system of invoicing above suggested; and urges that the fact that it did not do so leads to the conclusion that the 2% was not added as an increase to the sale price but was for the purpose of collecting an additional amount as tax from the customer.\nNo valid reason has been advanced as to why the sale price should be taken as $937.50\u2014when the rate was 4%, rather than $965.34,\u2014when the rate was 1%. If the latter figure were adopted, then when the rate became 6% the amount of the tax would be $57.92, which is less than was actually paid; and it is not contended that the Company should have paid any such amount. And what was to happen when the Company in November, 1932, reduced its quoted list price from $975 to $766? No suggestion could be made,\u2014no suggestion was made, that the tax should be computed, under those circumstances, on $937.50. Moreover, the circular of April 7th, 1932, and the notations on the invoices of \u201cadd 2% on a\/c sales tax\u201d or \u201cplus 2%\u201d make it clear that, with respect to manufactured goods, the Company instead of collecting any sum of money in excess of such sum as it was required to pay under the Act, merely increased the price of its goods.\nA fortiori the same result follows with respect to imported goods. The Company invoiced imported goods in the manner already described with reference to manufactured goods. In accordance with section 86 (1) (b), the Company had already paid the tax on the duty paid value at the time the imported goods were taken by it out of bond, at the rate then in force. No further sales tax was thereafter payable by the Company with respect to these imported goods. The duty paid value was deemed to be the sale price for the purpose of calculating the amount of the tax but did not necessarily bear any relation to the actual cost to the Company, or to the price at which it might determine the goods would be sold to its customers. In fact, in many cases the duty paid value upon which the sales tax was paid was more than the amount paid to the Company by its customers, including the 2%.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, the cross-appeal allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nCannon J.\u2014I agree with my brother Kerwin and I would dismiss the appeal, allow the cross-appeal and dismiss the action, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs;\nCross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John G. Ahearn.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] [1938] Ex. C.R. 177.\n"}

(Objecting Party) Respondent.\n1939: May 26; 1939: June 27.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTrade mark\u2014Petition under s. 29 of Unfair Competition Act (Dom., 1982, c. 38)\u2014Registration sought of certain words as trade mark\u2014Effect of prior proceedings and decision therein dealing with same words previously registered as trade mark\u2014Res judicata.\nAppellant on May 5, 1938, presented a petition to the Exchequer Court of Canada, under s. 29 of the Unfair Competition Act (Dom., 1932, c. 38) for a declaration to enable appellant to register the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d as a trade mark. Maclean J., dealing with certain points of law raised in a statement of objections by respondent, dismissed the petition, [1939] Ex. C.R. 58, one ground of dismissal being that the issues raised therein were res judicata by reason of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, 55 R.P.C. 125 (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1936] O.R. 613, affirming judgment of McTague J., [1936] O.R. 281), which held, in an action commenced in June, 1934, by appellant against respondent for alleged infringement of appellant\u2019s trade marks of the same words registered in March, 1928, and April, 1929, that said trade marks were not valid; that the words were purely descriptive of the product and had not acquired a secondary meaning as indicating goods exclusively manufactured by appellant.\nHeld: The dismissal of the petition should be affirmed. The said judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the former action clearly proceeded (as regards the issue of passing off raised in the action) on the footing that its findings were valid as of the date of the commencement of that action in June, 1934. Res judicata applied unless there were special user or special circumstances since June, 1934, on which could be based appellant\u2019s general plea that the words in question had at the date of the present petition acquired the essential secondary signification to entitle it to have the words registered as a trade mark. In the allegations in the petition no distinction was drawn as to the manner or circumstances of appellant\u2019s user of the words since June, 1934, and appellant\u2019s preceding long user thereof. Moreover, the effect of a certain undertaking by respondent at the outset of said former action was to give appellant a practical monopoly for nearly four years from June, 1934; and the effect of such a monopoly is, generally speaking, that in the absence of competition there is no occasion in anybody\u2019s mind for adverting to distinctiveness in respect of the maker or seller of the goods (Cellular Clothing Co. v. Maxton, 16 R.P.C. 397, at 409; Siegert v. Findlater, 7 Ch. D. 801, at 813, referred to). On the allegations in the petition and the admitted facts, and there being no averment of special user or special circumstances as aforesaid, no reasonable ground is disclosed for granting the petition. As to appellant\u2019s contention that there was no estoppel by res judicata because in the present proceedings respondent appeared in a character (as a member of, and on behalf of, the public) different from that in which it was sued (in its personal character) in said former proceedings\u2014held, that that was a technical point to which effect ought not to be given in the circumstances (Reichel v. Magrath, 14 App. Cas. 665).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing appellant\u2019s petition, made under s 29 of the Unfair Competition Act (Dom., 1932, c. 38), for a declaration that it has been proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d\nhave been so used by your petitioner as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and users of the class of wares in association with which they have been used, as indicating that your petitioner assumes responsibility for their character and quality and their place of origin, and that, having regard to the evidence adduced, your petitioner is entitled to registration thereof, pursuant to its application and that such registration should extend to the whole of Canada.\nIn 1896 one Perky obtained a grant of Canadian letters patent covering a new product which he had invented, and a process and machine by means of which the new product was prepared or produced; and in 1901 he obtained a grant of Canadian letters patent for \u201cimprovements in and relating to machines for making biscuits and other articles,\u201d which patent covered the machine which was used for the production of biscuit shapes, composed of the new product (the subject of the prior patent aforesaid) which issued from the rollers on to a travelling band. The said new product was called and was known by the name of shredded wheat. In 1904 appellant was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and acquired the good will of the business in Canada of the company which was at that time importing the product into Canada and selling it there. Appellant built a factory for its manufacture at Niagara Falls, Ontario, and in 1905 commenced and has ever since continued to manufacture the product in Canada and to sell it there. The said patents expired in 1914 and 1919 respectively. On March 20, 1928, the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d were registered as appellant\u2019s trade mark to be applied to the sale of biscuits and crackers; and on April 3, 1929, the same words were registered as its trade mark to be applied to the sale of cereal foods cooked or prepared for consumption[2].\nIn June, 1934, appellant commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against respondent (and one Bassin), claiming an injunction to restrain alleged infringement of appellant\u2019s said trade marks and for damages. The action was dismissed by McTague J.[3]. An appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4]. An appeal from its judgment was dismissed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[5]; it was held that appellant\u2019s said trade marks \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d were not valid trade marks; that the words were purely descriptive of the product and had not acquired a secondary meaning as indicating goods exclusively manufactured by appellant. (It was also held that \u201cpassing off\u201d by the defendants, which was also an issue in the action, had not been shown).\nOn May 5, 1938, appellant filed the present petition above mentioned under s. 29 of the Unfair Competition Act. Appellant alleged that on the same date (May 5, 1938) it filed a request for cancellation of the earlier registrations aforesaid, such cancellation to take effect upon the re-registration.\nNotice of the filing of the present petition was published in the Canada Gazette. Respondent filed a statement of objections. Paragraphs 7, 19, 20 and 21 of the statement of objections read as follows:\n7. The objecting party submits that by virtue of these proceedings and judgment [proceedings in said action commenced in June, 1934, and judgments therein, and ending in the said judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of February 4, 1938] the validity of the trade mark \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d and the issues raised in the petition are res adjudicata and that the petition should be denied and no further proceedings taken with respect thereto. 19. The provisions of section 29 of the Unfair Competition Act are only applicable in an action or proceeding already pending in the Exchequer Court of Canada, and cannot be made available to a party by filing a petition.\n20. The provisions of section 29 of the Unjair Competition Act are not applicable to an application to register a trade mark, but only in relation to the validity of a trade mark already registered.\n21. The existence upon the register of the registrations referred to in paragraph 6 of the petition [aforesaid registrations by appellant of trade mark \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d] form a bar to the petition.\nAn order was made (by consent) in the Exchequer Court of Canada that the points of law raised by said paragraphs 7, 19, 20 and 21 of the statement of objections should be set down for hearing and disposition before the Court. After the hearing, judgment was rendered by Maclean J., President of the Court, dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition[6]. The present appeal was then brought to this Court.\nIt is stated in the judgment of this Court (now reported) that\nOn the argument before this Court the respondents did not rely on paragraphs 20 and 21 of the statement of objections and, as regards paragraph 19, in the view we take, we find it unnecessary to consider it.\nWith regard to the question of res judicata raised by said paragraph 7 of respondent\u2019s statement of objections, a contention of appellant in support of the present petition was, that the fact that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided that in 1928 and 1929 the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d were merely descriptive and not registrable, is not inconsistent with the contention that those words have now acquired, through use, the necessary character to permit registration under the provisions of s. 29 of the Unfair Competition Act. Another contention of appellant was that in the former proceeding the present respondent was sued in its personal character but in opposing the petition now in question it does not appear in its personal character but in the character of a member of the public; that in an action under the provisions of s. 29 of the Unfair Competition Act, a statement of objections, by whomsoever presented, is a statement of objections on behalf of the public, and is not personal to the objecting party, and in a legal point of view it is a mere accident that in this case the objecting party was a party to a former litigation; that it is well settled that a party who, though identical in name, litigates in different characters in the two proceedings, is, in contemplation of law, two separate and distinct persons; that therefore the parties to the judicial decision relied upon as creating the res judicata were not the same persons as the parties to the present proceedings; and there can be no estoppel by res judicata.\nAim\u00e9 Geofirion K.C., A. H. Elder K.C. and E. G. Gowling for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellants presented a petition on the 5th day of May, 1938, to the Exchequer Court of Canada praying a declaration that the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d had\nbeen so used by your petitioner as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and users of the class of wares in association with which they have been used, as indicating that your petitioner assumes responsibility for their character and quality and their place of origin, and that, having regard to the evidence adduced, your petitioner is entitled to registration thereof, pursuant to its application and that such registration should extend to the whole of Canada.\nThe proceedings were taken with a view to obtaining a registration of the words mentioned as a trade mark under section 29 of the Unfair Competition Act. The respondents filed particulars of objections and paragraph 7 of those particulars is in these words:\n7. The objecting party submits that by virtue of these proceedings and judgment the validity of the trade mark \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d and the issues raised in the petition are res adjudicata and that the petition should be denied and no further proceedings taken with respect thereto.\nBy consent, an order was made directing that the points of law raised by paragraphs 7, 19, 20 and 21 in the statement of objections should be heard and disposed of before the trial. The allegations in paragraphs 4, 5 and part of 6 were admitted. These allegations are as follows:\n4. On the 1st of June, 1934, the petitioner commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario for an injunction to restrain infringement of the petitioner\u2019s alleged trade mark consisting of the words \u201cShredded Wheat,\u201d registered at Folio 43550 of Register No. 198 and at Folio 46703 of Register No. 214, during the course of which action evidence was taken from some twenty-seven witnesses representing consumers, retail grocers and wholesale grocers from every province of Canada with the exception of Ontario and Quebec, with respect to which provinces a formal admission was made on behalf of the objecting party that similar witnesses from those provinces would, if examined on commission, testify to the same effect, the said witnesses being produced in an effort by the petitioner to establish that a secondary meaning had been acquired for the words \u201cshredded wheat\u201d to distinguish the product of the petitioner.\n5. The aforesaid action in the Supreme Court of Ontario came on for trial before Mr. Justice McTague, who dismissed the action in a judgment dated the 30th day of March, 1936. Upon appeal being taken to the Court of Appeals for Ontario, the said Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal in a judgment dated the 30th of November, 1936.\n6. A further appeal was taken by the petitioner to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, before whom the case was argued on December 9th, 10th, 13th, 14th and 15th, 1937, as a result of which a judgment was delivered by Lord Russell of Killowen on the 4th day of February, 1938, reported at page 127 of Volume 55 of the Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark Cases, . .\nOn the argument before this Court the respondents did not rely on paragraphs 20 and 21 of the statement of objections and, as regards paragraph 19, in the view we take, we find it unnecessary to consider it.\nThere can be no doubt as to the effect of the proceedings recited in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. It is set forth explicitly in the judgment of the Judicial Committee, delivered by Lord Russell of Killowen, that the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d were aptly descriptive of the plaintiffs\u2019 goods, that is, the appellants\u2019 goods, in appearance as well as in substance; and, moreover, that the words \u201cShredded Wheat\u201d constituted the name by which these goods were known; and further, their Lordships concurred in the finding of the learned trial judge that the words had never acquired the secondary meaning of being distinctive of goods manufactured exclusively by the appellants.\nOn the issue of the validity of the trade mark, it was only material that these propositions of fact should hold as of the date of the registration of the trade mark; but, on the issue of passing off, it was obviously material that they should be valid as of a later date. Indeed, it would not be an unfair interpretation of their Lordships\u2019 judgment to read it as proceeding upon the footing that these findings of fact held as of the date of the trial. In the view I take it is not necessary, however, to go into this. It is quite clear that their Lordships\u2019 judgment proceeds, as regards the issue of passing off, on the footing that they were valid as of the pertinent date, that is to say, the date of the commencement of the action.\nThere is, of course, no dispute about this. Nor is there any dispute that, as between the appellants and the respondents in their private and individual capacity, these findings are binding and conclusive.\nIt is argued, however, and this is the basis of the appeal, that these propositions are not conclusive upon the issue raised, as the appellants contend, by the allegations in section 7 of the statement of objections, namely, that at the date of the petition, some four years after the commencement of the action, and two years after the date of the trial, the proceedings referred to had conclusively established by findings binding on the parties that the words Shredded Wheat had not acquired a secondary meaning in a sense entitling the appellants to have them registered as their trade mark; and, second, that, if these findings were binding as between the appellants and the respondents in their private and personal capacity, the respondents now appear in a different capacity, namely, as representing the public and, in that capacity, they are not bound.\nMr. Geoffrion\u2019s argument is that the sole issue raised by section 7 is the issue of res judicata in the strict sense; and, admitting, as he is obliged to admit, the effect of the findings as such, they are, he argues, inconclusive upon the precise point as to the meaning acquired by the words in question at the date of the petition and in any case inconclusive as between the appellants and the respondents in the capacity in which they now appear. It follows, he argues, that the point of law before the learned trial judge ought to have been decided in his favour. He was never called upon, he insists, to meet any other issue and ought not to have had his petition dismissed as an abuse of the process without having an opportunity of meeting the respondents on that ground.\nMr. Biggar has called our attention to the fact that, at the outset of the litigation,\u2014that is to say, in June, 1934\u2014the appellants applied for an injunction. An undertaking was given by the respondents which precluded them from selling the whole wheat biscuits, of the sale of which the appellants complained, \u201cuntil the final disposition of the action,\u201d which was finally disposed of by His Majesty\u2019s order of the 4th day of February, 1938, about two months before the appellants\u2019 petition was lodged; the effect of this undertaking being to give the appellants a practical monopoly.\nIt is necessary now to advert briefly to the allegations in the petition.\nThe petitioners allege that, continuously since the year 1905, they have carried on the business of manufacturing and selling cereal foods in Canada, and that this business was theretofore (from 1898) carried on by their predecessors; that the words Shredded Wheat \u201chave always been used as a trade mark by them and their predecessors in association with such products\u201d; that since commencing business, and especially during the past ten years, the petitioners have spent large sums of money in advertising and have sold many millions of dollars worth of goods in association with this trade mark; that the words have become a symbol adapted to distinguish the wares of the petitioners in such a manner that they are the petitioners\u2019 trade mark. The petition terminates by a general allegation, in paragraph five, that the words Shredded Wheat have been used by the petitioners in such a manner and have received general recognition of such a character as to entitle the petitioners to have the words registered as their trade mark.\nNow, it will be observed that the alleged user of the words Shredded Wheat as the trade mark of the petitioners and their predecessors is a user which goes back to the year 1898; that no distinction is drawn as to the manner or circumstances of this user in the four years following the commencement of the action in the Supreme Court of Ontario in 1934 and the preceding thirty-five or thirty-six years. I do not think the allegations in the petition, fairly read, can be said to raise the issue whether or not the words Shredded Wheat (having for thirty-five years prior to June, 1934, been used as aptly descriptive and as the name of the goods of the appellants and their predecessors by them and their purchasers and not used or known as their trade mark) had acquired, by virtue of the user of them in the four years succeeding June, 1934, the secondary meaning of being distinctive of goods manufactured exclusively by the appellants. During these particular four years the appellants had a monopoly in the manufacture and sale of these goods in consequence of the undertaking referred to. The effect of the existence of such a monopoly is, generally speaking, that in the absence of competition there is no occasion in the mind of anybody for adverting to distinctiveness in respect of the maker or seller of the goods. Theoretically, of course, the user might be of such a character, or accompanied by such circumstances, as to produce a different effect. But given the admitted facts here, in the absence of such special user or special circumstances, it would appear to be indisputable that the general allegation with which the petition concludes, namely, that these words had at the date of the petition acquired the essential secondary signification, is and must be quite baseless. On the point as to the effect of the monopoly, I refer to Cellular Clothing Co. v. Maxton[7] and Lord Davey\u2019s observations there, cited by Mr. Justice McTague and adopted by the Judicial Committee; and also to the judgment of Lord Justice Fry (Siegert v. Findlater[8]) adopted by Lord Davey.\nThe only difficulty in the appeal arises from the manner of the proceedings in the court below. There was not, in point of form, an application to strike out the petition as frivolous and as an abuse of the process of the court; and I am by no means clear whether the parties intended to proceed under rule 149 or 151, or both. The petition could not have survived the summary proceeding if taken a year ago. Having fully considered Mr. Geoffrion\u2019s formidable objections, we are not, I think, precluded from doing substantial justice now.\nIt would not, I am inclined to think, be an unfair interpretation of the proceedings in the Exchequer Court to read them as a submission to the trial judge of the question whether on the admitted facts, including, of course, the undertaking of June, 1934, there was any issue raised by the petition which ought to be permitted to be tried; and there can, as I have said, be only one answer to that question.\nBut, there is another way in which the position can be put and that is that the admissions should be treated as included in the allegations of the petition. So treating them, the allegations as a whole, including these admissions, there being no averment of special user or special circumstances in the last four years, disclose no reasonable ground for relief; and amendment is, of course, out of the question.\nAs to the point that the respondents are here in a different character from that in which they appeared in the Ontario action, that is a technical point to which effect ought not to be given in the circumstances (Reichel v. Magrath (1)).\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wainwright, Elder & McDougall.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Big gar.\n[1] [1939] Ex.

An option was given to commute all instalments into a single cash payment of $71,400. The total of the premiums paid during the husband\u2019s lifetime, over and beyond dividends aggregating $6,815.15 which accrued on the policy and were applied against premiums, was $37,039.85. Appellant\u2019s husband died on November 23, 1933. Appellant did not elect to take the single cash payment of $71,400; and she was paid the monthly instalments. For those received in 1934 (in all, $8,400) she was assessed for that year for income tax under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97. She appealed against such assessment.\nHeld (reversing judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1939] Ex. C.R. 35): The assessment should be set aside. The payments sought to be taxed did not fall within the definition of \u201cincome\u201d in s. 3 of said Act, reading that section as a whole and on particular examination of clause (b) therein.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming the assessment of appellant for income tax under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, in respect of the sum of $8,400 received in monthly instalments of $700 each during the year 1934 under a certain policy of insurance.\nThe policy was applied for by appellant and was issued by the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and was dated October 26, 1927. By it the Company agreed that on the death of appellant\u2019s husband (therein called the assured) it would pay to appellant (therein called the owner and therein called the beneficiary) the sum of $700 and a like monthly instalment in each succeeding month until 120 monthly instalments in all should have been paid; that should appellant still survive after the payment of the 120 monthly instalments it would continue to pay to her the sum of $700 monthly so long as she survived thereafter. It was agreed that when the first instalment under the policy became due the person or persons legally entitled to receive said first instalment should have the option of commuting all instalments into a single cash payment of $71,400 (\u201cprovided always that this option cannot be exercised by the beneficiary or payee unless the owner shall have filed with the Company a written request to that effect, or shall have so expressed his desire by will\u201d).\nThe annual premiums were paid on the policy, being $6,265 in each year and amounting in all to $43,855, but less the dividends accrued on the policy during the husband\u2019s life time, amounting in all to $6,815.15, which were applied against the premiums from time to time due; thus the actual premiums paid in cash after crediting such dividends amounted to $37,039.85.\nAppellant\u2019s husband died on November 23, 1933. Appellant did not elect to exercise the option of commuting the monthly instalments into a single cash payment of $71,400, and consequently the monthly instalments stipulated in the contract have been paid to appellant since her husband\u2019s death. In the year 1934 she received the sum of $8,400, in respect of which she was assessed for income tax and she appealed against such assessment. By the judgment now reported the appeal from the judgment of Maclean J. aforesaid dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Minister affirming the assessment, was allowed, and the assessment set aside, with costs throughout.\nI. F. Hellmuth K.C. and H. C. F. Mockridge for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and J. R. Tolmie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Crocket and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The charging section is section 9. There is no question that the appellant falls within one or more of the classes of persons to whom this section applies and the appeal really turns upon the question whether the payments which have been held to be taxable fall within the statutory definition of \u201cincome.\u201d\nThe defining section is section 3 and that section must be read as a whole. First of all, there is a declaration that, \u201cfor the purposes of this Act, \u2018income\u2019 means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity,\u201d whether as being a \u201cfixed amount,\u201d such as wages or salary, or \u201cunascertained,\u201d such as fees or emoluments, profits from a business or calling or from an office or employment, or a \u201cprofession or calling,\u201d or from a trade, manufacture or business. Then the section proceeds to say that income \u201cshall include the interest, dividends or profits * * * from money at interest\u201d or \u201cfrom stocks, or from any other investment\u201d; and finally,\nalso the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n(a) the income from but not the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent; and\n(b) the income from but not the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured, or payments made or credited to the insured on life insurance endowment or annuity contracts upon the maturity of the term mentioned in the contract or upon the surrender of the contract;\nand certain other classes of annual payments with which we are not concerned.\nIt should be observed, first of all, that the annual profit or gain which paragraphs (a) and (b) treat as income is the \u201cincome\u201d from a specified source which is treated as not of an income nature. In (a) this source is \u201cproperty acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent\u201d and the declaration that such income is \u201cincome for the purposes of the Act\u201d is accompanied by a declaration that the value of such property is not included within the classes of annual profit or gain designated by the term \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of the statute.\nGoing to (b), the income, on the natural reading of the paragraph which is \u201cincome for the purposes of the Act\u201d is the income from the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured, that is to say, upon the contingency of the death of such person. And here again, this declaration is accompanied by a declaration that such proceeds are not included under the term \u201cincome\u201d nor are \u201cpayments made or credited on life insurance endowment or annuity contracts\u201d or certain other specified payments.\nParagraphs (a) and (b) both specify sources the income from which is taxable and at the same time declare that these sources of income are not themselves embraced within the designation \u201cincome for the purposes of the Act.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge, in the course of his judgment, says it is evident that section 3 (b) contemplates the taxation of income derived from life insurance contracts and annuity contracts. With great respect, this proposition is, I think, stated rather too absolutely. Grammatically, this is the way, I think, in which paragraphs (a) and (b) are related to the second member of section 3:\nand shall include * * * and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including (a) the income from * * * property acquired in the designated ways; \u201cbut not the value of\u201d such \u201cproperty.\u201d That is to say, the value of such property is explicitly excluded from the category of income. Then, coming to (b), \u201cincome\u201d includes for the purposes of the Act,\nthe annual profit or gain from any other source including\n(b) the income from * * * the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured\nbut not the proceeds of such policies or,\npayments made or credited to the insured on life insurance endowment or annuity contracts upon the maturity of the term mentioned in the contract or upon the surrender of the contract.\n\u201cNot * * or\u201d has in this context its ordinary meaning \u201cneither * * nor.\u201d\nIt is clear enough to me that upon a strict reading of these provisions, the payments sought to be taxed do not fall within them. It is no part of our duty in construing and applying a taxing statute to ask ourselves what might have been in the draughtsman\u2019s mind or to accept the impression received from a casual inspection of the enactment to be applied. It is our duty to analyze such enactments with strictness and, in the case of a definition such as this, to apply it only to those cases which plainly and indubitably fall within it when strictly read.\nThere is an additional consideration which ought not to be overlooked. It will be observed that in paragraphs (a) and (b) the word \u201cincome\u201d is repeated. The section is defining \u201cincome\u201d and, in defining \u201cincome,\u201d it says that \u201cincome\u201d \u201cincludes the annual net profit or gain from any source including the income\u201d from certain specified sources. The legislature, it seems to me, is at pains to emphasize the distinction between income and the source of income. The income derived from the capital source is income for the purposes of the Act. The source is not income for the purposes of the Act. If, therefore, you find something which is the proceeds of a life insurance policy paid upon the death of the insured, or payments made or credited in the circumstances defined in (b), then you have something which is not \u201cincome for the purposes of the Act\u201d by the explicit declaration of the statute itself. Broadly speaking, the statute seems to be emphasizing the intention not to tax anything that is not of an income nature. But defined classes of benefits received\u2014property acquired by gift, testamentary or inter vivos and the proceeds paid on the contingency of the death of the insured under an insurance policy as well as defined classes of payments under specified classes of contracts\u2014are explicitly declared not to be income.\nAs regards the ten annual payments of $8,400 each, which come to an end at the expiration of ten years from the death of the insured, it seems impossible to escape the conclusion that each of these payments contains a very considerable element of capital. $71,400 was agreed upon between the parties as the capitalized value of these payments plus any additional payments if the beneficiary should live longer; and I should have said, even apart from the provisions of the statute, that there is at least as much to be urged in favour of the view that these payments are of a capital nature as that they are of an income nature. There has been no attempt to segregate capital from income and the Crown does not put its case on the ground that some part, at least, of these payments are of an income nature.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the assessment set aside with costs throughout.\nDavis, J.\u2014The facts in this case are not in dispute; they were set forth in a statement signed by the solicitors for both parties.\nThe appellant, Mrs. Bessie L. Shaw, of Toronto, in October, 1927, took out a policy of Insurance with the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada on the life of her husband, George Baldwin Shaw, who subsequently died November 23rd, 1933. Mrs. Shaw herself made the application for the insurance and named herself as the sole beneficiary thereof. The annual premium was $6,265, and the total cash premiums paid upon this policy during the husband\u2019s lifetime, over and beyond dividends of $6,815.15 which accrued upon the policy from time to time and had been applied against premiums, amounted to $37,039.85. Mrs. Shaw survived her husband and under the terms of the policy she became entitled on her husband\u2019s death to the sum of $700 \u201cand a like monthly instalment on the same day in each succeeding month until one hundred and twenty monthly instalments in all shall have been paid.\u201d There is no question that under the policy 120 monthly instalments, aggregating $84,000 were to be paid irrespective of whether Mrs. Shaw survived her husband or not. $84,000 is a sum, definite and fixed, which is to be paid by instalments. The policy specifically provided that if Mrs. Shaw should die before her husband, the amount of the annual premium would thereafter be reduced from $6,265 to $4,522.\nThe Company further agreed that if Mrs. Shaw was still living \u201cafter the payment in full of the 120 monthly instalments mentioned above,\u201d it would continue to pay to her the sum of $700 monthly on the same day in each month as that on which the preceding instalments became due \u201cso long as she may survive thereafter.\u201d\nThe Company further agreed that when the first instalment under the policy became due the person or persons legally entitled to receive the said first instalment should have the option of commuting all instalments into a single cash payment of $71,400; but it was provided that this option could not be exercised by the payee unless Mrs. Shaw \u201cshall have filed with the Company a written request to that effect, or shall have so expressed (her) desire by will.\u201d\nMrs. Shaw did not exercise the option to accept a single cash payment of $71,400. The monthly payments have been made to her by the company and the sole question for determination in this appeal is whether or not the Minister of National Revenue is entitled to assess the $8,400 received in the taxation period 1934 as income of the appellant liable to taxation within the provisions of the (Dominion) Income War Tax Act and amendments.\nMrs. Shaw was so assessed and appealed to the Minister against the assessment. The Minister affirmed the assessment on the ground that under the provisions of the policy Mrs. Shaw had the option of commuting all payments into a single cash payment of $71,400 and that, as she refrained from exercising the option and by reason of the nature of the monthly payments received by her, the payments constitute income by virtue of the provisions of sec. 3 and other provisions of the Income War Tax Act, and that the provisions of sec. 5 (k) of the Act allowing an exemption in respect of income derived from certain annuity contracts there mentioned do not apply to this particular case.\nOn appeal by Mrs. Shaw from the Minister\u2019s decision to the Exchequer Court of Canada, the Minister in his pleading took the position that in effect Mrs. Shaw purchased an annuity contract with the proceeds of the said insurance policy and that in that sense an annuity contract with the company was created when, on the death of her husband, she refrained from exercising her option to take a single cash payment, and that the assessment had been affirmed by the Minister on the ground that\nthe annuity payments are income under sec. 3 of the Act and are not the proceeds of the insurance policy on the life of the appellant\u2019s husband, the proceeds of such policy having been utilized to purchase the said annuity contract and that the annuity contract in question is not within sec. 5 (k), being not similar to the type of contract issued by the Dominion or provincial governments.\nBy an amended pleading the Minister took the position that if sec. 5 (k) applies, which was not admitted but denied, then the exemption is $5,000 rather than $1,200 as previously alleged by him, the annuity contract alleged by him having been entered into prior to May 26th, 1932, which was the date of an amendment made to sec. 5 (k) by sec. 6 of ch. 43 of the Statutes of 1932, reducing the exemption in respect of income derived from annuity contracts with the Dominion Government or like annuity contracts from $5,000 to $1,200.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court held that the instalment payments made by the company to the appellant were not proceeds of a life insurance policy within the meaning of paragraph (b) of sec. 3 of the Income War Tax Act and accordingly determined that, having regard to the other provisions of said sec. 3, the said instalment payments were income within the meaning of that section. Counsel for the appellant submitted to this Court that the learned President was in error in so holding and that the instalment payments received by the appellant during the period 1934 (aggregating $8,400) were part of the proceeds of the said policy of life insurance and accordingly exempt from taxation under the provisions of said sec. 3. This may be a convenient place to set out the pertinent portions of sections 3 and 5 of the statute.\n3. For the purposes of this Act, \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain * * *; and shall include * * * and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n* * *\n(b) the income from but not the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured, * * *\u2019\n5. \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n* * *\n(k) Twelve hundred dollars only, being income derived from annuity contracts with the Dominion Government or like annuity contracts issued by any Provincial Government or any company incorporated or licensed to do business in Canada.\nIt is income that is being taxed and not capital. The governing words of sec. 3, in so far as life insurance policies are concerned, are \u201cand also the annual profit or gain from any other source including.\u201d I am unable to read the provision as bringing into charge something which, when its true nature is looked at, is of a capital nature which otherwise would not have been chargeable. Obviously the whole of the $8,400 annual payment, with which this appeal is solely concerned, was not \u201cprofit or gain.\u201d The appellant had paid in premiums during her husband\u2019s lifetime $37,039.85 over and beyond dividends credited in the sum of $6,815.15. She might die before the annual payments had returned to her an amount equal to what she had paid. It is true that the policy assures annual payments for ten years certain, but in the event of the appellant\u2019s death before the expiration of the ten-year period, the subsequent payments could not be regarded as income to her\u2014they would pass under her will or upon an intestacy. It may well be that on a strict actuarial accounting some part of each of the $8,400 annual payments may be income, but obviously a comparatively small portion. But the Crown does not put forward a claim on that basis. Its contention is that the whole of the annual payment of $8,400 is an annuity and taxable as income from (rather than the proceeds of) the life insurance policy.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and vary the assessment of the appellant for the taxation year in question by deleting the said item of $8,400. Kerwin J.\u2014Mrs. Bessie L. Shaw appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer Court confirming the assessment levied upon her under the Income War Tax Act for the 1934 taxation period. Mrs. Shaw is the widow of G. B. Shaw, upon whose life a policy of insurance was taken out with the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. No importance is to be attached to the fact that the appellant signed the formal application for this policy nor to the fact that the premiums (less the annual dividends declared by the Insurance Company on the policy) were apparently paid out of appellant\u2019s funds,\u2014funds to which she became entitled by reason of the transfer to her by her husband of certain shares in the capital stock of an incorporated company. In my opinion the same result would follow if G. B. Shaw had applied for the policy and if he had paid the premiums.\nBy the policy, the appellant, who is referred to therein as \u201cthe owner\u201d and also as \u201cthe beneficiary,\u201d is to be paid $700 per month for one hundred and twenty months and, if she should survive after the payment in full of the one hundred and twenty monthly instalments, she was to be paid by the Company $700 monthly so long as she might survive thereafter. The policy further provides:\u2014\nIt is further agreed that when the first instalment under this policy becomes due, as above, the person or persons legally entitled to receive said first instalment shall have the option of commuting all instalments into a single cash payment of Seventy-one Thousand Four Hundred Dollars and the payment of this amount shall completely discharge the Company from all liability in connection with this contract; provided always that this option cannot be exercised by the beneficiary or payee unless the owner shall have filed with the Company a written request to that effect, or shall have so expressed his desire by will.\nMr. Shaw died November 23rd, 1933; the appellant did not exercise the option conferred on her by this clause and the Insurance Company has therefore paid her $700 each month. The question is whether she is assessable to income tax with respect to the sum of $8,400 so received by her during the year 1934.\nThis question depends upon the proper construction of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 97, the relevant parts of which are as follows:\u2014\nFor the purposes of this Act, \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, * * * and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n* * * (b) the income from but not the proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured, or payments made or credited to the insured on life insurance endowment or annuity contracts upon the maturity of the term mentioned in the contract or upon the surrender of the contract.\nMy view of the meaning of these words is that Parliament intended to exempt from income tax:\u2014\nI. The proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured.\nII. Payments made or credited to the insured on life insurance endowment or annuity contracts\n(a) upon the maturity of the term mentioned in the contract, or\n(b) upon the surrender of the contract.\nIt is arguable that the payments referred to relate to life insurance contracts or endowment contracts or annuity contracts and not to life insurance endowment contracts or life insurance annuity contracts (whatever that expression may mean), as has been suggested. It is unnecessary to come to any definite conclusion on that question because it is evident that the distinction to be drawn is between \u201cproceeds * * * paid upon the death of the person insured\u201d and \u201cpayments made or credited to the insured.\u201d The instalments here in question were not paid to the insured, and the latter part of paragraph (b) may, therefore, be disregarded.\nIn view of the evident intention to tax the annual profit or gain from any source, the monthly instalments paid to the appellant would, I think, be taxable unless they fall within the first part of paragraph (b) of section 3 as being \u201cthe proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of the person insured.\u201d The income that is to be included under paragraph (b) is the income from the proceeds of such life insurance and the income from the payments made or credited to the insured. In my opinion the monthly instalments are as much proceeds of life insurance policies as any single cash payment and they are \u201cpaid upon the death of the person insured\u201d just as much as the single cash payment of $71,400 would have been had the appellant exercised the option given her by the policy. Counsel for the respondent attached considerable importance to paragraph (k) of subsection 1 of section 5 of the Act. It could never have been intended by Parliament, he argued, that twelve hundred dollars only, being income derived from annuity contracts with the Dominion Government, etc., should be exempt, and that the total of the monthly instalments received by Mrs. Shaw under the policy should be exempt. But it is quite clear, from the evidence of Mr. Blackadar given in the Exchequer Court in this case, that this policy is an entirely different thing from the annuity contracts issued by the Dominion Government. Whatever considerations may have moved Parliament to enact clause (k) of subsection 1 of section 5 in 1930 and 1932, with reference to agreements to pay an annuitant certain sums during his lifetime, can have no bearing, it seems to me, upon the question as to what are proceeds of life insurance policies paid upon the death of of the person insured, as mentioned in clause (b) of section 3. It is quite true that any income from these proceeds is taxable and that, therefore, there is more likely to be a large taxable income if a beneficiary under such a policy takes a lump sum in satisfaction of her claim, but all this is nihil ad rem.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the assessment of the monthly instalments for 1934 set aside, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S. Fisher.\n[1] [1939] Ex. C.R. 35.\n"}

C.\u2014New trial ordered\u2014Non-direction by trial judge on grounds not raised at the trial\u2014No exception taken by the Crown to the trial judge\u2019s charge\u2014Whether section 1013(4) Cr. C. applicable.\nThe appellant was tried on a charge of having murdered one Germaine Rochon in Montreal. The case presented by the Crown against the accused at the trial was that he had intentionally shot the deceased with the intention to kill her. The defence relied upon the testimony given by the appellant himself, that the shooting was the result of an accident. The trial judge instructed the jury, that if they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted. Such instruction was accepted as satisfactory by counsel for the Crown and for the accused and that it correctly formulated the single issue of fact which both counsel put before the jury as the sole issue upon which it was their duty to pass. The jury rendered a verdict of not guilty. The Crown appealed to the appellate court of Quebec, under the provisions of section 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code. A new trial was directed by that court on the ground that the trial judge had erred in his charge by omitting to instruct the jury, first, that from certain facts disclosed by the testimony of the appellant, the jury might have convicted the accused of murder under section 259 (c and d) Cr. C., and second, that the accused having in his charge a loaded firearm and being bound to take reasonable precautions to avoid danger to human life, the jury might have convicted the accused of manslaughter under section 247 and 252 (2) Cr. C. These grounds, raised by the Crown before the appellate court, were not considered nor suggested at the trial. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld that the appeal should be allowed, the order granting a new trial be set aside and the verdict of the jury acquitting the appellant be restored.\nSubsection 4 of section 1013 Cr. C. was not intended to confer jurisdiction upon an appellate court to set aside a verdict of acquittal on a trial for murder in such circumstances as those in this case and so entitle the Crown to an order for a new trial in order to present an entirely new case against the accused. APPEAL by the appellant from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, setting aside a verdict of acquittal rendered by a jury in a trial for murder and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAntoine Sen\u00e9cal K.C. and Alexandre Chevalier for the appellant.\nJohn E. Crankshaw K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of my brother Kerwin and with that judgment I agree. I desire particularly to emphasize the course of the trial, and as I conceive it, its bearing upon the application of section 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code.\nThe appellant was indicted of murder by the killing of Germaine Rochon on the 29th of June, 1938. The appellant and the deceased Germaine Rochon were alone together in his apartment in the house of one Donato when she was killed by a bullet discharged from a pistol. To Donato and his wife who entered almost immediately afterwards and found the woman dead and the appellant shot through the chest, he said, in effect, \u201cI shot her and then shot myself but she made me do it.\u201d\nThe appellant, after long treatment in the hospital, recovered and gave evidence at the trial on his own behalf. He testified that he was holding the pistol in his hand intending to shoot himself when the woman, realizing his intention, seized the weapon and, in the confusion which followed, it \u201cwent off,\u201d the bullet entering her body and killing her; and that he then turned the pistol upon himself.\nThe case presented by the Crown was that the appellant had intentionally shot the deceased Germaine Rochon with the intention of killing her. The defence relied upon the testimony given by the appellant himself. It was agreed by both counsel for the Crown and for the defence, and the learned trial judge so instructed the jury, that if they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted. I quote the words of the learned judge in which he summed up the whole matter at the request of counsel for the defence after the jury had retired and had been recalled:\nThe Court: Gentlemen, I have been asked by the defence attorneys, to give a further explanation on a certain point. I have told you that, if you are satisfied with the explanation given by the accused, that the shooting was an accident, that he was entitled to an acquittal, but I must add\u2014and I think I did\u2014I must add, even on that evidence, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt; that is, if you are not reasonably sure that his explanations are not true, that you must give him the benefit of the doubt and acquit him.\nThat is, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt on the entire evidence. You must be reasonably sure that he has committed the offence before finding him guilty.\nWe are left in no doubt that this instruction by the learned trial judge was accepted as satisfactory by counsel both for the Crown and for the accused and that it correctly formulated the single issue of fact which both counsel put before the jury as the sole issue upon which it was their duty to pass. Mr. Crankshaw, who appeared for the Crown, both at the trial and in this court, with the candour and sense of duty we should expect from him, stated that this was the only issue which counsel intended to put before the jury and did in fact put before them.\nTo the conduct of the trial, as a trial of that issue, no objection was or could be taken.\nThe principal grounds of appeal were: first, that the testimony of the appellant is susceptible of the interpretation that the accused intentionally discharged the weapon with the purpose of killing himself; and that it was by accident that the deceased was killed by the bullet intended by the accused for himself; and that, accordingly, the jury ought to have been instructed that if they so found they might convict the accused of murder in virtue of section 259 (c) of the Criminal Code; and\nSecond, the jury ought to have been instructed that the accused, having in his charge a loaded firearm that in the circumstances was calculated to endanger human life, in the absence of precaution or care, he was under a duty to take the necessary precautions to avoid such danger, and that if they thought the death of the deceased was due to his failure to perform such duty they might convict him of manslaughter. It was not suggested at the trial that the evidence of the accused was susceptible of the interpretation which is the basis of the first of these grounds. Such an interpretation of his evidence occurred to nobody. Nor did it occur to the Crown to suggest that a verdict of manslaughter might be rested upon the second ground.\nThe Crown asked the jury to reject the story told by the accused as a fabricated story and to find that he intentionally shot the deceased with the purpose of killing her. The Crown, by the appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in effect asked to have the verdict on this issue set aside, and to be permitted to present to another jury a case based upon the testimony of the accused and upon a construction of it which did not occur to anybody until after the verdict had been pronounced. At the new trial, of course, there would be nothing to prevent the Crown advancing the same case as at the former trial and supporting it by fresh evidence.\nI do not think subsection 4 of section 1013 was intended to confer jurisdiction to set aside a verdict of acquittal on a trial for murder in such circumstances. The point is not merely that the Crown did not take exception to the learned judge\u2019s charge. The conduct of the trial with respect to the single issue of fact which was raised by the case put forward by the Crown was admittedly unimpeachable. The jury were told by the Crown that the determination of that issue in favour of the accused would entitle him to an acquittal. To set aside a verdict of acquittal in such circumstances, merely because the case for the Crown might, on a possible view of the evidence, have been put upon another footing would, it appears to me, introduce a most dangerous practice; a practice not, I think, sanctioned by the statute.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014On a charge of having murdered Germaine Rochon on June 29th, 1938, the appellant Wexler was tried and acquitted. On appeal by the Crown to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, of the province of Quebec, a new trial was directed on the ground that the trial judge had erred by omitting in his charge any reference to paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 259 of the Criminal Code, and also to section 247 and paragraph 2 of section 252 of the Code. Wexler now appeals to this Court.\nIt appears from the evidence that for some time prior to June 29th, 1938, Wexler had been drinking heavily and had on several occasions formed the intention of committing suicide but that at the last moment he had, on each occasion, desisted. He was on intimate terms with Germaine Rochon, who several times had stayed with him in a boarding-house in two rooms consisting of a bedroom and sitting-room. He had been in possession of a revolver for some months before June 29th, 1938, and on the 28th of that month he purchased a box of cartridges. On the day in question the revolver was loaded with five of these cartridges and it, together with the remainder of the cartridges, were in his rooms. He stated that he had definitely made up his mind on June 28th to shoot himself. The girl spent that night with Wexler and all of the 29th down to the time of the shooting. The accused testified that he desired to do away with himself when he was alone; that he asked the girl to leave and that she went to the telephone and the bathroom and returned to the bedroom. While the evidence is not quite clear, I adopt the trial judge\u2019s understanding of it,\u2014that Wexler was in the sitting-room and that he brought the loaded revolver with him from the sitting-room to the bedroom where the girl was, with his finger on the trigger. Notwithstanding his desire to commit suicide when he was alone, Wexler\u2019s explanation of this last action of his is that he wanted to say good-bye. His account of what happened subsequently is as follows:\u2014\nWell, she seemed to see me playing with the revolver and I had gone over to the counter to take a drink and I was afraid that if I would wait I would not be able to kill myself once more as I tried before so I told her, I said \u201cGood-bye.\u201d I said \u201cGood-luck\u201d and I had the gun and she came over and said something\u2014I cannot remember exactly what\u2014but she grabbed hold of the gun and started to pull it and I fell with her on the bed. I do not remember exactly but the gun went off. Whether it went off while we were on the bed or before I cannot say for sure and after that she just got up like with a queer sort of a shock and walked towards the other door. I followed her so as to help her. I knew she was shot and she lay down and I could not pick her up. When I saw that I said \u201cThere is no use to wait any more\u201d and I took the gun and pulled it and I do not remember much after that. The case made by the Crown against the accused at the trial was that he intended to, and did kill the girl. The defence was that so far as the girl was concerned the affair was an accident. At no stage of the trial was the claim put forth that Wexler, while in the act of discharging the revolver at himself with intent to commit suicide, shot the girl. As appears from the evidence at the trial and from the charge of the learned trial judge, and as admitted by counsel for the Crown, no such claim was ever considered. Thus we find that after referring to the fact that Crown counsel had defined \u201cmurder,\u201d the judge stated in his charge:\u2014\nI think it is better for me to repeat it. You know what murder is. It is the killing of a human being, with malicious intent, with malice aforethought: Article 259 says that \u201cHomicide may be culpable and non-culpable, will be murder, in the following cases,\u201d\nand he then proceeded to read paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 259 of the Criminal Code. He continued:\u2014\nI need not say that in this case, if the accused, when he shot the girl, intended to kill her, it is murder; if you come to that conclusion, because it is the first paragraph, if the offender means to cause the death of the person killed\u2014when he used the revolver and intended to kill\u2014and as a matter of fact, did kill her, it is murder.\nThere are two other paragraphs in Article 259, but we are not interested in them; it is usually applied to other cases.\nCounsel for the Crown, at the conclusion of the charge, stated that he had no objection to it.\nHowever, before the Court of King\u2019s Bench and before this Court, it was urged that if Wexler, while discharging the revolver at himself, shot the girl, it would be murder, and that the trial judge should have so instructed the jury. Reliance was placed in the Court below and in argument before us on the charge to the jury in the case of Edward Hopwood[1]. From the report of the case, it appears:\u2014\nThe defence put forward by the appellant, who refused to be represented by counsel at the trial, was that he was shooting at himself, that the deceased tried to stop him, and that there was a struggle, in the course of which she was accidentally shot. The judge directed the jury that even if they accepted this defence it would constitute murder if the shot which killed her was intentionally fired for the purpose of killing himself, but the jury found the appellant guilty of shooting the woman intentionally.\nIt is not necessary that we should pass upon the correctness of the statement that \u201cit would constitute murder if the shot which killed her was intentionally fired for the purpose of killing himself,\u201d but, in any event, each word of it is significant and its real meaning may easily be overlooked. That meaning becomes clearer upon a perusal of a report of the proceedings on the last day of the trial on page 3 of the Times newspaper of December 12th, 1913, where it is stated:\u2014\nMr. Justice Avory, in summing up, explained the law applicable to the case and said that the questions for the jury were: (1) Did the prisoner intentionally discharge a loaded firearm at the deceased woman with intent to kill her or to do her grievous bodily harm? or (2) did he intentionally discharge it at himself with intent to kill himself and did the shot intended for himself kill the deceased? If either of these was the true view of these facts then the prisoner was guilty of murder. The third question for the jury was, Is it possible to accept the theory that the pistol went off by accident during a struggle to prevent him discharging it at himself, and was the death of the woman caused by his unlawful attempt to commit suicide? If so, they might find him guilty of manslaughter. If the death was not caused either of those ways then they might find the prisoner not guilty.\nIn that case, as explained in the report[2], the jury found the prisoner guilty of murder under the first heading referred to by Mr. Justice Avory. We do not know the exact particulars in Hopwood and in any event, circumstances vary to such a degree that except for any principle that may be involved, it is impossible to determine one case by a reference to the evidence in another.\nIt may be a difficult question to decide in any particular case whether there is any evidence that an accused has proceeded beyond a mere intention to an actual attempt to commit suicide. In this appeal we are not concerned with that problem nor with the one whether the Crown is bound by the failure of Crown counsel to point out to the trial judge an alleged omission in his charge on a question of law. The real point for determination is whether, after an accused person has been tried on a charge of murder and acquitted, the Crown is entitled to an order for a new trial in order to present an entirely new case against him.\nAn appeal is given the Crown by the 1930 amendment to section 1013 of the Code \u201con any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone.\u201d Assuming, without deciding, that the pertinent question here is one of law, the Crown\u2019s contention is not entitled to prevail. While Wexler had on June 28th formed the intention of committing suicide on June 29th, it was never suggested during the whole course of the trial, by cross-examination or otherwise, that the shot that killed Germaine Rochon had been intentionally discharged by the accused at himself with intent to kill himself, or that the death of the girl was caused by an attempt on Wexler\u2019s part to commit suicide. Similarly, the possession by Wexler of the revolver was not relied upon to raise a duty on his part to avoid danger to human life, under section 247; nor was the issue presented as to whether he would, in that event, fall under the terms of subsection 2 of section 252.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order granting a new trial set aside.\nCrocket J.\u2014I agree that in the circumstances disclosed by the trial record in this case, where the only issue raised by the Crown was as to whether the fatal shot was fired at the deceased intentionally, as claimed by the Crown, or whether the revolver went off accidentally, as claimed by the accused, and that issue was placed squarely before the jury in terms of which the Crown counsel expressly approved, section 1013 (4) of the Criminal Code cannot properly be relied upon to enable the Attorney-General to avail himself of grounds in the Appeal Court, which were never mooted upon the trial, for the purpose of sending the accused back to a new trial on a murder indictment. So far as the offence of murder was concerned, I think the learned trial judge\u2019s direction, having regard to the course of the trial, was unexceptionable, viz., that if the jury believed the accused\u2019s explanation of the shooting to be true, he was entitled to be acquitted of the charge of murder. There can be no doubt that the jury believed the accused\u2019s explanation and acquitted him for that reason. To subject him now, after he had been put in jeopardy, taken the stand in his own behalf and been acquitted on that indictment, to a new trial thereon on the ground that he might have been convicted of manslaughter if the Crown counsel had not failed to put this feature of the case forward on the trial would, it seems to me with all respect, be such a manifest injustice as Parliament could not well be deemed to have intended when it enacted this drastic amendment to the Criminal Code.\nFor these reasons I have concluded that the appeal should be allowed and the verdict of the jury restored.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1913] 8 Cr.

C.R. 65, holding that the application for patent in question had not been abandoned and directing that it be given further consideration by the Commissioner of Patents in accordance with the practice of the Patent Office, was affirmed.\nIn the provision in s. 31 of The Patent Act, 1985 (c. 32), that upon failure of the applicant for a patent to prosecute his application within six months \u201cafter any action thereon of which notice shall have been given to the applicant, such application shall be deemed to have been abandoned,\u201d the phrase \u201caction thereon\u201d (which means \u201caction\u201d on an \u201capplication for a patent\u201d) is not an apt description of a judgment of the Exchequer Court in exercise of the Court\u2019s authority under s. 22 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 150, as amended in 1932, c. 21); it means something done by the Patent Office. Where, in proceedings under said s. 22, rights as to claims in conflict in two applications for patent had been determined by judgment in the Exchequer Court, which was followed by issue of patent to the applicant whose claims had by that judgment been allowed, it was held that the applicant whose claims had by that judgment been disallowed, though it had notice of the judgment and took no steps in the Patent Office within six months thereafter, yet could not be said to have abandoned its application, in the absence of any notice having been given to it of \u201caction\u201d by the Patent Office. (The issue of the patent as aforesaid was an \u201caction\u201d within the above phrase in s. 31, and had there been evidence of notice thereof to the applicant whose claims had been disallowed, s. 31 would have come into play).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing the present respondent\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents holding that a certain application for patent for invention had been abandoned.\nIn January, 1932, an application was filed by Joshua and others for a patent of invention relating to \u201cthe Conversion of defines into Alcohols\u201d\u2014serial No. 385, 527. This was assigned to The Distillers Co. Ltd.\nIn June, 1932, an application was filed by Metzger for a patent of invention relating to \u201cManufacture of Alcohols\u201d\u2014serial No. 390, 541. This was assigned to Air Reduction Co., Inc., the present respondent.\nThe Commissioner of Patents was of opinion that there was apparent conflict between the two applications. The applicants deposited affidavits as required by s. 22 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 150, as amended by Statutes of 1932, c. 21). On August 23, 1934 the Commissioner advised that on the facts stated in the affidavits he would allow the claims in conflict to Metzger, assignor to Air Reduction Co. Inc., unless within a certain time (later extended) action be taken as provided in s. 22 (4) of the Patent Act (as amended as aforesaid). Accordingly, proceedings were commenced in the Exchequer Court in February, 1935, in which The Distillers Co. Ltd. appeared as plaintiff and Air Reduction Co. Inc. appeared as defendant.\nOn October 30, 1936, an Order for Judgment was made in the Exchequer Court as follows:\u2014\nThis action having come on this day before this Court on motion for judgment on behalf of the defendant, by consent, upon hearing read the pleadings and the consent to judgment signed by the Solicitors for both parties and upon hearing what was alleged by Counsel for the defendant, no one appearing for the plaintiff;\nThis Court Doth Order and Adjudge that as between the parties hereto, the defendant is entitled to the issue of a patent on its application, serial number 390,541, containing claims directed to the subject matter of the invention therein described.\nThis Court Doth Further Order and AdjudGe that the plaintiff is not entitled to the issue of a patent on its application, serial number 385,527, containing claims directed to the subject matter in conflict with subject matter claimed in defendant\u2019s application for patent, serial number 390,541.\nA certified copy of said judgment was sent to the Commissioner of Patents on November 25, 1936. A patent issued accordingly, dated March 16, 1937.\nOn July 13, 1938, the solicitor for Air Reduction Co. Inc. forwarded to the Commissioner of Patents an assignment dated October 28, 1935, by The Distillers Co. Ltd., to Air Reduction Co. Inc. of all the right, title and interest of The Distillers Co. Ltd. in and to the invention set forth and described in the specification of the application, serial No. 385,527. He also forwarded to the Commissioner of Patents copies of new claims \u201cdrawn to restrict the claims in such a manner that they may be distinguished from\u201d the allowed claims of the Metzger application. He asked that the claims in application, serial No. 385,527, be cancelled and the new claims be inserted in lieu thereof. In reply (August 6, 1938) the. Commissioner stated:\nIn reply I beg to advise that the Office holds the application abandoned. The Judgment of the Exchequer Court No. 16026 of October 30th, 1936, ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff, The Distillers Company, Limited, was not entitled to the issue of a patent in its application Serial. No. 385,527, containing claims directed to the subject matter in conflict, with application Serial No. 390,541. As all the claims were found in conflict there remained no claims of record in the present case, and the applicants in application Serial No. 385,527 did not present any amendment following the Judgment which was made of record in the case of the 25th of November, 1936.\nand in a letter of August 20, 1938 (replying to a further letter from the solicitors of Air Reduction Co. Inc.), the Commissioner further stated:\nThe judgment of the Court confirmed the award of the Office which: was communicated to the then attorney of record on the 23rd of August, 1934, and the judgment becomes, therefore, equivalent to an action by the Office, the status of the case being determined by the court action The Office holds that action may be taken in such case at any time within six months from the date of the Order of the Court and that application Serial No. 385,527 became abandoned at the expiry of six months from the 30th of October, 1936, that is on the 30th of April, 1937, and absolutely abandoned at the expiry of one year from that date.\nAs the conflicting application matured to patent on the 16th of\u2019 March, 1937, your clients had ample time after knowledge of the issued patent was open to the public to file an amendment in the above application. and in reply to a further letter of the solicitors, he wrote on September 22, 1938, holding that the application must be considered absolutely abandoned.\nAir Reduction Co. Inc. appealed from the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the Exchequer Court of Canada. Its appeal was allowed by Maclean J.[2]. In his judgment he stated that all that was decided in the conflict proceedings by the Court was that the claims of Distillers Company were refused and those of Air Reduction were allowed; that the application of Distillers Company was not disallowed or voided, and conceivably its specification might contain such disclosures as would warrant the grant of claims to invention which had not been hitherto claimed, and which might be distinguishable from the claims awarded to Metzger in the conflict proceedings; that the conflict proceedings took the applications out of the Patent Office temporarily, for the Court to decide to whom belonged the claims said to be in conflict; they were then remitted back to the Patent Office for action in accordance with the Order of the Court. He held that Distillers Company was entitled to notification of the effect of the judgment of the Court in the conflict proceedings, and until that notice was received the six months could not commence to run against that applicant; that the judgment of a Court cannot be construed as official action taken by the Patent Office.\nBy the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court the appeal was allowed and it was ordered and declared that application serial number 385,527 had not been abandoned and it was directed that the same be given further consideration by the Commissioner of Patents in accordance with the practice of the Patent Office.\nOn an application under s. 83 of the Exchequer Court Act, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by a Judge of this Court.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling and G. F. Henderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014This appeal turns upon the application of section 31 of the Patent Act:\n31. Each application for a patent shall be completed and prepared for examination within twelve months after the filing of the application, and in default thereof, or upon failure of the applicant to prosecute the same within six months after any action thereon of which notice shall have been given to the applicant, such application shall be deemed to have been abandoned, but it may be reinstated on petition presented to the Commissioner within twelve months after the date on which it was deemed to have been abandoned, and on payment of the prescribed fee, if the petitioner satisfies the Commissioner that the failure to prosecute the application within the time specified was not reasonably avoidable. An application so reinstated shall retain its original filing date.\nSection 22 of the Patent Act (Ch. 150, R.S.C., 1927, as amended by ch. 21, Stats, of 1932) is in these terms:\n(1) Where the Commissioner has before him two or more applications, each of which he considers would be allowable if each did not contain one or more claims describing as new and claiming an exclusive property or privilege in things or combinations so nearly identical that separate patents to different patentees should not be granted on such applications, he shall forthwith notify each of the applicants of the apparent conflict and transmit to each a copy of all the conflicting claims, together with a copy of this section.\n(2) Each of the applicants, within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner, shall either avoid the conflict by the amendment or cancellation of his claims or deposit with the Commissioner in a sealed envelope duly endorsed an affidavit setting out the date at which he conceived the idea of the invention described in the claims in conflict, the date and mode in which the idea was first formulated and\/or disclosed by him in writing or verbally and the dates and nature of the successive steps subsequently taken by him to develop and perfect the said invention from time to time up to the date of the filing of his application for patent.\n(3) No envelope containing any such affidavit as aforesaid shall be opened nor shall the affidavit be permitted to be inspected unless there continues to be a conflict between two or more applicants, in which event all the envelopes shall be opened contemporaneously and the Commissioner shall transmit copies of the affidavits to the several applicants, at the same time stating to which of them he would, on the facts stated in the several affidavits, allow the claims in conflict.\n(4) The claims in conflict shall be rejected or allowed accordingly unless within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner and notified to the several applicants one of them commences proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada for the determination of their respective rights, in which event the Commissioner shall suspend further action on the applications in conflict until in such action it has been determined either\n(i) that there is in fact no conflict between the claims in question, or\n(ii) that none of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict as applied for by him, or\n(iii) that a patent or patents, including substitute claims approved by the Court, may issue to one or more of the applicants, or\n(iv) that one of the applicants is entitled as against the others to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by him.\n(5) The Commissioner shall, upon the request of any of the parties to a proceeding under this section transmit to the Exchequer Court of Canada the papers on file in his office relating to the applications in conflict. The judgment of the Exchequer Court in the action brought by the Distillers Co. Ltd., pronounced on the 30th day of October, 1936, disposed of all questions with which the Air Reduction Co., Inc., were concerned and they accordingly became entitled to their patent; which was, in fact, issued on the 16th of March, 1937.\nThere can be no question that the applicants, who at the time were The Distillers Co., Ltd., had notice of the judgment of the Exchequer Court. The proper inference from the facts is that of this judgment, which was a consent judgment, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors of record had notice and notice to them was notice to the plaintiffs.\nThe phrase \u201caction thereon\u201d (which means \u201caction\u201d on an \u201capplication for a patent\u201d) as employed in section 31, is not an apt description of a judgment of the Exchequer Court in exercise of the Court\u2019s authority under section 22; and I think, notwithstanding its inexactitude, that it means something done by the Patent Office. I think the issue of the patent was such \u201caction\u201d and if there had been evidence of notice to the applicant, section 31 would have come into play.\nWhatever may be said with regard to the judgment of the Exchequer Court, there is, it is quite clear enough, no evidence that notice of this \u201caction\u201d by the Patent Office was \u201cgiven to the applicant.\u201d\nAn assignment of October, 1935, from the Distillers Co., Ltd., to the respondents is put in evidence, but it was not registered and the Distillers Company continued for a year to be parties of record in their own action. Registration did not take place until some time in 1938, considerably over a year after the issue of the patent. There does not appear to be evidence from which an inference can be drawn that notice to the respondents involved notice to the Distillers Company, who at the pertinent time were the \u201capplicant\u201d within the meaning of section 31.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. No order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ewart, Scott, Kelley, Scott & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Henderson, Herridge, Gowling & MacTavish.\n[1] [1939] Ex.

In 1931 M. Co. had transferred to plaintiff 350,000 shares which it held in P. Co. It appeared that this transfer was made without the authority of the shareholders of M. Co. being given in accordance with the terms under which M. Co. held the shares. By the agreement now in question (of 1934) defendants, who were directors of M. Co., bought from plaintiff 240,000 shares of P. Co. at 7 cents a share and gave an option to plaintiff to repurchase 140,000 of said shares at 8 cents a share within nine months, but this option was \u201ccontingent upon the fact\u201d that defendants were to call a meeting of the stockholders of M. Co. \u201cwithin a reasonable time after the date of this agreement\u201d and submit to that meeting the question of ratifying said transaction of 1931, and if at said meeting the holders of 51% of the shares of M. Co. did not vote for such ratification, \u201cthe option hereby given shall become and be deemed null and of no effect.\u201d It was also provided that when and as soon as defendants received proxies from stockholders holding 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of M. Co. for voting at the meeting, defendants would cause a meeting to be called to consider such ratification. No meeting was called nor was the option exercised within the nine months. The trial judge held that under the agreement the duty of obtaining proxies and calling the meeting fell primarily upon defendants and, as plaintiff could not exercise the option until the meeting was called and the requisite approval obtained, plaintiff was entitled to a declaration that the option was still in force and would remain so for a fixed period to enable the meeting to be held, and to that extent the agreement might be reformed. On appeal by defendants, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held against the relief granted at the trial, but held that under the agreement defendants were obliged to call the meeting within the option period of nine months, that their failure to do so was breach of the agreement in a matter vital to its whole operation, that by such breach plaintiff had lost the chance of an approval of the holders of 51% of the shares within said nine months, and had lost the option, and gave judgment for damages with a reference to ascertain the amount. Defendants appealed.\nHeld: There was an obligation on defendants to call the meeting, as held in the Court of Appeal, but the judgment should have been for nominal damages only. Plaintiff had not developed at the trial any claim for damages on the basis of a breach of contract in not calling the meeting; there was no evidence that there was any reasonable probability that if the meeting had been called within the nine months a favourable vote of the holders of 51% of the shares could have been obtained; the plain inference from the evidence was that a favourable vote could not have been obtained. Further (per the Chief Justice and Davis J.), even had the meeting been called and a favourable vote obtained, plaintiff\u2019s option, in view of the evidence as to the market value of the shares, was not of any real value to him. (Per Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: Chaplin v. Hicks, [1911] 2 K.B. 786, and Carson v. Willitts, 65 Ont. L.R. 456, discussed; those cases afford no authority justifying the awarding of any more than nominal damages for the loss of a mere chance of possible benefit except upon evidence proving that there was some reasonable probability of the plaintiff realizing therefrom an advantage of some real substantial monetary value. Sapwell v. Bass, [1910] 2 K.B. 486 also cited).\nThere had been a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiff had claimed in his pleadings (inter alia) \u201c$50,000 as damages for breach of contract,\u201d and the record contained an affidavit on behalf of defendants on information and belief that plaintiff\u2019s counsel intended to produce evidence, on the reference, to establish damages much in excess of $2,000. The Court (in a judgment given prior to judgment on the merits) held (Crocket J. not concurring) that defendants had not established that \u201cthe amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of $2,000\u201d (Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 39) and in the absence of leave to appeal the appeal could not be entertained. (Having regard to circumstances in the case, opportunity was given to ask the Court of Appeal for such leave, which was granted).\nAPPEAL by the defendants (other than the defendant company; the individual defendants are hereinafter called the defendants) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, on appeal to that Court by the defendants from the judgment of Kingstone J. at trial in favour of the plaintiff, also gave judgment for the plaintiff but for relief different in its nature from that allowed by the trial judge. In 1931 March Gold Inc. had transferred to plaintiff 350,000 shares of stock in Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. (the defendant company). Apparently, through inadvertence, this transfer was made without the authority of the shareholders of March Gold Inc. being given in accordance with the terms under which March Gold Inc. held the shares. Defendants were directors of March Gold Inc. and wished to be in a position to meet any objections that might be made by shareholders to said transfer. The agreement now in question, of October 4, 1934, was made between plaintiff and defendants. It provided for plaintiff transferring to defendants 240,000 shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., at 7 cents per share (this was done), and for an option to plaintiff to repurchase 140,000 of said shares at 8 cents per share within nine months from the date of the agreement, defendants not to be required to deliver said stock within six months if for certain reasons they deemed it inadvisable to do so.\nBy clause 5 of the agreement the option was \u201cfurther contingent upon the fact\u201d that defendants were to call a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., \u201cwithin a reasonable time after the date of this agreement\u201d and submit to said meeting the question of ratifying said transfer of 350,000 shares to plaintiff in 1931, \u201cand that if at said meeting the holders of 51% of the shares of stock of March Gold, Inc., do not vote\u201d to ratify said transfer made in 1931, then \u201cthe option hereby given shall become and be deemed null and of no effect.\u201d\nBy clause 6 it was provided that when and as soon as defendants or their agents and representatives received proxies from stockholders of March Gold, Inc., holding 51% of the issued and outstanding stock of that corporation, authorizing the voting of said shares at the meeting, the defendants would cause the Chairman of the Board of Directors of March Gold, Inc., to call a meeting of the stockholders to consider the sale and\/or disposition of said 350,000 shares and the ratification of the contract made in 1931.\nThe provisions of the agreement and the facts of the case are more fully set out in the judgments now reported.\nThe plaintiff sued for enforcement of said option and certain further and alternative relief (including an injunction against selling, etc., the shares, and \u201c$50,000 as damages for breach of contract\u201d). The trial judge, Kingstone J., found that plaintiff had not, prior to the expiry of the nine months option period, notified defendants in any formal manner that he was exercising the option; that no meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., was called or held pursuant to clauses 5 and 6 of the agreement; that plaintiff could not exercise the option or right to repurchase until the meeting was called and approval of the transaction of 1931 obtained; that the duty of obtaining proxies and calling the meeting fell primarily upon defendants. He held that plaintiff was entitled to a declaration that the option was still in full force and effect and would remain so for a period of four months from the date of judgment to enable the meeting to be held, and to that extent there might be a reformation of the agreement; that plaintiff was entitled to an injunction against disposing of or dealing with the 140,000 shares until after the holding of the meeting.\nThe (individual) defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. That Court held that there was an obligation under clause 5 on defendants to call the meeting within a reasonable time; that such reasonable time was necessarily within the option period of nine months, and consequently there was breach by defendants of the agreement in a matter vital to its whole operation; that the result of such breach was that the plaintiff had lost the chance of an approval by 51% of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc., within said period of nine months; that the Court could not override the express terms of the agreement that the option expired at the end of nine months or extend this period; that there was no basis on which to reform the agreement; that therefore the judgment of the trial judge should be varied by declaring that defendants had committed a breach of agreement as aforesaid, whereby plaintiff\u2019s option to purchase 140,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., had been lost; that there should be a reference to the Master to enquire and report the damages thereby suffered by the plaintiff, the plaintiff to be at liberty to enter judgment on confirmation of the Master\u2019s report for the amount found. The injunction granted at trial was vacated.\nThe defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. There was a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on which questions arose as to whether the appeal had been brought within the statutory time and as to whether there was an \u201camount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal\u201d sufficient to give jurisdiction.\nA motion had been made by defendants to the Court of Appeal for Ontario to allow the appeal and security thereon, and alternatively, if the Court should consider that the time for bringing the appeal had expired, for an order extending the time, and also alternatively, if the Court should consider that the amount or value of the matters in controversy in the appeal did not exceed $2,000, for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. On that motion, the Court of Appeal, having regard to certain proceedings and determinations in settlement of the minutes of judgment, held that time had commenced to run in this case, for the purpose of an appeal, from the date when the judgment was finally settled and entered, and on this basis the appeal was brought in time, and the security was allowed[1]. This order did not deal with the question of the amount or value involved. A clause in an affidavit in support of the motion before the Court of Appeal was that\nThe amount claimed by the statement of claim herein for damages for breach of contract is $50,000 and I am informed by counsel for the plaintiff and verily believe that he intends to produce evidence on the proposed reference to establish damages substantially in excess of $2,000. * * * Exhibit D * * * is a true copy of a memorandum * * * delivered * * * by the solicitors for the plaintiff setting out the heads of damage proposed to be established by him.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada heard argument on the motion to quash and also argument on the merits.\nE. Bristol K.C. and N.E. Phipps for the appellants.\nA.C. Heighington K.C. and H.G. Steen for the respondent (plaintiff).\nJ.E. Corcoran K.C. for defendant company, respondent.\nJudgment was reserved. On a subsequent day the Court delivered judgment on the motion as follows:\n\u201cIn the opinion of the majority of the Court (Mr. Justice Crocket not concurring in this) the appellant has not established that the \u201camount or value of the matter in controversy in\u201d this \u201cappeal exceeds the sum of $2,000\u201d and, in the absence of leave, therefore, the appeal, for want of jurisdiction, cannot be entertained.\n\u201cIt appears that an application for leave to appeal was made by the appellant to the Court of Appeal and it seems that this application was not dealt with by that court. We are not satisfied that the Court of Appeal would not have granted the application for leave if they had thought that an appeal de plano was incompetent. In the circumstances, we think the appellant should have an opportunity of renewing his application for leave to the Court of Appeal and, in the meantime and for that purpose, further proceedings in the appeal should be stayed.\u201d\nSpecial leave to appeal was subsequently granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Supreme Court of Canada on a subsequent day delivered judgment on the merits.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) sought in this action specific performance against the individual defendants (appellants) of an alleged contract for the sale of 140,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., at 8 cents a share. The plaintiff alleged tender of the purchase price before action and pleaded his willingness and readiness to perform on his part the alleged contract for the purchase of the said shares. That was the main claim of the plaintiff in the action. After an extended trial the plaintiff failed on this claim. Alternatively, the plaintiff claimed cancellation of the alleged contract and the return to him of 240,000 shares of the same stock which he had previously sold and delivered to the individual defendants, on repayment by him of the amount received by him for those shares. The plaintiff failed at the trial on this claim as well. No appeal was taken by the plaintiff from the judgment at the trial in respect of these two claims. The result is that the action came to an end, in so far as these two claims are concerned, with the judgment at the trial.\nThe plaintiff, however, had made a further alternative claim in his prayer: a declaration that his right to repurchase the 140,000 shares under the contract, dated October 4th, 1934, notwithstanding that it contained a limitation of time of nine months, had not been determined (the writ was not issued until November 24th, 1936) and was still in full force and effect and would so remain until a meeting of the shareholders of another company, March Gold, Inc., had been held. The plaintiff succeeded at the trial on this claim. The trial judge ordered the reformation of the said contract; extended for a period of four months from the date of the judgment the time for the running of the plaintiff\u2019s right or option for the purchase of the 140,000 shares; declared that it was the duty of the individual defendants under the terms of the contract to cause a meeting of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc., to be held for the purpose of considering the question of ratifying, confirming and approving a prior sale and transfer of 350,000 shares of the Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. to the plaintiff which had been made by the directors of March Gold, Inc. on or about the 12th of June, 1931; restrained the individual defendants from transferring, disposing of or otherwise dealing in Ontario with the said 140,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. until after the holding of the meeting of the shareholders of March Gold Inc. and restrained Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. (which was a party defendant in the action) from accepting or recording any transfer of the said 140,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. until after the meeting of the shareholders of March Gold Inc. had been held.\nFrom that judgment the individual defendants (appellants in this Court) appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which Court unanimously disagreed with the conclusion of the trial judge on the last mentioned branch of the case, holding that the contract plainly contemplated and provided a fixed period of nine months, from its date, for the holding of a meeting of the shareholders of March Gold Inc. and the exercise of the option, if such right became available as a result of the vote at such meeting.\nBut the Court of Appeal, while holding that the contract had expired nine months from its date and that there was no ground upon which the Court was justified in extending the time, held that the plaintiff was entitled to damages against the individual defendants for their breach of the contract in failing to call a meeting of March Gold Inc., and accordingly varied the judgment at the trial as follows:\n(1) This Court doth order and adjudge that the plaintiff do recover from the individual defendants the damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the breach by the individual defendants of their obligation under clause 5 of the Agreement in question in this action to call a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold Inc. within the period of nine months from the date of such agreement during which the option granted to the plaintiff by the said agreement to purchase 140,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc., existed.\n(2) And this Court doth further order that it be referred to the Master of this Court to ascertain the amount of the said damages, the costs of such reference to be in the discretion of the said Master.\nFrom that judgment the individual defendants have appealed to this Court. No cross-appeal was taken and therefore the sole issue in the appeal is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled, upon the particular facts and circumstances of the case, to a judgment for damages with a reference to ascertain their amount.\nIt is unnecessary to review the evidence in detail. The essential facts are few and are not really in dispute. The plaintiff had, on or about June 12th, 1931, acquired 350,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. by a sale and transfer to him of the said shares from the directors of March Gold Inc. Both companies had been incorporated and organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States, but the former named company, Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. (made a party defendant in this action), has an office within the province of Ontario, where the stock transfer books of the company are kept. The individual defendants in the action were directors of March Gold Inc. at the time of the said sale and transfer of the 350,000 shares of the Porcupine Company, and had, inadvertently it would appear, failed to obtain the authority of the shareholders of March Gold Inc. to the said sale and transfer of the said Porcupine shares to the plaintiff. These shares had been held by March Gold Inc. under the terms of an agreement of February, 1929, which had provided that the shares should be held\nin trust for the sole, exclusive and continuing benefit of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc.\nand could\nnot be sold or otherwise disposed of until and unless not less than 51% of the entire issued and outstanding stock of March Gold, Inc. vote its approval at a meeting of shareholders called by the Chairman of the Board of March Gold, Inc. It seems to have been agreed by the parties that this omission had the effect of leaving the directors open to an action by the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. for breach of trust in disposing of the shares in contravention of the terms of the said arrangement, and perhaps of leaving the plaintiff\u2019s title to the shares doubtful.\nIn order to avoid the risk of liability to their shareholders for the unauthorized sale of these shares, and to put themselves in a position where they could satisfy the demands of any shareholders of March Gold, Inc. who might attack the transaction, the directors in October, 1934, repurchased from the plaintiff 240,000 of these shares at the price of 7 cents a share. This number of shares was calculated to be sufficient to meet any demands of any shareholders of March Gold, Inc. who might complain of the earlier transaction. The purchase and sale of the 240,000 shares between the plaintiff and the individual defendants was in writing, dated October 4th, 1934, and was carried out. The contract, however, contained a provision whereby the plaintiff was given the right or option to repurchase 140,000 of the 240,000 shares of the Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. at 8 cents per share,\nprovided that said stock is purchased within nine (9) months of the date hereof, and upon the further understanding and agreement that the purchasers (i.e., the individual defendants) shall not be required to deliver said stock to Hyman (the plaintiff) within six (6) months of the date hereof, if, in their discretion, they deem it inadvisable to sell or transfer said stock by reason of any possible claims that may exist in relation thereto in favour of March Gold, Inc. and\/or in favour of its stockholders.\nWhenever called upon after said six (6) months and within nine (9) months, the purchasers proportionally shall re-transfer and deliver to Hyman at Fort Erie, Province of Ontario, said shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., as aforesaid, in blocks of ten thousand (10,000) shares or more, as Hyman may require.\nThe contract contained the further express condition as to the right or option for the repurchase of the 140,000 shares:\nThis option is further contingent upon the fact that the purchasers (i.e., the individual defendants) are to call a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., within a reasonable time after the date of this agreement and submit to said meeting of stockholders the question of ratifying, confirming and approving the delivery of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., to Hyman, and that if at said meeting the holders of fifty-one (51%) per cent. of the shares of stock of March Gold, Inc., do not vote to approve, ratify and confirm the delivery of said Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., stock to Hyman as aforesaid, that then and in that event the option hereby given shall become and be deemed null and of no effect; * * *\nThe contract continues (it is unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to quote intervening provisions which have no application now):\nWhen and as soon as the purchasers (i.e., the individual defendants), or their agents and representatives, receive proxies from stockholders of March Gold, Inc. holding fifty\u2011one (51%) per cent. of the issued and outstanding stock of such corporation, authorizing the respective attorneys therein named to vote said shares at a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, to consider the sale or disposition of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., the purchasers will cause the Chairman of the Board of Directors of March Gold, Inc., to call a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., at a fixed time and place, pursuant to the by-laws of such corporation, to consider the sale and\/or disposition of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., and the confirmation and ratification of the said contract between Hyman and others, on the one part, and March Gold, Inc., and others, on the other, dated on or about June 12th, 1931, and all amendments and supplements thereto.\nIt is admitted that the individual defendants were in a position, had they so desired, at any time during the nine months period to call a meeting of March Gold, Inc.\nIt is plain that the plaintiff\u2019s right to repurchase the 140,000 shares could not arise until a meeting was called of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. and until fifty-one per cent. of the shares of the said company had been voted in favour of the approval, ratification and confirmation of the original sale of the 350,000 Porcupine shares by March Gold, Inc. to the plaintiff.\nIt is not disputed that no meeting of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. was called.\nWe agree with the view taken in the Court of Appeal that upon the true construction of the contract the individual defendants were under an obligation to the plaintiff to call a meeting of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. within the period of nine months fixed by the contract and sooner if they received sufficient proxies from the shareholders to vote in favour of the ratification of the original transaction. It is not disputed that the individual defendants did not receive such proxies, but it was none the less their duty to call the meeting. To that extent there was a breach of the contract. Was this a case for merely nominal damages or can it be properly said that it is a case for substantial damages? The Court of Appeal undoubtedly treated the case as one for substantial damages. The reasons for judgment of Masten J.A. were concurred in by the other members of the Court. That learned Judge of Appeal said:\nI would therefore vary the judgment of the learned trial judge by declaring that the defendants have committed a breach of the provisions of the agreement in the pleadings mentioned whereby the option of the plaintiff to purchase 140,000 shares of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. has been lost, and would direct a reference to the Master to inquire and report the damages thereby suffered by the plaintiff, the plaintiff to be at liberty to enter judgment on confirmation of the Master\u2019s report for the amount so found and the costs of the reference to be in the discretion of the Master.\nThe plaintiff in his prayer for relief in his statement of claim did claim, under paragraph (f), \u201c$50,000 as damages for breach of contract,\u201d but did not in any way develop at the trial any claim for damages on the basis of a breach of the contract in not calling the meeting. His two main claims were specific performance or, in the alternative, an extension of time for the holding of the meeting. The whole action was developed and fought out at the trial on those two principal issues. There was no evidence that there was any reasonable probability that if a meeting had been called within the nine months, a favourable vote of fifty-one per cent. of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. could have been obtained. No demand was made by the plaintiff within the nine months period for the calling of the meeting and it cannot be said to have been a deliberate and intentional disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s right. The plain inference from the evidence is that a favourable vote could not have been obtained.\nAssuming in the plaintiff\u2019s favour that the meeting had been called within the nine months period and that fifty-one per cent. of the shares had voted in favour of the ratification of the transaction, and thereby the option had become open to the plaintiff, would he have exercised it? Was the right of any real value to him? If he could have bought the same shares on the market at the stipulated price, or at a lower price, the right would have been of no money value and the breach of the contract would not have involved any loss. This disregards the suggestion that a favourable vote in ratification of the original transaction would have made the title to the plaintiff\u2019s remaining shares unquestionable, but nothing was made of that point either in the pleadings or in the evidence. The whole action in its several branches was based upon the refusal or failure of the individual defendants to resell to the plaintiff the 140,000 shares at the option price of 8 cents a share. Where there is a market in the shares, the proper measure of damages in general is the difference between the contract price and the market price of such shares at the time when the contract was broken, because if the purchaser has the money in his hands he may go into the market and buy. The evidence as to the prevailing market price of the shares in question during the nine months period is not as explicit as it might be but it is sufficient, I think, to indicate that if the plaintiff really wanted 140,000 shares at the time he could have bought them on the market at a price equal to, and perhaps considerably less than, the stipulated price. The agreement, to repeat, was October 4th, 1934, and the nine months would expire on July 4th, 1935. Moore, an attorney who had been practising in Buffalo since 1899, testified that\nWhen the option expired, Porcupine stock was selling around 5 cents a share.\nKinkel testified that on January 1st, 1935, or thereabouts, he sold 5,000 shares at 6 cents a share and that he bought 5,000 shares on November 17th, 1934, at 4\u00bd cents a share, on June 5th, 1935, 4,000 shares at about 5 and 8\/10 cents a share, and on June 7th, 1935, he bought 1,000 shares at 5 and 3\/10 cents per share. He testified further that on December 28th, 1935 (nearly six months after the expiration of the nine months period) he bought a 1,000-share block at 3 cents a share. During 1936 the market appears to have improved. Kinkel says that the group of individual defendants bought 200,000 shares, paying 8 cents a share for 140,000 and 10 cents a share for 60,000 shares. The exact date is not made plain but I take it from his evidence it was somewhere around June, 1936.\nKinkel further testified that\nDuring the period of the nine months I naturally assumed that Mr. Hyman, making no effort to bring in proxies or give me his proxy, was not interested in acquiring the stock under those circumstances at 8 cents a share, and therefore made no effort to force him to get proxies. If the plaintiff had intended to establish a claim for substantial damages for the breach of the contract in not calling the meeting (which is the claim that the Court of Appeal allowed), he should have developed, if it were possible, that branch of the case at the trial by giving at least some evidence upon which it would appear likely that a favourable vote could have been obtained within the period of nine months, had a meeting been called, and that the option would have been of some real monetary value to him. But the plaintiff made no such case at the trial and under the circumstances I think, with the greatest respect, that the Court of Appeal should have given judgment for nominal damages only. The courts should insist upon as much certainty and particularity, both in pleading and proof of damage, as is reasonable having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the breach complained of.\nThe question of jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal was raised by counsel for the plaintiff (respondent) upon the ground that the \u201camount or value of the matter in controversy\u201d in the appeal did not exceed the sum of $2,000 and that, in the absence of leave, the appeal should fail for want of jurisdiction. Since the issue of a memorandum by the Court on June 27th last, the Court of Appeal for Ontario has granted leave to appeal (September 15th) and we are therefore now in a position to dispose of the appeal.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgment appealed from set aside and judgment should be entered in favour of the plaintiff (respondent) against the individual defendants (appellants) in the sum of $1.00 with costs of the action on the High Court scale without a set-off. The appellants (the individual defendants) should be allowed their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court against the plaintiff (respondent).\nThe appellants made the Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc. a party respondent to this appeal but made no claim for relief against it and at the conclusion of the argument we dismissed the appeal as against this respondent with costs. The judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET, J.\u2014This case having previously been fully argued both on the jurisdictional ground and on the merits, the court pronounced its judgment on the jurisdictional question on June 27th, holding that there was no jurisdiction to hear the appeal without a special order of the Court of Appeal and staying further proceedings in order to give the appellant an opportunity of renewing an application to the Court of Appeal for such special leave. Special leave to appeal having been granted in the meantime, we are now in a position without further argument to deal with the merits of the appeal.\nThe controversy involved in this appeal arises out of an agreement entered into between the respondent (Hyman) and the appellants (Kinkel et al.) on October 4th, 1934. This agreement was made to adjust some difficulties, which had resulted from the previous sale to Hyman by the appellants, acting as directors of March Gold Inc., of 350,000 shares of the stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc., held by the former corporation and which sale had not been ratified by the stockholders of that corporation as required by its by-laws. By it Hyman agreed to sell to the appellants 240,000 shares of the stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines Inc., at 7 cents per share, with an option to him to repurchase 140,000 of them at 8 cents per share within nine months of the date of the agreement, and upon the further understanding and agreement that the appellants should not be required\nto deliver said stock to Hyman within six months of the date hereof, if in their discretion they deem it unadvisable to sell or transfer said stock by reason of any possible claims that may exist in relation thereto in favour of March Gold, Inc., and\/or in favour of its stockholders,\nand the appellants agreed whenever called upon after the said six months and within nine months to retransfer and deliver to Hyman said shares of stock in blocks of 10,000 shares or more as Hyman might require. This option was further conditioned upon the appellants calling a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold Inc. within a reasonable time after the date of the agreement for the purpose of ratifying the previous 350,000 shares sale to Hyman. The latter condition is fully set out in paragraph 5, the material portion of which reads as follows:\nThis option is further contingent upon the fact that the Purchasers are to call a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., within a reasonable time after the date of this agreement and submit to said meeting of stockholders the question of ratifying, confirming and approving the delivery of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., to Hyman, and that if at said meeting the holders of fifty-one (51%) per cent. of the shares of stock of March Gold, Inc., do not vote to approve, ratify and confirm the delivery of said Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc. stock to Hyman as aforesaid, that then and in that event the option hereby given shall become and be deemed null and of no effect; and in the event that the holders of fifty-one (51%) per cent. of the shares of stock of March Gold, Inc., shall vote for the approval of the transfer and assignment of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc. by March Gold, Inc., to Hyman, then the Purchasers shall deliver the said one hundred forty thousand (140,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc. to Hyman as and when he exercises his option, as hereinabove provided, unless prior to the expiration date of said option there shall be pending in any Court an action by any person or corporation to determine the existing rights of March Gold, Inc. stockholders in and to said stock, or any part thereof, in which event the time of exercising said option shall be extended until the final determination favourable to the defendant or defendants therein, of any action in respect thereto.\nParagraph 6, which is the only other part of the agreement with which we are concerned, reads as follows:\nWhen and as soon as the Purchasers, or their agents and representatives, receive proxies from stockholders of March Gold, Inc. holding fifty-one (51%) per cent. of the issued and outstanding stock of such Corporation, authorizing the respective attorneys therein named to vote said shares at a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, to consider the sale or disposition of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., the Purchasers will cause the Chairman of the Board of Directors of March Gold, Inc., to call a meeting of the stockholders of March Gold, Inc., at a fixed time and place, pursuant to the by-laws of such Corporation, to consider the sale and\/or disposition of said three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) shares of stock of Porcupine United Gold Mines, Inc., and the confirmation and ratification of the said contract between Hyman and others, on the one part and March Gold, Inc., and others, on the other, dated on or about June 12th, 1931, and all amendments and supplements thereto.\nThe Appeal Court was of opinion that the two paragraphs were independent and consistent with each other and that effect must be given to both. It therefore decided that paragraph 5 imposed upon the appellants an obligation to call a meeting of March Gold, Inc., with- in a reasonable time, that such reasonable time was necessarily within the period of nine months during which the option granted to the plaintiff existed and that there was a breach of the agreement on the part of the appellants in a matter vital to its whole operation, whereby Hyman had lost the chance of an approval of 51% of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc., within the period of nine months during which his option was in existence, and directed a reference to the Master to enquire and report the damages thereby suffered by the respondent Hyman.\nWhile I agree with the Court of Appeal that there was a breach of the agreement on the part of the appellants in not calling a meeting of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. within a reasonable time, whereby the respondent lost the chance of the 51% approval of the original sale, I am of opinion that the clear inference from the undisputed facts disclosed by the evidence is that if a meeting had been called within the nine months, the chance of ratification of the original sale, which was necessary to save the option, was practically nil and therefore of no real value to the respondent. Certainly the respondent produced no evidence to shew that there was any reasonable probability of his obtaining the desired ratification had such a meeting been called and made no attempt to develop on the trial this branch of his case, upon which the judgment now appealed against wholly turned. For this reason I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal should have entered a judgment for nominal damages only.\nIt is quite evident from the reasons of Masten, J.A., concurred in by Fisher and Henderson, JJ.A., that these learned Appeal Judges would not have ordered a reference had they not been of opinion that the chance of obtaining ratification of the original sale might possibly be found to be of substantial value and that this opinion was founded upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Chaplin v. Hicks[2], which was followed by the Appeal Court in Carson v. Willitts[3].\nWith all respect, the present case, I think, is distinguishable from Chaplin v. Hicks2. There the jury had actually found, in answer to the question put to them by the trial judge, that the defendant did not take reason- able means to give the plaintiff an opportunity of presenting herself for selection as one of a class of fifty ladies desirous of securing engagements as actresses, from whom twelve winners were to be chosen, to whom the defendant undertook to give three-year engagements (to the first four at \u00a35 per week, to the second four at \u00a34 per week and to the third four at \u00a33 per week) and assessed the damages at \u00a3100. As Vaughan Williams, L.J., points out, the average chance of each competitor was one in four.\nThe judgment in that case really proceeded on the ground that difficulty or impossibility of ascertaining damages with certainty does not render damages unassessable and that in any such case it is for the jury to do the best they can in determining the amount, which they think will justly compensate the plaintiff for a breach of contract.\nVaughan Williams, L.J., in the course of his reported reasons, said:\nThere are cases, no doubt, where the loss is so dependent on the mere unrestricted volition of another that it is impossible to say that there is any assessable loss resulting from the breach. In the present case there is no such difficulty.\nHe concluded:\nThe jury came to the conclusion that the taking away from the plaintiff of the opportunity of competition, as one of a body of fifty, when twelve prizes were to be distributed, deprived the plaintiff of something which had a monetary value. I think that they were right and that this appeal fails.\nThe opinion of Fletcher Moulton, L.J., proceeded upon the same ground, though in the course of his reasons he said he could find no authority for the proposition that where the volition of another comes between the competitor and what he hopes to get under the contract, no damages could as a matter of law be given. I reproduce the following illuminating passages from His Lordship\u2019s reported reasons:\nIs expulsion from a limited class of competitors an injury? To my mind there can be only one answer to that question: it is an injury and may be a very substantial one. Therefore the plaintiff starts with an unchallengeable case of injury, and the damages given in respect of it should be equivalent to the loss. But it is said that the damages cannot be arrived at because it is impossible to estimate the quantum of the reasonable probability of the plaintiff\u2019s being a prize-winner. I think that, where it is clear that there has been actual loss resulting from the breach of contract, which it is difficult to estimate in money, it is for the jury to do their best to estimate; it is not necessary that there should be an absolute measure of damages in each case.\n* * *\nI cannot lay down any rule as to the measure of damages in such a case; this must be left to the good sense of the jury. They must of course give effect to the consideration that the plaintiff\u2019s chance is only one out of four and that they cannot tell whether she would have ultimately proved to be the winner. But having considered all this they may well think that it is of considerable pecuniary value to have got into so small a class, and they must assess the damages accordingly.\nFarwell, L.J., after pointing out that in an action for unliquidated damages the assessment of the amount is ordinarily for the jury, and that the words \u201cchance\u201d and \u201cprobability\u201d may be treated as being practically interchangeable, said:\nThe necessary ingredients of such an action are all present; the defendant has committed a breach of his contract, the damages claimed are a reasonable and probable consequence of that breach, and loss has accrued to the plaintiff at the time of action. It is obvious, of course, that the chance or probability may in a given case be so slender that a jury could not properly give more than nominal damages, say one shilling; if they had done so in the present case, it would have been entirely a question for them, and this Court could not have interfered. But in the present competition we find chance upon chance, two of which the plaintiff had succeeded in passing; from being one of six thousand she had become a member of a class of fifty, and, as I understand it, was first in her particular division by the votes of readers of the paper; out of those fifty there were to be selected twelve prizewinners; it is obvious that her chances were then far greater and more easily assessable than when she was only one of the original six thousand. If the plaintiff had never been selected at all, the case would have been very different; but that was not the case.\nI may add that at the conclusion of his reasons Fletcher Moulton, L.J., referred to the decision of Jelf, J., in Sapwell v. Bass[4]. In that case the plaintiff was a breeder of race horses and the defendant the owner of a renowned stallion and it had been agreed between them that the defendant\u2019s stallion should serve one of the plaintiff\u2019s brood mares in consideration of a sum of 315 guineas to be paid by the plaintiff at the time of such service. The defendant afterwards sold the stallion to a purchaser in South Africa and thus precluded himself from carrying out the contract. In an action for breach of contract, Jelf, J., who tried the case without a jury, held that the plaintiff was only entitled to nominal damages. Fletcher Moulton stated that in his opinion that decision was right on the facts of the particular case for the reason that there was no evidence to shew that the right was worth more to the plaintiff than the 315 guineas, which he would have had to pay for the service of the stallion, and that there was therefore no evidence that the damages were more than nominal.\nIn the Ontario case of Carson v. Willitts[5], which was an action for the breach by the defendant of a contract to bore three oil wells in a specified territory, it was adjudged at the trial \u201cthat the plaintiff do recover from the defendant damages,\u201d the ascertainment of which was referred to a Master. The Master reported that the plaintiff was entitled to $2,162, estimating the damages on the footing of what it would cost the plaintiff to put down two of the three wells he had refused to bore. On appeal from the Master\u2019s report to a judge in Weekly Court the latter held that the Master had proceeded on a wrong principle in assessing the damages. The order made on this appeal merely allowed the appeal and set aside the Master\u2019s finding and report. On appeal from this latter order it was held by Masten, Orde and Fisher, JJ.A. (Riddell, J.A., dissenting), that the order was erroneous because the judgment at the trial had awarded the plaintiff damages, which meant something more than nominal damages; that, no appeal having been taken from that judgment, the effect of the order was to reverse the trial judgment, and that the order allowing the appeal from the report should stand, but that there should be added to it a declaration as to the basis upon which the damages should be assessed. A declaration was accordingly added to the effect that what the plaintiff lost by the refusal of the defendant to bore the two additional wells was a sporting or gambling chance that valuable gas or oil would be found when the two wells were bored; that it might not be easy to compute what that chance was worth to the plaintiff but the difficulty in estimating the quantum was no reason for refusing to award any damages. For my part, I can find no authority in either Chaplin v. Hicks[6] or Carson v. Willitts[7] justifying any court in awarding any more than a nominal sum as damages for the loss of a mere chance of possible benefit except upon evidence proving that there was some reasonable probability of the plaintiff realizing therefrom an advantage of some real substantial monetary value. Indeed the above quotations from Chaplin v. Hicks6 and the decision in Carson v. Willitts7 seem to me to point to the contrary.\nAs already intimated, the respondent\u2019s only chance of realizing any advantage from the option granted him by the appellants rested wholly upon the extremely doubtful ratification by a majority vote of the shareholders of March Gold, Inc. of the original sale to him of the 350,000 shares, and, there being no evidence upon which any finding could be made that such a vote was reasonably probable during the nine months fixed for the life of the option, I have been forced to the conclusion that the learned judges of the Court of Appeal were not warranted in awarding the respondent substantial damages which, under the decision in Carson v. Willitts[8] they must be taken to have done, and sending the case to the Master for the assessment of these damages. With the highest possible respect, I am of opinion that the Appeal Court\u2019s only justifiable course upon the evidence before it was to direct a judgment for nominal damages.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and remit the cause to the Court of Appeal to enter judgment for the plaintiff against the individual defendants for nominal damages only in lieu of the provisions of the first paragraph of the formal judgment with such alterations in paragraph 2 as will give the plaintiff his costs of the action down to and including the trial on the High Court scale without a set-off. Paragraphs 3 and 4 will, of course, stand. The appeal was dismissed as against the respondent corporation with costs on the hearing, so that paragraph 5 of the existing order stands.\nAppeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Court of Appeal to enter judgment for the plaintiff against the individual defendants for nominal damages only. Appeal dismissed as against the respondent corporation with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: White, Ruel & Bristol.\nSolicitors for the respondent (plaintiff): Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitors for the respondent (defendant) corporation: Godfrey & Corcoran.\n[1] [1938] Ont.

The appellant and his associates assigned this licence and their rights to Sterling Royalties, Ltd., which undertook to perform the conditions of the original lease and to drill the well, paying therefor by the sale of units of production to the public, and to transfer to appellant and associates the remaining units of production. The Sterling Royalties Ltd. then entered into an agreement with one, Head, to drill the well for a sum of $30,000, $15,000 payable in cash and $15,000 to be paid by the company out of the sale of production. The remaining units of production were transferred to the appellant and associates, who agreed that those units, having been pooled for that purpose, should be charged with the payment of the balance of Head\u2019s contract price. The well was completed, and the sum of $16,333.50 was paid by Sterling Royalties Ltd. to Head, and the amount was deducted from the proceeds derived from the pooled units of production. The Commissioner of Income Tax assessed that amount for income tax purposes, the assessment being confirmed by the Minister of National Revenue. The appellant then appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada, which held that the payment to Head by Sterling Royalties, Ltd., was a payment made at the request of appellant and associates out of income, and that the appellant was liable for income tax in respect of his portion of $16,333.50.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1938] Ex. C.R. 235), Crocket and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that, in view of the deeds and written agreements filed at the trial and of the other circumstances of this case, the above sum of $16,333.50 was never, directly or indirectly, received by the appellant and his associates within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act and cannot properly be treated as taxable income.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J.[1], dismissing the appeal of the appellant against the assessment of the Honourable Minister of National Revenue of the sum. of $16,333.50 as having been received by the appellant and his associates from Sterling Royalties Ltd., as income from the oil well operated by that company during the taxation year 1934.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. S. Patterson K.C. for the appellant.\nClinton J. Ford K.C. and J. R. Tolmie for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The controversy on this appeal turns upon the provisions of certain agreements which I proceed to consider.\nThe appellant is one of a group, to whom I shall refer as the vendors, and who had a licence from the Sterling Pacific Oil Company (to which I shall refer as the licensors) who, in turn, were lessees, under a lease from the Calgary and Edmonton Corporation, of the petroleum and natural gas in a tract of land, a part of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Company\u2019s land grant. This last mentioned lease will be referred to as the Head lease and the lessors as the Head lessors.\nThis lease is dated the 30th of June, 1928, and the licence to the vendors the 1st of June, 1933. The royalty payable under the Head lease is one-eighth, or 12\u00bd%, of the gross production of petroleum and natural gas and, under the license, in the events that have occurred, the same.\nOn the 1st of June, 1933, the vendors assigned to the Sterling Royalties, Ltd. (which will be referred to as the Company), its licence and its rights under the agreement with the licensors and the Company agreed to assume all the liabilities of the vendors under their agreement with the licensors.\nThe vendors received, in part consideration of the transfer, 3,450 fully paid up shares of the capital stock of the Company. The agreement contains two important provisions which are in these words:\n5. It is understood that the Party of the Second Part (that is to say, the Company) will proceed forthwith to sell sufficient royalties or units of production for such an amount and in such manner and on such terms and conditions as will secure the drilling of a well on the property hereinbefore mentioned, according to the terms of the said agreement. It being agreed between the parties hereto and the Parties of the First Part as between themselves hereby agreeing, that after the sale of sufficient royalties or units or production as aforesaid, the royalties or percentages of production remaining shall be divided among the parties of the First Part and Fred Elves in the proportion to the shares held by each in the company as hereinbefore set out; said royalties to be considered as part of the consideration for the sale, transfer and assignment of the said contract as hereinbefore set out. The Company holding the lease, drilling the well and operating the same for such consideration as may be agreed upon between the Company and a Trustee for the unit holders.\n6. It is further understood and agreed that the remaining royalties above mentioned and hereby agreed to be transferred to the Parties of the First Part and Fred Elves, or the proceeds therefrom shall bear certain costs and charges mutually agreed upon between the Parties of the First Part and Fred Elves including the sum of Fifteen thousand ($15,000.00) dollars, part of the price of drilling the well which it is proposed to pay to Hilary H. Head, drilling contractor, from production in an agreement now being negotiated with him.\nIt is important to notice that the stipulation set forth in the last paragraph (paragraph 6) is that the units of production agreed to be transferred to the vendors and Fred Elves, which will hereafter be referred to as vendors\u2019 units, or the proceeds therefrom, are to bear the costs and charges mentioned and that what these costs and charges are has been mutually agreed upon by the vendors and Fred Elves, and that they are to include the $15,000 mentioned. The important point is that there is no stipulation making the vendors personally responsible for the payment of any of these costs and charges.\nFurther, this may be a convenient place at which to observe that, nowhere in these instruments is there to be found any evidence of an obligation on the part of the vendors to pay moneys agreed to be paid by the Company to Head for the construction of the well. The vendors were under an obligation to the licensors to construct the well and work it. If they failed to perform that obligation they would expose themselves to an action for damages; but, on the other hand, the Company agreed with the vendors to perform that obligation and also, as we shall see, covenanted directly with the licensors to perform it.\nBefore proceeding further, it is, perhaps, well to call attention to the manner in which the terms \u201cunit of production\u201d is used by the parties. That appears from the agreement between the Company and the Trustee contemplated by the first of the paragraphs just quoted, which is dated the 24th of June, 1933, some three weeks after the transfer of the licence by the vendors. That agreement recites the lease from the Calgary and Edmonton Corporation to the licensors, the agreement between the licensors and the vendors of the 1st of June, 1933, the transfer of this agreement by the vendors to the Company, and a further agreement between the Company and the North West Company, Ltd., by which the Company had acquired certain necessary equipment of the value of $24,000 in return for a right to eight per cent of the gross production of petroleum and natural gas from the Company\u2019s land.\nThe royalties (12\u00bd%) due to the Calgary and Edmonton Corporation, and to the licensors respectively, and that due to the North West Company (8%), amounting in the aggregate to 33% of the gross production of petroleum and natural gas, the residue of such production amounted to 67%, and the agreement recites that the Company proposes to sell all or part of that \u201c67% in the form of 67 units of production on a net basis (viz., after the payment of the costs of production) for the purpose of financing and drilling a well\u201d on the property. This agreement also recites that \u201cthe Company has let the contract for the drilling of the said well and has actually commenced drilling operations.\u201d\nThe provisions of the agreement between the Company and the Trustee make it plain that the rights of the holders of the units of production are, as this recital declares, rights subject to the payment of operating expenses including the cost of drilling the well.\nIt is necessary to understand clearly what it is that the Trustee gets under this agreement. The Company agrees with the Trustee\nto pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee for the holders or purchasers of * * * units of production * * * a royalty in cash at the current market value at the time and place of production of all the petroleum and natural gas * * * recovered from the well now being drilled on the following land (a description of the land follows) during the unexpired residue of the term of years covered by the lease or licence hereinbefore referred to and every renewal thereof\nwhich is to be paid to the Trustee. But this royalty in cash, ascertained as provided for, is subject to the payment, first, of the royalties as above mentioned, amounting in all to 33% of the gross production; and, second, \u201call costs and expenses necessary for taking care of the production obtained from the said well.\u201d Then follows this most important stipulation,\nSuch payment to represent sixty-seven (67%) per cent of production after deducting expenses and costs of producing the well.\nThere are two further provisions of the agreement which it is necessary to notice. The first is sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1, by which the Company covenants with the Trustee\nthat it will regularly and duly pay from production all expenses and costs of producing the well and ... with the said well.\nThe second is sub-paragraph (h). In virtue of this paragraph, the Company covenants with the Trustee:\n(h) That the parties entitled to the Sixty-seven (67%) per cent or Sixty-seven (67) units of net production, as hereinbefore mentioned and after the payment of Twelve and one-half (12\u00bd%) per cent gross royalty to The Calgary and Edmonton Land Corporation Limited: Twelve and one-half (12\u00bd%) per cent gross royalty to Sterling Pacific Oil Company Limited and Eight (8%) per cent gross royalty to the Northwest Company Limited, and all expenses and costs of producing the said well, and the percentage or amount of net production or units on a net production basis, to which they are entitled, are as follows:\nName\nAddress\nRoyalty\nor Unit\nof Production\nFred A.

These certificates are provided for in paragraph 2 of the agreement and, by that paragraph, they are to be substantially in the form attached. That form is as follows:\nThis certifies that.......................of......................... in the Province of.................. is registered on the records of The Trusts and Guarantee Company, Limited, as being entitled to a Royalty of...per centum (..........%) of all petroleum, natural gas, gasoline gas, naphtha and\/or other petroleum products produced and marketed from the first and present well being drilled by Sterling Royalties, Limited, a company incorporated under Companies Act, 1929, of the Province of Alberta, on the following lands, namely:\nLegal Subdivision One (1), of Section Thirty-three (33), in Township Eighteen (18), Range Two (2), West of the Fifth (5th) Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, held by Sterling Royalties, Limited, subject to all the provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement dated the 24th day of June, A.D. 1933, made between Sterling Royalties, Limited, as Operator, of the First Part, and The Trusts and Guarantee Company, Limited, as the Trustee, of the Second Part, which said Agreement may be inspected during office hours at the office of the said The Trusts and Guarantee Company, Limited, at Calgary, Alberta.\n* * *\nIt will be observed that the \u201croyalty\u201d is a percentage of the natural gas and petroleum produced and marketed from the first and present well being drilled by Sterling Royalties, Ltd., and the holder\u2019s right is declared to be subject to all the provisions and conditions of the Trust agreement.\nThere are still two other agreements at which we must look: first, that of the 2nd of June, 1933, to which the vendors, the licensors and the Company are all parties. The licensors consent to the assignment of the licence from the vendors to the Company, but the two stipulations which should be carefully noticed are contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 which are in these words:\n2. The Licensees jointly and severally and the Assignee hereby agree that they, and each of them, will observe, carry out and perform all the obligations contained in the agreement made between the Licensor and the Licensees dated June 1st, 1933.\n3. The Assignee hereby covenants and agrees with the Licensor that the Licensor shall have as against the Assignee all the rights and remedies granted by the original agreement dated June 1st, 1933. As already mentioned, one of the undertakings for which the vendors made themselves responsible to the licensors under their agreement was that the vendors should, within five weeks from the date of the agreement, that is, the 1st of June, 1933, commence the work of drilling a well and carry on the operation of drilling continuously to a depth of 6,000 feet or a depth of 400 feet into the limestone (whichever should be the lesser depth) unless oil or gas should be found in the limestone in commercial quantities at a lesser depth.\nBy paragraph 5, the vendors agree to use and work the well in a skilful and proper manner.\nObviously, the effect of article 2 of the agreement between the Company and the licensors was to make the Company directly responsible to the licensors for the performance of these stipulations; that is to say, the Company agreed to observe, carry out and perform the obligation of the vendors, to commence the work of drilling a well within five weeks of the 1st of June, and to carry on such drilling operations continuously and diligently as just mentioned.\nPursuant to this obligation of the Company to the licensors and its obligation to the vendors, the Company entered into an agreement with one Head, the agreement referred to in article 6 of the agreement of the 1st of June, 1933, between the vendors and the Company and in the recitals of the Trust agreement of the 24th of June. Head\u2019s agreement is dated the 7th of June and he was to proceed to drill a well and the consideration he was to receive by article 21 of the agreement was $15,000 in cash and a further sum of $15,000 in respect of which the article provides as follows:\nThe remaining balance, namely, Fifteen thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars is to be paid out of the sale of production at the rate of Two Thousand ($2,000.00) Dollars per month, but not to exceed forty per cent (40%) of the net production coming to the Owner after the payment of all royalties in connection with the said wells.\nThe situation then, after execution of the agreement of the 24th of June, which I shall refer to as the Trust agreement, was that the Company had entered into an agreement with the licensors to execute all the obligations of the vendors under the agreement between the vendors and the licensors by which the vendors had acquired the licence; that they had covenanted with the vendors to perform all the vendors\u2019 obligations under the last-mentioned agreement and, being, therefore, under contractual obligations with the licensors, as well as the vendors, to construct and to work the well, they had pursuant to these obligations entered into an agreement with Head by which Head had agreed to construct the well, and by which $15,000 of the $30,000 was to be paid by the Company out of production.\nThe Company had also agreed with the vendors to sell sufficient units of production as to secure the drilling of the well on the property. The Company was to hold the lease, drill the well and operate the same for such consideration as should be agreed upon between the Company and the Trustee for the unit holders; and, further, the units of production remaining after the drilling of the well had been provided for were to be the property of the vendors and one, Fred Elves.\nThe Company, by the Trust agreement, had agreed to pay the cost of constructing the well and all operating expenses, and to pay to the Trustee a royalty in cash amounting to the current market value of all petroleum and natural gas recovered from the well then being drilled, subject to deductions of overriding gross royalties amounting to 33% of all costs and necessary expenses for \u201ctaking care of the production including the cost of producing the well.\u201d\nThe Company in the Trust agreement declared its intention of selling this 67% of production in the form of units of production on a net basis for the purpose of financing and drilling the well. The agreement declared that the parties are entitled to these 67 units of production at the date of the agreement were those named, 43 of these units being the property of the Company, and 24 of them being held by others. The annual remuneration of the Trustee is provided for, as well as compensation to the Company for its services; and the Trustee agrees\nthat in the event of production being obtained in commercial quantities, it will, upon receipt of the royalty from the Company, distribute among the persons, firms and corporations entitled at the time of such distribution, as appears from its records, and in proportion to the interest or interests of each, all moneys so received, less only its charges as herein provided. It is evident from what has been said that the parties intended, as the Trust agreement and the agreement with Head in the most explicit way provides, that all the costs of drilling and operating the well were to be paid by the Company out of gross production. These costs stood in precisely the same position as all other charges which were to be deducted from the gross value of the petroleum and natural gas produced for the purpose of ascertaining the royalty to be paid to the Trustee, such, for example, as the Head royalties.\nAs between the Company and the vendors, the sum of $15,000 now in question was, by force of the original vendors\u2019 agreement with the Company, to be charged on the vendors\u2019 units. The right of the Company and the holders of other than vendors\u2019 units to have this charge deducted in such a maner that its incidence should fall exclusively upon the vendors\u2019 units might have been worked out in various ways. It is not mentioned in the Trust agreement for the reason, possibly, that at that date 43 units out of the 67 allotted, were in the hands of the Company who were, therefore, in control of the situation. One obvious method of working out this right of the Company and of the holders of units other than the vendors\u2019 would be by a declaration by the Company and the holders of vendors\u2019 units that this sum was a charge on these units and a direction by them to the Trustee to pay it out of the share of the royalty which otherwise the Trustee would pay in its entirety to the holders of these units.\nThis, in effect, was what was accomplished by the agreement of February. The agreement is not conspicuously characterized by precision and the Crown naturally relies on the 4th recital. That recital says nothing whatever of relevancy to the question before us. It declares that it was agreed between the party of the first part, that is among the vendors and Elves that certain costs and charges should be borne by the parties of the first part. It says nothing as to an agreement between the parties of the first part and the Company, or an agreement between them and the holders of the units.\nAs I have already said, there is not a, suggestion in the vendors\u2019 agreement with the Company of the 1st of June that the vendors are to be under any personal liability in respect of the moneys due to Head by the Company. The agreement of February is simply a mode of giving effect to the agreement between the vendors and the Company that this particular sum and the other charges amounting in all to $20,000 should, as between the units of production sold to the public and the units of production transferred to the vendors and Elves, fall upon and be paid out of the latter. This was a right declared in the fundamental agreement by which the Company acquired from the vendors the licence, agreed to sell units of production for the purpose of drilling and financing a well, agreed to perform the obligations of the vendors, to operate the well, and to do so pursuant to the terms of an agreement to be entered into with the Trustee for the unit holders. From the very beginning, the arrangement that this payment, as part of the costs of production was to be charged exclusively upon the vendors\u2019 units and not spread over the units as a whole was a settled part of the plan and at no time had the vendors either a legal or a moral right to receive or to control the disposition of this sum.\nThe Company into whose hands came the proceeds of the sale of products of the well received this sum under a duty created by its agreement with Head to pay $15,000 to Head out of these proceeds. It received it under a duty created by the Trust agreement to pay out of the gross proceeds all costs and expenses including the \u201ccost of producing the well.\u201d It did not receive these moneys as trustee or agent for or in any manner on behalf of the vendors. As to the Trustee, the royalty distributable by the Trustee amongst unit holders was a royalty ascertained by deducting the cost of the well as well as other expenses and, apart altogether from the agreement of February, it was the duty of the Company to see to it that the charge upon the vendors\u2019 units was made effective. The purpose of the arrangement made between the vendors and the Company acting for the protection of the unit holders generally would have been defeated if these moneys devoted from the beginning for the payment of this particular obligation had been allowed to come into the possession or under the control of the vendors. The purpose and effect of the agreement of February was to protect the rights of the Company and the unit holders as everybody recognized them.\nFrom all this it results, in my opinion, that the sum in question was never, directly or indirectly, received by the appellant and his associates within the meaning of the statute.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDavis j.\u2014This is a Dominion Income Tax case arising out of the somewhat peculiar method (adopted, we are told, from an American practice) of dealing with speculative oil or gas production ventures which have in recent years become somewhat common in the western provinces. The method adopted is for the promoters to acquire, by lease or sublease or otherwise, the right to drill for and to take the oil or gas from certain defined lands upon the basis of giving to the land owner, and to the sublessor in case of a sublease, a certain proportion of the oil or gas that may be produced or its money worth. The promoters then sell and transfer, as vendors, the rights so acquired to a joint stock company which they cause to be incorporated and organized, taking in part consideration for the transfer fully paid shares of the capital stock of the company. In this way the vendors become the shareholders of the company. But instead of the company acquiring whatever capital may be necessary for the drilling of wells and other incidental expenses to the point of production by the sale of further shares of its capital stock, the agreement with the new company provides, by way of further consideration for the transfer of the rights, that the company shall dispose of all its prospective profits (which, under the ordinary commercial practice of trading companies would ultimately be distributable among the shareholders pro rata) by the creation of fractions or interests (called \u201croyalties\u201d or \u201cunits of production\u201d) in the prospective profits of the company; sufficient of these to be sold to the public to raise the necessary money and the balance to become the property of the vendors to the company. It is plain then that when these \u201cunits of production\u201d thus created are sold or disposed of to such an extent that they absorb one hundred per cent. of the profits of the company, the holders thereof will become entitled to all the profits of the company which may arise from the production of oil or gas from the company\u2019s properties. The rights of the shareholders of the company will in consequence be confined to the capital of the company and they will not as shareholders be entitled to any distribution of the profits of the company which may result from the production of the wells. That being so, the vendors of the new company not only arrange that they shall become shareholders of the company but that they shall become entitled to some of the units of production in order to participate in profits if the venture proves successful.\nIn the case before us the vendors received 3,450 shares of the capital stock of the company, Sterling Royalties, Limited. These were divided and are held as follows:\nRobert Wilkinson............................................................ 1,300 shares\nClarence E. Snyder (the appellant)................................ 800 shares\nWilliam S. Applegate ..................................................... 800 shares\nFred Elves ..................................................................... 550 shares\nSo far as appears, those are the only shares of the capital stock of the company issued and outstanding.\nBut the agreement between the vendors and Sterling Royalties, Limited, provided not only for the issue of these shares of the capital stock of the company to the vendors as part consideration for the transfer of their rights, but Sterling Royalties, Limited, undertook to\nproceed forthwith to sell sufficient royalties or units of production for such an amount and in such manner and on such terms and conditions as will secure the drilling of a well on the property hereinbefore mentioned, according to the terms of the said agreement. It being agreed between the parties hereto and the Parties of the First Part (the vendors) as between themselves hereby agreeing, that after the sale of sufficient royalties or units of production as aforesaid, the royalties or percentages of production remaining shall be divided among the Parties of the First Part and Fred Elves (a partner or associate of the three named parties of the first part) in the proportion to the shares held by each in the company as hereinbefore set out; said royalties to be considered as part of the consideration for the sale, transfer and assignment of the said contract as hereinbefore set out. The Company holding the lease, drilling the well and operating the same for such consideration as may be agreed upon between the Company and a Trustee for the unit holders.\nBy virtue of that clause of the agreement the promoters or \u201cvendors,\u201d besides becoming the holders of the shares of the capital stock of the company, became entitled to all the units of production which would remain after the company had sold sufficient units of production to secure the drilling of a well on the property. What actually happened was this: the vendors had become under obligation to the head lessor and to the sublessor of the property for a total of 25% of whatever petroleum or natural gas might be produced. These obligations were assumed by Sterling Royalties, Limited. Another 8% of production was accepted by the Northwest Company Limited from Sterling Royalties Limited for the supply of the drilling equipment. These were percentages of gross production and aggregated 33%. Then Sterling Royalties Limited created 67 units of production to cover the balance of production; 36\u00bd were sold for cash to the public by the company and the remaining 30\u00bd units, subject to payment thereout of certain charges and expenses of the company amounting to $16,333.50, became the property of the vendors, under their agreement with the company, in the proportions of the shareholdings of each of them in the company as hereinbefore set out.\nThe drilling of the well for Sterling Royalties, Limited, was given by contract to one Head, who undertook to drill the well for $30,000, payable as follows: $15,000 in cash by monthly instalments of $2,000 each, the first of these instalments to be due and payable within thirty days after the actual commencement of drilling operations, the second instalment within thirty days thereafter and so on from month to month until the well was completed. (There is an acceleration clause with which we are not concerned.) The balance of the contract price, that is, a further sum of $15,000, was to be paid \u201cout of the sale of production\u201d at the rate of $2,000 per month but not in excess of 40% of the net production coming to the company after the payment of all royalties in connection with the said well.\nSufficient cash appears to have been raised by the sale to the public of 36\u00bd units of production to meet the first $15,000 cash instalments that were to be paid to the contractor Head, but the second $15,000 that was only to be paid to Head \u201cout of the sale of production\u201d (i.e., if the well came into production) was part of the charges and expenses of the company amounting to $16,333.50 which, by the agreement between the vendors and Sterling Royalties, Limited, were to be borne by and charged against the 30\u00bd units of production to which the vendors were entitled as part of the consideration for the transfer of their rights to the company.\nA trust agreement was made between Sterling Royalties, Limited, and The Trusts and Guarantee Company Limited for delivery to the trust company of the net proceeds of production of the well in question (i.e., after providing for the 33% of the gross production to the head lessor, the sublessor and the Northwest Company Limited which supplied the drilling equipment) and for the distribution of the same, after payment thereout of operating expenses, among the holders of the units of production. A form of trust certificate was adopted to evidence the title of the holders of the units of production.\nThe well came into production and the last-mentioned $15,000 paid to Head under his contract and the other costs and charges amounting to $1,333.50, all of which had been agreed upon between the vendors and the company to be charged against the \u201cremaining\u201d units of production (i.e., the vendors\u2019 30\u00bd units) were paid.\nThe Minister of National Revenue sought to charge the appellant Snyder, who was one of the vendors, with his portion of $16,333.50 and Snyder challenged this claim upon the ground that no part of the $16,333.50 was income or profits to the individual holders of the 30\u00bd units. The Minister took the position that the vendors had acquired a 30\u00bd% interest in the production of the well and that they had in effect paid $16,333.50 to acquire that interest; that instead of paying that sum direct to the company as a capital expenditure on their part in order to acquire the 30\u00bd units, they adopted this method of dealing with the sum in question whereby they charged their 30\u00bd units of production with the payment of the $16,333.50, taking their profits to the extent of $16,333.50 to acquire as many as 30\u00bd units for themselves.\nBut no part of this total sum of $16,333.50 ever reached the vendors; in fact they were not entitled to any of it. The agreement was that they were to get whatever units of production were not sold to the public but that these \u201cremaining\u201d units were be charged with the payment of this $16,333.50. The share or interest of the vendors in the profits of the company from the production of the well was in fact 30\u00bd% less $16,333.50. If the speculation had not proved the success it apparently did, and 30\u00bd% of the sales of the production of its well had never amounted to more than $16,333.50, these vendors would never have become entitled to any profits at all. This statement is not exactly accurate, in that the 33 units set aside for the head lessor and the sublessor and the equipment company were gross production units, but that is not for our present purpose of any real consequence.\nSuppose Snyder and his associates had never transferred their rights to Sterling Royalties Limited but had proceeded with the venture themselves as a partnership undertaking and had made the same arrangement with the drilling equipment company to take 8% of the production instead of cash and had made the same arrangement with Head to drill the well as Sterling Royalties Limited made\u2014what would have been the result? Snyder and his associates in that event would have been entitled to 67% of the production; that is, the total production less 25% to which the head lessor and the sublessor were entitled and less 8% to which the equipment company was entitled. But Snyder and his associates would have had to pay the $30,000 to Head. The result of their transaction with Sterling Royalties Limited, however, was that they turned over, for better or for worse, their rights to that company, in consideration of certain shares and units of production, and that company by the sale to the public of certain units of production raised sufficient money to pay Head the first $15,000 on his contract and whatever other or incidental outlay was involved in the company bringing its well to the point of production. Snyder and his associates, in consequence of their arrangement wisely or unwisely made by them with Sterling Royalties Limited, have now only 30\u00bd% of the profits of the venture less the sum of $16,333.50 agreed between them and the company to be paid out of and charged against the first proceeds of this 30\u00bd%.\nWe are dealing with income tax and it is perfectly plain that the appellant Snyder never received any part of the $16,333.50 nor was he ever entitled to receive any part of it. Lord Macmillan in the Privy Council in the Tata HydroElectric case (Bombay)[2], said at p. 694:\nBefore their Lordships counsel for the Grown did not seek to support the judgment of the High Court in the present case on the ground that it was ruled by the decision in the Pondicherry case (1931) L.R. 58 I.A. 239, and in their Lordships\u2019 view he was well advised in recognizing the clear distinction between that case and the present case. In the Pondicherry case the assessees were under obligation to make over a share of their profits to the French Government. Profits had first to be earned and ascertained before any sharing took place. Here the obligation of the appellants to pay a quarter of the commission which they receive from the Tata Power Co., Ld., to F. E. Dinshaw, Ld. and Richard Tilden Smith\u2019s administrator is quite independent of whether the appellant made any profit or not. Indeed, if on their year\u2019s operations as a whole they were to make a loss and incur no liability to income-tax they would nevertheless have to pay away a quarter of the commission in question to the parties named. The commission in truth is not profit or gain; it is only an item or factor in the computation of the appellants\u2019 profits or gains. Their Lordships regard this as a fundamental distinction.\nI would refer to the language of Sir Wilfrid Greene, the Master of the Rolls, in the recent case of British Sugar Manufacturers, Limited, v. Harris (Inspector of Taxes[3]):\nVarious authorities have been referred to. Speaking for myself, I find the greatest assistance from two passages, one of them is a passage in the judgment of Romer L.J. in this Court in the case of Union Cold Storage Co. v. Adamson[4]. What Romer L.J. says there (at p. 328) is that in order to succeed in that case the Crown would have had to establish the following proposition: \u201cThat where a company, for the \u201cpurpose of enabling it to carry on its trade and earn profits in the \u201ctrade, places itself under an obligation to make money payments, the \u201camount of which is dependent upon the profits earned, or the payment \u201cof which is contingent upon certain profits being earned, payments made \u201cin discharge of that obligation are payments made out of the profits or \u201cgains of the company, within the meaning of Rule 3(l). In my opinion, \u201cfor that proposition there is no foundation at all in principle or on \u201cauthority.\u201d The case that was being dealt with there was a case where the obligation to make the payment was dependent upon the profits earned, but it seems to me that the reasoning and the expressions of Romer L.J. equally apply to the case where the payment to be made is a commission or a percentage of profits earned.\nThe other passage is a passage in the judgment of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Maugham in the case of Indian Radio and Cable Communications Co. v. Income-tax Commissioner, Bombay Presidency and Aden[5]. That was a case into the facts of which I need not go, but it is important as containing a reference to the particular phrase in an earlier case which affected the mind of Finlay J. in the present case. That case having been brought to the attention of the Board in the Indian Radio case, Lord Maugham said this (at p. 713): \u201cIt may be \u201cadmitted that, as Mr. Latter contended, it is not universally true to \u201csay that a payment, the making of which is conditional on profits being \u201cearned, cannot properly be described as an expenditure incurred for the \u201cpurpose of earning such profits. The typical exception is that of a \u201cpayment to a director or a manager of a commission on the profits of \u201ca company. It may, however, be worth pointing out that an apparent \u201cdifficulty here is really caused by using the word \u2018profits\u2019 in more \u201cthan one sense. If a company, having made an apparent net profit \u201cof \u00a310,000, has then to pay \u00a31,000 to directors or managers as the \u201ccontractual recompense for their services during the year, it is plain that \u201cthe real net profit is only \u00a39,000. A contract to pay a commission at ten \u201cper cent on the net profits of the year must necessarily be held to mean \u201con the net profits before the deduction of the commission, that is, in the \u201ccase supposed, a commission on the \u00a310,000.\u201d That passage, in my opinion, contains sufficient to dispose of this case, and if I may link it up, as I understand it, with what I said a moment ago about the two accounts, the two accounts are I think what may be called the accountancy aspect of the two different senses in which the word \u201cprofits\u201d is used in these cases, as explained by Lord Maugham. Once you realize that as a matter of construction the word \u201cprofits\u201d may be used in one sense for one purpose and in another sense for another purpose, I think you have the real solution of the difficulties that have arisen in this case.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court held that Snyder was liable to pay income tax in respect of his portion of the $16,333.50 charged against the 30\u00bd units, but with great respect I do not think for the reasons above given it can properly be treated as taxable income. I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the judgment appealed from, and the assessment and decision of the Minister in so far as the item of $16,333.50 is concerned. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout. As a result of this conclusion it becomes unnecessary to consider the cross-appeal of the Minister on the question of costs. The cross-appeal should be dismissed, but without costs.\nCrocket J. (dissenting)\u2014I agree with my brother Hudson and the President of the Exchequer Court that the appellant and his associates were not entitled to deduct from the income of their royalty trust certificates for the year 1934 the $16,333.50, which Sterling Royalties Limited (of which they were the sole directors and shareholders) applied at their request to the payment of the indebtedness then outstanding for the drilling of the oil well. That amount admittedly represented 30\u00bd% of the net proceeds of the oil produced from the well and sold, (see Snyder\u2019s evidence, p. 40), to which they had become entitled by the transfer to them by Sterling Royalties Limited, after the completion of the drilling operations and the oil well had been brought into production, of the 30\u00bd remaining so-called units of production that had been previously held by Sterling Royalties for sale to the public for that purpose, upon the appellant and his associates undertaking to liquidate the outstanding indebtedness of Sterling Royalties for completion of the drilling operations. The arrangement, under which the four partners acquired these 30\u00bd units, is formally set out in the pooling agreement entered into between them and Sterling Royalties Limited under date of February 6th, 1934. Its practical effect was to charge the income payable on the royalties certificates they acquired with a capital outlay of $16,333.50, and to make this amount the purchase price of the 30\u00bd units of production. The fact that instead of having Sterling Royalties Limited hand over the net income of their royalties certificates to their trustees for distribution among them, as they were bound to do under the trust agreement, they chose to direct the operating company to apply the whole amount to the liquidation of the capital indebtedness they had assumed, does not in my opinion entitle them to deduct the amount from their income of that year as a current disbursement.\nI agree with my brother Hudson that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson j. (dissenting)\u2014The facts have been set forth at length by the learned President in the court below and I shall refer only to those which I think sufficient to dispose of the matter.\nSnyder and his associates were the licensees of oil and gas rights and, under agreement granting them the licence, they covenanted to drill a well and their obligation to do this remained throughout until the well had been drilled and completed.\nThe next step was the agreement made with Sterling Royalties Limited and it must be borne in mind that Snyder and his associates were the sole shareholders and directors of this company. The plan adopted for financing the operation was to sell what were called units of production or percentages, and under clause 5 of this agreement it was contemplated that sufficient units should be sold to pay for the cost of drilling the well and that Snyder and his associates should get the remaining units up to the total number to be issued, but the agreement also contemplated the possibility of sufficient units not being sold to provide for the total cost of drilling, and to cover this, provision was made and incorporated in clause 6 as follows:\n6. It is further understood and agreed that the remaining royalties above mentioned and hereby agreed to be transferred to the Parties of the First Part and Fred Elves, or the proceeds therefrom shall bear certain costs and charges mutually agreed upon between the Parties of the First Part and Fred Elves, including the sum of Fifteen thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars, part of the price of drilling the well which it is proposed to pay to Hillary H. Head, drilling contractor, from production in an agreement now being negotiated with him.\nIt should be observed here that the effect of this agreement was to provide for the disposal of the company\u2019s entire net income from the production of the well under consideration not to the shareholders as such but to the holders of units of production or royalties, whichever term is appropriate.\nWhen the well was drilled and came into production the pooling agreement dated 6th February was made. Prior to that date the unsold units under the agreement with Sterling Royalties Limited had already been divided between Snyder and his associates. There was, of course, attached to these units the obligation provided for in clause 6 of the agreement with Sterling Royalties. It may be that the recitals in the pooling agreement do not correspond exactly with the obligations under clause 6 above mentioned, but the pooling agreement provides specifically that Snyder and his associates agree to pool their royalties or percentages of production for the purpose of paying all costs, charges and expenses including the payment to Head which is the matter of controversy in this litigation. It is there further provided that the proceeds derived from the said royalties be paid to Sterling Royalties for the purpose of paying the costs and charges including the amount payable to Head, and there is a further provision authorizing the trustees of the money to pay these moneys over for that purpose. This pooling agreement clearly recognizes the realities of the situation. The appellant was examined on this point and gave his evidence as follows:\nQ. That agreement was signed by the four of you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You were the four shareholders of the company?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Are you a Director?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Was Mr. Wilkinson a Director?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And Mr. Elves?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And Mr. Applegate said he was?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Now, I call your attention to clause 1 of that Agreement Exhibit No. 6. That clause reads:\n\u201c(1) The Parties of the First Part hereby agree to pool their royalties or percentages of production for the purpose of paying all costs, charges and expenses agreed to be paid by them and amounting to approximately Twenty thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars, the details and items of which said amount are well known to each of the Parties of the First Part, and include the bonus of Fifteen thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars\u201d\n(which really became $16,333.50)\n\u201cpayable to Hilary H. Head under a drilling agreement with him dated 7th June, 1933.\u201d\nNow how do you explain those words \u201cagreed to be paid by them\u201d?\u2014A. That clause means exactly what it says. We agreed to pay it out of royalties that we owned.\nQ. This agreement goes on further to say in clause 2 that the parties of the First Part further agree to pool the proceeds of the said royalties or percentages; now when you speak of the proceeds of said royalties or percentages, what do you mean?\u2014A. What was received for the oil that was sold.\nQ. Under your Royalty Trust Agreement you had the right to take oil from the well or take money, have the oil sold by the Trustee or take money?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. So that it is really the income from the well; is that right?\u2014A. It is the income from the royalties that were unsold that came to us; what I mean is this, that it was the money paid to us from the oil sold that was credited to royalties that belonged to that pool.\nQ. And your share of that was what per cent?\u2014A. 30\u00bd% of the net production.\nQ. And by that you mean after the Head royalty was taken off?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. After the costs of operation?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And out of whatever was left you got 30\u00bd%?\u2014A. That is right.\nQ. And that proportion of the net amount in each year the well produced came to the four of you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you pooled that amount and gave instructions to the Trustee to pay that sum to Sterling Royalties?\u2014A. That is right.\nThe auditors\u2019 statement of Sterling Royalties attached to the appellant\u2019s income tax return shows the money in question as \u201capplied against liability of\u201d Snyder. This confirms the view that Sterling Royalties were simply taking care of a recognized obligation of Snyder out of the proceeds of production, and under section 1, chapter 55, of the Statutes of Canada, 1934, all royalties or other periodical receipts dependent upon the production or use of real property, notwithstanding that the same were payable on account of the use of such property, are taxable.\nIt seems to me that Sterling Royalties in receiving the proceeds of production allocated to the units of Snyder and the others were receiving it as agents for them, and in paying Head they were likewise paying it as agents for them. If this be so, then it is simply a case of paying a capital expenditure out of the earnings of the business.\nI think that in all respects material to this litigation Sterling Royalties should be regarded simply as agents for Snyder and his associates from the making of the first agreement entered into with that company. For these reasons, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThere was a cross-appeal by the respondent in respect of costs in the court below. I think, however, that this was a matter within the discretion of the learned trial judge and would not disturb his judgment in this respect.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Patterson, Hoff & Patterson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

S\u00e9guin, (1915) 42 S.C.R. 644, foll. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment rendered by Rh\u00e9aume J., upon the verdict of the jury at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe respondent brought this action claiming damages on behalf of herself and as tutrix of her minor children, in consequence of the death of her husband, the father of the children, caused as alleged by the negligence of the appellant.\nJean Letourneau for the appellant.\nJohn L. O\u2019Brien for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rinfret, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret j.\u2014The grounds of appeal submitted to the Court were as follows:\n1. The plaintiff offered no evidence upon which the jury could find a verdict; and the motion for non-suit presented at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s enqu\u00eate should have been granted by the trial judge;\n2. The respondent had lost her right, if any, to a jury trial on account of the expiration of the delays provided for in article 442 of the Code of Civil Procedure;\n3. The overruling of the challenge to the array was erroneous;\n4. The finding against the appellant did not constitute a fault duly alleged and proved.\n5. The amount awarded was so excessive as to warrant interference by the Court.\n6. The case was not susceptible of being tried by a jury.\nWe will now discuss each of these points in order.\nOn the first ground: The motion for non-suit having been disallowed, the appellant proceeded with the case and produced evidence on its own behalf. Under the circumstances, in dealing with this point, an appellate court may not be restricted to a consideration of the evidence as it stood when the motion was presented, but the court must have regard to the whole of the evidence submitted to the jury.\nIn that view of the matter, it cannot be said that there was no evidence to go to the jury. It is sufficient for the present purpose to refer to the many extracts of the testimony quoted in the judgment of the trial judge and to the careful review of the facts made in the Court of King\u2019s Bench by Mr. Justice Hall, with whom the other judges either concurred or agreed in a separate judgment. We would not feel warranted in reversing and setting aside the verdict on that first ground.\nIt is unnecessary to expose in detail the somewhat complicated incidents upon which the appellant based his second and third grounds of appeal, for we indicated at the hearing that, in our view, these were strictly questions of practice and procedure in respect to which we would not interfere with the unanimous decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench; and counsel for the respondent was told that he need not present any argument on these points.\nAs to the fourth ground: The rule invariably followed in this Court is that the findings of a jury must be read in the light of the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge; it must receive a fair interpretation and must not be submitted to a \u201crigorous critical method.\u201d So construed, the verdict in this case undoubtedly constitutes a fault in law and it is a proper finding of negligence.\nThe fault found by the jury was sufficiently alleged, and we have already stated in discussing the first ground of appeal, that there was evidence upon which the jury could find as it did.\nThere is no inconsistency in the findings against each of the parties, since the verdict is to the effect that each of them directly contributed to the accident.\nComing to the fifth ground of appeal, it may be stated that a court of appeal, more particularly this Court sitting as a second court of appeal should be slow in interfering with the amount of damages awarded.\nThe rule as laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure (art. 502) is that\na new trial is granted whenever the amount is so grossly excessive or insufficient that it is evident that the jurors have been influenced by improper motives or led into error.\nOn this point, the Court of King\u2019s Bench was unanimous in refusing a new trial. In the premises, it is not easy to see how we could declare that it was \u201cevident that the jurors have been influenced by improper motives.\u201d But the appellant says that they were \u201cled into error\u201d by the learned trial judge, in his charge, when he referred to a passage in the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin, as he then was, in the case of Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Lachance[1], as a result of which the jury was induced to include in its award items of damages not contemplated by article 1056 of the Civil Code.\nThis, however, is the equivalent of a complaint of misdirection and under the Code of Civil Procedure, it could be given effect to, only if \u201cthe party complaining duly excepted to the misdirection\u201d (Art. 498, subp. 3, C.C.P.).\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Mr. Justice Barclay was of opinion that no exception was taken: The other judges did not express any opinion on this point. We would be inclined to think that the exception was not insisted upon in the course of the discussion which followed the learned judge\u2019s charge.\nBut the main difficulty in which the appellant finds itself is that Canadian Pacific Ry Co. v. Lachance1 is a case in this Court. The citation referred to by the trial judge and to which the appellant objects is taken from a judgment delivered in this Court. On the pertinent point, the judgments of the other members of the Court were along the same lines, and we would not see our way clear to differ from what was said in those judgments.\nThe remaining ground of appeal is that this case was not susceptible of being tried by a jury.\nSo far as this Court is concerned, we consider that the matter is concluded by the decision in Montreal Tramways Co. v. S\u00e9guin1. No doubt one of the reasons in that case was that the point had been taken too late by the appellant, but the majority of the Court also decided that a jury was competent to try an action brought under art. 1056 of the Civil Code.\nThis disposes of all the grounds of the appellant; and, as a result, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nCrocket J.\u2014While I doubt very much whether the jury\u2019s answer to question 4 is a sufficient specification of the particular fault on the part of the motorman, which contributed to the accident, to enable the Court to determine with any degree of certainty whether it was his antecedent negligence in failing to keep a proper look-out, or some other antecedent fault, it is quite as definite as their specification in the same answer of the deceased\u2019s own contributory negligence, which has not been questioned on this appeal. For this reason I am not disposed to rely upon this point as a sufficient ground for dissenting from the conclusion of my brother Rinfret that the appeal should be dismissed, particularly as I am fully in accord with his view that there was evidence, which the jury apparently believed, and which would warrant a finding that there was some negligence on the part of the motorman, which caused or materially contributed to cause the unfortunate accident.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vall\u00e9e, Letourneau & Tansey.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Audette & O\u2019Brien.\n[1] (1909) 42 S.C.R. 205.\n1 (1909) 42 S.C.R. 205.\n1 (1915) 52 S.C.R. 644.\n"}

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s inscription in law.\nL. H. Ballantyne in person for the appellant.\nV. M. Lynch-Staunton and John F. Stairs for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is an action in damages instituted by the wife, who is the respondent, against her husband, who is the appellant.\nBy means of an inscription in law the appellant prayed for the dismissal of the action on the ground that it was prescribed under the provisions either of article 2261 or of article 2262 of the Civil Code. The material provisions of those articles relied on by the appellant are as follows:\n2261. The following actions are prescribed by two years:\n* * *\n2. For damages resulting from offences or quasi-offences, whenever other provisions do not apply;\n2262. The following actions are prescribed by one year:\n1. For slander or libel reckoning from the day that it came to the knowledge of the party aggrieved.\n* * *\nBy force of article 2267 C.C. in those cases\nthe debt is absolutely extinguished and no action can be maintained after the delay for prescription has expired.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench, however, decided that the appellant\u2019s plea of prescription could not succeed because the parties were husband and wife, and they could not \u201cprescribe against each other,\u201d as enacted in article 2233 of the Civil Code.\nThe ground upon which the appellant maintains that the judgment appealed from is wrong may be expressed as follows: he says that the limitations provided for by articles 2261 and 2262 C.C. are really not prescriptions, but properly speaking \u201cd\u00e9ch\u00e9ances\u201d; and that, according to the doctrine generally adopted in France, the exception as regards husband and wife contained in article 2233 C.C. does not operate in the case of \u201cd\u00e9ch\u00e9ances.\u201d But the difficulty for the appellant is that, in the Code itself, these limitations are called prescriptions and they are dealt with as prescriptions.\nThey are to be found under the sub-title \u201cOf Certain Short Prescriptions\u201d and under the general title \u201cOf Prescription\u201d; and they come within the definition of prescription given in article 2183 C.C.\nPrescription is the word used in article 2233 C.C. as well as in articles 2261, 2262 and 2267 C.C. According to the accepted rule of interpretation, the same word used throughout the same legislation should be construed as having the same meaning.\nNo distinction is made in article 2233 C.C. In terms it is of general application. We should not introduce an exception where the Code itself makes none; and we think article 2233 must be held to apply to all cases of prescription\u2014both to the short and to the long prescriptions.\nSuch is also the view of Mr. Mignault. (Droit Civil Canadien, Volume 9, page 545). He says:\nmais il faut remarquer que la prescription m\u00eame courte n\u2019a pas lieu entre \u00e9poux. (Article 2233).\nNow, article 2267 C.C. enacts that the right of action is denied only \u201cafter the delay for prescription has expired\u201d; and article 2233 C.C. provides that prescription does not run between husband and wife. It follows that, in this case, as prescription did not run, the right of action still exists; and we agree with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the appellant\u2019s contention cannot prevail.\nIn this Court the appellant wished to raise the further point that, quite apart from any question of prescription, the respondent had no right of action in the present case, on the principle that no husband or wife is entitled to sue the other for an offence or a quasi-offence.\nBut, we do not think the point is open to the appellant.\nThe parties are before the Court on an inscription in law.\nUnder the Code of Procedure (art. 192), the inscription in law \u201cmust contain all the grounds relied upon,\u201d and \u201cno ground which is not therein alleged can be urged at the hearing.\u201d A general allegation, which moreover is merely introductory, is not sufficient; there must be a specific allegation. The only ground specifically alleged in the inscription in law is that of prescription.\nAdmittedly, the point was not raised in the courts below. But Mr. Justice St. Jacques who delivered the main judgment for the majority in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, more than once expressed a doubt as to whether the right of action existed. He stated however:\nLa Cour doit rester dans le cadre de l\u2019inscription en droit, telle qu\u2019elle est libell\u00e9e.\nWe therefore express no opinion upon the question whether the respondent was entitled to sue in damages; and it may be that the appellant is still at liberty to raise his objection in the future course of the case.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. H. Ballantyne in person.\nSolicitor for the respondent: V. M. Lynch-Staunton.\n[1] (1938) Q.R. 64 K.B. 27.\n"}

The secretary of respondent company, in accordance with a resolution of its directors, forwarded to the clerk of the City of Windsor a notice in form B, provided for by The Separate Schools Act, now R.S.O., 1937, c. 362, s. 66, requiring that 18% of its assessment be entered, rated and assessed for separate school purposes, and the assessor made his assessment accordingly. An appeal by appellant board against the assessment for separate school purposes was allowed by the court of revision, and its decision was sustained by Mahon Co. C.J., who, in a stated case made for purposes of appeal, found that the apportionment for separate school purposes made by the directors of the company (the shares of which company are numerous, widely distributed and extensively traded), though made in good faith, was not based on actual knowledge and was \u201conly a guess or an estimate\u201d; and held that the notice (form B) given by the company should be set aside and declared of no effect, and that all the company\u2019s assessments in said city should be assessed, enrolled and rated for public school purposes, as it had not been proved affirmatively that there was compliance with s. 66 (3) of said Act, namely, that the portion (18%) designated for separate school purposes was no greater proportion of the whole of the assessment than the amount of the shares held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of the shares of the company. His judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1938] O.R. 301, on the grounds that the statute ought, if possible, to be interpreted and applied so as to effectuate its manifest intention, viz., to provide for an equitable apportionment; on receiving the notice the assessor is bound to assess and return his roll apportioning the assessment; his roll is prima facie valid; the onus of displacing that situation rests on the attacking party and this onus was not discharged. Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (The Chief Justice and Davis J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: Having regard to the history of the Act and the change made in 1913 (c. 71) to the present form of s. 66 (3), the legislative intention was to free a company desirous of having part of its assessment apportioned to separate school purposes from the difficulty of ascertaining the precise ratio of the holdings of Roman Catholics. To give effect to that intention it must be held, on proper construction of the statute, that the company\u2019s notice stands and is to be followed unless displaced by evidence that the prohibition in s. 66 (3) has been violated. (Regina Public School District v. Gratton Separate School District, 50 Can. S.C.R. 589, discussed; it forms no authority on the point now in question) (Crocket J. further expressly concurred in the reasons given in the Court of Appeal).\nPer the Chief Justice (dissenting): Sec. 66 imposes a strict limit upon the proportion which can be designated by the company in its notice, and a prohibition to the company against exceeding that limit. In giving the notice, the company, though not a public body, is exercising a statutory authority bestowed upon it in the public interest and for a public purpose, and is affected by certain obligations which govern a public body invested with powers the execution of which may prejudicially affect the rights and interests of others; it is bound to act within the limits of the power conferred, and conformably to the procedure laid down by the statute; it is bound to exercise the power in good faith for the purposes (those contemplated by the statute) for which the power is given; and in putting the power into effect (following the procedure laid down) it is bound to act reasonably (Westminster v. London & N.W. Ry. Co., [1905] A.C. 426, at 430). The statute contemplates a notice given, and only given, after the company has ascertained as a fact that the proportion is not greater than that defined by s. 66 (3); unless that condition be fulfilled, the company cannot be said to be exercising the statutory power in conformity with the directions of the statute. Though there was no suggestion of any conscious dereliction from duty or any motive but an honest desire to conform to the directions of the statute, yet the material (as disclosed by the findings in the stated case) on which the notice was given formed no substantial foundation for the conclusion of fact which was the essential condition of a valid notice; therefore in giving the notice the company was not acting reasonably in exercise of the power conferred, and therefore the notice was not a valid exercise of the power. The above view would not preclude the establishment before the court of revision that the conditions under which the notice could validly be given did in fact exist; but there was no such evidence in this case.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting): The portion of its school rates which a company has a right under the Act to divert from public schools to separate schools is limited to the proportion named in s. 66 (3). Though it may not know all its Roman Catholic shareholders, it can, to the extent that it does ascertain them, exercise that right. But, in the absence of actual knowledge of any amount of shares held by Roman Catholics, an estimate of shares so held does not satisfy the plain conditions imposed by the Act. (Regina Public School District v. Gratton Separate School District, 50 Can. S.C.R. 589, at 606, cited; also the history of the legislation discussed, in regard to the construction of the statutory provisions now in question). In view of the facts as found according to the stated case, the question of onus of proof was not important; but, in a case where it became of importance, the onus should rest upon the party seeking the benefit of the special statutory provision\u2014on the person claiming exemption as a separatist from the general liability for the support of public schools, to prove those exceptional matters that took him out of the general rule (Re Ridsdale and Brush, 22 U.C.Q.B. 122, at 124; Harling v. Mayville, 21 U.C.C.P. 499, at 511; Free v. McHugh, 24 U.C.C.P. 13, at 21; also Parts I and II, generally, of the Act now in question and s. 5 of The Public Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 357, referred to; also principles as to onus of proof discussed).\nAPPEAL by the Board of Education for the City of Windsor from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of His Honour G.F. Mahon, a Judge of the County Court of the County of Essex. The judgment of Mahon Co. C.J. sustained the decision of the Court of Revision of the City of Windsor (which had allowed the present appellant\u2019s appeal against the apportionment of assessment made in accordance with the notice in Form B hereinafter mentioned) and held that the notice in Form B (provided for by The Separate Schools Act, now R.S.O., 1937, c. 362, s. 66) forwarded by the secretary of the Ford Motor Company of Canada Ltd. (in accordance with a resolution of the directors of the company) to the clerk of the City of Windsor, directing that 18% of the assessment of said company within the city of Windsor be entered, rated and assessed for separate school purposes, should be set aside, vacated and declared null and void and of no effect and that all the assessments of said company in said city should be assessed, enrolled and rated for public school purposes.\nSec. 66 (3) of said Act provides:\nUnless all the stock or shares are held by Roman Catholics the share or portion of such land and business or other assessments to be so rated and assessed shall not bear a greater proportion to the whole of such assessments than the amount of the stock or shares so held bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares.\nMahon Co. C.J. found that the apportionment made by the directors of the company (though they \u201cacted in good faith and with every desire to be fair\u201d) \u201cwas not based on actual knowledge and was only a guess or an estimate.\u201d He held that the onus was upon the company to establish that the portion of its assessment set out in its requisition (Form B) did not bear a greater proportion to the whole of its assessment than the amount of its stock or shares held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of the stock or shares; and that this onus was not discharged.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario1, on a special case stated by Mahon Co. C.J. for purposes of appeal (pursuant to s. 85 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 272), answered the questions submitted therein adversely to his holdings, on the grounds that the statute ought, if possible, to be interpreted and applied so as to effectuate its manifest intention, viz., to provide for an equitable apportionment of public and separate school taxes payable by companies having Roman Catholic shareholders who are supporters of separate schools; the assessor is bound to assess and return his roll apportioning the company\u2019s assessment on receiving the notice; his roll is prima facie valid; the onus of displacing the prima facie situation rests on the attacking party and this onus was not discharged in the present case, though practical means of undertaking to do so existed by summoning and cross-examining the company\u2019s directors or officers on the hearing before the Court of Revision or before the County Court Judge.\nThe material facts as found by the County Court Judge are set out in the judgments given in this Court now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, the Chief Justice and Davis J. dissenting.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and N.L. Spencer for the appellant.\nJ.B. Aylesworth K.C. for the respondent Ford Motor Company of Canada Ltd.\nA. Racine K.C. for the respondent Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Windsor.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)\u2014Mr. Justice Masten states in his judgment:\nThe appellants admit that prima facie every corporation shall be rated and assessed for the support of public schools and that this is the general or basic rule subject, however, to the provisions of section 65 of the Separate Schools Act.\nSection 65 (now s. 66) is in these words:\n66. (1) A corporation by notice (Form B) to the clerk of any municipality wherein a separate school exists may require the whole or any part of the land of which such corporation is either the owner and occupant, or not being the owner is the tenant, occupant or actual possessor, and the whole or any proportion of the business assessment or other assessments of such corporation made under The Assessment Act, to be entered, rated and assessed for the purposes of such separate school.\n(2) The assessor shall thereupon enter the corporation as a separate school supporter in the assessment roll in respect of the land and business or other assessments designated in the notice, and the proper entries shall be made in the prescribed column for separate school rates, and so much of the land and business or other assessments so designated shall be assessed accordingly for the purposes of the separate school and not for public school purposes, but all other land and the remainder, if any, of the business or other assessments of the corporation shall be separately entered and assessed for public school purposes.\n(3) Unless all the stock or shares are held by Roman Catholics the share or portion of such land and business or other assessments to be so rated and assessed shall not bear a greater proportion to the whole of such assessments than the amount of the stock or shares so held bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares. (4) A notice given in pursuance of a resolution of the directors shall be sufficient and shall continue in force and be acted upon until it is withdrawn, varied or cancelled by a notice subsequently given pursuant to any resolution of the corporation or of its directors.\n(5) Every notice so given shall be kept by the clerk on file in his office and shall at all convenient hours be open to inspection and examination by any person entitled to examine or inspect an assessment roll.\n(6) The assessor shall in each year, before the return of the assessment roll, search for and examine all notices which may be so on file and shall follow and conform thereto and to the provisions of this Act.\nThe appeal came before the Ontario Court of Appeal by way of a stated case and it is convenient to set forth the material facts in the words of the case:\nThe appeal was heard by the Court of Revision and on the 25th day of November, 1937, the decision of that Court, along with its reasons, was handed down in writing and a certified copy was produced and filed as Exhibit 6. That Court allowed the appeal with the effect that the whole of the assessment of the Ford Company goes to the support of the Public Schools.\nThe decision of that Court was not unanimous. The minority member, who would have disallowed the appeal, stated \u201cthat in his opinion the basis of the appeal should have been established by sub-section 4 of section 65 of the Separate Schools Act\u201d; the section 65 mentioned being now section 66 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, chapter 362.\nIt was the opinion of the majority members of the Court, according to the certificate filed (exhibit 6): \u201cThat subsection 4 does not invalidate subsection 3 and providing that the letter of the law and the spirit therein is adhered to in accordance with subsection 3, then subsection 4 would have been grounds for confirmation of the assessment. Such was not established by evidence under oath as previously recorded, not only was no effort made by the Corporation to ascertain the number of shares held by Roman Catholics but the Corporation had no knowledge of the proportion of shares held by Roman Catholics.\u201d\nAgainst this decision Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited and the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Windsor appealed.\nIn addition to the aforementioned exhibits filed was exhibit 5, being a certified copy of notice, form 15, under section 33b of the then Assessment Act, Revised Statutes, 1927, chapter 238, of the Ford Motor Company, filed in 1936 attached to which was the statutory declaration of the secretary stating that the Ford Company was unable to ascertain which of its shareholders are Roman Catholic and Separate School supporters or the ratio which the number of shares or memberships held by Roman Catholics who are Separate School supporters bore to all the shares issued by the Corporation.\nAt the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, after the production of the exhibits and their identification by Mrs. Helen Weller of the City Clerk\u2019s Department of the City of Windsor, Mr. Aylesworth, counsel for the Ford Motor Company, pointed out that one of the main questions between the parties was as to where the burden rests as to the compliance or non-compliance of the Company with the provisions of the then section 65 (now 66) of the Separate Schools Act and that without waiving his position that that onus was on the respondent here to prove affirmatively that less than 18% of the shares were held by Roman Catholics and that that onus was not on the appellant company to prove that there were as many as 18% of its shares held by Roman Catholics, he was willing to bring out the facts on the point. To this Mr. Spencer assented.\nMr. Douglas B. Greig, Secretary of Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited, was then called and gave his evidence, some of the material parts of which were:\nThe Company was incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act; has 1,658,960 shares of common stock and no preferred shares; that there were shares held by companies; that as of November 28th, 1936, the shares were held in 32 countries; that as of November 27th, 1937, the shares were held in 34 countries; that in Canada and the United States 1.500,000 shares are held; that the company cannot get the shareholders to reply to communications as to religion and school taxes; that the company has difficulty in getting many of its dividend cheques into the hands of those entitled; that they lately had about 100 letters containing dividend cheques returned to them; that there is, on the average, about 20,000 different shareholders; that all the company\u2019s shares of stock are not voting shares; that voting shares are not as widely distributed; that, on the average, about 19% of the proxies are returned; that voting shares are held in 16 different countries; that a number of outstanding shares are held in names of brokers; that between September, 1936, and November, 1937, the company\u2019s records indicate that the average number of shares held by brokers was 195,000; that the company has transfer agencies in Montreal, Toronto, Detroit and New York; that the number of shares changing ownership, according to records of stock exchanges, exceed by 9,500 monthly the number of shares presented for transfer on the books of the company; that in the year 1937 there were 665,874 shares of stock transferred on the books of the company; that the directors knew that all the stock of the company was not held by shareholders of the Roman Catholic faith and that shares were held by both Roman Catholics and others but did not know and could not ascertain what total percentage of the stock was held by Roman Catholics; that it was a practical impossibility to ascertain definitely what percentage of the shares were held by Roman Catholics and in fact the directors did not inquire from the shareholders as to their religious faith; that the Board consisted of five directors of whom one was a Roman Catholic which director was absent from the meeting adopting the resolution.\nThere were other facts brought out from Mr. Greig\u2019s evidence, but, I think the material facts are above recited. His evidence did show that directors in making the apportionment they did, acted in good faith and with every desire to be fair; they reasoned from a number of angles and made assessment comparisons and population comparisons, it is true many, if not most of them, after the notice, Form B, had been filed with the City Clerk; and that the directors, in adopting the resolution believed, from such information as was available to them, that the apportionment made to Separate Schools by the resolution was a percentage of the Company\u2019s local assessment no greater than the percentage of its shares held by Roman Catholics. However, I found that the division they made was not based on actual knowledge and was only a guess or an estimate.\nNone of the parties proved what proportion of the stock or shares of the Company was held by Roman Catholics. With the greatest respect, I find myself unable to concur in the application that has been made of this statute by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. My views can be stated very briefly.\nI am unable to escape the conclusion that section 66 imposes a strict limit upon the proportion of its land and business or other assessments which can be designated by the ratepayer\u2011corporation in its notice for assessment for the purposes of the separate school in the municipality. Subsection 3 appears to me to impose a prohibition directed to the corporation against designating for such purposes a proportion of its land, business or other assessments greater than the proportion which the stock or shares held by Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of its stock or shares.\nThe ratepayer corporation is not a public body, but in giving the notice authorized by section 66, it is exercising a statutory authority bestowed upon it in the public interest and for a public purpose. In exercising such authority it is affected by certain obligations which govern a public body invested with powers the execution of which may prejudicially affect the rights and interests of others. It is bound to act within the limits of the power conferred, and conformably to the procedure laid down by the statute. It is bound to exercise the power in good faith for the purposes for which the power is given, that is to say, for the purposes contemplated by the statute; and, in putting the power into effect (following the procedure laid down), it is bound to act reasonably. (Westminster v. London & N.W. Ry. Co.[2])\nWith great respect, I think this statute contemplates a notice given, and only given, after the ratepayer corporation has ascertained as a fact that the proportion of its assessment directed to be applied for separate school purposes is not greater than the proportion defined by subsection 3. Unless that condition be fulfilled, the corporation cannot, in my opinion, be said to be exercising the statutory power in conformity with the directions of the statute.\nNow, nobody suggests that in this case there has been on the part of those acting for the ratepayer corporation any conscious dereliction from duty, or any motive but an honest desire to conform to the directions of the statute; but, having considered with the greatest care the material before them as disclosed by the findings of the learned judge, I am constrained to the view that they had not before them any substantial foundation for the conclusion of fact which was the essential condition of a valid notice\u2014in the absence of which, that is to say, the notice could not be given conformably to the tenor of the statute.\nIt follows, I think, that in giving the notice the corporation was not acting reasonably in exercise of the power conferred; and that the notice was, therefore, not a valid exercise of their power. The learned judge considered that the persons acting for the Ford Company proceeded upon a guess or an estimate. There is much elasticity in the employment of the word \u201cestimate,\u201d but it is very clear to me that, as I have already implied, they had not before them anything that could lead them beyond the region of supposition.\nNo abstract criterion can be laid down for weighing the probative force of facts. It is sufficient that in this case there was no solid basis for a conclusion that the statutory condition of a valid notice was, in fact, fulfilled.\nThe view I have expressed would not preclude the Corporation ratepayer, or, I think, the Separate School Board, from establishing before the Court of Revision that the conditions under which the notice could validly be given did in fact exist; but there was no such evidence in this case.\nQuestion No. 3 ought, therefore, to be answered in the affirmative and that answer disposes of the controversy.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Judge Mahon restored.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014On July 27th, 1937, the directors of the respondent company, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, passed a resolution instructing its secretary to forward to the Clerk of the City of Windsor a notice requiring that eighteen per centum of the Company\u2019s land and business or other assessments in Windsor be entered, rated and assessed for Roman Catholic Separate School purposes. A notice to that effect, in the prescribed form, was sent to and received by the City Clerk, and the assessor entered the Company as a separate school supporter in the municipal assessment roll with respect to the designated percentage of the Company\u2019s assessments and as a public school supporter with respect to eighty-two per centum of its assessments.\nIt is common ground that in the absence of such notice the Company would have been properly entered as a public school supporter only. The notice was given and the entries made in accordance with section 65 of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O., 1927, chapter 328, as enacted by section 57 of The Statute Law Amendment Act, 1937. As the determination of this appeal depends primarily upon the construction of section 65, its provisions are reproduced forthwith:\u2014\n65. (1) A corporation by notice, Form B, to the clerk of any municipality wherein a separate school exists may require the whole or any part of the land of which such corporation is either the owner and occupant, or not being the owner is the tenant, occupant or actual possessor, and the whole or any proportion of the business assessment or other assessments of such corporation made under The Assessment Act, to be entered, rated and assessed for the purposes of such separate school.\n(2) The assessor shall thereupon enter the corporation as a separate school supporter in the assessment roll in respect of the land and business or other assessments designated in the notice, and the proper entries shall be made in the prescribed column for separate school rates, and so much of the land and business or other assessments so designated shall be assessed accordingly for the purposes of the separate school and not for public school purposes, but all other land and the remainder, if any, of the business or other assessments of the corporation shall be separately entered and assessed for public school purposes.\n(3) Unless all the stock or shares are held by Roman Catholics the share or portion of such land and business or other assessments to be so rated and assessed shall not bear a greater proportion to the whole of such assessments than the amount of the stock or shares so held bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares.\n(4) A notice given in pursuance of a resolution of the directors shall be sufficient and shall continue in force and be acted upon until it is withdrawn, varied or cancelled by a notice subsequently given pursuant to any resolution of the corporation or of its directors.\n(5) Every notice so given shall be kept by the clerk on file in his office and shall at all convenient hours be open to inspection and examination by any person entitled to examine or inspect an assessment roll.\n(6) The assessor shall in each year, before the return of the assessment roll, search for and examine all notices which may be so on file and shall follow and conform thereto and to the provisions of this Act. FORM B\n(Section 65)\nNotice by Corporation as to Application of School Tax.\nTo the Clerk of (describing the municipality).\nTake notice that (here insert the name of the corporation so as to sufficiently and reasonably designate it) pursuant to a resolution in that behalf of the directors requires that hereafter and until this notice is either withdrawn or varied the whole or so much of the assessment for land and business or other assessments of the corporation within (giving the name of the municipality) as is hereinafter designated, shall be entered, rated and assessed for separate school purposes, namely, one-fifth (or as the case may be) of the land and business or other assessments.\nGiven on behalf of the said company this (here insert date).\nR.S., Secretary of the Company.\nIn accordance with section 32 of The Assessment Act then in force (R.S.O., 1927, chapter 238), the Board of Education for the City of Windsor complained to the Court of Revision that the Company was wrongfully placed upon the roll as a Roman Catholic School supporter. By a majority, the Court of Revision considered that it was not established by evidence under oath that eighteen per centum was not a greater proportion of the whole of the Company\u2019s assessments than the proportion of stock or shares in the Company held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of such stock or shares; and\nnot only was no effort made by the corporation to ascertain the number of shares held by Roman Catholics but the corporation has no knowledge of the proportion of shares held by Roman Catholics.\nThey therefore held that the whole of the Company\u2019s assessments should be entered and assessed for public school purposes.\nThe Company and the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Windsor appealed to the County Judge and upon the latter\u2019s affirmance of the decision of the Court of Revision took a further appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on a stated case. The Court of Appeal reversed the order of the County Judge and the Board of Education now appeals to this Court.\nThe County Judge reported and found as follows:\u2014\nAt the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, after the production of the exhibits and their identification by Mrs. Helen Weller of the City Clerk\u2019s Department of the City of Windsor, Mr. Aylesworth, counsel for the Ford Motor Company, pointed out that one of the main questions between the parties was as to where the burden rests as to the compliance or non-compliance of the company with the provisions of the then section 65 (now 66) of the Separate Schools Act and that without waiving his position that that onus was on the respondent here to prove affirmatively that less than 18 per cent. of the shareholders were Roman Catholics and that that onus was not on the appellant company to prove that there were as many as 18 per cent. of its shareholders Roman Catholic, he was willing to bring out the facts on the point. To this Mr. Spencer assented.\nMr. Douglas B. Grieg, secretary of the Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, was then called and gave his evidence, some of the material parts of which were:\nThe Company was incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act; has 1,658,960 shares of common stock and no preferred shares; that there were shares held by companies; that as of November 28th, 1936, the shares were held in 32 countries; that as of November 27th, 1937, the shares were held in 34 countries; that in Canada and the United States, 1,500,000 shares are held; that the company cannot get the shareholders to comply with requests as to school taxes; that the company has difficulty in getting many of its dividend cheques into the hands of those entitled; that they lately had about 100 letters containing dividend cheques returned to them; that there is, on the average, about 20,000 different shareholders; that all the company\u2019s shares of stock are not voting shares; that voting shares are not as widely distributed; that, on the average, about 19 per cent. of proxies are returned; that voting shares are held in 16 different countries; that a number of outstanding shares are held in names of brokers; that between September, 1936, and November, 1936, the company\u2019s records indicate that the average number of shares held by brokers was 195,000; that the company has transfer agencies in Montreal, Toronto, Detroit and New York; that the number of shares changing ownership, according to records of stock exchanges, exceed by 9,500 to 10,000 monthly the number of shares presented for transfer on the books of the company; that in the year 1937 there were 665,874 shares of stock transferred on the books of the company; that the directors knew that all the stock of the company was not held by shareholders of the Roman Catholic faith and that shares were held by both Roman Catholics and others but did not know and could not know what percentage of the stock was held by Roman Catholics.\nThere were other facts brought out from Mr. Greig\u2019s evidence, but, I think the material facts are above recited. His evidence did show the directors, in making the apportionment they did, acted in good faith and with every desire to be fair. They reasoned from a number of angles and made assessment comparisons and population comparisons, it is true many, if not most of them, after the notice, Form B, had been filed with the city clerk. However, I must find and do find that the division they made was not based on actual knowledge and was only a guess or an estimate.\nThe questions asked in the stated case are as follows:\u2014\n1. Upon the facts above set out and upon the true construction of the Statutes as applied to the facts, was I right in holding that upon an appeal by a ratepayer affected by the Notice \u201cB\u201d given by the Corporation and the assessment, rating and enrolment made thereunder, the onus is upon the Corporation to establish the fact that the share or proportion of its land, business or other assessments as set out in its requisition (Form B) does not bear a greater proportion to the whole of its assessments than the amount of the stock or shares held by Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares.\n2. Upon the facts above set out and upon the true construction of the Statutes as applied to the facts, was I right in holding that upon an appeal by a ratepayer affected by the Notice \u201cB\u201d given by the Corporation and the assessment, rating and enrolment made thereunder, the onus is not upon the ratepayer attacking the assessment to establish affirmatively the fact that the share or proportion of the Corporation\u2019s land, business or other assessments as set out in its requisition (Form B) bears a greater proportion to the whole of its assessments than the amount of the stock or shares held by Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares.\n3. Upon the facts above set out and upon the true construction of the Statutes as applied to the facts so stated, was I right in holding that the appeals of Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, and of the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Windsor, should be dismissed, the decision of the Court of Revision sustained and the Notice, Form B, delivered by Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, set aside, vacated and declared null and void and of no effect and that all the assessments of the Company in the City of Windsor be assessed, enrolled and rated for Public School purposes, unless it was affirmatively proved before me that the share or proportion of the Corporation\u2019s land, business or other assessment as set out in its requisition (Form B) did not bear a greater proportion to the whole of its assessment than the amount of the stock or shares held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of the stock or shares.\nTwo points should, I think, be here emphasized. The first is that, while in the present instance the assessor fulfilled the obligation cast upon him by subsection 2 of section 65 of The Separate Schools Act, the problem would be the same if he had disregarded his plain duty and had failed to assess in accordance with the notice sent by the Company. In either case the question of substance must be whether a party objecting to the notice is obliged to show affirmatively that the proportion of the holdings of Roman Catholics in shares or stock of the Company was less than eighteen per centum. The second point is that the hearing of the appeal from the Court of Revision by the County Judge is in the nature of a new trial, as sub\u2011section 2 of section 78 of the present Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, chapter 272, provides:\u2014\nThe hearing of the said appeal by the county judge shall, where questions of fact are involved, be in the nature of a new trial, and either party may adduce further evidence in addition to that heard before the court of revision subject to any order as to costs or adjournment which the judge may consider just.\nThe proper construction of section 65 of The Separate Schools Act cannot be reached without an investigation of its history. For many years the Separate Schools Act in force from time to time in Ontario contained a section empowering a company to give notice to the clerk of the municipality wherein a separate school existed, requiring any part of its assessable property to be rated and assessed for the purposes of the separate school. In this section was included a proviso (as, for instance, in section 54 of The Separate Schools Act as enacted by 4 Edward VII, chapter 24, section 6) that the share so rated \u201cshall bear the same ratio and proportion to the whole of the assessment\u201d as the amount or proportion of the shares or stock of the Company as are held and possessed by persons who are Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of such shares or stock. In 1913, however, by 3-4 George V, chapter 71, section 66, the statutory provision was recast. What was formerly the proviso appeared (as it now does), as subsection 3,\u2014but with this important difference: Instead of the requirement that the share of the assessment should bear the same ratio and proportion to the whole of the assessment as the amount or proportion of the shares held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of such shares, it was provided that it shall not bear a greater proportion.\nMr. Hellmuth, for the appellant, argued that prior to 1913 it would have been incumbent upon the Company to ascertain the exact proportion, and that as soon as it was shown before the Court of Revision or County Judge that that had not been done, the Company would be assessed for public school purposes; the new Act, he submitted, merely authorized the Company to find the limits of the ratio but gave it no further or greater power. That is, he contended, the Company must be able to show that, in selecting the proportion to be assessed for separate school purposes, it has not adopted a greater proportion than the holdings of Roman Catholics bear to the whole amount of the Company\u2019s stock or shares. As an aid towards the establishment of these propositions he relied upon Regina Public School District v. Gratton Separate School District[3].\nIn connection with that case, it should be noted at the outset that two members of this Court were in favour of allowing the appeal because of their views as to the proper construction of sections 93 and 93 (a) of the Saskatchewan School Assessment Act, while two others adopted a directly contrary construction. In the result, the appeal was allowed, but that was because the fifth member, Mr. Justice Idington, without expressing any opinion upon the question of construction, concluded that the legislation was ultra vires the Saskatchewan legislature. In any event, the statutory provisions and the facts before the Court in that case were so different from what we have to consider on this appeal that no assistance may be gained from a review of the opinions expressed as to the construction of the statute. There, a number of companies had not given, under the permissive section 93 of the Saskatchewan School Assessment Act, notices requiring a portion of their school taxes to be applied for separate school purposes. Section 93 contained a proviso that the share to be assessed for separate school purposes should bear the same proportion to the whole property of the company assessable within the school district as the proportion of the shares of the company held by Protestants or Roman Catholics respectively bore to the whole amount of the shares of the company,\u2014in effect the same as the proviso in the earlier Ontario statutes. Under section 93 (a), which had been enacted later than section 93, the separate school trustees notified these companies that unless and until they gave notice under section 93 the school taxes payable by them would be divided according to a set formula. The mooted question was as to the efficacy of the separate school trustees\u2019 notices upon the proper construction of the two sections.\nIn the case at bar, although no obligation was imposed upon the respondent company, it did give a notice. As found by the County Judge, the directors acted in good faith, knowing \u201cthat shares were held by both Roman Catholics and others\u201d although \u201cnot what percentage of the stock was held by Roman Catholics.\u201d Under these circumstances, if the question had arisen under the statute as it stood prior to the 1913 amendment, no effect could have been given to the notice because it was shown that the share of the Company\u2019s assessments to be rated for separate school purposes did not bear the same ratio to the whole of the assessments as the proportion of the shares held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of such shares. I attach no importance to the fact that the new legislation appears, not as a proviso, but as a separate subsection, but the enactment was altered and it is only from a consideration of the language used that we are justified in gauging the intention of the legislature. That intention was to free a company desirous of having part of its assessment apportioned to separate school purposes from the difficulty of ascertaining the precise ratio of the holdings of Roman Catholics in its capital stock. To adopt the construction of the statute suggested on behalf of the appellant would be to require the Company to do the very same thing, although, it is true, it might then direct that a less proportion of its assessments be rated for such purposes. To give effect to the legislative intention, the proper construction of the statute requires us to hold that the Company\u2019s notice stands and is to be followed unless displaced by evidence that the prohibition in subsection 3 has been violated. As pointed out by Masten, J.A., if the fact be as the appellant contends, the means existed whereby it might be proved.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET J.\u2014As I fully concur in the reasons for the unanimous judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (Middleton, Masten and Fisher, JJ.A.), as given by Masten, J.A., as well as in those of my brother Kerwin here, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDAVIS J. (dissenting)\u2014I am of the same opinion as my Lord, the Chief Justice. The fact that the case is one of general importance leads me to state fully the reasons which move me to the same conclusion.\nThe appeal raises nothing but a question of law. The facts found by the County Judge are not subject to any right of appeal; we are entirely bound by those facts. The only question open for determination upon the stated case under The Assessment Act is the question of pure law: whether the County Judge as a matter of law upon the facts as he found them, reached a proper conclusion.\nThe point in issue in the case is a very simple one, turning on the interpretation and application of the words of sec. 66 of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 362. For convenience I shall refer throughout to the pro- visions in the present revised statutes of Ontario (1937) because there has been no change in the relevant provisions in force at the dates material in this case. Under said sec. 66 a corporation may require the whole or any part of its land, business or other assessments in any municipality in which a separate school exists, to be rated and assessed for the purposes of separate schools rather than for the purposes of public schools, but \u201cunless all the stock or shares\u201d in the corporation \u201care held by Roman Catholics,\u201d the share or portion of said land, business or other assessments to be so rated and assessed \u201cshall not bear a greater proportion\u201d to the whole of such assessments than the amount of the stock or shares held by Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares of the corporation.\nThe respondent Ford Motor Company of Canada Limited, in July, 1937, sought to have 18 per cent. of its land, business and other assessments in the City of Windsor rated and assessed for separate school purposes under and by virtue of the statutory provision above mentioned, by delivering to the clerk of the municipality a notice (Form B) as provided by subsection (1); the assessor thereupon, in accordance with subsection (2), entered the company as a separate school supporter in the assessment roll in respect of 18 per cent. of its land, business and other assessments designated in the notice. The Board of Education for the City of Windsor complained of this assessment (by virtue of sec. 31 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 272) and raised the question by way of appeal to the Court of Revision, of the right of the company to divert this portion of its school rates from the public schools to the separate schools. The Court of Revision by a majority agreed with the Board of Education\u2019s contention that the company had not brought itself within the statute, and accordingly set aside the assessment in respect of separate schools. On an appeal being taken by the company and by the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Windsor (by separate notices of appeal, to which I shall later refer) to the County Judge, he, by force of subsec. (2) of sec. 78 of The Assessment Act, was entitled to deal and did deal with the appeals as \u201cin the nature of a new trial\u201d and all parties were entitled to adduce further evidence in addition to that heard before the Court of Revision. Sec. 83 of The Assessment Act provides that the decision and judgment of the County Judge \u201cshall be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon,\u201d except that in the case of the assessment of a telephone company an appeal shall lie from such decision and judgment to the Ontario Municipal Board. Sec. 85, however, gives a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the County Judge \u201con a question of law or the construction of a statute.\u201d Sub-section (2) of sec. 85 provides that any party desiring so to appeal to the Court of Appeal shall, on the hearing of the appeal by the Judge, request the Judge to make a note of any such question of law or construction and to state the same in the form of a special case for the Court of Appeal. That was the procedure adopted in this case.\nThe County Judge found, as was in fact admitted, that all the shares of the company were not held by Roman Catholics. That being so, the question of fact then was whether or not 18 per cent. was a greater proportion of the whole of the company\u2019s assessments than the amount of the shares of the company held by Roman Catholics bore to the whole amount of the shares of the company. The right of a company under the statute to divert a portion of its school rates from public schools to separate schools (where all the shares are not held by Roman Catholics) is limited, as I have said, to a proportion \u201cnot greater than\u201d the amount of the shares of the company held by Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of the shares of the company. Prior to the amendment made in 1913 (3-4 Geo. V, 1913, ch. 71, sec. 66 (3)) the words were \u201cshall bear the same ratio and proportion\u201d (see 4 Edw. VII, 1904, ch. 24, sec. 6). The amendment permitted any part of a company\u2019s taxes to be diverted to separate schools so long as it \u201cshall not bear a greater proportion.\u201d It is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the maximum statutory percentage once two amounts are ascertained\u2014the amount of the shares in the company held by Roman Catholics and the total amount of the shares of the company. It became unnecessary however, under the amendment, that the exact ratio and proportion be ascertained, or if ascertained be diverted. To whatever extent the company ascertained the amount of shares held by Roman Catholics, to that extent the amendment gave the power to divert. The taxes that may be diverted must not bear \u201ca greater proportion\u201d; they may be less, but they cannot be greater. But one cannot determine any proportion at all until he ascertains, first, the total amount of the shares of the company, and second, some amount of those shares that is held by Roman Catholics.\nIn this case the parties gave all the evidence they could to the County Judge and he found as a fact that no one knew what amount of shares was held by Roman Catholics. The evidence of the Secretary of the Company, accepted by the County Judge, was that the directors \u201cdid not enquire from the shareholders as to their religious faith.\u201d The County Judge expressly found as a fact \u201cthat the division they (i.e., the directors) made was not based on actual knowledge and was only a guess or an estimate\u201d and he sustained the decision of the Court of Revision.\nThe Company and the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Windsor, by way of a stated case on a question of law or construction of statute, appealed to the Court of Appeal. The two appeals are said to have been heard together in the Court of Appeal, as they had been before the County Judge. I cannot see any reason for both the company and the Separate School Board appealing separately, but that only goes to the question of costs. The Court of Appeal took a different view of the matter from that taken by the Court of Revision and by the County Judge, and allowed the appeals. From that judgment, to which I shall presently refer, the Board of Education appealed to this Court.\nUpon the facts as found by the County Judge (and there was not a suggestion that if an appeal had lain on matters of fact as well as on matters of law the findings of fact could have been in any way impeached), I confess that I cannot see any really arguable point of law. If the company does not ascertain any number of shares held by Roman Catholics, how can the Court say that 18% is \u201cnot greater than\u201d the maximum proportion allowed by the statute?\nMuch of the argument was directed to the question of onus and the first two questions in the case stated by the County Judge at the request of the respondents are directed to the question of onus. But all the available facts were frankly given to the tribunal of fact (i.e., the County Judge), and the facts have been found and there is no right of appeal thereon. If no evidence had been tendered to the County Judge on the hearing before him, or if the evidence had been so evenly balanced that the County Judge could come to no conclusion on the facts, the onus or burden of proof might have operated as a determining factor of the whole case; Robins v. National Trust Co.[4] But that was not the case here. The learned County Judge was not upon the whole evidence judicially satisfied that 18 per cent. was not a greater proportion than that permitted by the statute. It is quite unnecessary for the Court to answer the first two questions submitted in the stated case. The third question is the substance of the matter, i.e., Was the County Judge right in holding that the appeals of the company and of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools Trustees should be dismissed, the decision of the Court of Revision sustained and the notice, form B, delivered by the company, set aside, unless it was affirmatively proved that the percentage of the company\u2019s assessments (i.e., 18 per cent.) set out in the requisition (Form B) did not bear a greater proportion to the whole of its assessments than the amount of the shares held by Roman Catholics bears to the whole amount of the shares of the company? Agreeing as I do with the conclusion of the learned County Judge upon the facts as he found them, I would answer the third question in the affirmative.\nBut there was so much said during the argument on the question of onus that it may be desirable to say that in any case where onus becomes of importance the problem of deciding upon whom the onus rests depends upon the nature and circumstances of the particular question involved. There is no single principle or rule which will afford a test in all cases for ascertaining the incidence of the burden. A statement of general application appears to be that the burden of proof lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative; but even this statement as a working rule presents its own difficulties in particular cases because, when the subject-matter of a negative averment lies peculiarly within the knowledge of the other party, the averment may be taken as true unless disproved by that party. And yet this statement again cannot be said to furnish a satisfactory general working rule. The article on Evidence in the Hailsham edition of Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England (Vol. XIII) which was under the editorship of Lord Roche, has left untouched the carefully guarded statement in the article on Evidence, in the first edition, which was under the joint editorship of Mr. Hume-Williams and Mr. Phipson. The law was there stated as at October, 1910, and the unchanged statement to which I have reference, in the edition of 1934, is paragraph 615 (2) at page 545, as follows:\n(2) Where the truth of a party\u2019s allegation lies peculiarly within the knowledge of his opponent, the burden of disproving it lies upon the latter.\nThe principle of this exception has frequently been recognized, both by the Legislature and in decided cases. On the other hand, its validity has been several times challenged by high authorities, and having regard to this conflict of opinion, the following statement of the point is, perhaps, the one which is the least open to objection:\u2014\u201cIn considering the amount of evidence necessary to shift the burden of proof, the court has regard to the opportunities of knowledge with respect to the fact to be proved which may be possessed by the parties respectively.\u201d\nI cannot appreciate the argument that when a company has been given a statutory right to divert taxes from one purpose to another provided the division \u201cshall not bear a greater proportion\u201d than that stipulated in the statute, and the company puts in an arbitrary figure without any actual knowledge of the facts, it falls upon those adversely affected to establish the two essential facts that are necessary in order that the simple mathematical calculation can be made to determine the maximum stipulated statutory proportion beyond which the taxes are not to be diverted, i.e., first, the total amount of the stock or shares of the company, and secondly, the amount of the stock or shares held by Roman Catholics. If that is so, it would only be necessary for any company to put in any arbitrary figure it liked and then to say to any person prejudicially affected and complaining that the division of taxes occasioned by such arbitrary figure must stand until the person who complains is able to prove affirmatively against the company (which itself has the information in its own keeping, if any one has) that the arbitrary percentage is in fact greater than the proportion fixed and permitted by the statute.\nWhile in my opinion, as already expressed, the question of onus does not arise in this case, if you had a case where onus became of importance it would, in my view, rest upon the party seeking the benefit of the special statutory provision. Even before the days of Confederation, the same sort of problem with which we have to deal here arose in Upper Canada with respect to school assessments of individuals. The principal school legislation of the province of Ontario may be traced from the form in which it appeared in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, 1859, ch. 64, through various consolidations. In 1862, in the case of Ridsdale and Brush[5], the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, composed of McLean, C.J., Burns and Hagarty, JJ., delivered judgment in which Burns, J., speaking for the Court, at p. 124 said:\nWe take it to be perfectly plain, from reading the Common School Act, chapter 64 of the Consol. Stats. of U.C., chapter 65, providing for separate schools, and chapter 55, the Assessment Act, that the Legislature intended the provisions creating the common school system, and for working and carrying that out, were to be the rule, and that all the provisions for the separate schools were only exceptions to the rule, and carved out of it for the convenience of such separatists as availed themselves of the provisions in their favour.\nGwynne, J., in Harling v. Mayville[6], approved the language of Burns, J., in the Ridsdale case5 and said, at p. 511:\nI think that the party claiming exemption from the general rule of prima facie liability to common school rates should show that the trustees of his separate school have taken the steps pointed out by the law to procure for the separatists the desired exemption.\nThe language of Burns, J., in the Ridsdale case[7] was again referred to by Chief Justice Hagarty (he had been a member of the Court in that case) in Free v. McHugh[8]. The effect of the judgments in those cases is that it lies on the person claiming exemption as a separatist from the general liability for the support of public schools to prove those exceptional matters that take him out of the general rule. I can see nothing inconsistent with that long established view of exemption from public school rates in the statement of Lord Haldane in the Tiny case[9], that \u201cthe separate school was only a special form of common school.\u201d\nSchool legislation in Ontario has from earliest times, and continues so down to this date, provided under certain circumstances for Protestant as well as for Roman Catholic separate schools. Part I, being the first fifteen sections of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 362, provides the conditions on which one or more separate schools for Protestants and one or more separate schools for coloured people may be established in any township, city, town or village in the province. Part II provides for separate schools for Roman Catholics. The public schools are governed by The Public Schools Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 357. By sec. 5,\nAll schools established under this Act shall be free public schools, and every person between the ages of five and twenty-one years, except persons whose parents or guardians are separate school supporters, and except persons who, by reason of mental or physical defect, are unable to profit by instruction in the public schools, shall have the right to attend some such school in the urban municipality or rural school section in which he resides.\nCounsel for the respondents pressed upon us another argument, quite independent of the question of onus. They said that the proportion or percentage in this case was \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d made in good faith by the directors as a fair estimate, and that the statute should be so interpreted by the Court, as in fact it was by the Court of Appeal, to allow any such reasonable probability to stand as a satisfactory compliance with the statute, upon the ground that the manifest intention of the statute was to provide for an equitable apportionment of public and separate school taxes payable by companies having Roman Catholic shareholders. But the language of the statute itself is perfectly plain and the Court cannot relieve itself of its duty to apply it. There is nothing in the language that suggests a place for either an estimate or a guess. Sir Louis Davies (then Davies, J.) in this Court in Regina Public School District v. Gratton Separate School District[10], in discussing a Saskatchewan statute allowing an apportionment between public and separate schools somewhat similar to the statute before us (except that the share to be assessed for separate school purposes should bear \u201cthe same ratio and proportion\u201d to the whole property of the company as the proportion of the shares of the company held by the Protestants and Roman Catholics respectively bore to the whole of the shares of the company) said, at p. 606:\nNow it is manifest that a company desirous of exercising the permission given by section 93 must before exercising it have ascertained with certainty the religious persuasions or beliefs or connections of its various shareholders. In no other way could the statutory division the company was authorized to require of its assessable taxes be made and the grossest injustice might be done to one or other of the respective schools, public or separate, if in the absence of such knowledge any company should attempt to exercise its privilege.\nThe statutory provision with which we have to deal was first enacted in its present language in 1913 (3-4 Geo. V, ch. 71, sec. 66), when the words \u201cnot greater than\u201d were substituted for the words \u201cthe same ratio and proportion,\u201d which had appeared in the enactment as first introduced in Ontario in 1886 by 49 Vict., ch. 46, sec. 53. It is not without significance, I think, that in 1936, then sec. 65 of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 328 (the same as present sec. 66), was repealed by the Ontario Legislature by The School Law Amendment Act, 1936, being 1 Edw. VIII, ch. 55, sec. 42, and there was passed by the Legislature An Act to amend The Assessment Act, being 1 Edw. VIII, ch. 4, which added to The Assessment Act entirely new sections, 33a, 33b, 33c, 33d, 33e and 33f, relating to the distribution of assessments of corporations for public and separate school purposes. These statutory changes\u2014that is, the repeal of old sec. 65 of The Separate Schools Act and the enactment of the new provisions\u2014were both assented to on April 9th, 1936. The new provisions expressly dealt with the case, such as the one before us in this appeal, of\n* * * a corporation, which, by reason of the large number of its shareholders or members and the wide distribution in point of residence of such shareholders or members, is unable to ascertain which of its shareholders or members are Roman Catholics and separate school supporters or the ratio which the number of the shares or memberships held by Roman Catholics who are separate school supporters bears to all the shares issued by or memberships of the corporation, * * * [sec. 33b (1)]. Provision was made for the division of school taxes between the public schools and separate schools\nin the same ratio as the total assessments of all the rateable property in such municipality or school section assessed according to the last revised assessment roll to persons who being individuals are public school supporters bear to the total assessments of all the rateable property in such municipality or school section assessed according to the said assessment roll to persons who being individuals are Roman Catholics and separate school supporters; and taxation for public school purposes and separate school purposes against the said lands, business and income of the corporation shall be imposed and levied accordingly; * * * [sec. 33b (3)].\nThese new provisions were obviously intended to meet just such a case as that now before us where, by reason of the large number of shareholders and the wide distribution in point of residence, a company is unable to ascertain, or cannot conveniently ascertain, which of its shareholders are Roman Catholics. But all these new statutory provisions were entirely repealed, on March 25th, 1937, at the next session of the Legislature by The Assessment Amendment Repeal Act, 1937, being 1 Geo. VI, ch. 9, and on the same day there was re\u2011enacted, by The Statute Law Amendment Act, 1937, 1 Geo. VI, ch. 72, sec. 57, old sec. 65 of The Separate Schools Act (the same as sec. 66 in the Revised Statutes of 1937) which had been repealed the year before and which section specifically provides that\n65. (3) Unless all the stock or shares are held by Roman Catholics the share or portion of such land and business or other assessments to be so rated and assessed shall not bear a greater proportion to the whole of such assessments than the amount of the stock or shares so held bears to the whole amount of the stock or shares.\nThe fact that the Legislature obviously dealt with just such a difficulty as has occurred in this case, and then immediately repealed the new provisions and restored the old, leaves no room in my opinion for the construction put upon the section by the Court of Appeal that we will best effectuate the intention of the Legislature by construing the words so as to imply that in the absence of actual knowledge of any amount of shares held by Roman Catholics in the company, a fair estimate is sufficient.\nThe general rule undoubtedly is that where an Act of Parliament has been repealed it is, as to all matters completed and ended at the time of its repeal, as though it had never existed as a governing law with respect to these subject-matters (per Bramwell, L.J., in Attorney-General v. Lamplough[11]). But if a present statute is doubtful or ambiguous, it is to be interpreted so as to fulfill the intention of the Legislature and to attain the object for which it was passed, and in that connection Lord Blackburn in Bradlaugh v. Clarke[12] said:\nIt is upon this principle that it is held, as I think it has always been held, that where a statute was passed for the purpose of repealing and, in part, re-enacting former statutes, all the statutes in pari materi\u00e2 are to be considered, in order to see what it was that the Legislature intended to enact in lieu of the repealed enactments. It may appear from the language used that the Legislature intended to enact something quite different from the previous law, and where that is the case effect must be given to the intention. But when the words used are such as may either mean that former enactments shall be re\u2011enacted, or that they shall be altered, it is a question for the Court which was the intention.\nIn the Lamplough case[13], Bramwell, L.J., said at p. 227:\nThen it is argued that you cannot look at the repealed portion of the Act of Parliament to see what is the meaning of what remains of the Act. I know that is not the argument of the Solicitor-General, but that opinion has been expressed. I, however, dissent from it.\nBrett, L.J., in the same case, said at p. 231:\nThe judgments of the majority in the Exchequer Division lay down that the moment an Act of Parliament is partly repealed we cannot look at the repealed part for any purpose, but that the repealed part must be regarded as if it had never been enacted. I cannot help thinking that that part of the judgments is not sustainable, for what we have to consider is not what was the construction of the first statute, but what is the effect of the repealing statute? We cannot tell what is the effect of the latter without looking at the meaning of the statute which it has repealed. We must treat it as we treat all statutes for the purpose of construing them; we must look at the facts which were existing at the time the Act passed to see what was its meaning.\nLord Justice Knight Bruce said in Ex parte Copeland[14]:\nAlthough it has been repealed, still, upon a question of construction arising upon a subsequent statute on the same branch of the law, it may be legitimate to refer to the former Act. Lord Mansfield, in the case of The King v. Loxdale[15], thus lays down the rule: \u201cWhere there are different statutes in pari materi\u00e2, though made at different times, or even expired, and not referring to each other, they shall be taken and construed together as one system, and as explanatory of each other.\u201d Fletcher Moulton, L.J., in Macmillan & Co. v. Dent[16], said:\nIn interpreting an Act of Parliament you are entitled, and in many cases bound, to look at the state of the law at the date of the passing of the Act\u2014not only the common law, but the law as it then stood under previous statutes\u2014in order properly to interpret the statute in question. These may be considered to form part of the surrounding circumstances under which the Legislature passed it, and in the case of a statute, just as in the case of every other document, you are entitled to look at the surrounding circumstances at the date of its coming into existence, though the extent to which you are allowed to use them in the construction of the document is a wholly different question.\nWhile regard may be had to a repealed statute in pari materi\u00e2 where difficulties of construction arise, I do not think it is necessary to invoke this rule or to rely on the repealed statute to construe the present section, which is neither doubtful nor ambiguous. The conditions which the Legislature has thought fit to impose are plainly set forth and it is not within the province of any tribunal to relax these conditions. It is not for those seeking to take advantage of the special privilege of a statute to say that they have given something just as satisfactory and reasonable as the exact conditions imposed by the statute; they must clearly satisfy the conditions.\nAlthough the case was argued before us by the respondents as if an estimate had been carefully arrived at by the directors before the statutory notice (Form B) was given to the clerk of the municipality, it is to be noted that the County Judge does not put it that way in his findings. He says:\nThey (i.e., the directors) reasoned from a number of angles and made assessment comparisons and population comparisons,\nbut\nit is true many, if not most of them, after the notice, Form B, had been filed with the City Clerk.\nThe Court of Appeal took the view that it is impossible in most cases for companies to state the exact percentage of their shareholders who are Roman Catholics and that if it is a sine qua non under the provisions of the statute that they should so state, then the present legislation is wholly ineffective to accomplish the purpose intended by the legislation, which purpose that Court took to be to provide for an equitable apportionment of the taxes pay- able by companies where some of their shareholders are supporters of public schools and others of their shareholders are supporters of separate schools. The Court of Appeal therefore thought it was its duty to give such an interpretation of the statute as would render it effective to accomplish that purpose. But Mr. Hellmuth pointed out that there was not the injustice that had been suggested in an adherence to the language of the statute because any company that wished to could ascertain, so far as it was convenient to do so, who, if any, were Roman Catholic shareholders in the company and the amount of shares held by them. The company might not be able to exhaust the entire list of its shareholders if the company had a very large number of shareholders scattered all over the world, but supposing it ascertained that 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. of the amount of the shares of the company was held by Roman Catholics, the company could divert its school taxes to separate schools up to the ascertained percentage and it could not then be denied that that proportion was \u201cnot greater than\u201d the percentage stipulated by the statute. As the statute has stood since 1913 (except for the one year it was repealed) the percentage is not required to bear \u201cthe same ratio and proportion\u201d as in the earlier statutory provisions; the result is that a company, though it may not know all its Roman Catholic shareholders, can, to the extent that it ascertains them, take full advantage of the present statutory provision.\nIn my opinion, the County Judge was right in his conclusion and I would therefore answer the third question submitted in the stated case in the affirmative, and would allow the appeal, with costs against the respondents in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Norman L.

VI, c. 18\u2014 Statute specifically pleaded\u2014Statute coming into force after date of accident, but before date of commencement, of suit\u2014Whether statute applicable. An action was brought on October 12th, 1937, by a motor cyclist for damages sustained in a head-on collision with an automobile, which collision occurred on October 30th, 1936. The trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the accident was caused solely by the plaintiff's negligence, but that judgment was reversed by the appellate court. The respondent, alleging contributory or ultimate negligence of the defendant, pleaded specifically the application of the Contributory Negligence Act, which went into force on July 1st, 1937.\nHeld that the statute has no application to this case; and, also, that upon the facts, the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, as the plaintiff was, to some extent if not in to to, guilty of negligence which contributed to the collision.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Howson J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe action was brought by the respondent against the appellant for damages sustained in a head-on collision with an automobile. The facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nT. N. Phelan K.C. for appellant.\nI. F. Fitch K.C. for respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rinfret, Davis and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This case arises out of a collision between a motor cycle and a motor car on the Bowness road near the city of Calgary. The collision occurred shortly after midnight on October 30th, 1936. The date becomes important in view of subsequent legislation to which I shall later refer. The owner and driver of the motor cycle (respondent) commenced this action against the owner and driver of the motor car (appellant) for damages claiming $1,177.50 for special damages and $13,820 for general damages. The date of the commencement of the action was October 12th, 1937, and that date becomes of importance also in considering subsequent legislation. The statement of defence was a general denial of liability but at the trial in February, 1938, leave was given to make amendments and the amended statement of defence set up that the collision was caused by the sole negligence of the plaintiff and, alternatively, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, or, was guilty of ultimate negligence. The plaintiff then filed an amended joinder of issue and reply, in which he denied that the accident was caused by his sole negligence or that he was guilty of contributory negligence or of ultimate negligence and pleaded further that, if he was guilty of any negligence which in any way contributed to the accident, the liability to make good the damage or loss should be in proportion to the degree in which each of the parties was at fault. He pleaded specifically the Contributory Negligence Act of Alberta, 1 Geo. VI, 1937, ch. 18, which did not go into force until the first day of July, 1937.\nThe case was tried without a jury by Mr. Justice Howson at Calgary on February 23rd, 24th and 25th, 1938, and judgment was reserved until March 22nd, 1938. The action was dismissed with costs.\nThe learned trial judge carefully analyzed and considered the evidence. He found that the plaintiff had purchased the motor cycle\u2014a second-hand 1929 model\u2014two days before the accident; that the electrical ignition system was not in good condition, the tail light was disconnected, the front wheel brake was not operating, the horn was dead, the battery was very low and, although equipped so that bright and dim lights could be installed, yet the bright light only was actually working; and that between the times of the purchase of the motor cycle and the collision no repair work had been done on the machine except that the plaintiff had wound tape round the electric wiring in two places. The learned trial judge found that the collision occurred at a point where the road in question, which is hard-surfaced, makes \"a very long, gradual and level curve.\" The motor cycle and the motor car were travelling in opposite directions.\nThere was, as is not unusual in these collision cases, a good deal of conflicting evidence, but the trial judge concluded :\nAfter considering all of the evidence, I find that the defendant did keep a proper lookout, that he was not operating his motor vehicle at an excessive rate of speed and that he had his automobile under proper control. I am convinced that the plaintiff either drove his motor cycle without any light until he was close to the defendant, and then switched it on, or that his light, if on, while rounding the curve, was so ineffective that it not only failed to give the defendant warning of the plaintiff's approach, but actually deceived the defendant. The defendant had then no chance of turning to the right and thus avoiding the collision but upon realizing the imminent danger, he did all that could reasonably be expected of him, namely, he jammed on his brakes.\nWhile I have the greatest sympathy for the plaintiff, who was very badly injured, yet I find that the accident was caused solely by his own negligence, and his action must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nThe case was carried to the court of appeal for Alberta. That Court reversed the judgment at the trial and gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $4,802.50 (to include both general and special damages) together with the costs of the action and of the appeal. From that judgment the defendant appealed to this Court and the plaintiff cross-appealed, asking for an increase in the amount of damages awarded from the sum of $4,802.50 and costs to the sum of $14,997.50 and costs.\nThe court of appeal reviewed the evidence and, speaking broadly, took the view that the defendant was guilty of negligence in not having taken the right-hand side of the road when meeting the plaintiff who, the Court thought, had a better right than the defendant to be on the other side of the road. Mr. Justice Ford, in delivering the judgment of the Court, said that it was clear from the evidence that the motor cycle was proceeding on its right-hand side of the centre line of the highway, close to the ditch, and at the time of the collision was, according to the defendant's own evidence, not more than four or five and a half feet from the north side of the road. The paved surface of the road is 22 feet wide. As a matter of fact, the plaintiff said he would be \"anywhere between the ditch and possibly five or six feet to my left hand side of the ditch.\" The defendant admitted that at the time of the impact he swerved his car two or three feet to the left. Mr. Justice Ford said that there was ample room for the defendant to turn to his right of the centre line of the highway when he met the plaintiff on his motor cycle. But with great respect, in the circumstances of this case it is not a question of whether there was ample room\u2014undoubtedly there was; the question is whether when suddenly confronted in the darkness by the motor cyclist there was time or opportunity to avoid a collision. But taking the view they did of the evidence, the court of appeal concluded that\nafter the emergency was apparent he (the defendant) and not the appellant (plaintiff) had the last chance to avoid the consequences of whatever negligence of either or both was antecedent to it, and he (the defendant) failed to avail himself of it. This * * * was the real cause of the accident.\nMr. Justice Ford, speaking for the Court, took a view of the evidence quite contrary to that taken by the learned trial judge and concluded his written reasons by stating that the plaintiff did all he could to avoid the collision; that although he had the right to expect that the defendant would yield him the right of way, he kept his motor cycle as near to his right-hand side and as near to the ditch as he could reasonably be expected to do; and that it could not be said that the last clear chance to avoid the accident rested with him.\nThis case is no different from so many collision cases which present their own difficulties upon conflicting evidence, and it is not easy to determine exactly where the blame lies. The young man on his motor cycle was undoubtedly on what is commonly called his own side of the road and the motor car as it met him travelling in the opposite direction was undoubtedly over to a considerable extent on what is commonly called its wrong side of the road. But it was on a curve in the road, after midnight, and the trial judge has found, and there is abundant evidence to support the finding, that the motor cycle was being driven without any light until it came up close to the motor car and then the light was switched on, or, that the light, if it was on while rounding the curve, was so ineffective that it not only failed to give the defendant warning of the approach of the motor cycle but actually deceived the defendant in the sense that the faint light indicated a tail light of a car going in the same direction as the defendant was travelling.\nOur view of the whole evidence would agree with that taken by the trial judge that the plaintiff was the author of his own injury but it is not necessary to determine the case on that basis because even if it can properly be said that the plaintiff on his motor cycle was not solely at fault, it cannot safely be said on the evidence that he himself was not, to some extent at least, guilty of negligence which contributed to the collision. While at the date of the accident there may have been a casus omissus in the amendments to the Alberta Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act (since cured by subsequent amendments) in the absence of any specific statutory provision requiring a motor cycle to be equipped with a lamp or lamps, we agree with the statement of the learned trial judge in this regard:\nThis would not excuse any motor cycle driver from failing to have on the front of his machine a light not only sufficient for his driving purposes but ample to properly warn others of his approach\u2014anything less would constitute negligence on his part.\nThis negligence contributed to the accident and would bar the plaintiff from any recovery under the Alberta law as it stood at the date of the accident.\nCounsel for the plaintiff pressed upon us the contention that if it were found to be a case of contributory negligence, then the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of the Contributory Negligence Act of Alberta, 1 Geo. VI, 1937, ch. 18, and that that statute having been specifically pleaded, the plaintiff would be entitled to have the damage apportioned in the degree in which each person was at fault. But that statute was not passed until April 14th, 1937, and did not go into force until July 1st, 1937. It was contended that it applied to this action commenced on October 12th, 1937; the collision had occurred on October 30th, 1936. We cannot accept that contention. The principle is too well established to require authority that a statute is prima facie prospective unless it contains express words or there is the plainest implication to the contrary effect.\nThe Alberta Contributory Negligence Act which was specifically pleaded by the plaintiff in his amended joinder of issue and reply dated February 24th, 1938, as a result of the amendments made by the defendant at the trial, has no application to this case.\nWe would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout. The cross-appeal necessarily fails and should be dismissed, but without costs.\nHUDSON J.\u2014This is an action for negligence in which the learned trial judge found that the accident was caused solely by the plaintiff's negligence. This decision was reversed by the court of appeal in Alberta. There the learned judges took the view that the defendant was guilty of negligence in two respects. In the first place, that he did not keep his vehicle to the right of the centre line of the road, and secondly, that when he became aware of the plaintiff's approach, instead of turning to the right he turned to the left, and that even assuming that there was negligence on the part of the plaintiff himself to act, once the emergency was apparent the defendant had the last chance to avoid the accident and failed to avail himself of it.\nIn considering the disposition of the appeal, the statements of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline and Lord Macmillan, which I have quoted at length in a judgment given to-day in the case of Sershall v. Toronto Transportation Commission[3], seem to me to be particularly applicable to the present case. Approaching the matter in the way indicated by these statements, I do not feel any difficulty in accepting the view of the learned trial judge to the extent that there was negligence contributing to the accident on the part of the plaintiff himself. That the defendant may have been guilty of some negligence is a question on which I feel less satisfied, but the mere fact of negligence on the part of the defendant, where there was negligence contributing to the accident, on the part of the plaintiff himself, would not impose liability at common law. A statute of Alberta covering this situation was passed after the accident, but for reasons pointed out by my brother Davis, I do not think that this statute affected this case.\nOn the application of the doctrine \"last chance\" it seems to me that the trial judge was best qualified to\n446\ndecide whether or not the plaintiff was to blame for the situation as it was. With all respect to the court below, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1938] 3 W.W.R. 691.\n[2] [1938] 1 W.W.R. 734.\n[3] [1939] S.C.R. 287.\n"}

The facts of the case are undisputed, the accused having called no evidence. One Lallemand was injured and incapacitated for a considerable period. He did not know the name of a single witness who could strengthen any claim he might make against the Montreal Tramways Company, the party he considered responsible for his injury; and for that reason, his attorneys could not advise action. Some time later, Lallemand\u2019s wife approached the appellant, who undertook to search for those who might have seen the accident. Lallemand and his wife having no money to pay the appellant for his services, it was agreed that the amount and settlement of his remuneration should await the conclusion of the litigation; but there was no bargain that he should receive a share of the proceeds. Then Lallemand himself chose and retained an attorney, who commenced and continued an action against the Montreal Tramways Company without any contribution from Lallemand or the appellant towards the expenses. In the meantime, however, the appellant had discovered certain witnesses whose testimony was made available to Lallemand\u2019s attorney. The action was finally settled upon payment of $6,000 by the company to the attorney. At Lallemand\u2019s direction, the expenses were paid out of that sum, including the amount at which the appellant\u2019s account was finally fixed. Held, that, under these circumstances, the appellant was not guilty of the criminal offence of maintenance. In order to make a person liable as a maintainer, either civilly or criminally, that person must have intervened officiously or improperly. There must exist officious interference, introduction of parties to enforce rights which others are not disposed to enforce and stirring up of strife. In this case, Lallemand was disposed to enforce his claim, and in fact had already consulted attorneys before his wife approached the appellant; and the appellant did not intervene on his own initiative and took no action that may be in any way described as stirring up strife and litigation.\nHeld, also, that the appellant could not be convicted of the crime of champerty, as he did not carry on the litigation at his own expense nor did he bargain for a share of the proceeds.\nReview of cases and text books on \u201cmaintenance.\u201d\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming by a majority the judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace by which the appellant had been convicted of maintenance and champerty and fined five hundred dollars.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nGustave Monette K.C. for the appellant.\nIvan Sabourin for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The appellant Goodman was convicted of maintenance and champerty by the Court of Sessions of the Peace and fined five hundred dollars. Upon appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the conviction was affirmed but, as appears from the formal judgment of the Court\nMr. Justice Bernier and Mr. Justice Hall dissent on the ground that the appellant, having been approached by the victim\u2019s wife and commissioned by her to discover the names and addresses of the witnesses required for the successsful prosecution of the proposed litigation, his participation therein was neither officious nor unlawful, and the fact that he consented to allow the payment for his: services to await the outcome of the action does not amount to maintenance.\nBased upon that dissent Goodman now appeals.\nWhile a considerable part of the factum for the respondent deals with the submission that no question of law is involved, it also appears from the factum and we understood from counsel at bar that the contention really is that the appeal must be confined to the question as to whether the facts adduced in evidence by the Crown (and the inferences to be drawn therefrom) did amount to maintenance or champerty. Such a question is clearly one of law.\nThere is no dispute about the facts, which are few and which were testified to by witnesses on behalf of the Crown,\u2014the accused calling no evidence; and there is likewise no dispute about the inferences. It appears that one Lallemand was injured and incapacitated for a considerable period. He did not know the name of a single witness who could strengthen any claim he might make against the Montreal Tramways Company,\u2014the party he considered responsible for his injury. He consulted attorneys who, because of the lack of evidence, could not advise action. Some time later Lallemand\u2019s wife approached the appellant, who undertook to search for those who might have seen the accident. It was perfectly well known that Lallemand and his wife had no money to pay the appellant for his services and it was agreed that the amount and settlement of his remuneration should await the conclusion of the litigation. There was no bargain that he should receive a share of the proceeds.\nLallemand chose and retained an attorney, who commenced and continued an action against Montreal Tramways Company without any contribution from Lallemand or the appellant towards the expenses. In the meantime, however, the appellant had discovered certain witnesses whose testimony was made available to the attorney. The action was finally settled upon payment of six thousand dollars by the Tramways Company to the attorney. At Lallemand\u2019s direction, the expenses were paid out of this sum, including the amount at which the appellant\u2019s account was finally fixed.\nUnder these circumstances it is needless to refer to the various definitions of champerty since it is clear that the appellant did not carry on the litigation at his own expense nor did he bargain for a share of the proceeds. Champerty, although of greater atrocity, is an offence similar to that of maintenance and it is, therefore, necessary to determine what constitutes that crime.\nA convenient starting point for that investigation is the first edition of Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law, 1816, vol. 2, p. 234, where in a note to a precedent of an indictment for maintenance, the author, quoting Blackstone and Hawkins, states that,\u2014\nMaintenance signifies a malicious, or at least officious, interference in a pursuit in which the party has no interest to assist either with money or advice to prosecute or defend the action.\nBlackstone\u2019s statement had been based upon Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown, the first edition of which appeared about 1716. In the eighth edition the principle upon which the law against maintenance is based is thus stated (Vol. 1, cap. 27, s. 38):\u2014\nIt seemeth, that all maintenance is strictly prohibited by the common law, as having a manifest tendency to oppression, by encouraging and assisting persons to persist in suits, which perhaps they would not venture to go on in upon their own bottoms.\nShortly after the publication of the eighth edition of Hawkins appeared Chancellor Kent\u2019s Commentaries on American Law. Kent adopted Blackstone\u2019s definition (which, as we have seen, was founded upon Hawkins). At p. 447 of volume 4 of the 12th edition, it is stated that the statutes of Edward I and Edward III against champerty and maintenance\nwere founded upon a principle common to the laws of all well governed countries, that no encouragement should be given to litigation, by the introduction of parties to enforce those rights which others are not disposed to enforce.\nStory on Contract, the first edition of which appeared in 1844, is to the same effect:\u2014\nMaintenance is the officious assistance, by money or otherwise, proposed by a third person to either party to a suit in which he himself has no legal interest to enable him to prosecute or defend it.\nIn Prosser v. Edmonds[1], Lord Abinger puts the matter in exactly the same way as it appears in Kent where he states:\u2014\nAll our cases of maintenance and champerty are founded on the principle that no encouragement should be given to litigation by the introduction of parties to enforce those rights which others are not disposed to enforce.\nLord Abinger\u2019s statement is significant because of the classical expression used by him in the later case of Findon v. Parker[2]:\u2014\nThe law of maintenance as I understand it upon the modern constructions, is confined to cases where a man improperly and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife, encourages others either to bring actions or to make defences which they have no right to make. This well-known passage assumes even greater importance in connection with the present appeal. In Findon v. Parker[3] action was brought by a solicitor for his costs, the defence being that the work was done pursuant to an agreement and in circumstances amounting to maintenance. In order to understand precisely the particular relevancy of the words quoted it is necessary to reproduce the whole of Lord Abinger\u2019s judgment in so far as it is pertinent. He said:\u2014\nIf any ground can be fairly suggested for making this contract legal, we ought to adopt it in favour of the party who makes the defence, in order to acquit him of the imputation that he casts upon himself. The contract does not necessarily imply anything that the law calls maintenance. The law of maintenance, as I understand it upon the modern constructions, is confined to cases where a man improperly, and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife, encourages others either to bring actions, or to make defences which they have no right to make. I do not like to give an opinion upon an abstract case, and therefore am not desirous to consider it; but if a man were to see a poor person in the street oppressed and abused, and without the means of obtaining redress, and furnish him with money or employed an attorney to obtain redress for his wrongs, it would require a very strong argument to convince me that that man could be said to be stirring up litigation and strife, and to be guilty of the crime of maintenance; I am not prepared to say, that, in modern times, Courts of Justice ought to come to that conclusion. However, I give no opinion upon that point.\nFrom this it will be observed that Lord Abinger was discussing the crime of maintenance and while expressing no opinion, stated his view that one ingredient of the crime must be \u201ca stirring up\u201d of litigation and strife.\nIn Bradlaugh v. Newdegate[4], Lord Coleridge, while determining that the passage quoted above had no application to the case before him, stated that it was full of the strong sense characteristic of Lord Abinger and he was inclined to agree with and adopt every word of it. Lord Coleridge gives a number of definitions of maintenance, among which will be found those of Kent and Story:\u2014\nThere are many definitions of maintenance, all seeming to express the same idea. Blackstone calls it \u201can officious intermeddling in a suit which no way belongs to one by maintaining or assisting either party with money or otherwise to prosecute or defend it\u201d: B1. Comm. book iv, c. 10, s. 12. \u201cMaintenence,\u201d says Lord Coke, \u201csignifieth in law a taking in hand, bearing up, or upholding of a quarrel, or side, to the disturbance or hindrance of common right\u201d: Co. Litt. 368 b. These definitions are repeated in substance in Bacon\u2019s abridgement, in Viner, and in Comyns, under the head of maintenance. To the same effect, though somewhat differing in words, is the language of Lord Coke in the 2nd Institute in his commentary on the Statute of Westminster the First, c. xxviii. There is, perhaps, the fullest and completest of all to be found in Termes de la Ley, \u201cMaintenance is when any man gives or delivers to another that is plaintiff or defendant in any action any sum of money or other thing to maintain his plea, or takes great pains for him when he hath nothing therewith to do; then the party grieved shall have a writ against him called a writ of maintenance.\u201d Chancellor Kent, adopting Blackstone\u2019s definition, which definition itself is founded on a passage in Hawkins, says that it is \u201ca principle common to the laws of all well governed countries that no encouragement should be given to litigation by the introduction of parties to enforce those rights which others are not disposed to enforce\u201d: part vi, lect. 67. I quote from the excellent edition of Kent\u2019s Commentaries, published by Mr. O. W. Holmes at Boston in 1873. To the same effect is another American authority, Mr. Story. \u201cMaintenance is the officious assistance by money or otherwise, proferred by a third person to either party to a suit, in which he himself has no legal interest, to enable them to prosecute or defend it.\u201d\nIn 1894, the case of Alabaster v. Harness[5] was decided by Mr. Justice Hawkins. That; was an action for damages for the maintenance of an action for libel, which latter action it was considered by the Court had not really been brought by the plaintiff or at any rate had been brought at the instigation of Harness and upon a promise of sustenance with respect to the costs of the action. Hawkins, J., at p. 899, quotes the statement of the principle upon which the law against maintenance is based, which appeared in Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown and which has already been set out, and also quotes Lord Abinger\u2019s statement of the principle in Prosser v. Edmonds[6]. In the Court of Appeal[7], Lord Justice Lopes, at p. 344, expressed his entire agreement with the judgment of Mr. Justice Hawkins in the court below and repeated, with approval, Lord Abinger\u2019s definition in Prosser v. Edmonds6.\nIn British Cash and Parcel Conveyancors Limited v. Lamson Store Service Company Limited[8], Cozens Hardy, Master of the Rolls, after agreeing that there had been a time when what the defendants in that action did would have been regarded as criminal, stated there was little use in citing ancient text-books on the law of maintenance. \u201cThe law,\u201d (he continues) \u201chas been modified in accordance with modern ideas of propriety,\u201d and he then proceeds to quote the famous passage from Findon v. Parker13. At page 1020, Lord Justice Buckley quotes the definitions of Kent and Story mentioned above and also extracts from the judgments of Lord Abinger in Prosser v. Edmonds[9] and Findon v. Parker13.\nIn Scott v. The National System for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children[10], Mr. Justice Bray, in referring at page 791 to certain bastardy proceedings, considered the cases showed that it was immaterial what the result might be but that most careful judge expressed the grounds of his decision on the point in the following sentence: \u201cIt was the wanton intermeddling that was the cause of action.\u201d\nIn Oram v. Hutt10, Lord Sumner at p. 107, in declining to agree with the contention that the prosecutor\u2019s defeat in a maintained action would be a defence to an indictment for the misdemeanour of maintenance, states that it may be as much against public interest to stir up an action which lies indeed but which never would have been brought if the tort sufferer had been left to himself as to maintain an action that does not lie at all.\nFinally, the House of Lords considered the civil action for maintenance in several aspects in Neville v. London Express Newspaper Limited[11]. It was there held by Lord Finlay, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline and Lord Phillimore that an action for damages for maintenance will not lie in the absence of proof of special damage, Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson dissenting. It was held by Lord Finlay, Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson that the success of the maintained litigation, whether an action or a defence, is not a bar to the right of action for maintenance, Lord Shaw of Dunfermlin eand Lord Phillimore dissenting. Lord Abinger\u2019s statement in Findon v. Parker[12] was expressly referred to by only two of the peers. Lord Atkinson set it out with the object of ascertaining the meaning to be ascribed to the words \u201cthey have no right to make.\u201d In his Lordship\u2019s opinion they applied not to the persons maintained but to the persons who maintained these latter. After quoting Lord Abinger\u2019s statement at page 41914, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline concludes: \u201cIn my opinion that is still the law of England\u201d; although on the particular point with which he was then concerned, he was in disagreement with Lord Atkinson and in fact in the minority.\nIt is clear, however, from a perusal of all the speeches in that case that no doubt was cast upon the general proposition that to make a person liable as a maintainer, either civilly or criminally, he must have intervened officiously or improperly. Lord Finlay really puts the matter in that way by quoting the definition of maintenance in Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown. Viscount Haldane, at p. 39014, remarks:\u2014\nFor the broad rule remains unrepealed by any statute that it is unlawful for a stranger to render officious assistance by money or otherwise to another person in a suit in which that third person has himself no legal interest for its prosecution or defence.\nBefore quoting Lord Abinger\u2019s statement, Lord Atkinson had, at p. 39514, stated:\u2014\nIf, however, the essence of the action of maintenance be the officious intermeddling in or supporting litigation in which the meddler has no legitimate interest * * * as I think it is.\nLater (p. 397)14 he quotes the extract from Prosser v. Edmonds15 and also (p. 405)14 the extract from the Scott case16. There is really nothing inconsistent with this view in the speech of Lord Phillimore.\nThese references to the speeches in the House of Lords in the Neville case14 indicate that the views previously expressed by various writers of standing and by a number of very able judges have not been departed from and that there must exist that officious interference, that introduction of parties to enforce rights which others are not disposed to enforce, that stirring up of strife, to constitute the crime of maintenance. In the present case Lallemand was disposed to enforce his claim, and in fact had already consulted attorneys before his wife approached the appellant. The appellant did not intervene on his own initiative and took no action that nay be in any way described as stirring up strife and litigation.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nCANNON J. \u2013 I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nAppeal allowed and conviction quashed.\n[1] (1835) 1 Y & C 481 at 497.\n[2] (1843) 11 M & W 675, at 682.\n[3] (1843) 11 M & W 675 at 682.\n[4] (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 1.\n[5] (1894) 2 Q.B.D. 897.\n[6] (1835) 1 Y & C 481.\n[7] (1895) 1 Q.B.D. 339.\n6 (1835) 1 Y & C 481.\n[8] (1908) 1 K.B. 1006.\n13 (1843) 11 M & W 675.\n[9] (1914) 1 Ch. 98.\n13 (1843) 11 M & W 675.\n[10] [1909] 2 T.L.R. 789.\n10 (1914) 1 Ch. 98.\n[11] [1919] A.C. 368.\n[12] (1843) 11 M & W 675.\n14 [1919] A.C. 368.\n14 [1919] A.C. 368.\n14\n14 [1919] A.C. 368.\n15 (1855) 1 Y & C 481.\n14 [1919] A.C. 368.\n16 [19091 2 T.L.R. 789.\n14 [1919] A.C. 368.\n"}

Subsequently, a petition in revocation of judgment (requ\u00eate civile) was presented by the appellant company. The daughter attained her age of majority before the date for proof and hearing on the merits of the petition; but the suit continued without any petition en reprise d\u2019instance being presented, and judgment was rendered dismissing the requ\u00eate civile. While the case was pending before the appellate court, the daughter having been interdicted, the father then presented a petition to continue the suit as curator, which petition was granted by the appellate court; and no appeal was taken. There has been no notification of the change of status of the daughter as to her age. As a preliminary ground of appeal before this Court, the appellant urged that all proceedings, subsequent to the date on which the daughter attained her majority, were null.\nHeld, that under the circumstances of this case, the proocedings should not be declared null and void. The judgment of the appellate court, authorizing the father to continue the suit as curator, had the effect of covering any irregularity in anterior proceedings. Moreover, no notification has been given as to the change of status of the daughter, and all proceedings are held to be valid up to the date of such notice. And, even after such notification the nullity incurred would be merely relative, and could be invoked only by the person whose interests would not have been represented.\nAs to the merits of the requ\u00eate civile:\nHeld that the judgment of the appellate court, affirming the judgment of the trial judge and holding that the new evidence offered by the appellant was not sufficient to justify an order for a new trial, should be affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Casgrain J. and dismissing a petition in revocation of judgment by the appellant company.\nThe facts of the appeal and the questions in issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nArthur Vall\u00e9e K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. P. Charhonneau for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Cette cause est d\u00e9j\u00e0 venue devant cette Cour sur appel d\u2019un verdict du jury[1]. Elle se pr\u00e9sente maintenant sur une requ\u00eate civile qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e au m\u00e9rite par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nIl nous faut disposer d\u2019abord d\u2019un moyen pr\u00e9liminaire soulev\u00e9 par les appelants.\nAu moment de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, Pauline Gu\u00e9rard \u00e9tait mineure, et les proc\u00e9dures furent prises au nom de son tuteur. Elle est devenue majeure le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1937, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire avant l\u2019inscription \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la requ\u00eate civile. Personne ne semble y avoir pr\u00eat\u00e9 attention; et la cause continua sans reprise d\u2019instance.\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure en faveur de Mlle Gu\u00e9rard fut rendu dans ces conditions; et c\u2019est \u00e9galement dans ces conditions que ce jugement fut subs\u00e9quemment port\u00e9 en appel devant la Cour du Banc du Roi. Puis, alors que l\u2019instance \u00e9tait pendante en appel, surgit un nouvel incident: Pauline Gu\u00e9rard fut interdite et son p\u00e8re, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 son tuteur, lui fut nomm\u00e9 comme curateur.\nIl pr\u00e9senta alors une requ\u00eate pour qu\u2019il lui f\u00fbt permis de reprendre l\u2019instance en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur.\nCette requ\u00eate fut contest\u00e9e, mais la contestation fut rejet\u00e9e par la Cour et la reprise d\u2019instance fut autoris\u00e9e.\nIl n\u2019y eut pas d\u2019appel du jugement autorisant cette reprise d\u2019instance; et aucune des pi\u00e8ces qui s\u2019y rapportent ne fait partie du dossier conjoint, dont la composition a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9e de consentement.\nLes appelants veulent maintenant soutenir devant nous que toutes les proc\u00e9dures faites subs\u00e9quemment au 22 f\u00e9vrier 1937, date o\u00f9 Pauline Gu\u00e9rard a atteint sa majorit\u00e9, sont nulles, n\u2019ont aucune valeur, et que, de ce chef, l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu.\nDisons tout d\u2019abord qu\u2019il est clair que ce moyen ne saurait affecter la r\u00e9clamation personnelle de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Rosario Gu\u00e9rard; il ne pourrait l\u2019int\u00e9resser qu\u2019en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur \u00e0 sa fille Pauline.\nMais nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel qui nous est soumis ne donne pas ouverture \u00e0 ce moyen pr\u00e9liminaire.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a autoris\u00e9 le curateur \u00e0 reprendre l\u2019instance; et il nous para\u00eet que, au moins \u00e0 dater de ce jugement dont il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel, le cours de la proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gularis\u00e9. Nous ne voyons pas comment nous pourrions maintenant remonter au del\u00e0 de ce jugement qui a permis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 de continuer les derniers errements. Il est admis que toute cette question fut alors d\u00e9battue. En accordant la requ\u00eate en reprise d\u2019instance, la Cour s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur la situation qui nous est expos\u00e9e par les appelants. L\u2019effet n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019autorisation ainsi donn\u00e9e au curateur est qu\u2019il pouvait validement continuer la cause; et, comme cons\u00e9quence, que les proc\u00e9dures faites durant l\u2019intervalle entre la date de la majorit\u00e9 et celle de l\u2019interdiction devaient \u00eatre tenues pour valables.\nIl nous semble d\u2019ailleurs que les appelants ont \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 plus d\u2019une autre difficult\u00e9.\nLe Code de proc\u00e9dure civile (art. 268 et 269) \u00e9dicte que le procureur qui conna\u00eet le changement d\u2019\u00e9tat de sa partie est tenu de le signifier \u00e0 l\u2019autre. \u201cLes poursuites sont valables jusqu\u2019au jour de cette signification.\u201d C\u2019est seulement apr\u00e8s que la \u201cnotification\u201d a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e que, dans les affaires qui ne sont pas en \u00e9tat, les proc\u00e9dures sont nulles jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019instance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 reprise par les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s ou que ces derniers aient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s en cause.\nDans le cas actuel, il n\u2019y a eu aucune notification du changement d\u2019\u00e9tat de Pauline Gu\u00e9rard.\nM\u00eame apr\u00e8s notification, les commentateurs, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, enseignent qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une nullit\u00e9 purement relative, qui ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e que par celui dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Et la jurisprudence, en France, est \u00e0 cet effet.\nApr\u00e8s avoir atteint sa majorit\u00e9, Pauline Gu\u00e9rard jouissait pleinement de ses droits et de ses facult\u00e9s; et elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e capable de conduire son affaire. Nous ignorons \u00e0 quel moment son tuteur lui a rendu ses comptes, mais nous savons qu\u2019elle connaissait l\u2019existence de sa cause puisqu\u2019elle a rendu t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Elle a donn\u00e9 au moins son acquiescement tacite \u00e0 la continuation des proc\u00e9dures; et, comme le jugement lui a, \u00e9t\u00e9 favorable, il est impossible de voir quel pr\u00e9judice elle aurait pu subir.\nA fortiori, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les appelants ne sauraient r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00e0 leur avantage, tout ce qui s\u2019est fait dans la cause entre la majorit\u00e9 et l\u2019interdiction de Mlle Gu\u00e9rard.\nAu m\u00e9rite de la requ\u00eate civile, les appelants avaient la t\u00e2che difficile de convaincre la Cour que la nouvelle preuve qu\u2019ils invoquaient \u00e9tait telle que, si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en temps, le verdict du jury e\u00fbt probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent (art. 505 C.P.C.). Et il fallait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le code de proc\u00e9dure (art. 1177-parag. 8 C.P.C.), que cette preuve f\u00fbt concluante.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement d\u2019avis que la nouvelle preuve offerte par les appelants ne rencontrait pas les exigences du code de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 les justifier de remettre la cause devant un nouveau jury.\nNous ne trouvons rien dans le dossier qui nous permette d\u2019infirmer ces deux jugements concordants.\nIl faut, bien entendu, se borner \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la requ\u00eate civile. Cette enqu\u00eate ne d\u00e9voile pas de dol personnel de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9.

The examination was made by two medical officers on the 27th of July, 1931, who reported immediately to the city that the appellant was still fit to perform his duties. But the appellant was not informed, for months after that his application had been rejected. In the meantime he had been required by his superior officers to return his fireman\u2019s equipment and thenceforward was in every way treated as not in the city\u2019s employment. The by-law, upon which the appellant based his claim, contains in section 2 the cases where an employee would be entitled to a pension; and section 11 provides that it \u201cdevolve upon the Board of Commissioners (later called Executive Committee) to decide, in each case, whether any civic employee is eligible for superannuation and pension.\u201d The appellant brought his action only in February, 1936, and in his statements of claim, did not allege such a decision in his favour, nor did he allege facts precluding the respondent city from relying upon section eleven; but he contented himself with alleging that the pension to which he had acquired a right had been unjustly and illegally refused by the city respondent and that he had fulfilled all the conditions entitling him to it. The respondent city denied such allegations, set up the report of the doctors and alleged generally that the appellant had not brought himself within the conditions giving him a right to superannuation and pension. It also raised, at the trial, the ground that the Superior Court had no authority under article 50 C.C.P. to review the decision of the Executive Committee. The trial judge, holding that he had such authority under the provisions of that article, proceeded to make himself an independent examination of the facts touching the state of the appellant\u2019s health in July, 1931, and finally granted the appellant\u2019s claim for pension. The appellate court reversed that judgment on the grounds that the Executive Committee, in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it by section 11, had the right to find that the appellant was not eligible for pension, that the Court could not substitute its opinion for that of the Committee and that, on the evidence, the decision of the Committee could not be declared to be arbitrary, unjust and illegal.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the appellate court and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, but in both cases on different grounds, that the appellant\u2019s claim for a pension and other benefit provided by the by-law should be maintained.\nHeld, also, reversing the judgment of the trial judge as to that ground, that article 50 C.C.P. has not the application given to it by him. Such article is primarily concerned with jurisdiction; but such jurisdiction must be exercised \u201cin such manner and form as by law provided.\u201d Where parties have agreed, as in the present case, that their rights shall rest upon the condition that a given individual or body shall be satisfied that a certain state of facts exists, article 50 C.C.P. does not enable the Superior Court to make a new contract between the parties and to declare their rights without regard to the contract and by reference solely to the trial court\u2019s own view of the facts. In this case a decision by the Committee favourable or unfavourable to an applicant is not susceptible of review upon the merits by any court.\nHeld, also, reversing the judgment of the appellate court that the city respondent should not be permitted to set up the decision of its Executive Committee in answer to the appellant\u2019s claim. The appellant, not having been informed of the nature of the report of the doctors until long after the decision of the Executive Committee, was given no opportunity of answering that report, before the Executive Committee had reached its decision; and, in these circumstances, it should be held that no inquiry of the character contemplated by section 11 of the by-law had taken place. Moreover, in the existing circumstances of the case, section 11 of the by-law would not afford, at the present time, appropriate machinery for working out the rights of the parties, mainly on the ground that evidence, to which the Committee might have resorted eight years ago, would probably be no longer available.\nHeld, further, that the finding of the trial judge, that the appellant had established the facts necessary to entitle him to superannuation and pension, under the by-law, should not be set aside.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, L. Cousineau J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe appellant obtained judgment in the Superior Court against the city respondent, condemning it to pay him an annual pension equivalent to a fifth of his annual salary at the time of his resignation as a member of the fire brigade of that city, namely, $416, to pay him the arrears accruing up to the date of the action with interest amounting to $2,085.20 and ordering the city to deliver him a paid-up certificate or policy of $1,000, entitling his heirs to payment of that amount upon his death.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nGustave Monette K.C. for appellant.\nClaude Choquette for respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The appellant\u2019s claim is based upon the enactments of by-law 506 amended by by-law 625 and section 38, cap. 112 of statutes of 1921. In so far as pertinent they are these: 2. When a permanent employee of the city shall become unable to perform his duties by reason of a chronic or incurable disease or of permanent infirmity contracted as a result or on account of the discharge of his municipal duties, he shall be superannuated and he shall then be entitled during his lifetime to an annual pension equal to one-fifth of the annual salary he was receiving at the time of his superannuation, if he has been in the city\u2019s employ for less than 10 years. If he has been in the city\u2019s employ for 10 years or more, he shall be entitled to the pension provided for in section 1 of this by-law.\n11. It shall devolve upon the Board of Commissioners to decide, in each case, whether any civic employee is eligible for superannuation and pension.\nBy the statute of 1921 the Executive Committee succeeded to the functions of the Commissioners.\nI agree with the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that primarily the appellant\u2019s right to superannuation and a pension must rest upon the decision of the Board of Commissioners under section 11. I think it is reasonable to treat the provisions of sections 2 and 11 as terms of the engagements between the respondent corporation and its employees so long as the by-law is in force. It was entirely within the powers of the corporation to require as one of those terms that the right to superannuation and pension should not arise until there had been a decision under section 11 and that, I think, is the proper interpretation of the by-law.\nOn the other hand, it was the duty of the Executive Committee upon application by the appellant for superannuation on the ground of ill health to entertain his application and, after due consideration, to decide whether eligibility was established.\nWith great respect for the dissenting judges in the Court of King\u2019s Bench I do not think a decision by the Committee favourable or unfavourable to an applicant in the execution of their duties, after a proper consideration of the applicant\u2019s claim, is susceptible of review upon the merits by any court. The right of the retired officer is a right resting upon the by-law and the by-law accords him a pension when and only when he has received a favourable decision from the Executive Committee.\nThat, however, does not necessarily conclude the matter. If the Executive Committee refuses to entertain the application, or if they give a decision without having afforded the applicant a fair opportunity of supporting his claim, then, since the Corporation is responsible for the acts of its administrative organ, it may by the fault of that body be precluded from setting up this condition and the court may be in a position to enter upon an examination of the merits of the claim.\nThe evidence in the present case is rather meagre. The appellant presented to the Chief of the Fire Brigade on the 23rd of July, 1931, his resignation on grounds of ill health and requested a medical examination. The examination having been made by the two medical officers of the Fire Brigade, Dr. Lafleur and Dr. Morrison, they reported that the appellant was still fit to perform his duties as fireman.\nAt the trial the appellant said that it was not until some time in the year 1932 that he received a communication by letter from the President of the Executive Committee advising him that his application had been refused on the report of the medical officers that he was still fit for service. It was not until February, 1936, that proceedings were taken.\nThe appellant did not in his declaration state facts constituting a right of action against the Corporation. He did not allege a decision by the Executive Committee in his favour, nor did he allege facts precluding the defendant Corporation from relying upon section 11 of the by-law. He contented himself with alleging that the pension to which he had acquired the right had been unjustly and illegally refused by the defendant corporation; and that he had fulfilled all the conditions entitling him to it.\nThe facts upon which in his declaration he bases his claim are that at the date of his application he was, by reason of various ailments contracted in the performance of his duties, incapable of performing them.\nThe defendant corporation denied the allegations of the declaration and set up the report of the doctors and alleged generally that the plaintiff had not brought himself within the conditions giving him a right to superannuation and pension.\nExcept for this general allegation in the defence and the general allegation in the declaration mentioned above, the pleadings contain no reference to the conditions embodied in section 11 of the by-law or to the proceedings of the Executive Committee. I have no doubt that the declaration was demurrable since a decision by the Committee favourable to him (or facts precluding the defendant Corporation from relying upon the condition embodied in section 11) was one of the constitutive elements of his cause of action.\nIt is clear, however, that at the trial both parties departed from the pleadings. The appellant in examination in chief gave evidence which, with that of the medical officers and the Chief of the Fire Department, made it quite clear that all parties understood that the appellant was applying for superannuation and a pension under the by-law, and an examination and report by the medical officers on the state of his health. He said that in 1932, the year following his application, he received, after repeated enquiries on the subject, a letter from the chairman of the Committee notifying him that his application had been rejected because the medical officers had reported him fit for duty.\nOn this evidence counsel for the defendant corporation based an argument at the trial (as appears by the judgment of the trial judge) that the action should be dismissed because the Superior Court had no authority to review the decision of the Executive Committee.\nThe learned trial judge rejected this contention, but the Court of King\u2019s Bench gave effect to it and on that ground allowed the appeal and dismissed the action.\nIt is convenient here to transcribe the relative consid\u00e9rants in both judgments. The trial judge says:\nLe troisi\u00e8me point soulev\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fense, toujours \u00e0 l\u2019argument seulement, est le d\u00e9faut d\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour reviser une d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 Ex\u00e9cutif.\nConsid\u00e9rant que l\u2019article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile donne \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure cette autorit\u00e9, surtout dans une cause comme celle-ci, o\u00f9 il nous est d\u00e9montr\u00e9, par toute la preuve entendue, qu\u2019il y a eu abus de pouvoir, soit volontairement, soit involontairement par ignorance des faits, et qu\u2019une injustice grave a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise.\nCar consid\u00e9rant que le fait pour deux m\u00e9decins! de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, qui connaissaient les maladies du demandeur depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, de n\u2019avoir pas examin\u00e9 le demandeur minutieusement, et pour ces diff\u00e9rentes maladies surtout, constitue \u201ca palpable and manifest wrong\u201d, et que le fait, pour la cit\u00e9, d\u2019avoir accept\u00e9 la r\u00e9signation du demandeur pour cause de sant\u00e9, car elle ne pouvait l\u2019accepter qu\u2019avec les raisons donn\u00e9es, et de lui avoir subs\u00e9quemment refus\u00e9 sa pension, constitute un abus de pouvoir.\nD\u2019ailleurs la d\u00e9fenderesse, par ses actions ou par celles de ses employ\u00e9s, a acquiesc\u00e9 dans l\u2019acceptation, d\u2019abord en requ\u00e9rant le demandeur de remettre aux quartiers chefs, ses uniformes et ses bottes, qu\u2019il en avait re\u00e7us, et en ne l\u2019avisant pas que sa r\u00e9signation n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e. Si, en effet, la cit\u00e9 avait refus\u00e9 la r\u00e9signation du demandeur, elle aurait d\u00fb l\u2019en avertir pour qu\u2019il puisse, soit reprendre son travail ou donner sa r\u00e9signation pour d\u2019autres causes. Elle n\u2019a rien fait;\nConsid\u00e9rant donc que le demandeur a \u00e9tabli, hors de toute doute, qu\u2019il souffre depuis au moins 1928, de rhumatisme, de lumbago, de troubles de gorge et d\u2019oreilles, et de fistules, et qu\u2019il est dans les conditions requises par le r\u00e8glement, et partant \u201cincapable de remplir ses fonctions \u00e0 raison de maladies chronique ou incurable\u201d, maladies qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par le fait ou \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions.\nIn the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench the following appears:\nConsidering that by the terms of the by-laws in force at the time when the respondent tendered his resignation\u2014which was accepted subject to medical report\u2014it devolved upon the Executive Committee of the city of Montreal to determine whether the respondent was eligible or not for the said pension;\nConsidering that the respondent, by his action as brought, does not pretend that the said Executive Committee failed to exercise the discretion so conferred upon it, but on the contrary the respondent expressly alleges that the Executive Committee unjustly and illegally rejected his claim;\nConsidering that, in accordance with the requirements of the by-laws relating to the matter, the respondent was examined by the medical officers of the fire brigade shortly after the date of his resignation and found to be still fit for service;\nConsidering that in virtue of the said by-laws governing such pension, a claim only arises in the event of the employee claiming it becoming unfit for further service, and the decision thereon is vested in the Executive Committee;\nConsidering that there was ground upon which the Executive Committee, in the exercise of the discretion so conferred upon it (while not bound to do so under the then existing by-laws), could, however, find that the respondent was not eligible for such pension as not coming within the terms of the by-law; and this court cannot substitute any opinion that it might form for that of the said Executive Committee, nor, in the light of the evidence, can it declare the decision of the said Executive Committee to be arbitrary, unjust and illegal (Harvey v. Montreal[1]; Montreal v. Diamond[2]).\nConsidering that there is error in the judgment of the Superior Court in granting the said pension;\nConsidering, further, that as to the insurance policy claimed by the respondent, while he is entitled to the same under the provisions of the resolution of the city council dated the eighteenth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five (1875), he is not entitled, in the alternative, to the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) in cash, and that there is error in the judgment of the Superior Court in this respect.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge shews plainly enough, I think, that he misdirected himself. He was under the impression that his duty was to enter upon an independent examination of the facts touching the state of the appellant\u2019s health in July, 1931, and that, having concluded he was in the state of health contemplated by section 2 of the by-law (that is to say, unfit to discharge his duties) he was entitled to disregard any decision of the Executive Committee under section 11 or the absence of any such decision. He finds there was an abuse of power \u201csoit volontairement ou involontairement par ignorance des faits et qu\u2019une injustice grave a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise\u201d. But this finding is based solely upon his conclusion respecting issues of fact which, by the terms of the by-law, the Executive Committee is to pass upon. He does not put his conclusion upon any illegality in the proceedings of the Committee or any refusal to consider the application or any want of judicial temper or any partiality in the conduct of the inquiry, although he does find unfairness and injustice in the conduct of the doctors.\nArticle 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure is primarily concerned with jurisdiction; the jurisdiction, however, is by the express words of the article to be exercised \u201cin such manner and form as by law provided.\u201d Where parties have agreed that their rights shall rest upon the condition that a given individual or body shall be satisfied that a certain state of facts exists, article 50 does not enable the Superior Court to make a new contract between the parties and to declare their rights without regard to the contract and by reference solely to the court\u2019s own view of the facts. I am satisfied that the judgment of the trial judge cannot be sustained, therefore, on the grounds on which he bases it.\nOn the other hand, after some hesitation, I have come to the conclusion that the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench cannot be maintained.\nThe respondent corporation having at the trial taken its stand upon the decision of the Executive Committee (disclosed in the evidence of the appellant) and the Court of King\u2019s Bench having treated it, as Mr. Justice Bond says, \u201cas established\u201d against the appellant\nthat the Executive Committee did in fact act in the matter and rejected his claim basing themselves upon the medical report received from the medical officers of the brigade, to the effect that the respondent at the time of his resignation was still fit for service,\nI think we must consider whether, on the evidence on which the Court of King\u2019s Bench proceeded, the decision of the Executive Committee can be accepted as final. The evidence bearing on this point is chiefly that of the appellant. And, as appears from the judgment of Bond J. it is upon this evidence that the Court of King\u2019s Bench acted. The statement in the formal judgment of the Court in the second paragraph quoted above must be founded on the appellant\u2019s evidence since the appellant in his declaration makes no reference to the action of the Executive Committee, but only to the \u201cillegal and unjust\u201d refusal of his pension by the defendant Corporation.\nFrom the evidence of the appellant we are entitled to conclude (he was not contradicted or cross-examined on these points) that, after the medical examination (July 27th), he was not informed for months that his application had been rejected or that the doctors had found him fit for duty, although they appear to have reported immediately. In the meantime he was required by his superior officers to return his fireman\u2019s equipment and thenceforward he was in every way treated as not in the Corporation\u2019s employment.\nIt is clear, as already observed, that everybody understood he was applying for superannuation under the by-law on the ground of incapacity by reason of ill health and the officials of the Corporation must have realized, if they gave the matter the slightest attention, that it was their duty at once to inform him that his application for superannuation had been rejected. In giving effect to the application as a simple resignation and keeping him in ignorance of the report of the doctors that he was fit for duty and of the decision of the Executive Committee, they were either deceiving him deliberately or acting with gross inattention to their plain duty.\nOne thing is plain: the appellant not having been informed of the nature of the report of the doctors was given no opportunity of answering that report before the Executive Committee had reached their decision.\nIt is obvious, of course, that in these circumstances there was no inquiry of the character contemplated by section 11. The duty of an administrative body charged with an inquiry into facts the results of which is to affect the civil rights of parties has been stated many times. It will be sufficient to refer to the language of Lord Loreburn in Board of Education v. Rice[3]:\nI need not add that * * * they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides. * * * They can obtain information in any way they think best always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties to the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view.\nThese words seem to be apt for the present purpose. The Court of King\u2019s Bench has overlooked the significance of the fact, not as I understand it disputed, that the appellant had no knowledge of the report of the medical officers until long after the decision of the Committee had been given and no opportunity to answer it. I repeat, in these circumstances, the respondent Corporation cannot be permitted to set up that decision in answer to the appellant\u2019s claim.\nIs the Corporation also precluded from relying on the condition embodied in section 11 itself?\nSection 11 contemplates an examination by the Committee of the facts touching the state of the applicant\u2019s health at the time of the application for the purpose of determining whether or not the applicant is in such a state of health as to be unable to perform his duties. If the inquiry results in a negative answer, then, in the ordinary course, the employee will not be superannuated but will continue to exercise his functions. As pointed out above the appellant by reason of the manner in which his application was dealt with was, in effect, dismissed from his employment although, according to the medical report and the decision of the Executive, he was not unfit to perform his duties. He was forced to commence an action to establish his status.\nSection 11 in the existing circumstances affords no appropriate machinery for working out the rights of the parties. It does not appear that the Committee has any power to examine witnesses upon oath; and evidence to which the Committee might have resorted eight years ago would, probably, be no longer available.\nSection 11, having in this particular case and chiefly by reason of the conduct of the defendant Corporation, and its officials and its administrative body, the Executive Committee, become abortive, the case appears to be one for the application of the principle of Cameron. v. Cuddy [4] as stated by Lord Shaw at page 656. The rule is a practical one for effectuating justice where the machinery set up by the instrument defining the rights of the parties has become inoperative. The rule is well within the spirit of article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the law of Quebec is not less efficacious for meting out justice in such a case than the law of England or Scotland.\nThere still remains the issue raised by the contention of the Corporation that the plaintiff has failed to establish the facts necessary to entitle him to superannuation under section 2 of the by-law. I think there was some evidence as to the fistula, and I am not prepared to say that the finding on that point should be set aside. Then, the learned trial judge had before him the appellant, of whose credibility he appears to have had no doubt, and whose credibility, indeed, does not appear to have been seriously impugned; and he was in a specially advantageous position to weigh the value of the appellant\u2019s statements with regard to his ailments and symptoms, and on the whole I should not feel justified in reversing his finding that the conditions of section 2 of the by-law obtained at the relevant time.\nIn the result, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. In view of all the circumstances the appellant should have his costs throughout.\nCannon J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Campbell, Kerry & Bruneau.\nSolicitors for respondent: St.-Pierre, Parent, Damphousse, Menard & Choquette.\n[1] (1934) Q.R. 72 S.C. 12.\n[2] (1934) Q.R. 57 K.B. 430.\n[3] [1911] A.C. 179 at 182.\n[4] [1914] A.C. 651.\n"}

The action was maintained for $25, the trial judge holding that the respondent\u2019s premises came within the definition of a \u201crestaurant\u201d and that owners of hotels and restaurants have no right to discriminate between their guests. This judgment was reversed by the appellate court (Q.R. 65 K.B. 104) which held that a tavern was not subject to the laws governing hotels and restaurants and that, as a general rule, a merchant or trader was free to carry on his business in the manner that he conceives to be the best for that business. The appellant moved before the court for special leave to appeal.\nHeld that special leave to appeal should be granted. The matter in controversy in the appeal will involve \u201cmatters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected\u201d within the meaning of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act. Further, the matter in controversy is of such general importance that leave to appeal ought to be granted.\nMOTION for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, P. Demers J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows: About half past eight in the evening of July 11th, 1936, the appellant, who is a negro, accompanied by two friends one of whom was also a negro, entered the tavern operated by the respondent and seated themselves at a table to which they summoned a waiter. The appellant placed fifty cents on the table and ordered three steins of beer, but was informed by the waiter that he was unable to serve them. The appellant asked the reason for such refusal and was informed by the assistant manager of the respondent company that, according to the regulations of the establishment, it was forbidden to serve coloured people. The respondent and his friends left the place. By his action, the appellent claimed $200 as damages for pain and suffering and humiliation caused to him in the presence of a number of people present in the tavern.\nLovell C. Carroll for motion.\nHazen Hansard contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014We think that the matter in controversy in this appeal will involve \u201cmatters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected\u201d within the meaning of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nWe also think the matter in controversy is of such general importance that leave to appeal ought to be granted.\nSpecial leave to appeal is, therefore, granted; the costs of the application will be costs in the appeal.\nLeave to appeal granted.\n[1] (1938) Q.R. 65 K.B. 104.\n"}

The trial judge found that there was a verbal contract made (to the effect claimed) based upon, but varying in some respects, certain written documents; that s. 17 of the Statute of Frauds did not apply, as pursuant to the contract there were accepted and actually received three carloads of wine as part of the 50,000 gallons; that s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not a bar to the action, as, though the parties expected that all deliveries would not be made within one year, yet, as the purchaser (plaintiff) might, if it saw fit, accelerate deliveries, there was a contract which was not incapable of being performed within a year. As to damages, he held that s. 56 (3) of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 250, had no application, as there was no available market where plaintiff could have procured wine to fill the contract; that s. 56 (2) contained the rule to be applied, namely, that the measure of damages was the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the sellers' breach of contract; that plaintiff was entitled to recover the profits which it might have been expected to make on the sale of the wine which defendants did not deliver; on which basis, and accepting as a guide a certain estimate as to profits given in evidence, but also considering elements involved and making allowances, he fixed damages. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversed his judgment, holding that the documents and other evidence did not establish or support a contract such as that claimed. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld: On the documents and other evidence (and in view of the trial judge's findings on issues of fact involving questions of credibility) there was a contract established for sale of 50,000 gallons of wine as claimed. S. 17 of the Statute of Frauds had no application, there having been acceptance and actual receipt by plaintiff of goods under the contract. S. 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not a bar to the action, for the reasons (supra) given by the trial judge. His judgment on the question of damages (supra) for breach was not impeachable on the ground that he erred in the principle he applied or in the manner of his application of it to the particular facts. (As to the canon applicable by an appellate court as to assessment of damages made at trial, McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada, [1913] A.C. 299, at 309, cited).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which reversed the judgment of McDonald J. in favour of the plaintiffs. The action was for damages for breach of an alleged contract to sell wine to plaintiffs.\nThe defendants were a partnership who operated a loganberry winery in British Columbia. The plaintiff Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. was a company incorporated in Saskatchewan on May 29, 1936. The plaintiff Eakins Products Ltd. was a company incorporated in British Columbia on June 17, 1931, and was controlled by H. G. Eakins.\nEakins proposed to incorporate a company in Saskatchewan (later incorporated as Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. aforesaid) to sell loganberry wine to the Liquor Control Board of Saskatchewan.\nOn April 22, 1936, the following agreement was made:\nVanc'r. Apr. 22\/36.\nRichmond Wineries\nSteveston, B.C.\nGentlemen\nWe herewith confirm our arrangement with you whereby we are to purchase up to 50,000 gallons of your Loganberry wine, naked, Sales tax, gallonage Tax extra with cooperage at our cost: Wine to be a minimum of two years, strength 28 degrees proof, at 55c. per Imperial gallon, payment to be made within thirty days of each shipment. Firm orders or shipping instructions are to be in your hands by July 1st, 1936. Sale to be f.o.b. your winery in Richmond District.\nYours truly,\nEakins Products Ltd.\nAccepted\nH. G. Eakins.\nRichmond Wineries\nPer W. R. Simpson.\nSubsequently the plaintiff Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. was incorporated on May 29, 1936. Subsequently the following letter was written (and acceptance stated thereon) :\nSte. 5, 410 Seymour St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe Richmond Wineries,\nJune 19th, 1936.\nSteveston, B.C.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nRe:\u2014Richmond Wineries Western Limited.\nWe beg to advise you that we have arranged to assign the contract dated the 22nd of April 1936 between ourselves and yourselves with respect to the purchase of 50,000 gallons of your loganberry wine to the Richmond Wineries Western Limited of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Will you please acknowledge receipt of this letter.\nYours truly,\nEakins Products Limited\nPer: \"H. G. Eakins.\"\nNotice of Assignment Accepted:\nRichmond Wineries\nPer \"W. R. Simpson\"\nOn June 29, 1936, Eakins Products Ltd. assigned the agreement of April 22, 1936, to Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. No notice of this assignment was given to defendants, but the assignment was in accordance with the original intention and understanding of all parties and Simpson testified that after said letter of June 19, 1936, he dealt with Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. on the assumption that the agreement had been assigned to that company.\nIt was alleged that a certain telegram of June 30, 1936 (a copy of which was tendered at the trial but excluded) and confirming letter of July 2, 1936, were sent by Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. to the defendant Simpson. Simpson denied receiving these. There was admitted in evidence a certain telegram of June 30, 1936, from Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. to S. H. Gilmour, solicitor for said company, which Gilmour stated was read by him to Simpson over the telephone on June 30, 1936, as follows:\nRegister Company Victoria Stop have wired Simpson shipping instructions one car July 12th Balance contract three thousand gallons monthly till further notice stop assure yourself this notification received as vital part of contract.\nAbout July 10, 1936, Simpson went to Prince Albert, and there were conferences there. According to Eakins, it was verbally agreed that defendants were to supply blended wine instead of the quality originally specified and that the terms of payment be altered. It was also alleged that a further agreement was made as follows: It was expected that the 50,000 gallons referred to in the April agreement (aforesaid) would supply the anticipated requirements of Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. for two years and Simpson agreed to supply it with 25,000 gallons a year for a three-year period to commence in 1938; in order to assist Simpson to finance his berry purchases to meet this added demand, Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. advanced him $5,000 against future deliveries of the wine under the additional three-year contract. Plaintiffs abandoned at the trial the enforcement of any claim arising out of this alleged additional contract.\nDefendants shipped a carload of wine on July 17, 1936. In August, 1936, another carload was ordered and sent; this was paid for at the rate of 60 cents a gallon, following a letter from defendants of August 20, 1936, claiming an additional 5 cents a gallon because of the extra cost of the blended wine. In October, 1936, a further carload was ordered and delivered. On November 18, 1936, defendants sold their loganberry wine business to Growers' Wine Company Ltd. (made a Third Party in this action). A further order for shipment of wine not being complied with, the present action was brought for damages for breach of contract.\nThe facts of the case are more fully stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice of this Court, now reported.\nThe trial judge took the view that the document of April 22, 1936, constituted an offer by defendants to sell a quantity of wine not to exceed 50,000 gallons; that offer was open for acceptance until July 1, 1936; the communication through Gilmour of June 30, 1936, purporting to accept that offer, not being in the terms of the offer in that it contained the words \"till further notice,\" did not serve to constitute a completed contract. But he found that there was a contract concluded at Prince Albert during Simpson's visit there, by which contract the plaintiff Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. was to buy and defendants were to sell 50,000 gallons of blended wine at 60 cents a gallon, and save as to this the contract was to buy and sell in accordance with the contents of said document of April 22, 1936, and the said telegram of June 30, 1936, read by Gilmour to Simpson. He held that, as pursuant to that contract Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. accepted and actually received three carloads of wine as a part of the 50,000 gallons, s. 17 of the Statute of Frauds did not apply; also that s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds was not a bar to the action on the facts with regard to the contract as he had found them; although the parties did expect that all deliveries would not be made within one year, nevertheless, in view of the fact that Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. might, if it saw fit, accelerate deliveries, there was a contract which was not incapable of being performed within a year (citing Quance v. Brown[1]). As to damages (the difficulties in estimating which he emphasized) he held that s. 56 (3) of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 250, had no application, as there was no available market where plaintiff could have procured wine to fill the contract; that the rule to be applied was contained in s. 56 (2) of that Act; that the measure of damages was the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the sellers' breach of contract; that plaintiffs were entitled to recover the profits which the court considered they might have been expected to make on the sale of the 41,360 gallons which defendants failed to deliver. On the evidence, including evidence as to estimate of profits, and considering elements involved and allowing for possible losses in business, he estimated the net profit at 65 cents per gallon and fixed the damages on this basis at $26,884. (The defendants' claim against the third party for indemnity was left to be proceeded with).\nThe Court of Appeal held that the agreement of April 22, 1936, as varied in Prince Albert, was in essence an option agreement, and until an order or orders were given the buyer remained free from obligation (and there being no mutuality of obligation, there was no contract); that the telephonic order given by Gilmour to Simpson on June 30, 1936, could not be construed as an order for the entire 50,000 gallons or as constituting a binding contract for delivery of more than one carload of wine; that the orders in August and October were likewise separate orders creating separate contracts which were duly executed by delivery; that whether these orders be regarded as given and accepted under an extension of the agreement of April 22, 1936, or it be considered that the option expired on June 30 for failure of the buyer to comply with its terms, and each subsequent order be looked upon as an offer by Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. incorporating, by reference, the terms of the expired option and accepted by Simpson on that basis, was of no moment because the result was the same; these transactions were completed and closed and the orders for limited and specified quantities of wine could not be regarded as firm orders for the entire 50,000 gallons; that the failure to deliver wine pursuant to the order of February 1, 1937 (the order given by Richmond Wineries Western Ltd. after the sale by defendants to Growers' Wine Co. Ltd.) did not amount to a breach of contract; in the first place, there was not a binding contract for the delivery of the wine until the order was accepted and in this instance it was not accepted; on the other hand, if the option agreement, as extended by the forbearance of Simpson to insist upon its exact terms, be considered as binding defendants to deliver upon orders to be given from time to time until 50,000 gallons had been delivered, there was nothing in the agreement of April, 1936, compelling defendants to remain in business, and on the facts of this case the court could not imply any such stipulation in the said agreement; defendants were, therefore, on February 1, 1937, precluded by the sale of their business from making any further deliveries; that there was nothing in the evidence to support the finding that a contract was concluded at the said conferences at Prince Albert as found by the trial judge. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nJ. W. deB. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nMartin Griffin K.C. and C. H. Locke K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal turns (in respect of one of the two grounds upon which I base my decision) upon one or two fundamental questions of fact in respect of which the evidence is partly documentary, partly oral. The learned trial judge has found these issues of fact (involving as they do questions of credibility) in favour of the appellants. The Court of Appeal appears to have thought that there was no evidence to support these findings. I am not in agreement with the view of the Court of Appeal. It is necessary, therefore, to review the facts and refer to the evidence in some detail.\nIn the spring of 1936, the respondents W. R. Simpson and John A. McKinney, under the trade name of the Richmond Wineries, were the owners of a loganberry winery in British Columbia and had on hand a large quantity of matured loganberry wine. H. G. Eakins owned and controlled a personal company, the Eakins Products Limited. Eakins was, until July, 1936, a considerable shareholder in the Growers' Wine Company and had endeavoured to induce that company to enter the business of manufacturing loganberry wine in Saskatchewan but without success. He then decided to form a company for that purpose, but first of all, since it takes considerable time to mature loganberry wine, it was necessary to secure a supply of matured wine in order to provide a stock in trade while engaged for the first year or two in establishing his business; and for this reason he arranged to purchase wine from Simpson. The following memorandum was signed:\nVancouver, Apr. 22\/36\nRichmond Wineries\nSteveston, B.C.\nGentlemen\nWe herewith confirm our arrangement with you whereby we are to purchase up to 50,000 gallons of your Loganberry wine, naked, Sales tax, gallonage Tax extra with cooperage at our cost: Wine to be a minimum of two years, strength 28 degrees proof, at 55c per Imperial gallon, payment to be made within thirty days of each shipment. Firm orders or shipping instructions are to be in your hands by July 1st, 1936. Sale to be f.o.b. your winery in Richmond District.\nYours truly,\nEakins Products Ltd.\nH. G. Eakins.\nAccepted\nRichmond Wineries\nPer W. R. Simpson\nSimpson was well aware of Eakins' plan and that his intention was to transfer the agreement of the 22nd of April to the new Company. In May, Simpson wrote to Eakins saying he had no objection to the use of the name Richmond Wineries of Saskatchewan for the new company and offered to act as a director if desired. The Richmond Wineries Western, Ltd., was incorporated on the 29th of May in Saskatchewan and, on the same day, licensed to carry on business for the year ending the 31st of December, 1936. It was registered as an extra-provincial company in British Columbia on the 14th of July, 1936. On the 19th of June the Eakins Products Limited wrote to the Richmond Wineries the following letter:\nSte. 5, 410 Seymour St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nThe Richmond Wineries,\nJune 19th, 1936.\nSteveston, B.C.\nDear Sirs:\nRe: Richmond Wineries Western Limited\nWe beg to advise you that we have arranged to assign the contract dated the 22nd of April 1936 between ourselves and yourselves with respect to the purchase of 50,000 gallons of your loganberry wine to the Richmond Wineries Western Limited of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Will you please acknowledge receipt of this letter.\nYours truly,\nEakins Products Limited\nNotice of Assignment Accepted:\nPer: \"H. G. Eakins.\"\nRichmond Wineries\nPer \"W. R. Simpson.\"\nOn the 29th of June, 1936, a formal assignment of the contract of the 22nd of April, 1936, to the Richmond Wineries Western, Ltd., of Prince Albert, was executed by the Eakins Products Limited, in consideration of an agreement on the part of the Company to issue to Eakins 6,000 fully paid up shares of the new company. On the 30th of June, the solicitor for the company, S. H. Gilmour of Vancouver, received from the Richmond Wineries Western, Ltd., at Prince Albert, the following telegram:\nRegister Company Victoria Stop Have wired Simpson shipping instructions one car July 12th Balance contract three thousand gallons monthly till further notice Stop Assure yourself this notification received as vital part of contract.\nAnd on the same day Mr. Gilmour, acting on behalf of the Company, communicated the contents of the telegram to Simpson, reading the document to him. On the 2nd of July, 1936, Richmond Wineries Western, Ltd., sent to the Richmond Wineries at Steveston a letter confirming a telegram to Simpson of the 30th of June in the following words:\nJuly 2, 1936.\nRichmond Wineries\nSteveston, B.C.\nAttention of Mr. W. R. Simpson\nDear Mr. Simpson:\nWe are confirming herewith our telegram to you of June 30th:\n\"Ship one carload wine per contract on or about July 12th consigned to Liquor Commission Prince Albert notify Richmond Wineries Western Limited stop We prefer the blended type stop Ship balance contract at rate of three thousand gallons monthly till further notice stop Are you coming out. Answer.\"\nI had been expected to hear from you that you were on your way here as I particularly wanted you to meet the crowd down here and so much more can be done on the spot. Please let me know if you can possibly come out before Logan season starts.\nWe are enclosing herewith waiver for you to sign and return as a Director. You were issued one share to qualify as a Director at the preliminary meeting which will be forwarded to you by the next mail or as soon as signed by the President, Mr. Sanderson. Furthermore, we believe, Mr. Eakins has transferred to you One Thousand Dollars paid up stock which will also go through concurrently.\nAll formalities in connection with the launching of the new company were implemented this week and legal registration is now being effected in Victoria, the stocks are allotted and the funds transferred and we are ready for business. Hence our telegram to you.\nWe do hope to do a rousing business in time and are naturally concerned as to the first shipment. In as much as the public here apparently prefer the blended to the straight Logan, I think we had better start off with this character of wine and leave that end of it to you.\nPlease wire or write anything any time.\nYours truly,\nRichmond Wineries Western Ltd.\nThe learned trial judge thought (and herein the Court of Appeal agreed with him) that the document of the 22nd of April was an offer which was to be accepted not later than the 1st of July and held that the communication made by Gilmour on the 30th of June was not an acceptance of this offer, not conforming, as he thought, to the terms of the offer.\nHereafter, I shall refer to the appellants as the Wineries Western and Eakins respectively, and to the respondents as the respondents.\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether the document of the 22nd of April, signed by both parties, could properly be considered as merely an offer by the respondent to Eakins. In form it is an agreement by which Eakins and the respondents agree that the former shall buy and the latter shall sell the respondents' loganberry wine \"naked\" up to 50,000 gallons on the terms stated; but the quantity is to be determined by firm order or shipping instructions given by Eakins by the 1st of July. A firm order or shipping instructions given pursuant to this term of the agreement will give rise to a binding contract to buy and sell the quantity thereby named. I shall deal later with the position of the Wineries Western.\nThe next point is the effect of the communication made by Mr. Gilmour to Simpson. Simpson denies that he received this communication. He begins by taking refuge in a mere non mi ricordo but adds that the matter was so important that he would have remembered the communication if he had received it; but he implicitly denies the receipt of it, when he declares that he visited Prince Albert because, not having received any order or shipping instructions, he wanted to ascertain the position there. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal have both found that he did receive this communication and I have no doubt that he received also the letter of the 2nd of July which, admittedly, was sent.\nWhat is the meaning of the communication? Mr. Gilmour says that he read the telegram to Simpson. The purport of the telegram seems to me to be clear enough. \"Contract\" in the phrase \"balance of contract\" can, I think, mean nothing but the quantity mentioned in the contract, 50,000 gallons; and the telegram, I think, is a notice that the balance of the 50,000 gallons is to be delivered at the rate of 3,000 gallons a month until this rate of delivery is altered by further notice. Strictly, \"until further notice\" relates to the rate of delivery and, I think, that is the natural reading of this telegram which professes to be a firm order or shipping instructions within the meaning of the document of the 22nd of April. That seems to me to be the natural construction and I can perceive no adequate ground for reading it in such a manner as to make it senseless and inoperative for the purposes for which it was intended.\nI am satisfied that the learned trial judge was right in inferring from all the facts that in effect the parties did by their conduct and their expressions declare to one another at Prince Albert that this was the footing upon which they were dealing; and that pursuant to this understanding the shipments of July, August and October were received and paid for.\nThere is a feature of the dealings that was not much discussed on the argument which I regard as of great importance. Mr. Gilmour says that when he communicated the contents of the telegram from Prince Albert to Simpson, Simpson asked, \"Does he say anything about the money?\" That this is true I have no doubt. The evidence of Simpson's partner McKinney is very clear on the point. Before Simpson's departure for Prince Albert, they, McKinney says, discussed the contract of April 22nd and they discussed the question of securing payment for shipments to be made under the contract; and McKinney's evidence shews that, as he understood it, this matter of security was the principal object of Simpson's visit to Prince Albert. Simpson pretends that it was only after his visit there that the idea of security occurred to him. And he swears that he had no discussion on the subject with his partner. I can see no reason for not accepting the evidence of Mr. Gilmour and McKinney on that point in preference to the evidence of Simpson. Mr. McKinney's testimony is illuminating and I quote it:\n218. Q. You don't think so. Did you have any discussion with Mr. Simpson before he went to Prince Albert with reference to an order which had been placed for wine? A. Just on that 50,000 gallons.\n219. Q. Just on the 50,000 gallons. A. Yes.\n220. Q. Now what discussion did you have about that? A. Well, we figured we had to increase our output for that year if we were going to carry on a business of that capacity.\n221. Q. Did you know that an order has been placed for wine? A. Yes. 222. Q. Before Mr. Simpson went to Prince Albert? A. Yes.\n223. Q. And how many gallons was that that had been placed at that time? A. That was the 50,000.\n224. Q. All the 50,000? A. Just the 50,000.\n***\n230. Q. And that was the reason Mr. Simpson went to Prince Albert, wasn't it, to see how you could get paid? A. Yes.\n***\n232. Q. Yes, and you had discussed that with Mr. Simpson? A. Yes. We wanted to get security on our wine.\n***\n237. Q. And I show you the invoice dated July 17th, 1936, of 55 barrels of loganberry wine, 2,869 gallons. That was what was\u2014 A. That was the first.\n238. Q. And then this matter had been discussed between you and Mr. Simpson before he went up there on the question of delivering that first order, is that right? A. Delivering the first order and getting security on that wine, that is what we figured on.\n***\n252. Q. Yes, that is, the contract was to be assigned to this company which was incorporated and called the Richmond Wineries Western Limited. You knew that. Isn't that so? A. Yes.\nSimpson, of course, says that the $5,000 received in July from the Wineries Western was merely a loan to enable him to finance his pack for that year. But even his evidence, when read as a whole, shews that his real purpose in getting the advance was to get security for payment of shipments to be made under the existing contract.\nThe arrangement as to the alteration of the terms of payment, that each instalment might be paid for at any time before the shipment of the next, which, Simpson implies, was correlative with and dependent upon Eakins' agreement to make the advance, strengthens the significance of this last-mentioned agreement and Simpson's conduct in relation to it.\nEakins, no doubt, believed that Simpson was contracting to supply an additional 75,000 gallons of wine after the 50,000 gallons they had contracted for had been exhausted. Simpson denies not only that there was any such arrangement, but even that the subject was discussed; I have no doubt he did so orally contract. The arrangement, I have no doubt, was as Eakins says that \"after the exhaustion of our existing contract\" the respondents were to supply to Wineries Western wine at the rate of 25,000 gallons annually and that the $5,000 which was to be paid to Simpson, and was paid to Simpson, was to be an annual deposit to assist Simpson in financing the manufacture of wine to be matured for the purpose of carrying out that engagement. The whole arrangement was on the footing that there was an existing contract for the supply of 50,000 gallons of wine under the document of the 22nd of April which had become a binding contract by the communications of June 30th. I have no doubt either that Eakins is stating a fact in saying that Simpson mentioned a possible sale of his business to the Growers Company, and he having expressed apprehension of the effect of such a sale upon this \" existing \" contract between the Wineries Western and the respondents, Simpson assured him that that contract would not be prejudiced. In passing, it is worth while noticing that the contract of sale to the Growers Company by the respondents is made subject to a claim on the part of Eakins under certain letters annexed to the contract and while in this series of letters the document of the 22nd of April is disclosed, there is no reference to the Gilmour telegram or the Gilmour communication or to the letter of the 2nd of July.\nSimpson, of course, fully realized the importance of Gilmour's communication. He says himself it was so big a thing that he was hardly likely not to remember it. Although he hesitates to admit it he meant by that, of course, that in the absence of such a communication there would be no binding contract. He must have known at the same time the importance attached to Gilmour's communication by Eakins. The telegram to Gilmour which Gilmour read to Simpson would make this clear.\nSimpson must have known when he went to Prince Albert on July 10th that Eakins considered he had a binding contract, and, as I have said, he proceeded immediately to transact business with him on that footing. Eakins' first question to Simpson when he stepped from the train at Prince Albert was, \"Have you shipped the car?\" This, of course, could only refer to the shipment of 3,000 gallons on July 12th specified in Gilmour's telegram, and the telegram and letter to Simpson, and Simpson's answer was, \"No, not yet.\" He added, producing a sample of blended wine:\nI am going to ship you four-year-old wine as incorporated in this sample rather than the two-year-old wine specified in our contract. This is the class of wine that I propose to send you under our contract. Then the shipments and the correspondence relating to them show that the shipments were made pursuant to the communications of June 30th. Simpson, in order to explain his first shipment, says it was ordered at Prince Albert. Eakins says no such order was given there; and I have no doubt that the only order for that shipment was the order contained in the previous communication.\nIt is significant that the shipment was made the day after Simpson acknowledged receipt of the cheque for $5,000 which he had stipulated for at Prince Albert as a term of the contract with the object of protecting him respecting payments to be made under the contract; although, as appears, he did not disclose this purpose to Eakins.\nReading the correspondence, one sees very plainly that the parties are not dealing with individual, independent orders. Simpson's own letter of the 20th of August referring not to past, but to future, shipments explicitly acknowledges the existence of the contract\u2014\"I will ship as per contract.\" At all events, I find it impossible to escape the conclusion that Simpson was fully aware that in the transactions at Prince Albert and in the subsequent shipments Eakins was dealing with him on the footing of a concluded contract in the terms of the communication of June 30th; and that Simpson himself was actually dealing with Eakins on that footing, or was deliberately leading Eakins to believe that he, Simpson, was dealing with him on that footing.\nBut it is not necessary to attempt to fathom the mind of Simpson; he is bound by the interpretation reasonably ascribed to his words and conduct by Eakins and acted upon by him. As regards the assignment to the Wineries Western, it may be questionable whether the assignment of June 29th before there was a concluded contract could (even assuming a sufficient notice) take effect as a legal assignment of the contract as ultimately concluded. That is of no importance because it is plain from the oral evidence as well as from the letters that the parties dealt with one another and that the wine was shipped on the footing of a contract of sale in which the Wineries Western were the purchasers. Eakins, the proprietor of the Eakins company, was not only aware of, but was a party to all the transactions and wrote the letters addressed to Simpson. The invoices were all addressed to the Wineries Western. In this aspect of the controversy, the letter of the 19th of June, and Simpson's examination of the minutes, and his reading of the formal assignment in the minutes, are relevant circumstances as well as the admission by all parties that from the beginning it was understood that as soon as Wineries Western was incorporated they were to be substituted for Eakins as purchasers. It must, of course, not be overlooked that the communications of the 30th of June were all addressed to Simpson by the Wineries Western. Simpson says that after the 19th of June he dealt with Wineries Western on the assumption that they had an assignment of the contract.\nSince the Eakins company, as well as the Wineries Western, are plaintiffs, non-compliance with the statutory formalities in respect of the assignment of legal choses in action under British Columbia legislation cannot affect the appellants' right to recover.\nOn the view of the facts above explained, it is not, of course, of cardinal importance whether the communications of the 30th of June were in strict conformity with the term that there were to be firm orders or shipping instructions by the 1st of July. Assuming there was an absence of strict conformity, an acceptance of the terms of those communications by conduct is clearly established. I agree with the trial judge that the proper inference from all the facts is that by words and conduct a contract was concluded between the parties of purchase and sale on the footing of the document of the 22nd of April and the communications of the 30th of June,\u2014blended wine being substituted for \" naked \" wine, the terms of payment being altered, as already explained, and the price increased (by the letters of August 20th and September 2nd) to sixty cents.\nI also agree with the learned trial judge that the seventeenth section of the Statute of Frauds has no application. There was acceptance and actual receipt by Wineries Western of goods under the contract. I also agree with him and for his reasons that the fourth section of the Statute is not an answer. The question of damages remains. We have had an able and useful argument upon it. The learned judge had a difficult task but he recognized the difficulty and there is no ground for thinking that he did not apply his mind to the various considerations substantially involved; and I do not think his judgment is impeachable on the ground that he erred in the principle he applied; namely, that the appellants are entitled to reparation for the loss of the profits they might reasonably expect if the contract was performed. The application of the principle to the particular facts was by no means easy; but he came to the conclusion that the estimate of Mr. Young might be regarded as a safe basis and he accepted and acted upon it as a guide, although he did not slavishly follow it. The sale by the respondents to the rivals of the appellants at a high profit is a circumstance not to be overlooked.\nLord Moulton's judgment in McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada[2] supplies, I think, the canon by which we ought to govern ourselves in this case:\nThe tribunal which has the duty of making such assessment, whether it be judge or jury, has often a difficult task, but it must do it as best it can, and unless the conclusions to which it comes from the evidence before it are clearly erroneous they should not be interfered with on appeal, inasmuch as the Courts of Appeal have not the advantage of seeing the witnesses\u2014a matter which is of grave importance in drawing conclusions as to quantum of damage from the evidence that they give. Their Lordships cannot see anything to justify them in coming to the conclusion that Beck J's assessment of the damages is erroneous, and they are therefore of opinion that it ought not to have been disturbed on appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nCrocket J.\u2014My Lord the Chief Justice in his reasons, I think, clearly shews that there was ample evidence to support the learned trial judge's finding that there was a contract concluded between the parties at Prince Albert for the purchase and sale of 50,000 gallons of blended Loganberry wine at the increased price of 60 cents a gallon, to be shipped as per the terms of the telegram of June 30th, 1936, and the letter of April 22nd, 1936, this evidence consisting, not only of written communications and verbal conversations between the parties, but of their acts and conduct with reference to the matter in controversy. I agree with the view of the learned trial judge also that the contract as concluded between the parties was one which was not incapable of being performed within a year and that s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds accordingly does not bar an action upon it, and also that the acceptance and actual receipt by the plaintiff of three carloads of wine, as part of the 50,000 gallons contracted for, takes the case out of s. 17 of the same statute.\nAs to damages, I can see no reasons which would justify this court in interfering with the assessment the trial judge has made.\nFor these reasons I agree that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: S. H. Gilmour.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. W. Ellis.\n[1] (1926) 58 Ont. L.R. 578.\n[2] [1931] A.C. 299, at 309.\n"}

In the present case, the facts, whose admittance was objected to, were of such a nature as to establish the existence of feelings of animosity, and even of hatred, on the part of the accused towards her husband; and, in that case, such evidence was legal, not only to prove the intentions of the accused, but also to establish one circumstance which, added to other circumstances resulting from the evidence, was of a nature to justify a verdict of guilty against the accused.\u2014The King v. Barbour, [1938] S.C.R. 465; Rex v. Hall, [1911] A.C. 47; Rex v. Bond, [1906] 2 K.B. 389, and Paradis v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 165, ref.\nThe well known rule, that the trial judge must warn the jury of the danger of finding an accused guilty on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, need not be followed by the trial judge in his charge to the jury, when the alleged accomplice has not given evidence and when only certain statements made by him in furtherance of the common purpose were adduced in evidence.\nSemble that, in criminal matters, at a trial before a jury, all objections to evidence should not be reserved for later adjudication by the trial judge, but should be overruled or maintained before such evidence be admitted. Some prejudice may be caused to the accused in the minds of the jury by certain evidence which may be given before it, even, if, later on, the trial judge rules that such evidence should be rejected and that the jury should not take it into account.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murder.\nThe facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nR. Beaudoin K.C. for the appellant.\nNo\u00ebl Dorion K.C., A. Lacoursi\u00e8re and C. No\u00ebl for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e coupable d'avoir, le dix-neuvi\u00e8me jour d'ao\u00fbt 1937, dans la paroisse de St-M\u00e9thode, P.Q., caus\u00e9 la mort de son mari en l'empoisonnant; et la peine capitale a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre elle.\nElle a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a confirm\u00e9 le verdict dans un jugement o\u00f9 quatre des juges ont concouru et un juge fut dissident.\nL'appelante porte maintenant sa cause devant cette Cour sur les moyens de droit soulev\u00e9s par la dissidence en Cour du Banc du Roi et nous soumet que ces moyens devraient pr\u00e9valoir pour faire annuler le verdict, ou, au moins, pour lui obtenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s. C'est ce dernier rem\u00e8de que lui aurait accord\u00e9 le jugement qui a prononc\u00e9 le dissentiment en appel.\nDans le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi, les motifs de la dissidence sont exprim\u00e9s comme suit:\n1. Admission de preuve ill\u00e9gale;\n2. Mauvaise direction de la part du juge pr\u00e9sidant le proc\u00e8s, au pr\u00e9judice de l'appelante;\n3. La preuve de circonstances apport\u00e9e contre l'accus\u00e9e ne justifiait pas en droit une condamnation.\nL'appelante est limit\u00e9e par la loi aux griefs d'appel qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans cette dissidence.\nIl est douteux que le moyen r\u00e9sultant de l'admission de preuve ill\u00e9gale pouvait valablement \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 devant la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nEn effect, comme l'a fait remarquer le procureur de la Couronne, la seule allusion que l'on trouve \u00e0 ce sujet dans l'avis d'appel est la suivante, sous le titre: \"Griefs d'appel en droit\": \"Toute la preuve permise par la Couronne et faite par elle est ill\u00e9gale.\"\nEt, sur motion de la Couronne, par un jugement unanime de la Cour du Banc du Roi, il fut ordonn\u00e9 que ce paragraphe soit retranch\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 de l'avis d'appel parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas expos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise et circonstanci\u00e9e et qu'il ne pouvait donc \u00eatre retenu.\nIl semble cependant que, malgr\u00e9 ce jugement, la Cour du Banc du Roi a laiss\u00e9 faire devant elle la discussion de ce moyen, car chacun des juges en fait mention dans ses notes et en discute la port\u00e9e. Dans les circonstances, comme nous avons entendu les arguments pour et contre \u00e0 l'audition, nous croyons pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de nous prononcer sur ce premier grief.\nA ce sujet, nous d\u00e9sirons seulement faire allusion, en passant, \u00e0 une remarque \u00e0 l'effet que, au cours de l'enqu\u00eate, bon nombre d'objections auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises sous r\u00e9serve par l'honorable juge qui pr\u00e9sidait le proc\u00e8s et que, de cette fa\u00e7on, toutes les r\u00e9ponses auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es devant le jury sans que, plus tard, dans sa charge, le savant juge ait indiqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision qu'il entendait donner sur ces objections.\nNous n'ignorons pas combien il est difficile parfois de d\u00e9cider sur-le-champ certaines objections \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate. D'autre part, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'insister pour d\u00e9montrer le pr\u00e9judice qui peut \u00eatre caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un accus\u00e9 dans l'esprit du jury par certaine preuve qu'on laisse faire devant lui, m\u00eame si, plus tard, le juge d\u00e9clare qu'elle doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et que le jury ne doit pas en tenir compte. Nous sommes d'avis que, dans une cause criminelle devant un jury, les objections \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate ne devraient jamais \u00eatre prises sous r\u00e9serve. Nous croyons devoir en parler ici parce que le point a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 devant nous; mais nous ne pensons pas que la question se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause-ci, car le savant procureur de la Couronne a affirm\u00e9 que\nNo objection was taken under reserve by the trial judge. All the objections were decided as soon as they were made. Consequently the accused surely could not be prejudiced.\nSur ce point, le dossier n'\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas aussi satisfaisant qu'il aurait pu l'\u00eatre; et il a d\u00fb \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par un document sign\u00e9 par le st\u00e9nographe officiel; mais naturellement nous acceptons la d\u00e9claration du procureur de la Couronne.\nLa preuve qui, selon l'avis du juge dissident, n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre permise peut en somme se rapporter \u00e0 deux questions principales.\nLa premi\u00e8re a trait \u00e0 une histoire de sortil\u00e8ge. Elle est rapport\u00e9e par deux t\u00e9moins. Grondin, que l'accus\u00e9e a \u00e9pous\u00e9 peu de temps apr\u00e8s la mort de son premier mari, aurait voulu rejeter contre ce dernier un sortil\u00e8ge qu'il pr\u00e9tendait avoir re\u00e7u de lui. Dans l'esprit de Grondin, ce sortil\u00e8ge aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 au moyen d'un \u00e9crit concernant \"les sorts\"; et l'honorable juge dissident se demande \u00e0 quoi cette histoire pouvait rimer et pourquoi on a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'en encombrer la preuve.\nMais il fut \u00e9tabli que l'\u00e9crit dont Grondin voulait se servir \u00e9tait de la main de l'accus\u00e9e et qu'elle \u00e9tait au courant de l'usage qu'il pr\u00e9tendait en faire. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 lui donner sa participation dans cette affaire. Quelle que soit l'opinion que l'on puisse avoir de cette na\u00eeve machination, il nous semble que cette preuve pouvait tendre \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la nature des sentiments que l'accus\u00e9e entretenait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son mari; et, comme nous le verrons plus loin, nous croyons qu'une preuve de ce genre pouvait \u00eatre permise dans les circonstances. L'autre reproche que l'appelante fait \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate de la Couronne, c'est que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'aurait pas d\u00fb permettre la preuve des relations entre l'accus\u00e9e et un nomm\u00e9 Gilbert; vu que cela ne pouvait avoir aucun rapport avec le crime reproch\u00e9.\nNous croyons cependant que cette preuve pouvait \u00eatre permise en l'esp\u00e8ce pour la m\u00eame raison que nous avons donn\u00e9e plus haut au sujet des histoires de sortil\u00e8ges. Elle \u00e9tait certainement de nature \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence de sentiments d'animosit\u00e9, et m\u00eame de haine, de la part de l'accus\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son mari; et, dans ce cas, elle \u00e9tait l\u00e9gale, non seulement pour prouver l'intention de l'accus\u00e9e, mais m\u00eame pour \u00e9tablir une circonstance qui, jointe aux autres circonstances r\u00e9sultant de la preuve, \u00e9tait susceptible de justifier un verdict contre l'appelante.\nDans la cause de The King v. Barbour1, que nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9e tout r\u00e9cemment, nous avons ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s par suite de l'admission de preuve ill\u00e9gale. Cependant, en discutant un point semblable \u00e0 celui dont il est ici question, l'honorable juge-en-chef, qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de la majorit\u00e9, s'exprime comme suit:\nThe existence of such feelings would, as we shall see, be relevant not merely in respect of intent, but in respect of the fact as well.\nEt, \u00e0 la page 469, il continue:\nIf you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the fact as well.\nEt, en particulier, il s'appuie sur les deux autorit\u00e9s suivantes, que nous croyons devoir citer: Rex v. Hall2,\no\u00f9 Lord Atkinson dit, \u00e0 la page 68:\nSurely in an ordinary prosecution for murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to show he entertained feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not merely of the malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact that he killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards the deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased's life. Evidence of motive necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as well as his \"malice aforethought.\"\nDans le m\u00eame sens, Lord Loreburn cite avec approbation le passage suivant du jugement de Kennedy, J., re Rex v. Bond3. The relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial.\nNous pourrions \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux observations contenues dans le jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de Paradis v. The King4.\nPour ces raisons, nous croyons que le premier grief d'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nIl en est de m\u00eame, \u00e0 notre avis, du second grief \u00e0 l'effet que l'honorable juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s aurait donn\u00e9 au jury une mauvaise direction au pr\u00e9judice de rappelante. Ce dont se plaint le savant procureur de l'accus\u00e9e, c'est que l'honorable pr\u00e9sident du tribunal aurait trop librement donn\u00e9 son opinion sur les faits au cours de sa charge.\nD'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l'on peut dire qu'il faudrait un cas bien exceptionnel pour consid\u00e9rer une objection de ce genre comme une question de droit, et surtout pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un verdict de jury en se fondant sur un pareil motif. Mais, en plus, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal a parfaitement d\u00e9limit\u00e9 le champ d'action du jury et celui du juge. A maintes reprises, il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 au jury que les questions de faits \u00e9taient exclusivement du domaine de ce dernier; et il leur a dit:\nC'est votre opinion qu'il faut, et non la mienne; et, dans l'expos\u00e9 que je vais vous faire, ne voyez pas dans ce que je vais vous dire une opinion; ce sera plut\u00f4t un expos\u00e9 des faits pour vous permettre de suivre intelligemment tous ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis devant vous; et si vous croyez y voir une opinion, \u00f4tez-vous cela de l'esprit.\nAvec la direction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e au jury par le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal, nous ne voyons pas quel pr\u00e9judice pouvait r\u00e9sulter \u00e0 l'appelante de l'expos\u00e9 des faits par le juge.\nLe procureur de l'appelante se plaint, en outre, que le juge aurait omis compl\u00e8tement de mettre le jury en garde contre la preuve apport\u00e9e par un complice. Il dit que la Couronne aurait tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir la complicit\u00e9 de Grondin et \u00e9galement celle de Gilbert, et que le juge n'a donn\u00e9 aucune direction au jury quant \u00e0 la preuve qui pouvait \u00e9maner de ces deux personnes. La r\u00e8gle qui doit \u00eatre suivie dans la direction \u00e0 donner au jury \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un complice est bien connue; mais elle ne s'applique que lorsque le complice a rendu t\u00e9moignage. Elle consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir le jury du danger de condamner un accus\u00e9 en se basant uniquement sur le t\u00e9moignage du complice. Ici, il n'y a pas le moindre doute que la Couronne cherchait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la complicit\u00e9 de Grondin. Mais, comme Grondin n'a pas rendu t\u00e9moignage, il s'ensuit qu'il ne s'agit pas dans l'esp\u00e8ce de l'un des cas o\u00f9 le juge devait mettre la r\u00e8gle en pratique.\nCependant le procureur de l'appelante est all\u00e9 plus loin. Il a fait remarquer que certaines d\u00e9clarations de Grondin avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en preuve; et il a pr\u00e9tendu que si le juge \u00e9tait tenu de mettre le jury en garde contre le t\u00e9moignage d'un complice, il en devrait \u00eatre de m\u00eame de la preuve des d\u00e9clarations que ce complice aurait pu faire.\nNous ne croyons pas que la r\u00e8gle puisse \u00eatre \u00e9tendue jusque-l\u00e0. Comme nous venons de le dire, l'un des points que la Couronne tentait d'\u00e9tablir contre l'accus\u00e9e \u00e9tait qu'elle avait agi de complicit\u00e9 avec Grondin. Dans les circonstances, il nous para\u00eet que la Couronne avait le droit de prouver les actes et les d\u00e9clarations de Grondin dans l'ex\u00e9cution du projet commun; et il n'importe pas que le complice dont on tente de prouver les actes ou les paroles soit ou non mis en accusation en m\u00eame temps que le d\u00e9fendeur.\nDans la cause de Wark5, monsieur le juge Phillimore eut \u00e0 se prononcer sur une question de ce genre; et voici la d\u00e9cision qu'il rend \u00e0 la page 616:\nOn all indictments for crime, and not only in cases in which the indictment is for high treason or conspiracy, where the case for the prosecution is that the crime was the result of a conspiracy, and where evidence has been adduced fit for the jury to consider in proof of the common purpose, any act done by any of the confederates in furtherance of the common purpose may be given in evidence against all. Regina v. Desmond6\u2014per Chief Justice Corkburn and Baron Bramwell\u2014is an instance of this. \"Such acts may include speech. A request in words is clearly as admissible as a request by sign or pantomime.\"\nVoir \u00e9galement ce que dit Lord Alverstone, C.J., dans la cause de Rex v. Duguid7.\nC'est d'ailleurs l'opinion qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par cette Cour dans la cause de Paradis v. The King8, d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e. Quant \u00e0 l'omission de donner une direction au sujet de la complicit\u00e9 de Gilbert, ce moyen doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9 pour la simple raison que, suivant nous, il n'y a rien dans le dossier qui permet de conclure \u00e0 cette complicit\u00e9.\nIl ne reste que le troisi\u00e8me grief d'appel, \u00e0 savoir que la preuve de circonstances apport\u00e9e contre l'accus\u00e9e ne justifiait pas sa condamnation. Sur ce point, nous ne croyons pas utile d'entrer dans les d\u00e9tails de la preuve. Les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi en contiennent une analyse minutieuse et circonstanci\u00e9e.\nIl ne saurait y avoir de doute que le verdict concluant \u00e0 l'empoisonnement de Brochu pouvait amplement se justifier. Nous ne comprenons pas d'ailleurs que ce soit l\u00e0 le point sur lequel a port\u00e9 l'opinion du juge dissident; et ce n'est pas, non plus, celui sur lequel le procureur de l'appelante a insist\u00e9. Le grief consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 dire que toute la preuve contre l'accus\u00e9e se bornait \u00e0 une preuve de circonstances et que cette preuve n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante, en l'esp\u00e8ce, pour permettre au jury de conclure que l'empoisonnement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par l'appelante.\nVoici comment le juge pr\u00e9sidant le proc\u00e8s exposa aux jur\u00e9s leurs devoirs sur ce point:\nQuand vous aurez \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite devant vous, preuve de circonstances, dans son entier, pour en tirer une conclusion, voici ce qu'il faut: Vous devez \u00eatre convaincus, hors de tout doute raisonnable, et quand je parle de doute raisonnable, c'est toujours le doute raisonnable que je viens de vous expliquer il y a un instant, c'est un doute raisonnable, dis-je, que non seulement tous les faits prouv\u00e9s \u00e0 votre satisfaction conduisent \u00e0 la seule conclusion que l'accus\u00e9e est coupable, si vous trouvez que l'accus\u00e9e est coupable, mais aussi qu'il ne peut y avoir d'autres hypoth\u00e8ses, d'autres suppositions raisonnables que c'est elle qui est coupable. En d'autres termes, la preuve doit produire la conviction hors de tout doute, que tous les faits conduisent \u00e0 la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9e, et non seulement \u00e7a, mais qu'il n'y a pas d'autres explications possibles du crime, aucune autre hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable.\n* * *\nSi vous en venez \u00e0 la conclusion que vous pouvez trouver non pas, quatre, cinq ou six hypoth\u00e8ses, mais une seule hypoth\u00e8se raisonnable pour expliquer qu'elle n'est pas coupable, c'est suffisant; mais il faut que cette hypoth\u00e8se l\u00e0 en soit une raisonnable. Je suis certain que le verdict que vous allez rendre va \u00eatre un verdict bas\u00e9, comme je l'ai dit et comme votre serment vous y oblige, bas\u00e9 sur la preuve, non pas sur des sentiments, non pas sur des suppositions, non pas sur des nouvelles publi\u00e9es dans les journaux, mais sur la preuve et sur la preuve telle que faite devant vous. Comme je vous l'ai dit, et j'y reviens encore: cette preuve doit \u00eatre prise dans son ensemble. Vous n'avez pas \u00e0 vous baser sur un fait particulier; ce serait le moyen le plus s\u00fbr de se tromper. C'est sur l'ensemble que vous devez vous baser, la vue d'ensemble de toute la preuve des deux parties. Vous devez avoir cette vue d'ensemble, et c'est de cette vue d'ensemble que doit sortir une conclusion de culpabilit\u00e9 ou de non-culpabilit\u00e9. Et en ayant cette vue d'ensemble-l\u00e0, vous ne pouvez pas perdre de vue que vous devez le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute raisonnable \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9e. Si vous avez un doute raisonnable, je vous dirai encore que vous devez ce doute \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9e; il lui appartient, c'est \u00e0 elle.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 ant\u00e9rieurement le juge avait dit aux jur\u00e9s:\nSi apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la preuve, vous avez un doute raisonnable de la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9e, c'est votre devoir de l'acquitter.\nC'est apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une direction de ce genre que le jury en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 son verdict de culpabilit\u00e9. Il avait devant lui tous les faits et toutes les circonstances. Il avait \u00e9galement les d\u00e9clarations de rappelante, nullement provoqu\u00e9es, et qui, il faut le dire, \u00e9taient d'une extr\u00eame gravit\u00e9.\nAvec la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous sommes d'avis que le jury pouvait certainement tirer des circonstances et des d\u00e9clarations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es la conclusion raisonnable que l'appelante \u00e9tait coupable du crime dont on l'accusait; et nous ne nous croirions pas justifiables pour cette raison de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le verdict qui l'a condamn\u00e9e.\nPour ces motifs, nous croyons que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed.\n1 [1938] S.C.R. 465.\n2 [1911] A.C. 47.\n3 [1906] 2 K.B. 389, at 401.\n4 [1934] S.C.R. 165, at 169, 170.\n5 (1898) 35 L.J.N.C. 615.\n6 (1868) 11 Cox C.C. 146.\n7 (1906) 94 L.T.R. 887.\n8 [1934] S.C.R. 465.\n"}

The York Corporation, [1940] S.C.R. 139\nDate: 1939-12-09\nFred. Christie (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe York Corporation (Defendant) Respondent.\n1939: May 10; 1939: December 9.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nDamages\u2014Tavern\u2014Refusal to serve beer to coloured persons\u2014Discrimination\u2014Freedom of commerce\u2014Monopoly or privileged enterprise\u2014Licence Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 25\u2014Alcoholic Liquor Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 37\u2014Alcoholic Liquor Possession and Transportation Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 38.\nThe appellant, who is a negro, entered a tavern owned and operated by the respondent in the city of Montreal and asked to be served a glass of beer; but the servants of the respondent refused him for the sole reason that they had been instructed not to serve coloured persons. The appellant brought action for damages for the humiliation he suffered. The respondent alleged that in giving such instructions it was acting within its rights; that its business was a private enterprise for gain and that, in acting as it did, it was merely protecting its business interests. The trial judge maintained the action on the ground that the rule whereby the respondent refused to serve negroes in its tavern was illegal according to sections 19 and 33 of the Quebec Licence. Act. But the appellate court reversed that judgment, holding that the above sections did not apply and that, as a general rule, in the absence of any specific law, a merchant or trader was free to carry on his business in the manner he conceived to be best for that business.\nHeld, Davis J. dissenting, that the appeal to this Court should be dismissed.\nPer Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: The general principle of the law of Quebec is that of complete freedom of commerce. Any merchant is free to deal as he may choose with any individual member of the public. It is not a question of motives or reasons for deciding to deal or not to deal: he is free to do either. The only restriction to this general principle would be the existence of a specific law, or, in the carrying out of the principle, the adoption of a rule contrary to good morals or public order; and the rule adopted by the respondent in the conduct of its establishment was not within that class. Also, as the law stands in Quebec, the sale of beer in that province was not either a monopoly or a privileged enterprise. Moreover, the appellant cannot be brought within the terms of section 33 of the Quebec Licence Act, as he was not a traveller asking for a meal in a restaurant, but only a person asking for a glass of beer in a tavern. As the case is not governed by any specific law or more particularly by section 33 of the Quebec Licence Act, it falls under the general principle of the freedom of commerce; and, therefore, the respondent, when refusing to serve the appellant, was strictly-within its rights.\nPer Davis J. dissenting\u2014Having regard to the special legislation in Quebec establishing complete governmental control of the sale of beer in the province and particularly the statutory provision which prohibits anyone of the public from buying beer in the glass from anyone but a person granted the special privilege of selling the same, a holder of such a permit from the government to sell beer in the glass to the public has not the right of an ordinary trader to pick and choose those to whom he will sell. The old doctrine that any merchant is free to deal with the public as he chooses has still now its application in the case of an ordinary merchant; but when the state enters the field and takes exclusive control of the sale to the public of such a commodity as liquor, then such doctrine has no application to a person to whom the state has given a special privilege to sell to the public.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 65 K.B. 104) aff., Davis J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec1, (under special leave of appeal granted by this Court)2, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Philippe Demers J., and dismissing the appellant's action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLovell C. Carroll for the appellant.\nHazen Hansard for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant, who is a negro, entered a tavern owned and operated by the respondent, in the city of Montreal, and asked to be served a glass of beer; but the waiters refused him for the sole reason that they had been instructed not to serve coloured persons. He claimed the sum of $200 for the humiliation he suffered.\nThe respondent alleged that in giving such instructions to its employees and in so refusing to serve the appellant it was well within its rights; that its business is a private enterprise for gain; and that, in acting as it did, the respondent was merely protecting its business interests.\nIt appears from the evidence that, in refusing to sell beer to the appellant, the respondent's employees did so quietly, politely and without causing any scene or commotion whatever. If any notice was attracted to the appellant on the occasion in question, it arose out of the fact that the appellant persisted in demanding beer after he had been so refused and went to the length of calling the police, which was entirely unwarranted by the circumstances.\nThe learned trial judge awarded the appellant the sum of $25 and costs of the action as brought. The only ground of the judgment was that the rule whereby the respondent refused to serve negroes in its tavern was \"illegal,\" according to sections 19 and 33 of the Quebec Licence Act (Ch. 25 of R.S.P.Q., 1925). The Court of King's Bench, however, was of opinion that the sections relied on by the Superior Court did not apply; and considering that, as a general rule, in. the absence of any specific law, a merchant or trader is free to carry on his business in the manner he conceives to be best for that business, that Court (Galipeault, J., dissenting) reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the appellant's action with costs3. The appeal here is by special leave, pursuant to sec. 41 of the Supreme Court Act4.\nIn considering this case, we ought to start from the proposition that the general principle of the law of Quebec is that of complete freedom of commerce. Any merchant is free to deal as he may choose with any individual member of the public. It is not a question of motives or reasons for deciding to deal or not to deal; he is free to do either. The only restriction to this general principle would be the existence of a specific law, or, in the carrying out of the principle, the adoption of a rule contrary to good morals or public order. This is well illustrated in a case decided by the Tribunal de Commerce de Nice and which was confirmed by the Cour de Cassation in France (S. 93-2-193; and S. 96-1444):\n* * * le principe de la libert\u00e9 du commerce et de l'industrie emporte, pour tout marchand, le droit de se refuser \u00e0 vendre, ou \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 la disposition du public, ce qui fait l'objet de son commerce; * * * le principe de la libert\u00e9 du commerce et de l'industrie autorise le propri\u00e9taire d'un \u00e9tablissement ouvert au public, et \u00e0 plus forte raison le directeur d'un casino, \u00e0 n'y donner acc\u00e8s qu'aux personnes qu'il lui convient de recevoir; son contr\u00f4le \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est souverain et ne peut \u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des tribunaux.\nCependant la libert\u00e9 du commer\u00e7ant ou de l'industriel de n'entrer en rapport qu'avec des personnes de son choix comporte certaines restrictions, bas\u00e9es sur des raisons d'ordre public. Il en est de la sorte, par exemple, lorsque le commer\u00e7ant ou l'industriel jouit, ainsi que les compagnies de chemin de fer, d'un monopole de droit ou m\u00eame de fait.\nThis principle was followed by the Court of King's Bench in the case of Loew's Montreal Theatres v. Reynolds5, where the facts presented a great deal of similarity with those of the present case. The plaintiff, a coloured man, sued Loew's Theatres Ltd. in damages because he had been denied a seat in the orchestra at its theatre, on account of his colour, for the reason that the management had decided that no person belonging to that race would be admitted to the orchestra seats. The Court decided that the management of a theatre may impose restrictions and make rules of that character. In the course of his reasons, Chief Justice Lamothe said:\nAucune loi., dans notre province, n'interdit aux propri\u00e9taries de theatres de faire une r\u00e8gle semblable. Aucun r\u00e8glement municipal ne porte sur ce sujet. Alors, chaque propri\u00e9taire est ma\u00eetre chez lui; il peut, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, \u00e9tablir toutes r\u00e8gles non contraries aux bonnes m\u0153urs et \u00e0 l'ordre public. Ainsi, un g\u00e9rant de th\u00e9\u00e2tre pourrait ne recevoir que les personnes, rev\u00eatues d'un habit de soir\u00e9e. La, r\u00e8gle pourrait para\u00eetre arbitraire, mais elle ne serait ni ill\u00e9gale ni prohib\u00e9e. Il faudrait s'y soumettre, ou ne pas aller \u00e0 ce th\u00e9\u00e2tre. Tenter de violer cette r\u00e8gle \u00e0 l'aide d'un billet, serait s'exposer \u00e0 l'expulsion, ce serait s'y exposer volontairement.\nIn the particular case of the hotel keepers, the jurisprudence is now well established; and we read in Carpentier and du Saint, R\u00e9pertoire du droit fran\u00e7ais, Vo. Aubergiste, nos 83 et 84, that\nLe principe de la libert\u00e9 de l'industrie a fait d\u00e9cider aux auteurs de l'Encyclop\u00e9die du droit que l'h\u00f4telier est toujours libre de refuser le voyageur qui se pr\u00e9sente.\n* * *\nC'est en ce dernier sens que se prononce une jurisprudence constante; et la question aujourd'hui ne pr\u00e9sente plus de doute s\u00e9rieux.\nIn a similar case, in the province of Ontario, where the facts were practically identical with the present one, Lennox, J., decided according to the same principle and referred to a number of English cases on which he relied (Franklin v. Evans)6.\nThis, moreover, would appear to have been the view of the learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment, and it would seem that he would have dismissed the case but for his opinion that sec. 33 of the Quebec Licence Act specifically covered the case. Referring to the decisions above mentioned, he said in the course of his reasons:\nJe suis d'avis qu'aucune de ces causes n'a d'application. Elles sont bas\u00e9es sur le fait qu'il n'y a pas de loi restreignant la libert\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire; que chaque propri\u00e9taire de th\u00e9\u00e2tre ou de restaurant est ma\u00eetre chez lui. C'est la pr\u00e9tention que la d\u00e9fenderesse voulait faire triompher dans cette cause. Malheureusement pour elle, la loi des licences, ch. 25 S.R.P.Q., Art. 33, dit: \"Nulle personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 tenir un restaurant \"ne doit refuser sans cause raisonnable de donner \u00e0 manger aux \"voyageurs.\" We will discuss later the effect of sec. 33 of the Quebec Licence Act, but for the moment it may be stated that, in this case, either under the law or upon the record, it cannot be argued that the rule adopted by the respondent in the conduct of its establishment was contrary to good morals or public order. Nor could it be said, as the law stood, that the sale of beer in the province of Quebec was either a monopoly or a privileged enterprise.\nThe fact that a business cannot be conducted without a licence does not make the owner or the operator thereof a trader of a privileged class.\nThe license in this case is mainly for the purpose of raising revenue and also, to a certain extent, for allowing the Government to control the industry; but it does not prevent the operation of the tavern from being a private enterprise to be managed within the discretion of its proprietor.\nThe only point to be examined therefore is whether sec. 33 of the Quebec Licence Act, upon which the learned trial judge relied in maintaining the appellant's action, applies to the present case.\nThe view of the majority of the Court of King's Bench was that it did not; and we agree with that interpretation.\nSection 33 reads:\nNo licensee for a restaurant may refuse, without reasonable cause, to give food to travellers.\nFor the purpose of our decision, there are three words to be considered in that section: \"restaurant,\" \"food,\" and \"travellers.\"\nThe word \"restaurant\" is defined in the Act (sec. 19-2):\nA \"restaurant\" is an establishment, provided with special space and accommodation, where, in consideration of payment, food (without lodging) is habitually furnished to travellers.\nThe word \"traveller\" is also defined in the same section as follows:\nA \"traveller\" is a person who, in consideration of a given price per day, or fraction of a day, on the American or European plan, or per meal, \u00e0 table d'h\u00f4te or \u00e0 la carte, is furnished by another person with food or lodging, or both.\nWith the aid of those two definitions in the Act, we think it must be decided that, in this case, the appellant was not a traveller who was asking to be furnished with food in a restaurant.\nPerhaps, as stated by the learned trial judge, a glass of beer may, in certain cases, be considered as food. But we have no doubt that, in view of the definitions contained in the Act, the appellant was not a traveller asking for food in a restaurant within the meaning of the statute. In the Act respecting alcoholic liquor (ch. 37 of R.S.P.Q., 1925) we find the definition of the words \"restaurant\" and \"traveller\" in exactly the same terms as above. But, in addition, the words \"meal\" and \"tavern\" are also defined (Sec. 3, subs. 6 and 9).\nThose definitions, so far as material here, are as follows:\n6. The word \"meal\" means the consumption of food of a nature and quantity sufficient for the maintenance of the consumer, in one of the following places:\n* * *\n(b) In the dining-room of a restaurant situated in a city or town, and equipped for the accommodation of fifty guests at one time, and which is not only licensed for the reception of travellers but where full meals are regularly served.\n9. The word \"tavern\" means an establishment specially adapted for the sale by the glass and consumption on the premises of beer as hereinbefore defined, or, in a hotel or restaurant, the room specially adapted for such purpose.\nIt will be seen therefore that the appellant cannot be brought within the terms of sec. 33 of the Quebec Licence Act. He was not a traveller asking for a meal in a restaurant. According to the definitions, he was only a person asking for a glass of beer in a tavern.\nAs the case is not governed by any specific law or more particularly by sec. 33 of the Quebec Licence Act, it falls under the general principle of the freedom of commerce; and it must follow that, when refusing to serve the appellant, the respondent was strictly within its rights.\nBut perhaps it may be added that the Quebec statutes make a clear distinction between a hotel or a restaurant and a tavern. The Act (sec. 32) provides that \"no \u201clicensee for a hotel may refuse without just cause to give \"lodging or food to travellers\" and that (sec. 33) \"No \"licensee for a restaurant may refuse without reasonable \"cause, to give food to travellers.\"\nNo similar provision is made for taverns; and, in our opinion, it would follow from the statute itself that the legislature designedly excluded tavern owners from the obligation imposed upon the hotel and restaurant owners. For these reasons, the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nDavis J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a British subject residing in Verdun near the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec. He came from Jamaica and has been permanently resident in the said province for some twenty years. He is a coloured gentleman\u2014his own words are \"a negro\" though counsel for the respondent, for what reason I do not know, told him during his examination for discovery that he wanted it on record that he is \"not extraordinarily black.\" He appears to have a good position as a private chauffeur in Montreal. He was a season box subscriber to hockey matches held in the Forum in Montreal and in that building the respondent operates a beer tavern. Beer is sold by the glass for consumption on the premises. Food such as sandwiches is also served, being apparently purchased when required from nearby premises and resold to the customer. The appellant had often on prior occasions to the one in question, when attending the hockey matches dropped into the respondent's tavern and bought beer by the glass there. On the particular evening on which the complaint out of which these proceedings arose occurred, the appellant with two friends\u2014he describes one as a white man and the other as coloured\u2014just before the hockey game went into the respondent's premises in the ordinary course. The appellant put down fifty cents on the table and asked the waiter for three steins of light beer. The waiter declined to fill the order, stating that he was instructed not to serve coloured people. The appellant and his two friends then spoke to the bartender and to the manager, both of whom stated that the reason for refusal was that the appellant was a coloured person. The appellant then telephoned for the police. He says he did this because he wanted the police there to witness the refusal that had been made. The manager repeated to the police the refusal he had previously made. The appellant and his two friends then left the premises of their own accord. The appellant says that this was to his humiliation in the presence of some seventy customers who were sitting around and had heard what occurred. The appellant then brought this action against the respondent for damages for breach of contract and damages in tort. No objection was taken to the suit having been brought both on contract and in tort on the same set of facts and I assume that this form of action is permissible under the Quebec practice and procedure. The appellant recovered $25 damages and costs at the trial. This judgment was set aside and the action was dismissed with costs upon an appeal to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), Galipeault J. dissenting7.\nThe learned trial judge found that the appellant had been humiliated by the refusal and was entitled to be compensated upon the ground that the tavern was a restaurant within the meaning of the Quebec Licence Act, R.S.Q. 1925, ch. 25, sec. 19, and that as such the respondent was forbidden by sec. 33 to refuse the appellant. By sec. 19 (2) a restaurant is defined as\nan establishment, provided with special space and accommodation, where, in 'consideration of payment, food (without lodging) is habitually furnished to travellers.\nBy sec. 33,\nno licensee for a restaurant may refuse, without reasonable cause, to give food to travellers.\nThe Court of King's Bench did not consider the above statute, which deals with various licences granted by the government under the Act, applicable to the facts of this case and, I think rightly, dealt with the case of the tavern under another statute, the Alcoholic Liquor Act, R.S.Q. 1925, ch. 37, and the majority of the Court took the view that \"chaque propri\u00e9taire est ma\u00eetre chez lui\" on the doctrine of freedom of commerce\u2014\"la libert\u00e9 du commerce et de l'industrie.\" Pratte, J. ad hoc agreed with the conclusion of the majority but upon the single ground that the respondent's refusal was made under circumstances such that it could not cause any damage to the appellant. Galipeault, J. dissented upon the ground that the conduct of the respondent towards the appellant was contrary to good morals and the public order\u2014\"contre les bonnes moeurs, contre l'ordre public,\" and considered that under the special legislation in Quebec governing the sale of liquor the respondent was not entitled to the \"freedom of commerce\" applicable to ordinary merchants and places like theatres, etc. Galipeault, J. would have affirmed the trial judgment.\nThis Court gave special leave to the appellant to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench upon the ground that the matter in controversy in the appeal will involve \"matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected \"within the meaning of sec. 41 of the Supreme Court Act and also because the matter in controversy is of such general importance that leave to appeal ought to be granted8.\nThe question in issue is a narrow one but I regard it as a very important one. That is, Has a tavern keeper in the province of Quebec under the special legislation there in force the right to refuse to sell beer to any one of the public? There is no suggestion that in this case there was any conduct of a disorderly nature or any reason to prompt the refusal to serve the beer to the appellant other than the fact that he was a coloured gentleman.\nThe province of Quebec in 1921 adopted the policy of complete control within the province of the sale of alcoholic liquors. (The Alcoholic Liquor Act, 11 Geo. V, Quebec Statutes 1921, ch. 24, now R.S.Q. 1925, ch. 37.) The words \"alcoholic liquor\" in the statute expressly include beer (sec. 3 (5)). The word \"tavern\" means an establishment specially adapted for the sale by the glass and consumption on the premises of beer or, in a hotel or restaurant, the room specially adapted for such purpose (sec. 3 (9)). The sale and delivery in the province of alcoholic liquor, with the exception of beer, is forbidden expressly, except that it may be sold or delivered to or by the Quebec Liquor Commission set up by the statute or by any person authorized by it, or in any case provided for by the statute (sec. 22). The sale of beer is specifically dealt with by sec. 25, which provides that\nThe sale or delivery of beer is forbidden in the province, unless such sale or delivery be made by the Commission or by a brewer or other person authorized by the Commission under this Act, and in the manner hereinafter set forth.\nThe Commission is given power by sec. 9d to control the possession, sale and delivery of alcoholic liquor in accordance with the provisions of the statute and by sec. 9e to grant permits for the sale of alcoholic liquor. By sec. 33 the Commission may determine the manner in which a tavern must be furnished and equipped in order to allow the exercise therein of the \"privilege conferred by the permit.\" Beer may be sold by any person in charge of a grocery or of a store where beer only is sold, on condition that no quantity of less than one bottle be sold, that such beer be not consumed in such store, and that a permit therefor be granted him by the Commission, and that such permit be in force (sec, 30 (4)). Now as to the sale of beer by the glass, sec. 30 (5) provides as follows:\u2014\nAny person in charge of a tavern, but in a city or town only, may sell therein beer by the glass,\u2014provided that it be consumed on the premises, and provided that a permit to that effect be granted him by the Commission * * * and that such permit be in force.\nSection 30 further provides that in every such case the beer must have been bought directly by the holder of the permit from a brewer who is also the holder of a permit. Section 42 (3) fixes the days and hours during which any holder of a permit for the sale of beer in a tavern may sell. Then by sec. 43, certain named classes of persons are forbidden to be sold any alcoholic liquor:\n1. Any person who has not reached the age of eighteen years;\n2. any interdicted person;\n3. any keeper or inmate of a disorderly house;\n4. any person already convicted of drunkenness or of any offence caused by drunkenness;\n5. Any person who habitually drinks alcoholic liquor to excess, and to whom the Commission has, after investigation, decided to prohibit the sale of such liquor upon application to the Commission by the husband, wife, father, mother, brother, sister, curator, employer or other person depending upon or in charge of such person, or by the cure, pastor, or mayor of the place.\nBut no sale to any of the persons mentioned in 2, 3, 4 or 5 above shall constitute an offence by the vendor unless the Commission has informed him, by registered letter, that it is forbidden to sell to such person. Sec. 46 provides that no beer shall be transported in the province except as therein defined.\nBy a separate statute, the Alcoholic Liquor Possession and Transportation Act, 11 Geo. V (1921), ch. 25, now R.S.Q. 1925, ch. 38, which Act is stated to apply to the whole province, no alcoholic liquor as defined in the Alcoholic Liquor Act (which includes beer) shall be kept, possessed or transported in the province except as therein set forth. Subsection 3 of sec. 3 excepts:\nin the residence of any person, for personal consumption and not for sale, provided it has been acquired by and delivered to such person, in his residence, previous to the 1st of May, 1921, or has been acquired by him, since such date, from the Quebec Liquor Commission.\nIt is plain, then, that the province of Quebec, like most of the other provinces in Canada, took complete control of the sale of liquor in its own province. The permit system enables the public to purchase from either government stores or specially licensed vendors. A glass of beer can only be bought in the province from a person who has been granted by the Government Commission a permit (sec. 33 refers to it as a \"privilege\") to sell to the public beer in the glass for consumption on the premises. The respondent was a person to whom a permit had been granted. The sole question in this appeal then is whether the respondent, having been given under the statute the special privilege of selling beer in the glass to the public, had the right to pick and choose those of the public to whom he would sell. In this case the refusal was on the ground of the colour of the person. It might well have been on account of the racial antecedents or the religious faith of the person. The statute itself has definitely laid down, by sec. 43, certain classes of persons to whom a licensee must not sell. The question is, Has the licensee the right to set up his own particular code, or is he bound, as the custodian of a government permit to sell to the public, to sell to anyone who is ready to pay the regular price? Disorderly conduct on the premises of course does not enter into our discussion because there is no suggestion of that in this case. One approach to the problem is the application of the doctrine of \"freedom of commerce.\" It was held by the majority in the Court below, in effect, that the licensee is in no different position from a grocer or other merchant who can sell his goods to whom he likes. The opposite view was taken by Galipeault, J. on the ground that the licensee has what is in the nature of a quasi monopolistic right which involves a corresponding duty to sell to the public except in those cases prohibited by statute. Pratte J., ad hoc, did not take either view; his decision rests solely upon the ground that the respondent's refusal was made under circumstances such that it could not cause any damage to the appellant.\nSeveral decisions were considered and discussed by the judges in the Court below. One of the cases relied upon for the majority view was the Quebec case of Loew's Theatre v. Reynolds9, where it was held that a negro who buys a ticket of general admission to the theatre and knowing the rule of the theatre that only persons wearing evening dress are allowed in the dress circle, is refused the right to sit there, has no right of action. It was said in that case that a theatre can make rules, such as requiring evening dress in the dress circle, which applied to all, white and coloured alike, and it did not constitute discrimination because it was a rule that was not against public order and good morals. Carroll, J., dissented in that case. Martin, J. who rendered the majority opinion of the Court, said, at p. 465:\nWhile it may be unlawful to exclude persons of colour from the equal enjoyment of all rights and privileges in all places of public amusement, the management has the right to assign particular seats to different races and classes of men and women as it sees fit, * * *\nAnother case relied upon by the majority was the Ontario case of Franklin v. Evans10. That was a restaurant case in which the plaintiff, a negro, had been refused food on the ground of colour. There was no statutory law in Ontario requiring a restaurant to receive. Lennox, J., who tried the case, said that he had been referred to no decided case in support of the plaintiff's contention that the restaurant was bound to serve him. But he said that in his opinion the restaurant-keeper in that case was\nnot at all in the same position as persons who, in consideration of the grant of a monopoly or quasi-monopoly, take upon themselves definite obligations.\nThe English case of Sealey v. Tandy11 was referred to by those who took the majority view. That was a case of assault stated by a metropolitan magistrate. It was held that the occupier and licensee of licensed premises (not being an inn) has a right to request any person to leave whom he does not wish to remain upon his premises. But I would refer, in connection with that case, to the editors' footnote in the new Halsbury, vol. 18, p. 144 (k), where after citing Sealey v. Tandy12, they say:\nBut in Attorney-General v. Capel (1494, Y.B. 10 Hen. 7, fo. 7, pl. 14, Hussey, C.J., said that a \"victualler\" will be compelled to sell his victual if the purchaser has tendered him ready payment, otherwise not. Quod Brian affirmavit. And in Anon. (1460) Y.B. 39 Hen. 6, fo. 18, pl. 24, cited in Bro. Abr., tit. Action sur le case, pl. 76, it is said: \"It is decided by Moyle, J., if an innkeeper refuses to lodge me I shall have an action on the case and the same law if a victualler refuses to give me victuals.\nA victualler (see Murray's Oxford Dictionary) is one who sells food or drink to be consumed on the premises; a publican.\nThe question is one of difficulty, as the divergence of judicial opinion in the courts below indicates. My own view is that having regard to the special legislation in Quebec establishing complete governmental control of the sale of beer in the province and particularly the statutory provision which prohibits anyone of the public from buying beer in the glass from anyone but a person granted the special privilege of selling the same, a holder of such a permit from the government to sell beer in the glass to the public has not the right of an ordinary trader to pick and choose those to whom he will sell.\nIn the changed and changing social and economic conditions, different principles must necessarily be applied to the new conditions. It is not a question of creating a new principle but of applying a different but existing principle of the law. The doctrine that any merchant is free to deal with the public as he chooses had a very definite place in the older economy and still applies to the case of an ordinary merchant, but when the State enters the field and takes exclusive control of the sale to the public of such a commodity as liquor, then the old doctrine of the freedom of the merchant to do as he likes has in my view no application to a person to whom the State has given a special privilege to sell to the public.\nIf there is to be exclusion on the ground of colour or of race or of religious faith or on any other ground not already specifically provided for by the statute, it is for the legislature itself, in my view, to impose such prohibitions under the exclusive system of governmental control of the sale of liquor to the public which it has seen fit to enact.\nThe appellant sued for $200. The learned trial judge awarded him $25 damages. I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment appealed from and restore the judgment at the trial with costs here and below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lovell C.

(Suppliant) Respondent.\n1939: May 1; 1939: December 9.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis and Kerwin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nNegligence\u2014Construction of jetty by Dominion Government\u2014Upper portion of it destroyed by storm and lower portion remaining under water entirely submerged\u2014Vessel striking such portion\u2014Damages not immediately ascertained\u2014Subsequent sinking of vessel\u2014Responsibility of the Crown\u2014Whether damages limited to damages at the time of the collision.\nThe Dominion Government undertook, in 1931, the construction of a jetty, projecting at right angles to the large Dominion Government breakwater at Port Morien, Nova Scotia. Before the jetty was completed, about 50 feet of the upper portion of the outward end broke away during a storm in 1932, thus leaving the lower portion of the outer cribwork and its rock ballast remaining in position but entirely submerged. Some two years later, in September, 1934, the towboat Ostrea, the property of the suppliant, equipped for wrecking and salvage operations, became a total loss at sea as a result of having struck the submerged portion of the jetty which, the suppliant alleged, had been left without any buoy or other warning to indicate its presence there. It was established by the evidence that the master of the Ostrea, considering the collision as slight, did not ascertain immediately the extent of the damage caused to his vessel. The Ostrea continued on her way to her salvage work; but after proceeding for about 25 minutes, a distance of 3\u00bd miles, she appeared to be filling with water, and, a few minutes after all the men on board left her in lifeboats, she sank with all her furnishings and salvage equipment. The underwriters, being advised. that the ship should be written as a total loss, paid the suppliant the sum of $20,016. The suppliant then submitted a petition of right on behalf of and for the benefit of the group of underwriters who were subrogated to the rights of the suppliant in respect of the loss. The Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J., held that, in the restoration and changes made in the jetty, there had been negligence on the part of the officers or servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work; but he limited the relief to \"the damages to the vessel directly attributable to the collision * * * , had such damages been ascertained immediately after the said collision.\" The respondent appealed and the suppliant cross-appealed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada and dismissing the appeal to this Court, that, upon the facts of the case, the submerged cribwork, which was left with nothing to warn navigators of its presence, constituted a dangerous menace to navigation, and in leaving that obstruction without providing any such warning, the officials and servants of the Crown in charge of these works were chargeable with negligence for which the Crown is responsible by force of section 19.(c) of the Exchequer Court Act; but\nHeld, varying the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada and allowing the cross-appeal, that the amount of damages should not be restricted to those mentioned in that judgment.\nPer Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: After the collision there has been negligence on the part of the ship's officers in not having discovered sooner than they did the extent of the damages; and the total loss of the vessel and its equipment would have been avoided had an attempt been made either to return her to the wharf or to beach her at some nearby point. But the suppliant, although not entitled to damages as a total loss, should recover more than the cost of the repair of the vessel as allowed by the trial judge, and should be granted any other damages directly attributable to the collision.\nPer The Chief Justice and Davis J.\u2014The respondent is entitled to recover the total amount of damages claimed in the appeal.\nPer the Chief Justice: The onus resting upon the Crown, to shew that the loss of the vessel did not follow in the ordinary course as the \"natural and reasonable\" result of running upon the obstruction under water, has not been discharged; the Crown has not established such negligence of officers in charge of the ship as constituting novus actus interveniens. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kelvin Shipbuilding Co. (138 L.T. 369) ref.\nPer Davis J.\u2014The appellant would be subjected to a diminution of damages only it it be proved that those in charge of the vessel were guilty of negligence (as opposed to mere error of judgment) amounting to a novus actus interveniens which would have caused the extra damage; and there was no conclusive evidence that the vessel could have been saved from total destruction even if the leak in her had been discovered immediately after the collision. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J., which had maintained in part the petition of right presented by the suppliant to recover damages from the Crown.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCharles J. Burchell K.C. and Charles Stein for the appellant.\nW. C. MacDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014I agree with the learned trial judge that the submerged cribwork which, after the superstructure of the jetty had been carried away, was left with nothing to warn navigators of its presence, constituted a dangerous menace to navigation; and that in leaving this obstruction without providing any such warning the officials concerned are chargeable with negligence for which the Crown is responsible by force of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe only question presenting any difficulty is whether the onus resting upon the Crown to shew that the loss of the vessel did not follow in the ordinary course as the result of running upon this obstruction has been discharged.\nThe principle applicable can, I think, be taken from the judgment of Lord Haldane in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Kelvin Shipping Co. Ltd. (1)1:\nThe question is whether, after the original fault which started matters, there has been a novus actus interveniens which was the direct cause of the final damage.\nHe adds:\nWhen a collision takes place by the fault of the defending ship in an action for damages, the damage is recoverable if it is the natural and reasonable result of the negligent act, and it will assume this character if it can be shown to be such a consequence as in the ordinary course of things would flow from the situation which the offending ship had created.\nAnd later he says:\nIt follows that the burden lies on the negligent ship to show by clear evidence that the subsequent damage arose from negligence or great want of skill on the part of those on board the vessel damaged. This is not, of course, a case of collision between two ships, but I can see no reason for thinking that the principle is not applicable. It is true also that there was not in the case before us any emergency: the matter of the vessel was not confronted with a difficult choice between course of action all attended with peril; but I have, nevertheless, come to the conclusion, although the question is a difficult one, that the Crown has not in this case established such negligence as constituted novus actus interveniens.\nAs Lord Wright said in Caswell v. Powell (1)2:\nNegligence is the breach of that duty to take care which the law requires either in regard to another's person or his property, or where contributory negligence is concerned, of a man's own person or property. The degree of want of care which constitutes negligence must vary with the circumstances * * * It is not a matter of uniform standard. It may vary according to the circumstances from place to place, from man to man, from time to time. It may vary even in the case of the same man.\nI attach importance to a consideration to which, with the greatest possible respect, as it appears to me, the learned trial judge did not give the weight I think it deserves. The learned judge found that the work, presenting, as Captain Williams says, the appearance of a new wharf, but with the sunken crib work projecting from it without a sign of its presence, constituted a trap. The master of the Ostrea had not the slightest reason to suspect the presence of any obstruction, natural or artificial, as he passed within a few feet of the end of the wharf. He had every reason for complete confidence in the assumption that he had plenty of water and for acting on that assumption. When he and the mate and the engineer realized that the vessel had struck something, it did not, it seems clear, occur to them that they had run upon an obstruction solidly in place in the bed of the harbour; or that the ship had suffered such damage as to make it unsafe or risky to proceed to their destination. The impact seemed so light that the engineer, as he says, \"thought she rubbed up against the breakwater.\"\nThe captain says:\nQ. Now as to this bump; was it a serious bump?\nA. No. We experience worse than that every day. I did not think it anything out of the way but enough to roll her a bit. The engineer says:\nQ. One of the witnesses said they got bumps like that every day?\nA. I have hit against scows and other things when docking and the bump would be 75 per cent harder than that.\nQ. So that this was not a hard bump?\nA. No, sir, the ship seemed to run on something and listed to starboard.\nQ. Could you tell that it struck forward?\nA. Yes, from her listing and the fact that I felt no bump aft.\nQ. Bumps of this kind happen daily?\nA. But this was not exactly a bump. Maybe in the after end I would not hear the sound like they would, but I remember the vessel running up on something and her listing to starboard.\nI cannot help thinking that, had they suspected the existence of the tangled mass of logs and rocks against which they had run,\u2014had they realized the character of the obstruction with the risks involved in running against it,\u2014the attention of the master and his officers would have been at once aroused to the practical possibility of substantial damage and that they would have proceeded more energetically in ascertaining the effects of the impact.\nI do not think the authors of the original wrong can escape responsibility for the failure on the part of the officers of the vessel to appreciate instantly the serious nature of what had occurred and for any lack of energy in their investigation. I am inclined to think that the language of Lord Sumner in the Paludina (1)3 (referring to the facts in the City of Lincoln (2))4 may not unfairly be adapted to the circumstances with which we are concerned: \"The hand of the original wrongdoer was still heavy on\" them, and their own management of the vessel \"was not the sole human agency determining\" the loss of the vessel.\nI am disposed to think that the original wrongdoing which created the trap is chargeable, not only with leading the Ostrea into danger, but also with lulling her officers into a false confidence in the innocuousness of the blow they had received by concealing from them the character of the obstruction they had encountered. In these circumstances, although, as I have said, I have found the question a difficult one, I am with respect unable to agree that the Crown has shown \"by clear evidence\" that the loss of the ship \"arose,\" to repeat Lord Haldane's words, \"from negligence or great want of skill on the part of those on board.\"\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014During the years 1931, 1932 and 1933, the Federal Department of Public Works constructed a jetty as an addition to an old Government breakwater at Port Morien, a village on the north shore of Cow Bay, in Cape Breton, the added jetty running west from and at right angles to the old breakwater and forming with the original breakwater a small harbour protected from the sea on the east and south sides. The new structure consisted of a framework of cribbed logs fastened together by heavy bolts and ballasted with stones and rocks of various sizes from 10 to as much as 150 to 200 pounds. It was protected on either side by planking and tapered from a width of 26 ft. at the bottom to 16 ft. at the top. A length of 105 ft. of the jetty was completed in the year 1931 and a block or crib partially constructed for its extension by another 105 ft. during the year 1932. The framework of the last crib had been constructed on the shore to a height of 6 or 7 ft., including a ballast floor, in the latter part of 1931, when, the appropriation having been exhausted, the work was suspended. It had proceeded under the control of T. J. Locke, resident district engineer of the department of Public Works at Halifax, and the supervision of Duncan H. McDonald, his assistant district engineer, who had acted as inspecting engineer of the Department of Public Works in Cape Breton for a number of years. In May, 1932, a further appropriation having been granted, Henry T. Munro was notified by Locke of his appointment as foreman for the continuation of the work and the operations were resumed under his immediate control and the supervision of McDonald in July. The partially constructed crib after having been reinforced by the addition of more logs was towed to the end of the completed jetty, ballasted and sunk in its proper position. It was then raised to its proper height by further cribbing and ballasting. In the month of September, while this work was in progress and before the ballasting had been completed, the top portion of the outer end of the crib for a distance of about 50 ft. was swept away by a violent storm and the wooden framework driven on a reef. The work on the extension of course ceased beyond the employment of two or three men to clear up the floating wreckage. Though McDonald went to Port Morien shortly afterwards and conferred with Munro on the situation, no further work was done on the extension until the late summer of 1933, the 1932 appropriation having been exhausted. In the meantime a report seems to have been made to the district engineer's office of a further examination of the situation made by McDonald in July, recommending that the jetty be squared off and sheeted at the point from which the upper framework had been torn away by the storm\u2014approximately 155 ft. out from the old breakwater\u2014and this crib framework utilized in the construction of a return L running about 50 ft. northerly towards the shore. A further appropriation of $2,000 had been placed at the disposal of the Resident Engineer's office for this work. A new foreman (John Martel) was appointed and carried the job on to final completion in October, 1933, under the direction and supervision of assistant engineer McDonald. No effort, however, was made to clear away the submerged portion of the damaged crib beyond the sawing off of a few projecting logs, which could be seen a few feet below the water line and which could be reached by a five-foot cross-cut saw at the point where the 50-foot section broke away. Martel said he did not go down to the bottom because there was ballast there covering the lower logs. No diver was employed by the department for the purpose of examining this submerged obstruction, but in December, 1934, after the loss of the steam tug Ostrea, hereinafter referred to, a diver named Hennessy examined it at the instigation no doubt of the suppliant company. According to his evidence as given on the trial as a witness for the suppliant, the submerged obstruction consisted of a mass of rock and round logs tangled into one another and extending perhaps 3 fathoms out from the head of the jetty, and rose at its centre to within 5\u00bd feet of midwater level, as measured by his assisting tender. The tender confirmed this evidence as to the depth of water above the obstruction at this point and produced a record showing that beyond the obstruction, 18 feet out from the jetty, the water depth was 11\u00bd feet. No attempt was ever made to chart, buoy or mark this obstruction in any way.\nIn September, 1934, the suppliant's steam tug, the Ostrea, equipped for wrecking and salvage operations, was working on the wrecks of two steamers some few miles apart in Cow Bay and occasionally came into Port Morien, docking at the new Government wharf there to land some of the material salvaged, though it appeared she took most of it to Louisburg. She came in during the afternoon of September 21st and docked at the new Government wharf behind the new jetty, headed south. There were a large number of fishing boats anchored behind her, which necessitated some manoeuvreing in backing out from the dock early next morning and heading for the bay. The Ostrea, which was a boat of composite construction having a steel frame and wooden shell, was 70 or 80 ft. long with a beam of 18 or 20 ft. and a draft of 4 ft. 3 in. at the stem, gradually increasing to 7 ft. at the stern. According to the evidence of her master (Williams), who was at the wheel with his mate (King) beside him, the tug cleared the end of the new jetty by 5 or 6 ft., but in doing so experienced a little roll and a few bumps, which caused her to list over a bit. He had no knowledge of the existence of the submerged obstruction. The mate remarked that they had struck something and Williams sent him down to the chief engineer to see if there were any leaks or if anything was wrong below. King returned to the bridge and reported to the captain that the engineer had said No. Williams remained at the wheel until he passed a buoy marking the submerged remains of the outer end of the old breakwater, which he said was 30 yards away on the port side when, everything now being clear and the tug headed for the open bay, he gave the wheel to King and went to lie down in his berth. In about 25 minutes King told him he could hardly steer her. Williams jumped up immediately and saw that the boat was down by the bow. The engine was reversed and all hands got into a life-boat and when they had pulled away about 100 yards the steamer went down about 3\u00bd miles out from the jetty.\nThe Ostrea was insured with several marine underwriters and the suppliant thereafter filed a petition in the Exchequer Court on behalf of and for the benefit of these underwriters, who were subrogated to its rights in respect of the said losses, praying that the Crown be condemned to pay the sum of $22,016.50 and such further and other sums as the court might deem meet.\nIn its petition the suppliant alleged that the loss of the steamship with her equipment resulted from the negligence of officers or servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work and that the said negligence consisted in not replacing the top part of the outer end of the jetty nor removing the said under portion and allowing the said under portion to remain and continue up to the time of the collision in a submerged, dangerous and unsafe condition, wholly uncharted, unbuoyed and unmarked and so as to constitute a menace to those lawfully engaged in the navigation of navigable waters. The petition further alleged that the value of the tug and her equipment at the time of their loss was $10,000 and the value of the salvage equipment $9,016.50 and that the suppliant sustained additional loss and damage of $3,000.\nIn its statement of defence the Crown denied that the jetty was built by officers or servants of the Crown, acting within the scope of their duties or employment or otherwise or at all, and that the said under portion was left in a dangerous condition as alleged in the petition. The defence also denied that the tug while rounding the jetty came into collision with the said obstruction and alleged contributory negligence upon the part of the officers and crew of the tug.\nThe petition came on for trial before Mr. Justice Angers at Halifax in June, 1937. His Lordship held that the case was governed by s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act; that the jetty was a public work within the meaning of that section; that the Ostrea struck the submerged under portion of its outer end and that the collision was attributable to the negligence of officers or servants of the Crown, i.e., the district engineer and assistant district engineer, under whose supervision the construction of the jetty and its reparation after the top part of the outer end thereof had been partially washed away were effected, acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work.\nDealing with the contention of the respondent that the Crown was not bound to keep in repair any public work and that it could not be held liable for injuries resulting from the unsafe condition thereof, the learned judge, while assenting to this submission and stating that s. 19 (c) seemed to exclude the case in which the injury was the result of non-repair or non-feasance, added that in some cases non-repair or non-feasance may constitute a hazard or, in other words, create what is called a trap and bring about a condition which renders an accident almost unavoidable. \"This,\" he said, \"is what happened in the present case.\"\nHis Lordship found, however, that after the accident the master of the Ostrea was negligent in not taking the means of ascertaining the extent of the damage caused to the vessel by the collision before proceeding to sea. In this connection he said:\nHad be found that the vessel was leaking, as I think he should have, if he had made a proper inspection of the hull immediately after the impact, he would not or at least should not, assuming he had acted prudently, have proceeded on his voyage but should have brought back his vessel to the wharf. He would thus have avoided the loss of his ship and of her equipment.\nHe therefore held that the damage for which the respondent was liable should be limited to the cost of the repair of the vessel. As unfortunately there was no evidence in the record enabling him to determine this cost, he suggested that if the parties could not agree on the amount they should have liberty to refer the matter to him and to adduce evidence for the purpose of establishing as exactly as possible what the repair of the vessel would have cost.\nThe formal judgment declared that the suppliant was not entitled to the entire relief sought by the petition but that he was entitled to recover the damages to the vessel directly attributable to the collision had such damages been ascertained immediately after the said collision and that the amount thereof be established by reference to the court if the parties could not agree, and that the respondent pay to the suppliant its costs of the action.\nThe evidence of the material facts I have endeavoured to outline is undisputed and I think fully justifies the conclusion of the learned trial judge, not only that the Ostrea struck the submerged and invisible obstruction in turning around the end of the jetty, but that its collision therewith was attributable to such negligence on the part of officers and servants of the Crown, while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work as rendered the Crown responsible therefor under the provisions of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act. It was not a case of mere non-repair or non-feasance, but of the actual creation of a hidden menace to navigation by a Department of the Government through its fully authorized officers and servants in the construction of a public work.\nI am of opinion also that there was sufficient evidence to support the learned trial judge's finding that after the collision there was negligence on the part of the steamboat's officers in not discovering sooner than they did the extent of the damage caused to the vessel's hull in passing over the obstruction and that had they acted promptly and prudently in this regard, the vessel would not have continued its voyage for 3\u00bd miles into the open bay.\nThere can be little doubt that the total loss of the vessel and its equipment would have been avoided had an attempt been made either to return her to the wharf or to beach her at some nearby point. For this reason, though not convinced of the correctness of the statement appearing in His Lordship's reasons that the damage should be limited to the cost of the repair of the vessel, I concur in the terms of the formal judgment in so far as it declares that the suppliant is not entitled to compensation as for a total loss as claimed, but is entitled to recover the damages directly attributable to the collision. I would not, however, restrict the condemnation to damages to the vessel alone and would delete from the order the words \"had such damages been ascertained immediately after the said collision,\" and leave the assessment open generally to such damages as are directly attributable to the collision. It is not at all clear upon the existing evidence that, had the extent of the damage to the steamer's hull been promptly discovered and the master brought her back to the dock or beached her at the nearest possible place, no further loss would have been sustained than the damages to the vessel itself, which were ascertainable immediately after her collision with the submerged obstruction. This phase of the case was not satisfactorily investigated on either side, though one of the witnesses, Waterhouse, supervisor of masters and mates for the Department of Transport at Halifax, did express it as his opinion that if the boat had been run to the nearest shore or returned to the dock she might fill up, but would not have sunk. Many other considerations might well enter into the assessment of the damages, which would have resulted from the collision, had the damaged steamer not proceeded on her voyage and an attempt been made either to manoeuvre her back to the dock or to beach her at the nearest possible place. For instance, assuming that the steamer had been safely brought back to the dock, it would seem to be almost certain that she could not have been prevented from filling up and, though not entirely disappearing, from settling on the bed of the water basin within the L. The consequent flooding of her engine and other machinery and the general depreciation of the steamer by such flooding and settling could scarcely be said not to be directly attributable to the collision, not to speak of the expense of raising and refloating her, or possible damage to the loose wrecking and salvage equipment, most of which, it seems, was kept in the alleged water-tight forward bulkhead. Or, assuming that the steamer had been beached on the nearest available shore, it could scarcely be that such a course would not have entailed considerable additional damage. In either event the owner would be entitled to recover the cost of restoring the vessel to as good a condition as she was in before the collision and if that were impossible to an allowance for such depreciation as may have occurred by reason of her having been completely flooded or further damaged by the attempt made to minimize the loss, and also for any loss proved to have resulted directly from the enforced suspension of its operations during the time required to make the necessary repairs. In this connection I may refer to Dr. Lushington's exposition of the rule applicable in a case where a ship is partially damaged. In \"H.M.S. Inflexible,\" (1)5,\n\"When a ship is partially damaged,\" he said,\nthe principle is clear, restitutio in integrum; the application often difficult. First, then, as to consequential damages, an expression the precise meaning of which has not, to my knowledge, been defined by any authority, nor do I mean to attempt it. In the present case, regard being had to the particular circumstances, restitutio in integrum is the amount of loss sustained, and that amount consists of the expense of repair and a just compensation for the non-employment of the ship whilst under repair; and that just compensation must again consist of the expense of detention and amount of profit lost. Such, I apprehend, are the general principles which a judge at Nisi Prius would lay down for the direction of a jury in a case in which it was their duty to assess the damage.\nOf course in a case such as this, where a steamship has been so damaged by running over a hidden obstruction and rendered so leaky that upon proceeding 3\u00bd miles to sea she suddenly sank and became a total loss, and where the trial judge has found that the original damage was caused by the negligence of the respondent in the creation of the obstruction, but that the steamship's officers were guilty of negligence in proceeding to sea without ascertaining the extent of the damage to her hull, and could have avoided a total loss by returning to the dock, and therefore held that the suppliant was entitled only to the cost of the repairs, which might have been necessary had the steamer in fact returned to the dock, it is difficult to determine with any degree of certainty the condition of her hull immediately after the collision or what the cost of repairing that condition would be. The existence of such difficulty, however, does not relieve the respondent from liability to compensate the ship's owner for such damage as can fairly and reasonably be held to be really attributable to the ship's striking the submerged obstruction. It matters not whether the whole of such damage was ascertainable before or after the master's negligent failure to discover the extent of the injury to the ship's hull, so long as it was suffered as a direct and natural consequence of the collision. The effect of the latter negligence was simply to relieve the Crown of liability for the ship's foundering in the open sea and thus becoming a total loss, which the respondent would otherwise have had to make good. The fact that the ship did founder in the open sea after so short a run from the site of the collision nevertheless shews the serious nature of the injury caused to her, and it seems to me should have a material bearing, not only on the question of the probable cost of repairing her if the master had made an attempt to get her back to the dock or to beach her after the collision and the lapse of a reasonable time in which he might have ascertained the extent of the damage done to her hull, but also upon the question of depreciation, the length of time which would probably be required for necessary repairs and her consequent enforced idleness, and other items of damage, which would probably have followed as the direct and natural consequence of the collision.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs, allow the cross-appeal to the extent of varying the declaration of the formal judgment of the learned trial judge limiting the assessment of damages in the manner stated, and, failing an agreement between the parties, remit the case to the Exchequer Court for their determination on the basis of the suppliant being entitled to all such damages as are directly and naturally attributable to the collision. The suppliant, I think, is in the circumstances entitled to costs on its cross-appeal as well as on the appeal.\nDavis J.\u2014In 1931, the Dominion Government undertook the construction of a jetty, projecting at right angles to the large Dominion Government breakwater at Port Morien in the province of Nova Scotia, for the better protection of numerous small fishing boats which were accustomed to find shelter in the safe anchorage of the bay at that point. There was no harbour at Port Morien except that which was afforded by the breakwater. This jetty or extension to the breakwater was in a location which exposed it to the full force of the Atlantic storms. The proposed jetty was to be about 210 feet long, with a width of 26 feet at the bottom and of 16 to 17 feet at the top, and 12 or 13 feet in height. The method of construction was cribwork made of logs and timber, with stones running in weight as high as 150 and 200 pounds being used as ballast. Before the jetty was completed, about 50 feet of the upper portion of the outward end broke away during a storm on September 9th, 1932. This left the lower portion of the outer cribwork and its rock ballast remaining in position but entirely submerged. The inner portion of the jetty, about 50 feet in length, was not damaged; it withstood the storm because the ballasting of that portion had been completed.\nSome two years later, on September 22nd, 1934, the towboat Ostrea became a total loss at sea; the suppliant claims as a result of having struck the submerged portion of the jetty that had been left undisturbed and without any buoy or other warning to indicate its presence there. The Ostrea was a boat used for salvage operations, some 70 or 80 feet in length and between 18 and 20 feet wide. Her draught was about 7 feet. She was of composite construction\u2014a wooden covering with a steel frame.\nIn this action in the Exchequer Court, on a petition of right to recover for the loss of the ship and its equipment, no negligence was alleged against the Crown prior to the date of the storm and we are therefore not called upon to enquire into the method of construction of the jetty. Mr. Burchell, in his clear and forceful argument on behalf of the Crown, contended that there was no obligation upon the Crown to rebuild the damaged portion of the structure, or to remove the cribwork and ballast that remained submerged, or to place any buoy or other warning sign at the place. It may be that the Crown was under no such obligation, but it is unnecessary to express any opinion on that point. What actually happened was this: At the time of the storm in September, 1932, the appropriation of $3,000 for the work had. become exhausted and the government engineers decided that in any event it was too late in the season to do any further work that year. On July 20th of the next year the district engineer of the Department of Public Works and his assistant visited the site and decided that the submerged portion was not suitable as a foundation for new cribwork, and abandoned it. They decided to saw off the logs that were sticking out at low water and these were cut down to the ballast. The end of the jetty which had not been washed away was squared off and spiled in order to support and strengthen it. The cribwork that had been washed ashore was used to make an L at what had become the end of the jetty. This work was done under the instructions of the district engineer of the department of Public Works. Two thousand dollars appears to have been appropriated in that year, 1933, to do the work that was then undertaken, and it was completed at the end of October, 1933. The jetty then \"looked as if it were a new wharf that had just been built\"; but immediately outside the apparent end of the jetty there remained the submerged cribwork of tangled logs and rocks, wholly invisible and unmarked.\nNo more work appears to have been done up to September 21st, 1934, when the towboat Ostrea arrived at Port Morien and was berthed inside the jetty. She had come to Port Morien as a base for salvage operations on the wreck of the steamer Watford, which had gone ashore on the coast a few miles distant from the harbour, during the same storm that had carried away the outer end of the jetty. In the early morning of September 22nd, 1934, the Ostrea left her berth in good condition to take up her salvage work in Morien Bay. While on her way out, and at a distance of 5 or 6 feet from the apparent outer end of the jetty, the suppliant contends she came into collision with the submerged outer portion of the jetty that had been abandoned and as a result subsequently sank and became a total loss. The trial judge was satisfied that the Ostrea struck the submerged rock or cribwork, and the evidence amply justifies that finding of fact. With the tide conditions at the time of the collision, the submerged cribwork at its highest point was covered with only 5\u00bd feet of water. The collision caused the Ostrea to spring a leak, though that fact did not become at once apparent to those on board. She continued on her way to her salvage work but after proceeding for about twenty-five minutes, a distance of three and a half miles, it became apparent to those on board that she was filling with water. They could do nothing at that time to save her and were obliged to get into the life-boats to save themselves. A few minutes after they left her, the Ostrea with her furnishings and salvage equipment, sank. Subsequently the underwriters had their representative locate the wreck. He took soundings and recommended to the underwriters that owing to the exceptional condition of the coast and the cost necessary to raise the ship, she be written off as a total loss. The underwriters paid the suppliant the sum of $20,010, made up as follows: $8,000 for the hull; $9,016 for the salvage equipment; and $3,000 for the disbursements. The suppliant then submitted a petition of right on behalf of and for the benefit of the group of underwriters who were subrogated to the rights of the suppliant in respect of the loss.\nThe case made against the Crown is that having undertaken and completed the restoration and change in the structure, leaving the impression upon those using the waters at the point that the end of the jetty was as it appeared above water, it was negligence on the part of the officers or servants of the Crown not to have either removed the submerged rocks and cribwork, or, placed a buoy or some warning of their existence and danger; in other words that it was not, as contended by the Crown, a case of nonfeasance but was in fact a case of misfeasance. That was the view of the evidence accepted by the learned trial judge and I think it was right. The Crown undertook the repair and reconstruction of the structure and did it in such a manner as to create a condition dangerous to those using the waters beside it. While in one sense the acts complained of might be regarded as an omission, in substance the result of the acts of those in charge of the work of restoration of the jetty constituted misfeasence.\nThe claim in question was put forward under sec. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., ch. 34, which is as follows:\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(a) * * *\n(b) * * *\n(c) every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nThat the submerged portion of the jetty was part of a public work is really not disputed. The appellant's factum admits that it is obvious \"that the submerged portion of the cribwork would still be of some value as a breakwater to protect the inner harbour, which was the purpose for which the jetty or extension to the L of the breakwater was originally built.\" What is contended for by the Crown is that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction because there could be no duty on the Crown to remove the submerged pile of ballast; consequently no duty on any officers or servants of the Crown to remove it and a fortiori no negligence on the part of officers or servants of the Crown in not removing it. But I agree with the view taken by the learned trial judge on the evidence, that is, that in the restoration and changes made in the jetty, there was negligence on the part of the officers or servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon the public work.\nThe learned trial judge declined to declare the suppliant entitled to relief to the extent of the total loss of the ship and its equipment. He limited the relief to (I now quote from the formal judgment)\nthe damages to the vessel directly attributable to the collision with the obstruction in the vicinity of the pier as alleged, had such damages been escertained immediately after the said collision,\nand directed that the amount of the damages so awarded should be established by a reference if the parties cannot agree. In his written reasons for judgment the learned trial judge on this branch of the case put his conclusion this way:\nI am of opinion, however, that, after the accident, the master of the Ostrea was negligent in not taking the means of ascertaining the extent of the damage caused to his vessel by the collision, before proceeding to sea. Had he found that the vessel was leaking, as I think he should have, if he had made a proper inspection of the hull immediately after the impact, he would not or at least should not, assuming he had acted prudently, have proceeded on his voyage but should have brought back his vessel to the wharf. He would thus have avoided the loss of his ship and of her equipment.\nThe learned judge then proceeds to refer to some of the evidence, and concludes:\nI have no doubt that the extent of the damage caused to the ship by the collision would have been detected if a proper inspection had been made immediately after the collision.\nThe limitation put by the trial judge upon the relief sought is such that it might only amount to a few dollars. If the fact that the ship had sprung a leak in striking this submerged rock or cribwork had been immediately known to the master of the ship and he had at once beached the boat, if this were practicable, the cost of repairing the hull might well have been a small sum. The judgment limits recovery to \"the damages to the vessel\" directly attributable to the collision, \"had such damages been ascertained immediately after the collision.\"\nWith the greatest respect I find myself unable on a review of the evidence to agree with the trial judge's conclusion on this branch of the case. Nothing is easier, in this sort of case, after all the facts and circumstances are known, than to suggest that if something else had been done than that which was done, the consequences might not have been what they were. But that is hindsight. The test is, what should a reasonable man under the circumstances have done? Did he exercise reasonable judgment on the facts as he knew them at the time? Now this little towboat, the Ostrea, equipped for and engaged in salvage work along the Atlantic coast, is not to be thought of in terms of a large passenger steamship running in a regular channel. If a ship of that sort strikes something in the course of its regular route, it immediately arouses anxiety of a grave concern, and the duty of the master is very plain. But this towboat, in the very nature of its operations, was, according to the evidence, constantly bumping up against different obstructions. It was nothing unusual. No one on board seems to have had the slightest fear that what had happened would cause the boat to spring a leak and sink. I quote from the evidence of the master:\nIn crossing the end of that wharf the L was very close but we did not hit, but right past the end of that I struck something in the water; there was a little roll, but it was not bad, not much of a knock, but the mate asked me what I thought was there. The mate was on the bridge alongside of me. He said \"We struck something,\" and I said \"Yes.\" She listed over a bit, there were a few bumps, so I sent the mate down to the engine room to see if the engineer had heard it and to ascertain if any damage was done, if the ship was taking any water; I never thought any more about it.\nAnd on cross-examination:\nQ. Now as to this bump; was it a serious bump?\nA. No. We experience worse than that every day. I did not think it anything out of the way but enough to roll her a bit. The mate testified that he felt a \"bump,\" and I take the following from his cross-examination on this point:\nQ. Did you make any investigation of your own in regard to this bump?\nA. No, sir, I just went by the Captain's orders.\nQ. Was this bump any different to bumps which you experience every day?\nA. No, sir, not to me.\n* * *\nQ. This was not then an extraordinary hard bump or anything of that nature?\nA. No.\nQ. And there was nothing to indicate that it was something serious?\nA. No.\nQ. Or put you on your guard in any way?\nA. No.\nThe engineer, when asked for his version of the accident, stated:\nFor a short time as we were going ahead the boat lurched over to starboard; I thought she rubbed up against the breakwater. She hit some obstruction anyway.\nOn cross-examination:\nQ. Was it unusual to feel a bump of the type you felt that morning?\nA. Yes, it was, while on that boat.\nQ. One of the witnesses said you got bumps like that every day?\nA. I have hit against scows and other things when docking and the bump would be 75 per cent harder than that.\nQ. So that this was not a hard bump?\nA. No, sir, the ship seemed to run on something and listed to starboard.\nQ. Could you tell that it struck forward?\nA. Yes, from her listing and the fact that I felt no bump aft.\nQ. Bumps of this kind happen daily?\nA. But this was not exactly a bump. Maybe in the after end I would not hear the sound like they would, but I remember the vessel running up on something and her listing to starboard.\nIt did not occur to the engineer, apparently, that any investigation should have been made by him at the time to see if the boat was taking water. The master of the ship certainly did not suspect that any appreciable injury was done to his boat, and in sending his mate down to the engine room and ascertaining from him that no damage had apparently been done, he did what, under all the circumstances, can be said to have been all that could be reasonably expected of him. There is no doubt, in the light of what we now know, that it would have been prudent for the master to have caused a more careful examination to be made at the time, but whether his conduct was reasonable or not must be tested by what he knew or suspected at the time. Two experts were called for the Crown and testified as to what they thought the proper thing for the master of the ship to have done but Patterson, who is Superintendent of the Halifax Ship Yards, was a ship builder and as such would know and appreciate the serious effect that even a somewhat light bump might have on a boat of composite construction such as the Ostrea, and Captain Waterhouse, now Supervisor and Examiner of Masters and Mates for the Department of Transport for Eastern Canada, had been a master of large vessels and his experience had been limited to them. A small towboat like the Ostrea, by its very construction and use, is adapted for and subject to a good deal of \"bumping\" in its work of salvage along the coast. The appellant is entitled to a diminution of damages only if it be proved that those in charge of the respondent's vessel were guilty of negligence (as opposed to mere error of judgment) amounting to a novus actus interveniens which caused the extra damage. The Pensher (1)6; The Metagama (2)7; The Genua (3)8. The question is whether the suppliant was guilty of such negligence after the collision as would make that negligence the direct cause of the final damage. There is no conclusive evidence that the Ostrea could have been saved from total destruction even if the leak in her had been discovered immediately after the collision, and it may be that she did not begin to leak until after she had proceeded a short distance on her way. The evidence is that a ship of the construction of the Ostrea would sink much more quickly than an ordinary boat. Capt. Waterhouse, who gave it as his opinion that if soundings had been taken immediately after the collision and the Ostrea found to have been leaking, she should have been run to the nearest shore water or returned to the wharf and put in a position where, if she did fill up, she would not sink, admitted on cross-examination that he had never been in Port Morien; whereas Munroe, a resident of Port Morien, stated that the coast line at Port Morien was rugged and rough all the way along. Counsel for the appellant did not ask before us for the full amount claimed, $20,016, but for $19,666.50 (taking off $350 in view of the evidence as to the value of the provisions, stores, etc., lost).\nI would dismiss the Crown's appeal with costs and would allow the cross-appeal to the extent of $19,666.50, with costs of the action and of the cross-appeal.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the trade mark \"Coca-Cola,\" to be applied to the sale of non-alcoholic beverages and syrup for the preparation thereof, which was registered in Canada, in distinctive script form, in 1905, registration being renewed in 1930, and was further registered in Canada, not in distinctive script but in ordinary typewritten form, in 1932. (In argument in this Court it was sought to support this latter registration by s. 28 (1) (b) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, a position not taken on the pleadings). Defendant claimed to be the owner of the trade mark \"Pepsi-Cola,\" to be applied to the sale of a non-alcoholic beverage, which was registered in Canada, in distinctive script form, in 1906, and renewed in 1931. Plaintiff in 1936 brought action against defendant, claiming infringement of its trade mark by the use of defendant's trade mark. Defendant attacked the validity of plaintiff's trade mark and by counterclaim sought cancellation of the registrations thereof.\nHeld: Plaintiff's action for infringement should be dismissed (judgment of Maclean J., [1938] Ex. C.R. 263, reversed). Defendant's attack against plaintiff's trade mark fails, except that this Court makes no order on defendant's counterclaim in respect of plaintiff's registration in 1932; subject to that, the counterclaim is dismissed.\nPer The Chief Justice and Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ.: Though \"coca\" and \"cola\" is each a descriptive word, it does not follow that a trader cannot join them into a compound which, written in a peculiar, script, constitutes a proper trade mark. (In re Crosfield, [1910] 1 Ch. 130, at 145-6, and other cases, cited). If there ever was any legitimate ground for impeaching the 1905 registration of \"coca-cola,\" there has been such long delay and acquiescence that any doubt must now be resolved in its favour. It would be a matter of grave commercial injustice to cancel the registration which has stood since 1905 and become widely used by plaintiff. As to defendant's contention that one of plaintiff's courses of dealing\u2014selling its syrup to some 80 different bottling concerns throughout Canada who add carbonated water according to standard instructions and then bottle the beverage and sell it as coca-cola to retail dealers\u2014constitutes a public use of the word \"coca-cola\" as the name of a particular beverage and an abandonment of the word as a trade mark for the product of a particular manufacturer:\u2014 There may be some force in that contention, but the evidence at the trial was not developed sufficiently on this branch of the case to show explicitly how these bottling concerns or the retail dealers who purchased from them actually sold the beverage, and if said course of dealing were to be relied upon as an abandonment by plaintiff of its trade mark, the facts should have been plainly established.\nPlaintiff had not established a claim for infringement from defendant's use of the trade mark \"Pepsi-Cola.\" In the general attitude taken by plaintiff, its objection really went to the registration by any other person of the word \"cola\" in any combination, for a soft drink; and if such objection were allowed, then plaintiff would virtually become the possessor of an exclusive proprietary right in relation to the word \"cola\"; and to this it was not entitled. (In this connection it was held that 30 certificates of registration of trade names or trade marks in which the word \"cola\" or \"kola\" in some form was used were admissible as some evidence of the general adoption of the word in names for different beverages or tonics.) It cannot be said by tests of sight and sound that \"Pepsi-Cola\" bears so close a resemblance to \"Coca-Cola\" as to be likely to cause confusion in the trade or among the purchasing public. Each case depends upon its own facts. In the present case further circumstances that might be taken into account were: that \"Pepsi-Cola\" as a registered trade mark in Canada had stood unimpeached since 1906, and the evidence disclosed that pepsin and cola flavour actually formed part of the ingredients of the beverage manufactured and sold by defendant as pepsi-cola; that no application in objection to defendant's corporate name was made by plaintiff following upon defendant's incorporation; that there was no evidence that anyone had been misled, and where a defendant's trade is of some standing the absence of any instance of actual confusion may be considered as some evidence that interference is unnecessary. Under all the circumstances of the case, commercial injustice would follow the injunction sought by plaintiff against defendant's use of the mark \"Pepsi-Cola.\"\nWhile the rules of comparison for testing an alleged infringement of a registered mark resemble those rules by which the question of similarity on an application for registration is tested, it is necessary to establish a closer likeness in order to make out an actual infringement than would justify the refusal of an application to register; the burden on a plaintiff in an infringement action is to show reasonable probability of confusion, while an applicant for registration must establish, if challenged, the absence of all reasonable prospect of confusion.\nCases cited with regard to principles applicable to the use of trade marks included: In re Crosfield, etc., [1910] 1 Ch. 130, at 145-6; the Reddaway case, [1927] A.C. 406, at 413; Hall v. Barrows, 33 L.J. (N.S.)

The question in each case is one of fact (Johnston v. Orr Ewing, 7 App. Cas. 219, 220, cited), and in this case that question must be answered adversely to plaintiff's claim. Defendant's counterclaim against the 1905 registration of \"Coca-Cola\" should be dismissed, but solely on the ground that there is no evidence that would warrant the court declaring that it was not registrable or ordering that the registration be cancelled. In view of s. 28 (1) (b) of said Act (without determining its precise meaning) and of the course that the trial took, neither party should be precluded in a properly framed action from litigating the question whether under s. 28 (1) or otherwise plaintiff could apply for and secure registration of the compound word \"Coca-Cola,\" although the same compound word in script form had already been registered by it as a trade mark; the judgment at trial dismissing the counterclaim's attack against the 1932 registration, should be set aside, and it should be declared that this Court makes no order with respect to it.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J.; President of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, holding that the plaintiff's trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" had been infringed by the use by the defendant of the trade mark \"Pepsi-Cola\" and granting to plaintiff injunctions and other relief, and dismissing defendant's counterclaim for an order that the trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" was not registrable and for cancellation of registrations thereof.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment given in this Court, now reported.\nBy the judgment of this Court, the defendant's appeal was allowed (with regard to plaintiff's claim) and the action dismissed; as to defendant's counterclaim, the plaintiff (respondent) was entitled to succeed except that this Court did not see fit to make any order in respect of the registration of 1932 (discussed in the reasons for judgment); subject to that, the counterclaim was dismissed; appellant (defendant) to have its costs of the appeal and the action, and respondent (plaintiff) its costs of the counterclaim.\nW. D. Herridge K.C., J. J. Creelman K.C., and J. C. Osborne for the appellant.\nR. S. Smart K.C. and A. W. Langmuir K.C. for the respondent.\n(J. L. Ralston K.C., by special leave, spoke on behalf of certain clients, not parties to the action, with regard to certain observations in the reasons for judgment at trial).\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014Both parties to this trade mark litigation, which was commenced in the Exchequer Court of Canada, manufacture and sell in Canada in competition with each other a low priced (five cents) non-alcoholic beverage. The plaintiff (respondent) uses as a trade mark the compound word \"Coca-Cola\" and the defendant (appellant) uses as a trade mark the word \"Pepsi-Cola.\" Both parties are limited companies incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act; the plaintiff on September 29th, 1923, with the corporate name \"The Coca-Cola Company of Canada Limited,\" and the defendant on May 29th, 1934, with the corporate name \"Pepsi-Cola Company of Canada Limited.\" Neither party has disclosed the formula from which its product is made. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant on May 30th, 1936, alleging that it was the duly recorded owner of the registered trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" for non-alcoholic, soft drink beverages and syrup for the preparation thereof and that the said trade mark had been registered in the Canadian Patent Office on November 11th, 1905, and renewed on April 15th, 1930. A further registration on September 29th, 1932, to which special reference will have to be made later, was also set up. The plaintiff then alleged that the defendant was adopting and using the designation \"Pepsi-Cola\" with its beverage, which it alleged \"was and always has been so arbitrarily similar in colour and appearance to plaintiff's 'Coca-Cola' as to be virtually indistinguishable therefrom by the purchasing public,\" and that the corporate name of the defendant was \"confusingly similar to\" the corporate name and trade mark of the plaintiff, and that it was obviously done with the object that the defendant in competition with the plaintiff would benefit by the good will which had been built up by the plaintiff and its predecessors in title; and that the designation \"Pepsi-Cola\" whenever applied to that beverage was \"in script form closely and confusingly similar to the distinctive script form in which the trade mark 'Coca-Cola' had been used by the plaintiff and its predecessors in title. \"The plaintiff alleged that all acts aforesaid of the defendant had been knowingly done in contravention of the provisions and prohibitions of The Unfair Competition Act (22-23 Geo. V, (1932) ch. 38) \"and by way of infringement of the plaintiff's trade mark 'Coca-Cola'.\" The plaintiff claimed the usual relief in an infringement action.\nThe defendant in its defence admitted that the plaintiff was \"registered as the proprietor of the registered trade mark 'Coca-Cola',\" but denied that the registrations were in force or effect. The defendant alleged that the registration of November 11th, 1905, had been abandoned, or, in the alternative, that the registration of September 29th, 1932, is not distinguishable from the first registration, or if distinguishable, at no time has there been user or intended user of the last registered trade mark. The defendant alleged that it was the owner (by assignment) of a trade mark \"Pepsi-Cola,\" to be applied to the sale of a non-alcoholic beverage, which was registered in Canada on November 30th, 1906, and that the same is in full force and effect, and that its predecessors in title had carried on in the United States for many years prior to the incorporation of the defendant an extensive business, and in Canada for a short period of years, a limited business in the manufacture and sale of soft drink beverages and syrups used in the preparation thereof under the trade mark \"Pepsi-Cola\" used in the distinctive form set out in the certificate of registration thereof, and that the defendant had upon its incorporation commenced and had since continued the manufacture and sale of its soft beverages, and the syrups used in the preparation thereof, and distributed the same under the said trade mark \"Pepsi-Cola.\" After setting up the usual defence pleadings in an infringement action, the defendant specifically attacked the validity of the registration in 1905 of \"Coca-Cola\" upon the ground that the words \"were descriptive and not properly registrable as a valid trade mark\" and by way of counterclaim the defendant sought cancellation of the registrations of the said mark relied upon by the plaintiff.\nIt is plain then that this is not a passing off action but an infringement action upon a registered trade mark, the validity of which is directly put in issue.\nWhen the action came on for trial, counsel for the plaintiff merely filed the certificates of the registration of \"Coca-Cola\" of November 11th, 1905, and of September 29th, 1932; read into the record a few questions and answers from the examination for discovery of the Manager of the defendant company; and filed as exhibits a sample bottle of Pepsi-Cola and photographs showing the markings on cases in which the defendant shipped its beverage in bottles. No evidence was tendered in support of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the statement of claim (all of which had been denied by the statement of defence) which had alleged long years of manufacture and sale, the expenditure of large sums in advertising, the extent of the plaintiff's business in Canada, and the acquisition by the plaintiff of all of the business and good will in and throughout Canada in connection with which the trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" had been used by the plaintiff's predecessors in title including the trade mark \"Coca-Cola.\"\nCounsel for the defendant moved for a non-suit, upon the ground that there was no proof that the plaintiff had acquired the good will or was the assignee of the original proprietor of the trade mark \"Coca-Cola.\" The motion was reserved by the learned trial judge and the defence then called only one witness, Guth, the General Manager of the American Pepsi-Cola Company, which, he said, owns all the capital stock of the defendant company; filed the examination for discovery of the Secretary-Treasurer of the plaintiff, the certificate of registration of Pepsi-Cola of November 30th, 1906, and an assignment, a certificate of the registration of the design of the bottle in which Coca-Cola is marketed, and, subject to objection, 30 certificates of registration of trade marks which contain the word \"cola\" or \"kola\" or some similar word. The plaintiff gave no evidence in reply.\nEach party attacked the title of the other to its trade mark and if the evidence were to be closely examined it may be that neither party has strictly established its own right to the trade mark it claims. The evidence on both sides is at least not satisfactory. In the case of \"Coca-Cola\" the application in 1905 was filed by a United States company, the Coca-Cola Company of Georgia. A notation attached to the certified copy of the registration states that the mark was assigned in 1922 by the Georgia company to a Delaware company. A further notation appears on the registration that \"a document purporting to be an assignment\" of the trade mark between the Delaware company and the plaintiff had been registered. But there was no proof of the assignments. Counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the pleadings and sec. 18 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, but the admission in the statement of defence is only \"that the plaintiff is registered as the proprietor of\" the trade mark \"Coca-Cola\", \"as set out in paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim.\" The defendant is in an even less favourable position on the question of title. The word \"Pepsi-Cola\" had been registered on November 30th, 1906, by a North Carolina company and it does not appear by whom its renewal on November 30th, 1931, was obtained. The defendant did not become incorporated until May 29th, 1934, and it is admitted that it did not succeed to the business of any other company in Canada, though it produced to the Trade Mark Office and caused to be recorded what purported to be an assignment, dated May 11th, 1936, made by a United States company which was described as a Delaware corporation and \"successor\" to the North Carolina company. There is no proof of any assignment or succession between the North Carolina company and the Delaware company. It may be on a strict view of the evidence that neither party has proved a legal right to the trade mark it claims. But we prefer to deal with the appeal from a broader point of view having regard to the substantial and important questions raised and the exhaustive and helpful arguments submitted to us by counsel for both parties. For that purpose we shall assume the title of each party is established until it becomes necessary, if it does, to determine that question.\nIt may be convenient at this point to refer to the plaintiff's registration of \"Coca-Cola\" of September 29th, 1932. This new registration (application for which was filed August 11th, 1932) was a specific trade mark\nto be applied to the sale of beverages and syrups to be used in the manufacture of such beverages, and which consists of the compound word: \"Coca-Cola,\" in any and every form or kind or representation; as per the annexed pattern and application.\nThe application made by the plaintiff stated that \"we verily believe\" the specific trade mark\nis ours on account of our having acquired the same from the Coca-Cola Company, a corporation of the State of Delaware, United States of America, which last mentioned company in its turn acquired the same from the Coca-Cola Company, a corporation of the State of Georgia,. United States of America,\nand\nWe hereby declare that the said specific trade mark was not in use to our knowledge by any other person than ourselves at the time of our adoption thereof.\nThe application continued:\nThe said specific trade mark consists of the compound word \"Coca-Cola\" in any and every form or kind of representation. A drawing of the said specific trade mark is hereunto annexed.\nIn the earlier registration of the same words in 1905, the words were written in a very distinctive script and it is in that form that the mark has actually been used by the plaintiff. We find it a little difficult to understand the purpose or effect of this registration, though obviously it was with a view to obtaining some advantage under The Unfair Competition Act which was passed by the Dominion Parliament on May 13th, 1932, and came into force on September 1st, 1932, which statute, by sec. 61, repealed the provisions of the Trade Mark and Design Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 201, in so far as trade marks are concerned. The application was not based upon the words having acquired any secondary meaning and no such claim is made in this action in respect of the registration.\nIt was almost unbelievable that the 1932 registration consists merely of the words Coca-Cola in ordinary typewritten form, as shown on the certified copy filed. We have examined the original document, in the Registrar's Office and, as we might have expected, the certified copy before the Court is exactly the same as the original document\u2014a foolscap sheet of plain paper with nothing on it but the compound word Coca-Cola typewritten in the centre of the page. The application refers to this as \"a drawing\" and the certificate of registration refers to it as the \"annexed pattern.\" Registration was granted for the use of the compound word \"in any and every form or kind or representation.\" The words are the same hyphenated words that appear in the original registration of 1905 in the well known characteristic script. During the opening of the case the learned trial judge said to Mr. Smart, counsel for the plaintiff:\nThe whole question is, you say, as to whether the words Pepsi-Cola infringe Coca-Cola?\nMr. Smart: Yes, in the way it is written. The \"Coca-Cola\" is, as your Lordship may have seen, always displayed in characteristic form. The first letter has a scroll extending below the first word, and the second word has a scroll extending above.\nWhen Mr. Smart was filing proof of the 1932 registration, he said:\n* * * it consists of a compound word \"Coca-Cola\" again, but it is not shown in the characteristic form. This is a word-mark in itself.\nHis Lordship: Why was it renewed,\u2014does the statute require it?\nMr. Smart: It is the second registration. That was just before The Unfair Competition Act was passed, dividing trade marks into word marks and design marks. And, as the original registration showed not only the word but a special form, it was presumably thought that some additional protection would be obtained by registering it without showing the particular form. As a matter of fact, that drops out of sight now, in view of The Unfair Competition Act, which provided that marks registered before that Act, under the Trade Mark and Design Act, should be treated, if they were in distinctive form, as a word mark for the word and a design mark for the design. So that by reason of The Unfair Competition Act, the first registration is the equivalent of two registrations, one on the word \"Coca-Cola,\" and one on the special and distinctive and characteristic form of that word.\nThe only evidence touching this registration is that of the Secretary-Treasurer of the plaintiff on his examination for discovery:\nQ. Do you make any distinction in point of use between these two registered trade marks?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. Do you know whether or not there is any distinction made in the use of these two trade marks?\nA. Not to my knowledge, no.\nQ. You use them indifferently for the same purpose?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you use the trade mark Coca-Cola in any form but the script form?\nA. Yes.\nQ. In what other form do you use it?\nA. It is typed out and may be in block letters.\nQ. How do you use it in relation to the product in a form other than the script form?\nA. We generally use it in script form in our advertising.\nQ. But sometimes you use it in block letter form?\nA. Not in our advertising. In our advertising it is used in script form.\nQ. Then how is it used in block letter form?\nA. In the typing of a letter, for instance.\nQ. Is that all?\nA. It may appear in block letters in, for instance, a newspaper. Anyone writing the word Coca-Cola in a newspaper article might do that.\nQ. But apart from the user of it in block letters where it is not convenient to use it in script, you do not use it in any other way?\nA. That is not exactly correct.\nQ. Will you state just how you do use it?\nA. In a pamphlet, for instance, where you are using a certain form of type, particularly where the lettering is small, it is difficult to make the Coca-Cola trade mark small in distinctive script.\nAll that the trial judge says about this registration is:\nIn 1932, the plaintiff also registered the mark \"Coca-Cola,\" for the same use, \"in any and every form or kind or representation,\" but that registration may here be disregarded.\nBut the registration was specifically pleaded in the statement of claim and its validity specifically denied in the statement of defence and the counterclaim asked for its cancellation. The plaintiff in its supplemental factum takes the position that the registration may be superfluous under the old Act but seeks to support it under sec. 28 (1) (b) of the new Act, a position which was not taken on the pleadings. In the circumstances we do not think it advisable to make any order on the counterclaim in respect of the 1932 registration. But that registration does show that the plaintiff was plainly asserting a claim to the use of the words themselves in any shape or form.\nThe defendant's main attack was against the 1905 registration of Coca-Cola upon the ground that the two words were common English words of merely descriptive character and were not distinctive. It was said that \"cola\" (kola) is a word with a very common meaning, being a genus of trees native to western tropical Africa which had been introduced into the West Indies and Brazil, whose seed, called cola-nut or cola-seed, about the size of a chestnut, brownish and bitter, is largely used for chewing as a condiment and digestive and the extract used as a tonic drink, and that the available literature, much of which we were referred to, shows that the word \"cola\" was well known and in the widest use to describe beverages containing cola extract long before the registration in 1905 of the mark \"Coca-Cola\"; further, that coca is a common word describing a South American shrub from the leaves of which cocaine, among other substances, is obtained and that the use by the natives of its leaves for their supposed stimulating properties had long been known. It was contended that long before 1887 extracts from coca leaves and from cola nuts had found a place in the pharmacopoeia. We were referred to the case of Nashville Syrup Co. v. Coca Cola Co. (1), where it is stated at p. 528 that\nIn 1887 Pemberton, an Atlanta (Georgia) druggist, registered in the Patent Office a label for what he called \"Coca Cola Syrup and Extract.\"\nThe Coca Cola Company, in the Nashville case2, was organized as a corporation in 1892 and acquired Pemberton's formula and label, according to the report of that case.\nIn United States v. Coca Cola Company of Atlanta3, the Food and Drugs authorities of the United States filed a libel against the Coca Cola Company (Georgia) charging that its beverage was adulterated and misbranded. The Coca Cola Company denied the charge of misbranding and averred that its product contained \"certain elements or substances derived from coca leaves and cola nuts.\" Mr. Justice Hughes (the present Chief Justice of the United States) in his opinion at p. 289 said:\nIn the present case we are of opinion that it could not be said as matter of law that the name was not primarily descriptive of a compound with coca and cola ingredients, as charged. Nor is there basis for the conclusion that the designation had attained a secondary meaning as the name of a compound from which either coca or cola ingredients were known to be absent; the claimant has always insisted, and now insists, that its product contains both.\nAnd at p. 288:\nNor would it be controlling that at the time of the adoption of the name the coca plant was known only to foreigners and scientists, for if the name had appropriate reference to that plant and to substances derived therefrom, its use would primarily be taken in that sense by those who did know or who took pains to inform themselves of its meaning. Mere ignorance on the part of others as to the nature of the composition would not change the descriptive character of the designation.\nIt is not without its own significance that there is no evidence in the case now before us that an extract or ingredient from either cola nuts or coca leaves forms any part of the formula from which the plaintiff's beverage is made. We doubt if the public who buy and consume the beverage ever think in terms of either coca leaves or cola nuts. We should think it not unreasonable to presume that the ordinary consumer thinks of \"coca\" as a mere corruption of the word \"cocoa\" or \"cacao\" and might not unreasonably expect that the beverage contained something of the product we all know as cocoa. Mr. Herridge made a powerful attack upon the registration of the words \"coca\" and \"cola\" as the basis of an exclusive trade mark for a beverage. No doubt each of the words is a descriptive word but we are not prepared to say that a trader cannot join the words into a compound which, written in a peculiar script, constitutes a proper trade mark.\nIn In re Joseph Crosfield & Sons Ltd. and other cases4 (an application case), Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton said, at pp. 145 and 146:\nMuch of the argument before us on the part of the opponents and the Board of Trade was based on an assumption that there is a natural and innate antagonism between distinctive and descriptive as applied to words, and that if you can shew that a word is descriptive you have proved that it cannot be distinctive. To my mind this is a fallacy. Descriptive names may be distinctive and vice versa. * * * There is therefore no natural or necessary incompatibility between distinctiveness and descriptiveness in the case of words used as trade marks. The notion that there is such an incompatibility is confined to lawyers, and is, in my opinion, due to the influence of the earlier Trade Marks Acts.\nThese observations were referred to with approval by Lord Maugham (then Maugham, L.J.) in Bale and Church Ld. v Sutton Parsons & Sutton and Astrah Products5 and by Lord Wright in the \"Sheen\" case, In re J. & P. Coats, Ld.6.\nViscount Dunedin in the Reddaway case7 said:\n* * * it seems to me that to settle whether a trade mark is distinctive or not * * * is a practical question, and a question that can only be settled by considering the whole of the circumstances of the case.\nThe compound word \"Coca-Cola\" was registered in Canada as early as 1905 and has been used by the plaintiff as its trade name and trade mark in connection with the sale of its beverage (whatever its ingredients may be), and the defendant's claim to have the registration of 1905 declared invalid and cancelled was not made until 1936. If there ever was any legitimate ground for impeaching the 1905 registration of Coca-Cola, there has been such long delay and acquiescence that any doubt must now be resolved in its favour. It would be a matter of grave commercial injustice to cancel the registration that has stood since 1905 and which admittedly has become widely used by the plaintiff.\nThe evidence is that the plaintiff manufactures the syrup and from it the beverage is made by adding carbonated water in some proportions not disclosed. In some cases the plaintiff itself adds the carbonated water and bottles and sells direct to the retailers; it has some 20 bottling plants of its own. In other cases the plaintiff sells the syrup to jobbers who in turn sell it to soda fountain owners who in turn add the carbonated water to it, before selling to the consumer. But it is also shown that the plaintiff sells the syrup to some 80 different bottling concerns throughout Canada who add carbonated water according to standard instructions and then bottle and sell the beverage to retail dealers. The evidence of Duncan, secretary-treasurer of the plaintiff, was this:\nQ. Do these independent bottling plants bottle Coca-Cola alone or do they bottle other beverages as well?\nA. Practically all of them bottle other products as well.\nQ. What would be the nature of those products?\nA. A general line of sodas.\nThere can be no doubt upon the evidence that the plaintiff's beverage is merchandized in Canada to a large extent through these independent bottling concerns. What is said against the plaintiff is that this method of doing business\u2014selling its product in syrup to some 80 different concerns throughout Canada who in turn add a certain quantity of carbonated water to it in accordance with standard instructions and then sell the bottled drink to the public as Coca-Cola\u2014constitutes a public use of the word Coca-Cola as the name of a particular beverage and an abandonment of the word as a trade mark for the product of a particular manufacturer. There may be some force in that contention but the evidence at the trial was not developed sufficiently on this branch of the case to show explicitly how these bottling concerns, or the retail dealers who purchased from them, actually sold the beverage. It would seem to be a fair inference from the evidence that it was sold under the name Coca-Cola but if the plaintiff's course of dealing with the syrup and the sales to the public of the beverage made from the syrup were to be relied upon as an abandonment by the plaintiff of its trade mark, the facts should have been plainly established.\nThe defendant's counterclaim for cancellation of the registration of Coca-Cola must fail.\nWe now come to the attack against Pepsi-Cola. The question is whether or not the names are so similar and confusing as likely to mislead the consuming public. It is not a passing off action; and there is no evidence that anyone has been misled. Where a defendant's trade is of some standing, the absence of any instance of actual confusion may be considered as some evidence that interference is unnecessary. What is said is that the designation \"Pepsi-Cola\" is \"confusingly similar to\" the trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" and that its use by the defendant constitutes an infringement of the plaintiff's trade mark. Lord Westbury said in Hall v. Barrows8:\n* * * the property in a trade mark consists in the exclusive right to the use of that mark as applied to some particular manufacture. Nor is it correct to say that the right to relief is founded on the fraud of the defendant, as appears from the case of Millington v. Fox9, already referred to. Imposition on the public is indeed necessary for the plaintiff's title, but in this way only, that it is the test of the invasion by the defendant of the plaintiff's right of property; for there is no injury done to the plaintiff if the mark used by the defendant be not such as may be mistaken, or is likely to be mistaken, by the public for the mark of the plaintiff. But the true ground of the Court's jurisdiction is property.\nEach case depends upon its own facts. We were referred to a great many authorities and while they contain statements of much value on general principles, they all deal with the particular facts of the particular cases. The actual decisions in cases of words of such similarity as \"Kleenoff\" and \"Kleenup\"10, \"Coalite\" and \"Ucolite\"11, \"Ustikon\" and \"Justickon\"12, \"Harvino\" and \"Vyno\" or \"Vino\"13, do not assist us in this particular case. While the Payton case in the House of Lords14 was an action to restrain passing off, the words of Lord Macnaghten (at p. 634) may well be recalled:\nNow, when a person comes forward to restrain a colourable imitation of this sort in a case like this, and when he cannot prove that the defendants have tried to steal his trade, he has to make out beyond all question that the goods are so got up as to be calculated to deceive. The principle is perfectly clear\u2014no man is entitled to sell his goods as the goods of another person. The difficulty lies in the application, and when it is a case of colourable imitation I think it is very desirable to bear in mind what Lord Cranworth said on one occasion\u2014that no general rule can be laid down as to what is a colourable imitation or not. You must deal with each case as it arises and have regard to the circumstances of the particular case.\nLord Parker, then Parker, J., said in another application case, the Pianotist case15: You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there will be a confusion\u2014that is to say, not necessarily that one man will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a confusion in the mind of the public which will lead to confusion in the goods\u2014then you may refuse the registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in that case.\nThe authorities are plain, we think, that the rules of comparison for testing an alleged infringement of a registered mark resemble those rules by which the question of similarity on an application for registration is tested but that it is necessary to establish a closer likeness in order to make out an actual infringement than would justify the refusal of an application to register. The burden on a plaintiff in an infringement action is to show reasonable probability of confusion, while an applicant for registration must establish, if challenged, the absence of all reasonable prospect of confusion.\nWhat is protected by law is the whole mark as registered but a part of a mark may be so taken and used as to amount to a substantial taking of the whole. The only similarity between the two compound words here in question lies in the inclusion of the word \"cola\" in both marks. The plaintiff does not, and of course could not, claim any proprietary right in the word \"cola\" standing alone. None the less it is plain that the objection of the plaintiff really goes to the registration by any other person of the word \"cola\" in any combination, for a soft drink. If such objection is allowed, then the plaintiff virtually becomes the possessor of an exclusive proprietary right in relation to the word \"cola.\"The general attitude of the plaintiff finds expression in the evidence of Duncan, the secretary-treasurer of the plaintiff, whose connection with the parent company goes back to 1920, when he said in answer to a question on this examination for discovery: \"But cola to me means coca-cola.\" The defendant's factum set out a list of actions pending in the Exchequer Court at the present time brought by the plaintiff against other parties for using the word \"cola\" in connection with their beverages. Suit No. 17042 vs. E. Denis, to restrain the use of the mark \"Denis cola.\"\nSuit No. 17057 vs. Eskimo Bottling Works, to restrain the use of the marks \"Eskimo cola\" and \"Texacola.\"\nSuit No. 17048 vs. Frisco Soda Water Co. Ltd., to restrain the use of the mark \"Sunshine cola.\nSuit No. 17036 vs. Girouard Ltd., to restrain the use of the mark \"Hero-Cola.\"\nSuit No. 17056 vs. Canadian Aerated Waters, Ltd., to restrain the use of the mark \"Soda-Kola.\"\nNo objection was taken to this statement. The thirty Canadian registrations of trade names or trade marks in which the word \"cola\" in some form was used were in our opinion admissible as some evidence of the general adoption of the word in names for different beverages or tonics:\nDate of Registration\nTrade Mark\nProduct\nPage number in Record\nJune 11, 1896\nBromo-Kola\nMedicine\n78\nApril 7, 1898\nClarke's Kola Compound for Asthma\nMedicine\n80\nMar. 11, 1901\nLaxakola\nTonic Beverage\n82\nNov. 22, 1902\nKola Tonic Wine\nTonic Beverage\n85\nNov. 11, 1905\nCoca-Cola\nBeverage\n87\nJune 28, 1906\nNoxie-Kola\nTonic Beverage\n91\nOct. 3, 1906\nTona-Cola\nTonic Beverage\n92\nNov. 30, 1906\nPepsi-Cola\nBeverage\n95\nApril 9, 1907\nLa-Kola\nBeverage\n98\nApril 25, 1907\nCola-Claret\nBeverage\n100\nFeb. 17, 1910\nKola-Cardinette\nMedicine\n102\nJuly 23, 1912\nCocktail Kola\nTonic Beverage\n104\nOct. 18, 1915\nMint-Kola\nBeverage\n107\nOct. 29, 1915\nKel-Ola\nBeverage\n108\nApril 20, 1918\nKelo\nTonic Beverage\n111\nNov. 21, 1919\nKuna Kola\nBeverage\n113\nJuly 11, 1921\nKola Astier\nMedicine\n115\nSept. 1, 1922\nRose Cola\nBeverage\n117\nNov. 2, 1922\nOrange Kola\nBeverage\n119\nNov. 17, 1922\nO'Keefe's Cola\nBeverage\n121\nAug. 31, 1925\nSmith's O'Kola\nBeverage\n123\nFeb. 19, 1926\nFruta-Kola\nBeverage\n124\nMar. 9, 1926\nKola-Fiz\nBeverage\n127\nJune 17, 1927\nKetra-Kola\nBeverage\n128\nOct. 15, 1927\nRoyal Cola\nBeverage\n130\nJune 25, 1928\nKali Kola\nBeverage\n132\nJuly 3, 1930\nCelery-Kola\nBeverage\n137\nAug. 27, 1930\nMexicola\nBeverage\n139\nOct. 27, 1930\nKlair-Kola\nBeverage\n140\nNov. 20, 1930\nOxola\nBeverage\n142\nJuly 7, 1934\nKolade\nMedicine\n146\nOct. 15, 1936\nVita-Kola\nBeverage\n148 It will be observed that Coca-Cola is the fifth and Pepsi-Cola the eighth in the given list of registrations.\nThe United States case of The Coca-Cola Company v. The Koke Company of America et al.16 was relied upon by the respondent. In that case the Supreme Court of the United States granted an injunction but both courts below had agreed that, subject to one question in respect of which a writ of certiorari was granted by the Supreme Court, the plaintiff had on the facts a right to equitable relief. It had been found that the defendant's mixture was made and sold \"as and for the plaintiff's goods.\" Mr. Justice Holmes, who wrote the judgment in the Supreme Court, referred to the defendant's conduct there as \"a palpable fraud\" Nothing of that sort is proved or seriously suggested in the case before us. The question which the Supreme Court of the United States considered was whether the plaintiff had there been guilty itself of such representations to the public of its own beverage as would disentitle it to equitable relief.\nThe plaintiff obviously seeks to eliminate the word \"Pepsi-Cola\" from the trade, in whatever form it is written. This is plain from its demand that even the use of the corporate name of the defendant be restrained. The real basis of the plaintiff's claim is not against the style of script lettering in which the Pepsi-Cola mark as registered or used by the defendant is written; the basis of the claim is the use of the compound word in any form, obviously because it contains the word \"cola.\" The registration of September, 1932, as we have seen, is not in script but in ordinary type and its use is claimed \"in any and every form or kind of representation.\" In the \"Peps\" and \"Pan-Pep\" case17, Eve J. pointed out that\nOne must be careful in determining the issue that the claim put forward by the owners of the mark shall not develop into a claim calculated greatly to restrict the use in the particular business of an affix or a prefix extremely common in the trade.\nHere the plaintiff is really attempting to secure a monopoly in the word \"cola.\"\nBoth companies were incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act. Under sec. 7 a proposed corporate name shall not be a name liable to be confounded with the name of any other company, and sec. 23 provides for a change of corporate name if it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that the name of a company is so similar to the name of an existing company \"as to be liable to be confounded therewith.\" The Companies Act, R.S.C., 1927, chap. 27, secs. 7 (a) and 23, as amended by 20-21 Geo. V (1930), chap. 9, secs. 4 and 10. No such application appears to have been made by the plaintiff following upon the incorporation of the defendant. It is one of the circumstances that may be taken into account.\nWe cannot say by tests of sight and sound that the compound word \"Pepsi-Cola\" bears so close a resemblance to \"Coca-Cola\" as to be likely to cause confusion in the trade or among the purchasing public. The difference between the two compound words is apparent. If the sound test is applied, the difference is sharply accentuated; if the sight test is applied, the first word \"Pepsi,\" written in any form, at once distinguishes the compound words. The general impression on the mind of the ordinary person, we think, made by sight and sound of the two marks would be one of contrast, rather than of similarity. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that \"Pepsi-Cola\" as a registered trade mark in Canada has stood unimpeached since 1906 and that the evidence in the case discloses that pepsin and cola flavour actually form part of the ingredients of the beverage manufactured and sold by the defendant as Pepsi-Cola. To refer again to certain language of Eve J. in the \"Peps\" case18:\n* * * I feel satisfied that, if confusion had in fact arisen, or, if in fact there had been reason to believe that confusion was likely to arise in the near future, it would not have been impossible to produce evidence of some retailer of the circumstances in which confusion had either been created or was apprehended.\nWhile this is not decisive of the matter, it is of considerable weight.\nConsidering all the circumstances of the case, the same commercial injustice which we spoke of in connection with the defendant's attempt to cancel the registration of \"Coca-Cola\" would follow, though perhaps to a lesser extent, the injunction sought by the plaintiff against the use of the mark \"Pepsi-Cola\" by the defendant. We are satisfied the plaintiff has not established its claim for infringement.\nThe learned trial judge, the President of the Exchequer Court, found infringement and gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff, restraining the defendant not only from selling or distributing its beverage in association with the compound word \"Pepsi-Cola\" but also from using the word \"Pepsi-Cola\" in or as part of its corporate name, ordering the delivery up of all labels, advertising matter, price lists and other material in the possession or under the control of the defendant which bear the compound word \"Pepsi-Cola,\" and awarding such damages as may be ascertained on a reference. The counterclaim was dismissed. It is plain from the reasons for judgment of the learned Judge that he concluded that there was a system of deception and fraud practised by the defendant against the plaintiff and that his view of the whole case was much influenced by certain findings of fraud and deception that had been made in a judgment in an American case (Delaware) introduced into the evidence of the present case and referred to by the learned Judge in his reasons for judgment. Neither of the parties to this action was a party in the foreign action and it is sufficient to say, with the greatest respect, that the findings of fact in that case have nothing whatever to do with this case and were clearly inadmissible.\nAt the opening of the appeal we heard Mr. Ralston, by special leave, who said he represented several other \"Cola\" companies who feared their rights might be prejudicially affected by certain rather extended observations in the trial judgment to which he called our attention, relating to the number of other registrations and the use of trade names containing the word \"cola\" in some form. It is only necessary for us to say that our judgment is solely concerned with the rights of the parties to this litigation and nothing in this case can alter or prejudicially affect the rights of other parties.\nWe would allow the appeal with costs. Both the action and the counterclaim should be dismissed with costs, except that there shall be no order under the counterclaim in respect of the 1932 registration. Kerwin J.\u2014The defendant, Pepsi-Cola Company of Canada, Limited, appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer Court whereby, at the instance of the plaintiff-respondent (The Coca-Cola Company of Canada, Limited), the appellant, its servants, agents and workmen were perpetually restrained\nfrom selling or distributing any beverage not of the plaintiff's manufacture in association with the compound word \"Pepsi-Cola\" or any other word or words so similar to the plaintiff's trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" as to be calculated to cause confusion between the defendant's beverage and that the plaintiff.\nThe judgment perpetually restrained the appellant\nfrom using the compound word \"Pepsi-Cola\" in or as part of its corporate name, or any word or words therein so similar to the plaintiff's trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" as to be calculated to cause confusion between the plaintiff and the defendant;\nand also perpetually restrained the appellant, its servants, agents and workmen\nfrom distributing any beverage not of the plaintiff's manufacture in association with any word or words in script form of a kind calculated to cause confusion between the defendant's beverage and that of the plaintiff.\nThe judgment contained an order for the delivery up by the appellant to the respondent of all labels, advertising matter, etc.; directed a reference to determine the damages suffered by the respondent by reason of the infringement complained of in the statement of claim or alternatively as the plaintiff might elect to take an account of profits; and dismissed the appellant's counterclaim for an order that the trade mark \"Coca-Cola\" was not registrable and for the cancellation of the registrations of the respondent.\nAt the trial the respondent filed a certificate of registration of trade mark dated November 11th, 1905, a certificate of another trade mark registered September 29th, 1932, a sample bottle of Pepsi-Cola, two photographs showing markings on cases of Pepsi-Cola, and a sample bottle of Coca-Cola. In addition to filing these exhibits, the respondent read certain questions and answers from the examination for discovery of Donald S. Hawkes, General Manager of the appellant company, which merely showed that the deponent and some of his predecessors in the position occupied by him had been at various times connected with the respondent company and with some other company which may be referred to as the Coca-Cola Company. There is also a statement that the appellant company did not take over the Canadian business of any other company, to the deponent's knowledge, but in the view I take of the matter, the effect of that answer need not be considered. The respondent then rested its case and after a motion for non-suit had been refused, certain evidence was led and certain exhibits filed on behalf of the appellant. It appears that the appellant registered the name \"Pepsi-Cola,\" in the form shown in its application, as a trade mark to be applied to the sale of beverages and particularly to a non-alcoholic beverage on November 30th, 1906.\nWhatever may have been proved in other actions brought by the respondent or its parent company against other individuals or companies cannot, of course, be considered, and it is unnecessary, in my opinion, to define the precise effect of section 18 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, chapter 38. The respondent undoubtedly appears to be the owner of the trade mark and the word mark \"Coca-Cola,\" and by section 3 of the Act the appellant is prohibited from knowingly adopting for use in Canada in connection with beverages and syrup for the manufacture of such beverages the respondent's trade mark or any distinguishing guise which is similar to it. By section 2 (k):\u2014\n\"Similar,\" in relation to trade marks, trade names or distinguishing guises, describes marks, names or guises so resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other that the contemporaneous use of both in the same area in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to cause dealers in and\/or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced, or for their place of origin;\nIn the present case the only admissible relevant evidence consists of the two names, the forms in which they respectively appear and the fact that they are used in the same areas in Canada in connection with similar wares, i.e., \"soft\" drinks. Facsimiles of the respective trade marks are reproduced in the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court19. A comparison of the two hyphenated words, their appearance in script, and their sound as pronounced and as likely to be pronounced by dealers and users of the wares of the parties do not indicate that they so resemble each other or so clearly suggest the idea conveyed by each other that they fall within the definition of section 2 (k).\nNumerous judgments were cited at bar to show that in other cases certain words or expressions were calculated to cause the goods of one party to be taken by purchasers for the goods of the other party but the question in each case is one of fact. \"How (asks Lord Watson in Johnston v. Orr Ewing20 can observations of judges upon other and quite different facts bear upon the present case, in which the only question is what is the result of the evidence?\" Lord Blackburn in the same case states21: \"The question to be determined is a question of fact.\" In the present case that question must, in my opinion be answered adversely to the respondent.\nAs to the counterclaim, I find myself unable to agree with all the reasons given by the learned President. I would affirm its dismissal in so far as respondent's trade mark registered as No. 43\/10433 is concerned, but solely on the ground that there is no evidence that would warrant the Court declaring that it was not registrable or ordering that the registration be cancelled. I would set aside the judgment a quo, in so far as it dismisses that part of the counterclaim which asks for a declaration that respondent's trade mark registered as No. 257\/55268 was not registrable and for an order cancelling the registration.\nThe parties having been permitted to file supplementary factums, it appears from that submitted on behalf of the respondent that the position now taken by it with respect to the second trade mark differs from that advanced by it at the trial. Our attention has been drawn to section 28 (1) (b) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932:\u2014\n28. (1) Notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained:\u2014* * *\n(b) similar marks shall be registrable for similar wares if the applicant is the owner of all such marks, which shall be known as associated marks, * * *\nI am not prepared, at the moment, to determine the precise meaning of that provision but in view of it and of the course that the trial took, I am not disposed to preclude either party in a properly framed action litigating the question whether under section 28 (1) or otherwise respondent could apply for and secure registration of the compound word \"Coca-Cola\" although the same compound word in script form had already been registered by it as a trade mark. The judgment on the counterclaim should, therefore, declare that with respect to the respondent's second trade mark, the Court does not see fit to make any order.\nThe appellant should have its costs of the appeal and of the action, and the respondent its costs of the counterclaim.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Creelman, Edmison & Beullac.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt\n1 [1938] Ex.

Derbyshire (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1939: May 23, 24; 1939: December 9.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMotor vehicles\u2014Limitation of actions\u2014Construction of statutes\u2014Action for damage caused to house by vibration through operation of cement-mixing trucks on highway\u2014Damage sustained more than twelve months prior to commencement of action\u2014Action barred by s. 53 of Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 251, as amended\u2014\u201cDamages occasioned by a motor vehicle.\u201d\nPlaintiff sued defendant for damages for injury to plaintiff\u2019s dwelling house in the city of Toronto through vibration caused by operation of defendant\u2019s cement-mixing motor trucks in the street in front of the house. Permission had been granted (pursuant to authority under The Highway Traffic Act) by the City to defendant to operate said trucks on said street (otherwise the use of such trucks was prohibited by said Act). Practically all the damage was sustained beyond 12 months prior to the date when the action was brought (though operation of the trucks continued for a time within that 12 months period). Sec. 53 of The Highway Traffic Act (R.S.O., 1927, c. 251, as amended in 1930, c. 48, s. 11) provided (subject to provisions not material) that \u201cno action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained.\u201d\nHeld: The limitation in s. 53 applied, and plaintiff\u2019s action was barred. As to construction of the plain words in s. 53, there were cited (per the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ.) the rule stated in the Sussex Peerage case, 11 Cl. & F. 85, at 143 (accepted in Cargo ex \u201cArgos,\u201d L.R. 5 P.C. 134, at 153, and referred to in Birmingham Corporation v. Barnes, [1934] 1 K.B. 484, at 500), and (per Crocket J.) Winnipeg Electric Ry. Co. v. Aitken, 63 Can. S.C.R. 586, at 595, and British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Pribble, [1926] A.C. 466, at 477, 478.\nSemble (per the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ.): Where damage is the cause of action or part of the cause of action, a statute of limitation runs from the date of the damage and not of the act which caused the damage; if there be fresh damages within the statutory period, an action in respect of those damages will not be barred (Crumbie v. Wallsend, [1891] 1 Q.B. 503, following Darley Main Colliery Co. v. Mitchell, 11 App. Cas. 127). (In the present case the damages, if any, within the limitation period were negligible).\nIt being held that the action was barred, it was not necessary to determine whether or not, in view of the authorized permission to operate the trucks, the operation could be regarded in law as constituting an actionable nuisance. It was pointed out (per the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ.) that the authority to use the street was not obligatory but only permissive, and that even where there is a statutory obligation upon a person, that does not entitle him to invade the rights of others unless he can show that in practical feasibility the obligation could be performed in no way save one which involves damage to other persons (Manchester Corporation v. Farnworth, [1930] A.C. 171, at 183. Also Provender Millers (Winchester) Ltd. v. Southampton County Council, 1939 W.N. 301, at 302, [1939] 3 All E.R. 882, affirmed, 1939 W.N. 367, [1939] 4 All E.R. 157, referred to).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing (Riddell J.A. dissenting) the present appellant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of McTague J.[1] in favour of the plaintiffs against the present appellant (one of the defendants) for $500 damages for injury to a dwelling house through vibration caused by operation of appellant\u2019s cement-mixing motor trucks on the highway passing in front of the building. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment now reported. Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appeal was allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and K.G. Morden for the appellant.\nJ.W. Pickup K.C. for the respondents. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This appeal comes to this Court by special leave granted by order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe respondent Frances Anger, on July 18th, 1935, commenced the action against the appellant for damages to her residential property, 349 Beech avenue, in the City of Toronto. She alleged that in the years 1933 and 1934 the appellant was engaged in construction work in connection with the Water Purification Plant under construction for the Corporation of the City of Toronto in the eastern portion of the city and that for the purposes of its construction work the appellant\noperated and caused and procured to be operated upon the said Beech avenue in front of and in the immediate vicinity of the said premises of the plaintiff heavy machines for the mixing of concrete, said machines being mounted on heavy trucks and while in operation the said machines were carried upon the said trucks past the plaintiff\u2019s premises at a high rate of speed and in such a manner as to cause severe vibration of the buildings along the course of the said street, including the plaintiff\u2019s dwelling-house. As the result of the said acts of the defendants the said dwelling-house of the plaintiff was greatly damaged.\nAt the end of a long trial the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice McTague, in a considered judgment found as a fact \u201cthat the continued operation of these cement mixing trucks did cause physical injury to the plaintiff\u2019s property.\u201d The learned trial judge discounted, he says, to some extent the estimated cost of repairs advanced on behalf of the respondent but allowed damages in respect of actual physical injury at the sum of $500. This judgment was affirmed on appeal to the Court of Appeal, Riddell, J.A., dissenting. There are concurrent findings of fact because, while Riddell, J.A., accepted without adjudication the finding that the damage was done by the motor trucks to the respondent\u2019s house, Fisher, J.A., upon a careful review of the evidence, agreed expressly with the findings of fact of the trial judge, and Henderson, J.A., while not expressly stating his concurrence in the findings, refers to the evidence upon which the trial judge made his findings and affirms the judgment. However that may be, the main argument presented to us was that the appellant had been granted permission by the Corporation of the City of Toronto, pursuant to statutory authority, to operate the trucks on the particular street in ques- tion and that while the operations may have been a nuisance in the broad sense of the term, they could not under the circumstances be regarded in law as constituting an actionable nuisance. This contention was accepted by Riddell, J.A. Against this view, the effect of the argument on behalf of the respondent was that while such permission had been granted by the municipal corporation, it was permissive merely and not imperative and that there was necessarily implied in the permit that the use of the highway so sanctioned was not to be in prejudice of the common law right of others. We were afforded a very complete argument by counsel on this branch of the case but in my view it becomes unnecessary to determine this question. It may with advantage, however, be pointed out that the authority to use the street was not obligatory but only permissive, and that even where there is a statutory obligation upon a person, that does not entitle him to invade the rights of others unless he can show that in practical feasibility the obligation could be performed in no way save one which involves damage to other persons. Manchester Corporation v. Farnworth[2]. Farwell, J., very recently said in Provender Millers (Winchester) Ltd. v. Southampton County Council[3] that the speech of Lord Macnaghten in East Freemantle Corporation v. Annois[4] must be read in the light of the particular facts of that case where the legislature had authorized the actual thing done, so that unless the work was improperly done the corporation could not be made liable for damages suffered by other persons.\nThe appellant pleaded in its statement of defence that any claim that the respondent may have had by reason of the operation of the trucks referred to in her statement of claim was barred by the provisions of sec. 53 of The Highway Traffic Act, being R.S.O., 1927, ch. 251 and amendments thereto. The relevant section as it stood in the Revised Statutes of 1927 was as follows:\n53. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 no action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of six months from the time when the damages were sustained. Subsections (2) and (3) are not material. They deal with the case where death is caused and the action brought under The Fatal Accidents Act and the case where the person injured is an infant. In 1930, by 20 Geo. V, ch. 48, sec. 11, the period of limitation in sec. 53 was made twelve instead of six months. The subsection now stands in the same language as amended in 1930 in the Revised Statutes of 1937, ch. 288, sec. 60.\nIt is important then to repeat that the writ in this action was issued July 18th, 1935, and the statement of claim refers to the operations of the appellant in the years 1933 and 1934. If the statutory limitation of twelve months above mentioned applies to this case, then the damages, if any, sustained beyond the twelve months cannot be recovered. It was frankly admitted by Mr. Pickup that while there might be some damage within the twelve months period, the substantial damage was undoubtedly sustained outside that period of time. It is a fair view of the evidence that the damages, if any, within the twelve months period were negligible.\nThe learned trial judge in dealing with this aspect of the case said:\nIf I have to give effect to the contention it would be serious as to the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damages and perhaps as to the right to recover at all, because I am of opinion that the real damage was probably caused early in the year 1933 when the truck operation was heaviest and not nearly so reasonably carried out as it was after the 24th day of June of that year.\nIt therefore becomes vital to the respondent\u2019s case to determine whether or not her recovery is limited by the twelve months statutory period. The trial judge did not think so. He carefully considered the section of the statute and concluded that the right to damages here is a common law right which does not come within the purview of the statutory provision, and therefore in his opinion this defence had no application. In the Court of Appeal, Riddell, J.A., while not resting his judgment on that point, was of the opinion that the section plainly ousted claims for damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months and he said that if the action were sustainable at all he would give effect to this section. Fisher, J.A., did not deal specifically with the point. Henderson, J.A., discussed the section at some length and concluded that the statute concerned itself entirely with highway traffic and, having regard to the general purpose and scope of the statute, the limitation section must be deemed to refer to traffic accidents, and upon this reasoning it became clear to the learned judge, he says, that the respondent\u2019s action is not one contemplated by The Highway Traffic Act or within its scope or purview and that the limitation section cannot apply to it.\nThe interpretation and application of this special statutory limitation was carefully considered in at least two earlier cases in the Ontario Court of Appeal. In Harris v. Yellow Cab[5], Mulock, C.J.O., Hodgins and Smith, JJ.A., held (Magee, J.A., dissenting) that the damages to which the limitation applies, so far as the owner of the motor vehicle is concerned, are intended to be those provided for in the Act itself, due to its violation, and not those recoverable at common law or apart from the Act; and therefore an action brought by a passenger in a motor vehicle against the owner, to recover damages for injuries sustained by reason of the negligence of the driver in shutting the door of the vehicle upon the passenger\u2019s hand, was not barred, though brought more than six months (the then period of limitation) after the injury. Then in Hughes v. Watkins & Co.[6], the Court, composed of Mulock, C.J.O., Magee, Hodgins, Ferguson and Grant, JJ.A., held, affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell who had tried the case with a jury, that the plaintiff\u2019s action for damages for her injury (she had been struck while standing on the sidewalk of a city street and injured by the projecting part of a load on the defendants\u2019 motor truck negligently driven by their employee as found by the jury) was barred by the limitation section of The Highway Traffic Act, the action not having been brought until after the expiration of six months from the time when the damages were sustained. Whether the cause of action was to be regarded as arising under the statute or at common law, the section was held applicable. It was subsequent to this decision that the legislature amended (in 1930) the section by making the statutory period twelve months instead of six months. The judgment of Grant, J.A., in the Hughes v. Watkins case[7], contained obiter dicta, however, that if damages are occasioned by a motor vehicle upon a highway under circumstances which give a right of action under the provisions of the Act, even though the same circumstances give a right of action at common law (and whether based upon a breach of a contractual obligation or upon tort), the right of action is barred at the expiration of the special statutory period, but, if the circumstances are such as would give a right of action at common law but not under the statute, then the section has no application.\nThe argument presented on behalf of the respondent in this Court was that the action was a common law action of nuisance and that The Highway Traffic Act had no application to such an action; that the statute is dealing with regulation of traffic upon highways and that the, cause of action here sued upon exists quite apart from the statute and is not within the scope of it. The respondent relied upon the dicta of Grant, J.A., in the Hughes v. Watkins case7 and also on the decision in the Harris v. Yellow Cab case[8].\nIt is to be observed in the present case that The Highway Traffic Act not only deals with traffic accidents but stipulates the width and the length and the weight of vehicles and of the loads that may be moved upon wheels over or upon different classes of highways (old provisions that are now found as secs. 17 and 33 in R.S.O., 1937, ch. 288). It is plain that the use of the particular motor trucks in question in this action upon the highways was prohibited by the statute unless a special permit was issued, pursuant to sec. 34, which provides that the municipal corporation or other authority having jurisdiction over the highway may, upon application in writing, grant a permit for the moving of heavy vehicles, loads, objects or structures in excess of the limits prescribed by section 17 or 33. Permission was in fact granted by the City of Toronto to the appellant to operate their motor trucks on Beech avenue and that permission was given by the municipal corporation pursuant to the authority vested in it by sec. 34, and it is damage alleged to have been caused by those motor trucks that the respondent in this action seeks to recover. It is difficult for me, therefore, to accept the contention that the limitation section (now sec. 60) in the statute is not applicable to this action. It very plainly states that, subject to two provisoes which do not affect this action,\nno action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained.\nThe rule of construction is plain:\nIf the words of the statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves alone do, in such case, best declare the intention of the lawgiver.\nThis is the rule declared by the Judges in advising the House of Lords in the Sussex Peerage case[9] which was accepted by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Cargo ex \u201cArgos\u201d[10], and recently referred to by Slesser, L.J., in Birmingham Corporation v. Barnes[11].\nThe operation of the trucks continued on Beech avenue for a time within the one-year period. Where damage is the cause of action or part of the cause of action, a statute of limitation runs from the date of the damage and not of the act which caused the damage. If there be fresh damages within the statutory period, an action in respect of those damages will not be barred (Crumbie v. Wallsend Local Board[12], following the decision in the House of Lords in Darley Main Colliery Co. v. Mitchell[13]). But in the case now in appeal before us the finding of the trial judge, amply supported by the evidence, is that the substantial damages, assessed at $500, were in fact sustained prior to the one-year period. If there was any further damage within the year it was de minimis.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the action is barred by the statute and that the appeal must be allowed, the judgments below set aside and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nCROCKET J.\u2014This action was brought to recover for damage alleged to have been caused to the plaintiffs\u2019 residential property on Beech avenue, Toronto, by the opera- tion of heavy machines for the mixing of concrete in front of and in the immediate vicinity of the said property. The statement of claim alleged that the said machines were mounted on heavy trucks and while in operation were carried upon the said trucks past the plaintiffs\u2019 premises at a high rate of speed and in such a manner as to cause severe vibration of the buildings along the course of the said street, including the plaintiffs\u2019 dwelling house, and that, as a result, the said dwelling house was greatly damaged. It claimed that the acts of the defendants amounted to a nuisance and were an unlawful interference with the use and enjoyment of the property and resulted in permanent injury thereto.\nThe defendant appellant in its statement of defence alleged that when it operated its trucks on Beech avenue it was authorized to do so by permits issued pursuant to the provisions of ss. 2, 29 and 30 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 251, and amendments thereto, and did so in accordance with the limitations placed upon it by the said Act and the said permits and in a proper and careful manner, and denied that the operation of the trucks damaged the plaintiffs\u2019 premises or interfered with the reasonable enjoyment thereof. It also pleaded that the action was barred by the provisions of s. 53 of the said Highway Traffic Act and amendments thereto.\nOn the trial before McTague, J. (without a jury), His Lordship found in effect that the movement and operation of these trucks on Beech avenue was a nuisance, which had caused physical injury to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, for which the defendant appellant was liable, though he stated that there could be no question about the right of the Dual-Mix Co. (the defendant appellant\u2019s subsidiary) to operate the trucks upon the street and that the Highway Traffic Act and the municipal by-laws and regulations were lived up to. He held that the right to recover for this damage was a common law right outside the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act and that consequently the action was not barred by the provisions of the limitation section, which had no application to such a case, and accordingly ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs against the defendant appellant for $500 and costs on the County Court scale. This judgment was confirmed by the Appeal Court, Riddell, J.A., dissenting, and from the latter judgment special leave to appeal to this Court has been granted.\nAs I have come to the conclusion that the action must be dismissed on the ground that it was not brought within the time limit prescribed by s. 53 of the Highway Traffic Act, ch. 251, R.S.O., 1927, as amended by s. 11, ch. 48 of the Ontario Statutes of 1930, I shall confine myself solely to this point.\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that the concrete mixing trucks were motor vehicles within the meaning of s. 1 (h) of the Highway Traffic Act, nor that Beech avenue was a highway within the terms of that statute. The learned trial judge having clearly found that the damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property, for which compensation was sought in this action, was caused by the operation of these cement mixing trucks upon the highway and that the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act and the municipal by-laws and regulations were lived up to in connection with their movement along that highway, I am at a loss to perceive how it can well be said that this action was not an action \u201cfor the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle,\u201d within the meaning of s. 53 of the Highway Traffic Act or that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover for such damages was a common law right entirely beyond the scope and purview of that statute. Had the trucks been driven at an excessive rate of speed or had there been any negligence of any description in connection with their movement or operation as they proceeded along the highway, to which the damage was properly attributable, no question could have been raised as to the action being barred, provided the damage claimed for was sustained more than twelve months prior to the commencement of the action.\nThe learned trial judge seems to have based his judgment as to the non-applicability of s. 53 upon the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Harris v. Yellow Cab, Ltd.[14], and a dictum of Grant, J.A., in Hughes v. Watkins[15].\nIn the later case the plaintiff, while on foot on the kerb of a city sidewalk or street, was struck and injured by the projecting part of a load on the defendants\u2019 motor truck, negligently driven by their employee, as found by a jury. The Appellate Division held that the action, not having been brought until after the expiration of six months from the time when the damages were sustained, was barred by the limitation section. In his reasons for judgment, Ferguson, J.A., said:\u2014\nIt being established and admitted that the injury and damages which form the subject-matter of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim occurred and were occasioned by the negligent use of the defendants\u2019 motor vehicle in the course of its using a highway for motor travel or motor traffic, I am of opinion that the learned trial Judge [Riddell, J.A.] was right in his conclusion that s. 54 applied to bar the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, provided the \u201cdamages were sustained\u201d more than six months [as the section then stood] prior to action brought.\nThis seems to have been the basis of the decision in that case that the action was barred.\nIt is claimed that it was \u201cthe negligent use of the defendants\u2019 motor vehicle in the course of its using a highway for motor travel or motor traffic,\u201d which brought that case within the purview of the section and of the statute, and that, no negligence having been alleged or found in connection with the use of the highway in the present instance, the decision in Hughes v. Watkins15 is authority for the proposition that the section does not apply to bar the present plaintiffs\u2019 action. For my part I cannot accept this contention.\nThe section itself says nothing about the damages sued for being occasioned by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle upon a highway. It is directed wholly to the bringing of actions \u201cfor the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle\u201d\u2014a motor vehicle, which can only be lawfully operated on a highway under a permit granted in accordance with the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act. That statute contains special provisions regarding the weight, width, etc., of trucks and prescribes penalties for their violation. If any of those provisions had been violated by the defendant appellant\u2019s subsidiary in the operation of these trucks along the highway, their operation obviously would have been unlawful, and any damage really occasioned thereby attributable to the defendant appellant\u2019s negligence. In that case under the doctrine laid down in Hughes v. Watkins15 the limitation section would have applied and the plaintiffs would have been required to bring their action within the twelve months period prescribed thereby. It seems to me, with the highest respect, that we could not give effect to the distinction now relied upon in support of the judgment a quo without reading into the language of a perfectly clear, precise and unambiguous enactment, words which it does not contain, and, moreover, without holding that the section was enacted as a protection only for those who violated the provisions of the statute, and not for those who observed them.\nIn Winnipeg Electric Railway Co. v. Aitken[16], this Court considered a very similar question, viz.: whether an action to recover damages for personal injury, based on a claim for breach of contract of carriage, fell within the provisions of s. 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act It was conceded that the plaintiff in that case had been injured as the result of one of the defendant company\u2019s tramcars colliding with another in which she was a passenger, through the negligent operation of the two cars, and the question involved was as to whether, notwithstanding the provisions of s. 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act, under which her action for negligence admittedly would have been barred, she was entitled to recover for the damages sustained against the defendant company for breach of the contract of carriage. This Court held, per Duff, Anglin and Mignault, JJ., Idington and Cassels, JJ., dissenting, that s. 116 of that Act applied and that the plaintiff could not recover either upon the ground of negligence or of breach of contract. S. 116 of the Manitoba Act provided that\nall suits for indemnity for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the construction or operation of the railway shall be instituted within twelve months next after the time of such supposed damage sustained.\nAnglin, J., held that the decisive question in the case was whether the plaintiff\u2019s injury was sustained by reason of the operation of the defendant\u2019s railway, regardless, as I take it, of whether the action was grounded on negligence or on a claim for damages for breach of contract. I reproduce from p. 595 the following paragraph from his judgment: The primary rule of statutory construction is that, unless to do so would lead to absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the statute the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words should prevail. The language of section 116 of the Manitoba Act is precise and unambiguous. No absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency can arise from giving to it its natural and ordinary sense. On the other hand to hold that the case of a man in the street who is injured through negligence in running the cars falls within the purview of the section, but that the case of a passenger who sustains injury from the like cause does not, seems to me to involve inconsistencey and repugnancy to common sense as well. Unless compelled by authority to hold otherwise, I should have no doubt that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was sustained \u201cby reason of the operation of the defendant\u2019s railway\u201d and that her action is therefore barred by the Manitoba statute above quoted.\nHis Lordship then proceeded to review all the authorities dealing with the construction of limitation sections. Subsequently in the case of British Columbia Electric Railway Co. v. Pribble[17], s. 60 of the appellant\u2019s private Act, which was precisely of the same import as that of s. 116 of the Manitoba Railway Act, except that the limitation was six instead of twelve months, came before the Privy Council for construction. The respondent plaintiff in that action was a passenger on the appellant\u2019s railway and was injured in alighting owing to the defective step of the car and had brought her action more than six months after the happening of the accident. The Judicial Committee held that the action was barred. Lord Sumner in delivering the judgment of the Board reviewed the Canadian authorities upon the construction of similar limitation sections and in doing so approved of the judgment of Anglin, J., in Winnipeg Electric Railway Co. v. Aitken[18] and of the judgments of his colleagues who concurred with him. In the course of his reasons Lord Sumner said at p. 477:\nThe section is expressed in general terms. If the action is one of the kind described, the section applies, for all such actions are within it.\nand, after dealing with the argument, which had been presented in support of the inapplicability of s. 60, he added[19]:\nAfter the most careful consideration of the matter their Lordships are of opinion that the reasoning of Sayer\u2019s case[20] is wrong and that the reasoning in Aitken\u2019s case[21] gives true guidance to the construction of the present section. The above quotation from the reasons of Anglin, J., in the Aitken case22 applies, in my judgment, with peculiar force to the case now before us, and I have no doubt that the respondents\u2019 action, not having been commenced within twelve months of the time when the damage claimed for was sustained, falls under the prohibition of s. 53, or, as it is now, s. 60 of c. 288 of the Revised Statutes of 1937.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be allowed and the plaintiffs\u2019 action dismissed with costs throughout.\nKERWIN J.\u2014Shortly after counsel for the respondents commenced his argument, the Court intimated that we did not require to hear him further on the question of fact as to whether the appellant\u2019s operations on the highway caused damage to the respondents\u2019 house to the extent of five hundred dollars, as we were satisfied that the trial judge\u2019s finding in that respect, concurred in as it was by the Court of Appeal, must stand. It is necessary to determine, however, whether any vibrations were set up by the operation of the cement mixers and auxiliary motors as distinct from the vibrations set up by the movement of the trucks themselves along the highway, and also whether any damage was caused thereby.\nOn behalf of the respondents, the point is thus put in their factum:\u2014\n13. It was also argued in the Court of Appeal that the cement mixing operations did not increase the vibrations set up beyond what the movement of the trucks themselves would cause and that the Trial Judge was under a misapprehension in relying upon that operation as causing unusual vibration. There is no evidence at all as to that either one way or the other. The Respondents relied upon the whole operation being an unusual one and the fact that the operation as a whole caused physical damage. It was not incumbent upon the Plaintiffs to show what elements in the Appellant\u2019s operations were the factors which produced the damages. If the fact that the operation of the cement mixer did not increase vibration has any bearing on the case it was for the Appellant to have proved the fact. It is submitted that the proper inference from the evidence as to causes of vibration (Case, p. 118, 1.1) and from the fact that an auxiliary motor was operating and a drum revolving with movement of cement inside is that such motion would set up vibrations.\nThe reference to page 118 of the Case is to the evidence of Dr. Harkness, a witness called on behalf of the respondents. Commencing at page 117, his examination-in-chief proceeds as follows:\u2014\nQ. Then, Dr. Harkness, in the passage of heavy vehicles\u2014you have heard the evidence in this case, of course?\nA. Yes. Q. Such as trucks carrying cement mixers that we have heard so much about, what are the elements important in estimating the degree or extent of the vibration?\nA. The condition of the roadway; the material on which the roadway rests; the weight of the vehicle; the resilience of the springs and tires of the vehicle, and the velocity.\nMr. McCarthy: Condition of roadway; substructure of the roadway; resilience of springs and tires?\nWitness: Yes, and the weight of the vehicle and its velocity.\nMr. Robertson: Q. Other things being equal, what is the effect of the increase in velocity?\nA. An increase in velocity would increase the impacts on the roadway at least in the ratio of the increase in velocity\u2014if you double the velocity the impacts on the roadway would be at least double, and the vibration caused thereby would be double.\nI can find nothing in the record to indicate that the point under consideration was put to any witness and my interpretation of the whole of the evidence is that no case was attempted to be made out that any vibrations that might have been set up by the cement mixers alone caused any damage. The trial judge seems to have found that the damages were caused by the combined operation of the trucks, the mixers, and auxiliary motors. He states:\u2014\nThe cement mixing trucks are very heavy and are equipped with an auxiliary motor which operates the mixer as the truck travels to its destination. * * * There is no question in my mind that the continued operation of these cement mixing trucks did cause physical injury to the plaintiffs\u2019 property. * * * Each truck of the Dual-Mixed Company is in a sense a manufactory. Unusual vibration is caused by virtue of the motor operating the mixer and by the operation of the mixer itself. It is a legitimate operation, of course, but it produces vibration to a degree which might well constitute a nuisance in these circumstances. * * * As between the two principles involved I think I should choose the one which fastens liability on the defendant who operated the cement-mixing trucks. * * * The cement-mixing trucks on the highway are in a sense in the same category as a manufactory established close to the plaintiffs\u2019 property.\nWhile, no doubt, throughout the trial emphasis was placed upon the fact that the cement mixers operated while trucks were in motion upon the highway both when carrying cement and when empty, and while it may be a fair inference that the mixers and auxiliary motors did set up vibrations, I am unable to find any evidence to warrant a finding that these vibrations caused damage to the respondents\u2019 house. I therefore conclude that in this case the damages were caused by motor vehicles.\nThere remains for consideration the questions (1) whether the appellant was responsible in law for such damages, and (2) whether such claim was barred by section 53 of The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario which at the relevant time was chapter 251 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1927, as amended by 20 George V, chapter 48, section 11. Contrary to the impression formed at the conclusion of the argument, I have concluded, though not without doubt, that any action that might have existed is barred by this section, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to express any opinion upon the first question.\nWe are not concerned with subsections 2 and 3 of section 53. Subsection 1, as amended, reads as follows:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 no action shall be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle after the expiration of twelve months from the time when the damages were sustained.\nThe amendment made in 1930 merely provided that the period of limitation should be twelve months instead of six months.\nTaken by themselves the words used in this subsection are clear and unambiguous. In terms they are not limited to circumstances where damages are occasioned by a motor vehicle on a highway; they are not restricted to cases where damages are caused by a motor vehicle coming in contact with a person or thing; they do not state that the damages must have been occasioned by negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle or by reason of the violation of any of the provisions of the Act. It is contended on behalf of the respondents that the subsection must be construed in a narrower sense and that such a claim as the present, based as it is on an alleged nuisance at common law, is not within its purview.\nAttention is called to the liability for loss or damage section and the onus section (now sections 47 and 48 of the current Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 288) and it is argued that subsection 1 of section 53 should be construed as limited to damages occasioned by contact with a motor vehicle itself in its use of the highway for the purpose of traffic. It is also contended that to give the subsection a meaning broad enough to include the claim made in this action, which is not based on negligent operation of a motor vehicle, would mean that the truck driver, if sued by the respondents in this case for nuisance, would be required by the onus section to disprove negli- gence or improper conduct on his part although such issue would have nothing to do with the action.\nUpon consideration, I am unable to agree with these contentions. While the vehicles here in question were on the highway, it is to be noticed that not all sections of the Act refer to motor vehicles while upon a highway. Furthermore, cases may arise where damages are claimed as a result of nervous shock \u201coccasioned by a motor vehicle,\u201d and while it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to the basis for such an action or as to how far it may extend, it is at least arguable that such actions fall and were meant to come within the terms of section 53. Finally, while it may be that in such an action as the present the onus section of the Act could have no application, since the negligence or improper conduct of the driver is not in issue, the action is nevertheless, in my opinion, one for damages \u201coccasioned by a motor vehicle.\u201d\nConsiderable difference of opinion upon the question has existed in the Courts of Ontario, but upon the whole I am forced to the conclusion that there is nothing in the Act to warrant restricting the plain words of the subsection, \u201coccasioned by a motor vehicle,\u201d so that they do not cover the damages sustained by the present respondents. As to whether the action was commenced after the expiration of twelve months from the time that all of the five hundred dollars damages were sustained, the trial judge stated that if he were to give effect to the section\nit would be serious as to the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages and perhaps as to the right to recover at all, because I am of opinion that the real damage was probably caused early in the year 1933 when the truck operation was heaviest and not nearly so reasonably carried out as it was after the 24th day of June of that year.\nIn his factum, counsel for the respondents states:\nThe action was not commenced within the time limited by that section,\nand before us admitted that he could not state that any of the damages occurred within the statutory period.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Armstrong & Sinclair.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\n[1] [1938] O.R. 492; [1938] 4 D.L.R. 70.\n[2] [1930] A.C. 171, at 183.\n[3] 1939 W.N. 301, at 302; [1939] 3 All E.R. 882 (affirmed in the Court of Appeal, 1939 W.N. 367; [1939] 4 All E.R. 157).\n[4] [1902] A.C., 213, 217.\n[5] (1926) 59 Ont.

The \"premium\" (of $10 per share) paid on such redemption was charged by the company against its \"surplus account.\" Appellants held shares thus redeemed and were assessed for income tax in respect of the \"premium\" received, on the ground that it was a \"premium paid out of undistributed income on hand\" within said s. 17. The assessment was sustained by Maclean J., [1939] Ex. C.R. 41. On appeal:\nHeld (Davis J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Hudson J.: In view of the manner in which the company's surplus (as shown in its surplus account) was built up and what it represented (as appearing from directors' reports, balance sheets, and other evidence), it must be held that in fact it represented undistributed income actually existing, though in various forms as current assets. The company, having cash on hand (whether derived from sale of shares or a loan), might treat this cash as the embodiment of the surplus. It was clear in point of fact that the directors, with the assent of the shareholders, did intend to pay the premium out of surplus, and, pro tanto, to reduce the surplus; and by resorting to the fund of which they made use, they thereby treated that fund as part of the surplus of undistributed income, and, therefore, as \"undistributed income on hand.\" Therefore the conditions of s. 17 were fulfilled. (Also, said premium, so called, was a premium within the contemplation of s. 17.) Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. agreed with the reasons far judgment of Maclean J. (cited supra) in holding that the premium in question was a premium paid out of the company's \"undistributed income on hand\" within the meaning of s. 17.\nPer Davis J. (dissenting): From the facts (discussed) in regard to the source and constitution of the fund out of which the redemption payments were made, it cannot be said that the premium, so called, was \"paid out of undistributed income on hand\" within s. 17. Quaere whether the excess over par value, paid by the company in exercise of its right (given by supplementary letters patent) to redeem at a fixed price without consent of holders of the shares, was strictly \"a premium.\"\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the present appellant's appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming the assessment of appellants for income tax for the taxation period of 1929 (under s. 17 of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, as it stood at the material date) in respect of a \"premium\" of $10 per share paid to them upon the redemption by Massey-Harris Co., Ltd., of preference shares held by appellants in the stock of the company.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported (and are also discussed at length in the judgment appealed from (1)). The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Davis J. dissenting.\nC. H. A. Armstrong K.C. for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and A. A. McGrory for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Hudson J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal raises a question of the construction and application of section 17 of the Income War Tax Act (ch. 97, R.S.C. 1927) which is as follows:\n17. Where a corporation, having undistributed income on hand, redeems its shares at a premium paid out of such income, the premium shall be deemed to be a dividend and to be income received by the shareholder.\nThe question to be determined is whether certain sums received in 1929 by the appellants from the Massey-Harris Co., Ltd., on the redemption of shares held by them in that Company are assessable to income tax as being within the scope of this definition of income.\nThe Massey-Harris Co., Ltd., is a manufacturing company created under the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act. By a document described as supplementary letters patent of the 17th of February, 1926, the Secretary of State, pursuant to statutory authority, approved a resolution of the Company of the 2nd of February converting 250,000 shares of the capital stock of the Company of the par value of $100 each into 125,000 cumulative preference shares of the par value of $100 and 125,000 common shares of the same value. By this document it was declared:\nThe Company shall also have the right without the consent of the holders thereof, from time to time to redeem the whole or any number of the said cumulative preference shares at One hundred and ten (110%) per centum of their par value, together with any accumulated dividends thereon upon giving [the prescribed] notice * * *\nThe late Walter E. H. Massey at his death was the registered holder of 9,122 of these shares. By a document also described as supplementary letters patent, of March 19th, 1929, the Secretary of State, in exercise of authority vested in him by the Companies Act, confirmed a by-law of the company increasing the capital stock of the company from 125,000 7 per cent, cumulative preference shares of $100 each and 500,000 common shares without nominal or par value to 125,000 7 per cent, cumulative preference shares of $100 each (being the already authorized preference shares) and 150,000 5 per cent, cumulative convertible preference shares of $100 each and 1,000,000 common shares without nominal or par value, being an addition of 150,000 5 per cent cumulative convertible preference shares of $100 each and 500,000 common shares without nominal or par value of the company.\nUpon the same date the company gave notice to the shareholders of the 7 per cent, cumulative preference shares of its intention to redeem these shares by paying the redemption price of $110 per share together with the accrued dividend. The shares held by the appellants as the executors of the late Walter E. H. Massey were redeemed on the 15th of May, 1929. Accompanying the notice to the shareholders was a hypothetical balance sheet certified by the auditors as of the 30th of November, 1928, but modified by making allowances for:\n(1) the redemption of the 7 per cent, cumulative preference shares and the issue of 120,899 redeemable 5 per cent, cumulative preferred shares,\n(2) the issue of 241,798 additional common shares of no par value at $60 per share,\n(3) the writing off of the entire bond discount and expenses shown as an asset on the actual balance sheet of the 30th of November, 1928, and \"making reserve against any premium payable on redemption of the 7 per cent, preferred shares,\"\n(4) the repayment of bank advances out of the proceeds of new capital.\nThe actual surplus of the 30th of November, 1928, is given in this balance sheet as $6,982,098.02. The surplus left after the deductions mentioned in the third of the allowances enumerated above, amounting to $2,109,960.20, is shown to be $4,872,137.82. This balance sheet was certified by the auditors.\nThe premium of $10 attributable to 9,122 shares, amounting in the aggregate to $91,220, was duly paid to the appellants and was assessed as taxable income in their hands. I repeat, at the close of the fiscal year ending the 30th of November, 1928, the directors' report to the shareholders showed a surplus of $6,982,098.02. The surplus at the end of the year ending the 30th of November, 1929, was $5,786,337.67. In the year 1929 there was earned a profit of $2,800,813.35, but the deductions on account of bond discount and expenses, premium on 7 per cent, preference shares and dividends paid in the year 1929 had the effect of reducing the surplus to the figure mentioned. The amount paid for premiums on the 7 per cent, preference shares redeemed was $1,100,770. This is all shown in the directors' report to the shareholders for the year ending the 30th of November, 1929, and submitted to the shareholders at the annual meeting on February 21st, 1930.\nIt seems advisable to notice the manner in which (as it appears from the directors' reports to the shareholders and the balance sheets) this surplus of nearly seven millions was built up and what it represented. The earliest directors' report and the earliest balance sheet before us are those for the year 1924. The report showed that the surplus at the 30th of November, 1923, that is the end of the fiscal year, was $750,152.73. The surplus at the 30th of November, 1924, ascertained by deducting from the surplus of the previous year a sum required for an adjustment in connection with subsidiary companies' stock and adding the net profit for 1924, is given as $818,709.60, and this sum appears in the balance sheet as a credit to profit and loss account. Net profit for the year is ascertained by deducting from the income for the year's operations interest on borrowings and appropriations for certain reserves. Reserves appear in each of the balance sheets for the years 1924 to 1929 inclusive and are for taxes, foreign exchange, etc., pensions, buildings and equipment, possible losses on collection, fire indemnity, contingent account as called for by charters and by-laws of companies and, as appears from the directors' reports, appropriations were made from time to time during these years for one or more of these accounts. In each year the surplus is ascertained by adding to the surplus of the preceding year the net profit for the year in question and deducting sums paid for dividends, if any, the net profit in each case being arrived at in the manner already mentioned.\nNow, it appears from the hypothetical balance sheet sent to the shareholders with the notice of redemption that any premium payable on redemption of the 7 per cent, preferred shares would be paid out of, or would go in reduction of the surplus of $6,982,098.02 at the 30th of November, 1928; and, in the report of the directors for the year ending the 30th of November, 1929, submitted to the shareholders at the annual meeting on the 21st of February, 1930, the sum paid for such premiums, $1,100,770, is charged to and goes in reduction of such surplus.\nWe have, as I have said, no directors' reports or balance sheets, prior to 1924 but, from the evidence of Mr. Vardon, there is no doubt, I think, that the surplus at November 30th, 1924, was treated by the company as income and assessable to income tax; and subject to qualification as to a sum of $130,000 transferred to surplus account in 1925, the surplus in each year is calculated, as I have said, by adding the net profit for the year to the surplus of the preceding year and deducting sums paid for dividends. The sum of $130,000 was transferred in 1924 direct from the contingent account, $380,000, to surplus, increasing the surplus by that amount and correspondingly diminishing the contingent account. The transfer was explained by the fact that this sum was held in the contingent account of subsidiary companies no longer required because of the surrender of their charters.\nI have already observed that in all these years the net profit was as a rule ascertained by deducting from the income from the year's operations, interest on borrowings and appropriations for the reserves mentioned. There are, however, two credits to income, one in the year 1925, and the other in the year 1928, which, perhaps, call for some comment.\nThe first is a sum of $661,139.20 in 1925, representing \"recovery of assets written off in the war years.\" The other is a profit on the sale of assets in the year 1928 amounting to $835,218.16. Both of these credits, as well as the nature of the receipts they represent, appear explicitly in the directors' reports submitted to the shareholders in the respective years mentioned.\nHaving regard to the way in which the income account is made up, as already explained, and especially to the appropriations for the reserves mentioned which appear to have been built up by such appropriations from income, it would appear to have been a perfectly natural and reasonable thing to credit both these sums to income account and, this having been done with the assent of the shareholders, it seems to me the net profit in each year, as it appears in the directors' reports, must be considered to fall within the category of income. Subject to a question as to the sum of $130,000 mentioned, the surplus at the 30th of November, 1928, which apparently stood at the same figure on the 15th of May when the Massey shares were redeemed, represented accumulated income. Whether this last-mentioned sum represented accumulated income or not we have no means of knowing.\nTurning now to the application of section 17. The question to be determined is whether or not the premium of $10 a share received by the appellants was paid out of undistributed income on hand. I think it ought to be observed that this is not necessarily the same question as the question to which the learned trial judge seems chiefly to have applied himself, whether it was paid out of undistributed profits available for the payment of dividends. The Dominion Companies Act, which governs the Massey-Harris Co., Ltd., provides (s. 98):\nNo dividend shall be declared which will impair the capital of the company.\nThis section does not prevent the distribution of a capital profit provided the effect of doing so will not reduce the value of the assets below the sum total of the liabilities and the share capital. Broadly, it may be said that the company may distribute any of its assets among the shareholders so long as such is not the result of the distribution. The fact, therefore, that the surplus was drawn against for dividends is not at all conclusive; undistributed profits are not necessarily undistributed income within the meaning of section 17; but, I repeat, the proper conclusion from the evidence is that the surplus represented accumulated income with the exception of the sum mentioned of $130,000 which, as I have said, may or may not be within that category. Since the transfer of this sum took place in 1925, the total surplus was drawn upon to the extent of more than 30 per cent, and this sum must, therefore, be proportionately reduced; so reduced it may, I think, be disregarded.\nThere remains the question whether, within the meaning of section 17, the premiums on the shares redeemed were \"paid out of\" undistributed income \"on hand\" which the surplus represented at the time. That the intention of the directors was to charge the premiums against the surplus, that is to say, that they should go in reduction of the surplus, is plain; and it is also plain that the shareholders acquiesced in this manner of dealing with the surplus. The shareholders became aware of it at the meeting of February, 1930, and there is no suggestion that any shareholder ever took exception to it. The undistributed income, no doubt, existed in various forms in the current assets, as Mr. Vardon says, but it was there nevertheless and the fact that it was not in a form in which the company could conveniently employ it for the purpose of making payments or convert it into cash does not appear to me to be conclusive upon the point we are considering. I can see no reason why the company, having cash on hand, might not treat this cash as the embodiment of the surplus. If that was done, I do not think it matters whether this cash was derived from the sale of shares or from a loan unless there is something in the law or the constitution of the company preventing such funds being so dealt with.\nOf course, in the present case the direct and immediate source of the monies put to the credit of the Preference Dividend Account was the money subscribed for share capital and, if that were the whole story, nothing more could be said; but I think it is clear enough in point of fact that the directors, with the assent of the shareholders, did intend, as I have said, to pay the premium out of the surplus and, pro tanto, to reduce the surplus; and by resorting to the fund they made use of they thereby treated that fund as part of the surplus of undistributed income and, therefore, as \"undistributed income on hand.\"\nIf I am right in my view that in fact the surplus represented undistributed income actually existing, though in various forms as current assets, then I think the conclusion is that the conditions of section 17 have been fulfilled.\nI should add that, in my view, the premium so-called was a premium within the contemplation of section 17.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal by the executors of Walter E. H. Massey from a judgment of the Exchequer Court[2] confirming the assessment levied upon the appellants for income tax for the year 1929. The appellants were the owners of a number of preference shares of Massey-Harris Company, Limited, upon the redemption of which they received a premium, and the real point for determination is whether this premium was paid out of the company's \"undistributed income on hand\" within the meaning of section 17 of the Income War Tax Act. This section, as it stood at the time of the redemption of the shares in 1929, was in the following terms:\u2014\nWhere a corporation, having undistributed income on hand, redeems its shares at a premium paid out of such income, the premium shall be deemed to be a dividend and to be income received by the shareholder.\nBefore this Court, however, counsel for the appellants took a point that had not been previously raised. He contended that, as section 17 is not a charging section and as there is no evidence that the premium received by the appellants was income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 11 of the Act, the appellants could not be assessed for income tax. Apparently the solicitors for the appellants desired to obtain a decision on the point of substance, and, no doubt, having the assessment made against the appellant executors was considered a convenient method of securing an adjudication. The will of the late Walter E. H. Massey is not before us but it should be assumed that the premium did constitute income accumulating in trust as defined in subsection 2 of section 11 and it must be held that the point is not open to the appellants.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the appellants abandoned one claim he had advanced before the Exchequer Court, i.e., that as a portion of the surplus account of the company was earned prior to the coming into force of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, the premium, if held to be paid out of undistributed income on hand, should be deducted from that portion that had been earned prior to 1917. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with that question.\nWith reference to the main contention, that section 17 contemplates an actual payment out of accumulated cash income on hand, I agree with the reasons for judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court and have nothing to add.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavis J. (dissenting).\u2014At the time of the redemption of the shares in question and the payment of what has been treated by both parties as \"a premium\" of 10 per cent., the company admittedly had undistributed income but it was not in liquid form\u2014it had gone into and had become part of the physical assets of the company. At the same time the company owed its bankers over six million dollars. Obviously, in any practical business sense the company was not in a position to redeem in cash large blocks of its capital stock at par plus 10 per cent. But the company desired to get rid of heavy dividend burdens on its outstanding preference shares by taking advantage of much lower prevailing interest rates, and worked out a plan whereby it would reduce its annual charge for dividends by $241,798 by calling in outstanding securities and issuing new securities at a lower rate of dividend.\nThe company, duly incorporated under the (Dominion) Companies Act, R.S.C. 1886, ch. 119, had the right, by virtue of supplementary Letters Patent,\nwithout the consent of the holders thereof, from time to time to redeem the whole or any number of the said [7%] cumulative preference shares at One hundred and ten (110%) per centum of their par value, together with any accumulated dividends thereon.\nThe company had the further right, by supplementary Letters Patent, to issue 5 per cent, cumulative convertible preference shares of the par value of $100 each as well as additional common shares without nominal or par value. What actually was done was that the company created and issued a new series of securities (both preference and common shares) and from the proceeds of the sale of these securities realized nearly fifteen million dollars in cash out of which to pay, and did in fact pay, in cash the redemption price of the outstanding preference shares, including what has been called the premium thereon of 10 per cent.\nThe sole question in this appeal is whether or not the appellants are liable for income tax on the $10 per share received by them as part of the redemption moneys. The Minister of National Revenue contends that they are liable under section 17 of the Income War Tax Act as it stood when the said shares were redeemed. That section as it stood at the material date had been enacted by ch. 10 of the Statutes of 1926 in the following words:\nWhere a corporation, having undistributed income on hand, redeems its shares at a premium paid out of such income, the premium shall be deemed to be a dividend and to be income received by the shareholder. This provision was carried into the Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, and remained in force until repealed in 1934 (by ch. 55, section 9, of the Statutes of 1934) and present section 17, which does not affect the issue in this appeal, was substituted in the following words:\nWhere a corporation redeems its shares at a premium, the premium shall be deemed to be a dividend and to be income received by the shareholder.\nThe appellants contend they are not liable, in that the said moneys were not \"paid out of\" undistributed income of the company \"on hand\" within the meaning of section 17. Counsel for the Minister very frankly and accurately set out in their factum certain facts that were proved at the trial in the Exchequer Court. I set out below a complete paragraph that appears in the respondent's factum:\nOn April 30th, 1929, that is fifteen days before the redemption of the 7 per cent preference shares the company was indebted to the Bank in the sum of $6,040,657.99. Between that date and May 16th, the company received cash as follows: in respect of common share subscriptions\u2014$3,737,449.30; in respect of the sale of 5 per cent preference shares\u2014$11,010,900; and in respect of ordinary operations\u2014$398,693.04, making a total of $15,147,042.34. These receipts were utilized as follows: The sum of $971,510.59 was expended for current operations during the period, the sum of $5,000,000 was transferred to a special bank account called the Preference Dividend Account and it was out of this fund that the redemption payments were made, and finally the Bank loan above mentioned was paid off. The company after making these several disbursements, still had a credit balance of $3,124,873.66 on May 15th. This surplus, however, was rapidly depleted as funds were transferred to the preference dividend account to meet redemption cheques as presented. By May 17th, the company was once more indebted to the Bank and the redemption cheques paid on that day and the following days were paid out of loans or advances by the Bank. The Massey stock was paid for by cheques which were accepted for payment on May 15th.\nUpon these admitted facts, how can the respondent contend that the $10 per share was \"paid out of undistributed income on hand\"?\nThe governing section (17) at the time of the transaction was not, as it is to-day, \"Where a corporation redeems its shares at a premium, the premium shall be deemed to be a dividend and to be income received by the shareholder,\" nor did it declare that premiums \"shall be deemed to be paid out of income\" as section 21 (6), as enacted by the 1926 statute, had declared with respect to dividends actually declared by a personal corporation. The liability under the section as it stood at the time of the transaction involved two matters of fact\u2014(1) undistributed income \"on \"hand,\" and, (2) a premium \"paid out of\" such income. The evidence plainly does not establish, in my opinion, the facts necessary to support the contention advanced by the Minister.\nAlthough the income of a beneficiary from an estate is (apart from non-residents) not assessable at its source in the hands of the trustee but assessable against the beneficiary who receives the same, except in those cases where income is accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests (section 11), the appellants at no time disputed liability upon the ground that the 10 per cent. payment sought to be taxed was not accumulating in their hands but had been received by the beneficiaries, and it must therefore be taken for the purpose of this appeal that if the 10 per cent. payment in question came under old section 17, the trustees are liable to be assessed.\nThe question whether or not the $10 per share of the $111.75 per share paid by the company for the redemption of its shares was strictly \"a premium\" was not raised. It has been assumed throughout that it was and the appeal has been dealt with on that basis, but I should like to reserve the point for consideration should it ever come up in another case. There may well be a difference between the case where a company, having authority to do so, offers its shareholders an opportunity to turn back their shares to the company in payment of a bonus or premium, and the case such as this where the shares were sold to the public with certain defined rights, permitted by statutory authority, which included a right in the company, without the consent of the shareholders, from time to time to redeem the shares at a fixed price (i.e., 110 per cent. of their par value). A company may sell its preference shares, of a par value of $100 each, at $105 or $110 or for any amount in excess of the par value, and if it has authority to repurchase these shares at any time and obligates the holder to resell at any time at a fixed price, I doubt that the exercise of that right of repurchase is redeeming the shares \"at a premium.\" The right here given to the company was not restricted, as it is under section 46 of the English Act of 1929 which provides that a company may, if so authorized by its articles, issue preference shares which are, or at the option of the company are to be liable, to be redeemed provided that no such shares shall be redeemed except out of profits of the company which would otherwise be available for dividends or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purposes of the redemption.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment appealed from and the decision of the Minister and the assessment, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Armstrong & Sinclair.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

There was no marriage contract between the consorts and by the law of Quebec they are presumed to have intended to subject themselves, as regards their rights of property, to the law of their matrimonial domicile, i.e., the domicile of the husband at the time of the marriage. And the principal question at issue in this case is whether such domicile was in Quebec where in the absence of a marriage contract community as to property is presumed or was at another place where in such a case separation as to property would be presumed. The husband, born at St. Germain, Quebec, in 1894, went to the United States in quest of work in 1923. In the fall of that year, his father, mother, brothers and sisters followed him, but they returned to Quebec in 1928, several months before the marriage. The respondent born at the same place in 1905, went in 1922 to Bristol, in the State of Connecticut, also in quest of work and remained there except for a period of eleven months during which she lived with her family in Quebec. The marriage took place at Bristol in September, 1928, and two years later, the respondent and her husband returned to St. Germain, with the intention of building a home somewhere in Quebec. The husband also testified that he had taken out some papers connected with American citizenship; but these papers were not produced and the nature of the representations made for the purpose of obtaining them were not disclosed. The trial judge maintained the respondent's action, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld that it was incumbent upon the respondent to establish the existence of a regime of non-community of property in the matrimonial domicile. The only evidence as to foreign law consisted of an admission that the regime of community of property did not prevail' in the state of Connecticut. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the respondent to establish a domicile in Connecticut. The evidence did not establish by strict and conclusive proof a fixed settled intention on the part of the husband to make his permanent residence in the state of Connecticut or, in other words, a residence there, not merely for a particular purpose, not merely for the purpose of getting work there, but a permanent residence \"general and indefinite in its future contemplation,\" and, therefore, from the facts and circumstances of the case, inference should be drawn that the husband had not acquired at the time of his marriage a domicile in the state of Connecticut. If so, the law of his former domicile, i.e., the law of Quebec, must determine the matrimonial status of the respondent, and according to that law the respondent is presumed to be commune en biens. Therefore the respondent cannot sue in her own name for recovery of damages for personal injuries and her action should be dismissed.\nThe principles by which the courts are governed when it is alleged that a domicile of origin, or a domicile of birth, has been changed and a new domicile has been acquired are, first, that a domicile of origin cannot be lost until a new domicile has been acquired; that the process of the acquisition of a new domicile involves two factors,\u2014the acquisition of residence in fact in a new place with the intention of permanently settling there: of remaining there \"for the rest of his natural life,\" in the sense of making that place his principal residence indefinitely. In other words, a domicile of origin is not lost by the fact of the domiciled person having left the country in which he was so domiciled with the intention of never returning; but it is essential that he shall have acquired a new domicile, that is to say, that he shall in fact have taken up residence in some other country with the fixed, settled determination of making it his principal place of residence, not for some particular purpose, but indefinitely.\nQuaere as to admissibility of direct evidence as to intention.\u2014Dictum of Mignault J. in Taylor v. Taylor ([1930] S.C.R. 26) ref.\nThe strict rule as to concurrent findings of fact is not applicable to the circumstances of this case.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 64 K.B. 484) reversed. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Denis J. and maintaining the respondent's action for $3,000 damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nC. A. S\u00e9guin K.C. and G. Ringuet K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court (Mr. Justice Cannon taking no part in it) was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The respondent is a married woman and, by the law of the province of Quebec, the right of action for damages for personal injuries suffered by a married woman commune en hiens belongs exclusively to her husband and she cannot sue for recovery of such damages in her own name, even with the authorization of her husband. An objection based upon this rule is raised by the defendant who appeals, and who alleges that the plaintiff comes within it, and, consequently, has no right of action against him.\nThe answer to these questions, admittedly, depends upon the matrimonial domicile for in this case there was no marriage contract and by the law of Quebec the consorts are presumed to have intended to subject themselves, as regards their rights of property, to the law of their matrimonial domicile. In the present case it is not disputed that the matrimonial domicile is the domicile of the husband at the time of the marriage.\nIt will be convenient, first, to state the undisputed, pertinent facts. The husband, Lionel Rajotte, was born at St. Germain de Grantham on the 22nd of July, 1894. In February, 1923, he went to the United States in quest of work. In the autumn of that year his father, mother, brothers and sisters followed him. They returned to St. Germain in May, 1928, several months before the marriage of Rajotte to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, whose name was also Rajotte, was also born at St. Germain de Grantham in March, 1905. In 1922 she went to Bristol, Connecticut, also in quest of work. She remained there except for a period of eleven months during which she lived with her family at St. Germain. She married her present husband at Bristol on the 4th of September, 1928. The members of her family went from St. Germain to Bristol and remained for a time but eventually returned to St. Germain where they were living at the time of the trial. Two years after the marriage, they returned to St. Germain. In the declaration her husband is described as \"Lionel Rajotte de St. Germain de Grantham.\"\nThe respondent, by her pleading, alleges:\nQu'elle est l'\u00e9pouse s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens de Lionel Rajotte de St. Germain de Grantham, autoris\u00e9e par ce dernier aux fins des pr\u00e9sentes;\nand, in support of this allegation that she is separate as\nto property, evidence was adduced intended to establish a matrimonial domicile in the state of Connecticut. The conclusions of the learned trial judge as to this point are stated in his judgment in the following two consider ants:\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'objection du d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e0 Paction de la demanderesse, bas\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9tention que cette derni\u00e8re ne serait pas mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens, doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour plusieurs raisons; tout d'abord, parce qu'il est prouv\u00e9 que la demanderesse est r\u00e9ellement mari\u00e9e sous le regime de la separation de biens; ensuite, parce que l'\u00e9tat matrimonial de la demanderesse ne concerne pas le d\u00e9fendeur qui n'y a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat; enfin, parce que si Taction n'appartenait pas \u00e0 la femme, parce que mari\u00e9e en communaut\u00e9 de biens, ce moyen aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre plaid\u00e9 par exception \u00e0 la forme, alors qu'il n'est plaid\u00e9 ni \u00e0 la forme, ni au fonds la d\u00e9fense au m\u00e9rite;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le choix de l'\u00e9tat matrimonial des \u00e9poux, irr\u00e9vocable apr\u00e8s le mariage, reste soumis \u00e0 leur seule volont\u00e9 avant le mariage, d'o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte que les tiers n'ont ni Tint\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9cessaire ni le droit de discuter l'intention pr\u00e9-nuptiale et les circonstances qui, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ont fait que les \u00e9poux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens;\nAnd the conclusion of the Court of King's Bench is expressed as follows:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il ressort des faits et des circonstances rapport\u00e9s, que le 4 septembre 1928, alors que la demanderesse et son \u00e9poux se sont mari\u00e9s \u00e0 Bristol, dans le Connecticut, l'un des Etats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique, tous deux, et sp\u00e9cialement la man, y avaient \u00e9tabli d\u00e9j\u00e0 leurs domiciles; que, n'ayant pas fait de contrat de mariage, ils se sont done mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens, suivant l'admission des parties concernant la loi du lieu; qu'en cons\u00e9quence la demanderesse, assist\u00e9e de son mari, a capacit\u00e9 d'ester en justice en la pr\u00e9sente cause;\nBefore proceeding to examine the evidence, it is desirable, perhaps, first, to state some settled principles by which the courts are governed when it is alleged that a domicile of origin, or a domicile of birth., has been changed and anew domicile has been acquired.\nThe subject came before this Court in the case of Wadsworth v. McCord[2] in the year 1886; and the rules and principles by which the courts must be guided in deciding such questions under the law of Quebec were very fully considered. There was an appeal to the Privy Council which was dismissed[3]; and the. judgment of the Board delivered by Sir Barnes Peacock implies that the rules for determination of international domicile do not differ from the generally recognized rules which are fully stated and illustrated in the judgment of Sir William Ritchie in this court. After quoting fully from the judgments of the Peers in Bell v. Kennedy[4], Udny v. Udny[5] and the Lauderdale Peerage case[6], the learned Chief Justice proceeds (p. 478):\nI cannot discover that these principles are peculiar to the law of England; they are of universal application as principles of private international law, and so far as the province of Quebec is concerned, there is nothing in the law of that province antagonistic to them.\nThe judgments of Henry J. and Gwynne J. proceed upon the same principle.\nThe principles which ought, I think, to be kept steadily in view and rigorously applied in this case are, first, that a domicile of origin cannot be lost until a new domicile has been acquired; that the process of the acquisition of a new domicile involves two factors,\u2014the acquisition of residence in fact in a new place and the intention of permanently settling there: of remaining there, that is to say, as Lord Cairns says, \"for the rest of his natural life,\" in the sense of making that place his principal residence indefinitely.\nIt will be necessary, I think, to consider rather carefully the evidence as to the change of residence in fact, but before going into that, it will be useful, I think, to discuss more fully the point of intention. As Lord Westbury says in Udny v. Udny[7] (page 457) the residence for the purpose\nmust be residence fixed not for a limited period or particular purpose, but general and indefinite in its future contemplation.\nAgain, it was laid down in the Lauderdale Peerage case[8] (I am quoting from the head-note)\na change of domicile must be a residence sine animo revertendi. A temporary residence for the purposes of health, travel, or business does not change the domicile. Also (1) every presumption is to be made in favour of the original domicile; (2) no change can occur without an actual residence in a new place; and (3) no new domicile can be obtained without a clear intention of abandoning the old.\nIn this case two things must be established, first, a residence in Connecticut, not merely for a particular purpose, not merely for the purpose of getting work there, but a permanent residence \"general and indefinite in its future contemplation.\"\nIn Winans v. Attorney-General[9], Lord Macnaghten quotes from Lord Westbury with approval to the effect that the animus manendi necessary to change the domicile of origin to a new domicile means a fixed and settled purpose and on the same page he quotes the language of Lord Cairns as follows:\nTo the same effect was the inquiry which Lord Cairns proposed for the consideration of the House in Bell v. Kennedy[10]. It was this: Whether the person whose domicil was in question had \"determined\" to make, and had, in fact, made the alleged domicil of choice \"his home with the intention of establishing himself and his family there, and ending his days in that country?\"\nAnd again, on page 292, Lord Macnaghten says:\nMy Lord, if the authorities I have cited are still law, the question which your Lordships have to consider must, I think, be this: Has it been proved \"with perfect clearness and satisfaction to yourselves\" that Mr. Winans had at the time of his death formed a \"fixed and settled purpose\"\u2014\"a determination \"\u2014\" a final and deliberate intention\"\u2014to abandon his American domicil and settle in England?\nI think it is important also to emphasize this: the requirement of strict and conclusive proof is one which is naturally exacted owing to the very grave consequences entailed by a change of domicile. Lord Buckmaster says in Ramsay v. Liverpool[11]:\nThe law upon the matter is settled. A domicile of origin can be changed and in its place a domicil of choice acquired, but the alteration is a serious matter not to be lightly assumed, for it results in a complete change of law in relation to two of the most important facts of life, marriage and devolution of property. This is admirably expressed by Lord Curriehill in Donaldson v. McClure[12] in words unnecessary to repeat, which were expressly approved by Lord Halsbury in Marchioness of Huntly v. Gaskell[13].\nAnd, to quote once more from Lord Macnaghten's judgment in Winans v. Attorney-General[14], he says: \"And,\" says his Lordship (referring to Lord Westbury in Bell v. Kennedy[15])\n\"unless you are able to shew that with perfect clearness and satisfaction to yourselves, it follows that a domicil of origin continues.\" So heavy is the burden cast upon those who seek to shew that the domicil of origin has been superseded by a domicil of choice! And rightly, I think. A change of domicil is a serious matter\u2014serious enough when the competition is between two domicile both within the ambit of one and the same kingdom or country\u2014more serious still when one of the two is altogether foreign. The change may involve far-reaching consequences in regard to succession and distribution and other things which depend on domicil.\nBefore proceeding to discuss the facts, it, perhaps, ought to be added that a domicile of origin is not lost by the fact of the domiciled person having left the country in which he was so domiciled with the intention of never returning. It is essential that he shall have acquired a new domicile, that is to say, that he shall in fact have taken up residence in some other country with the fixed, settled determination of making it his principal place of residence, not for some particular purpose, but indefinitely.\nThis factor is of great importance in the present case. The issue is not whether the husband had left Quebec with the intention of settling somewhere in the United States and not returning to Quebec, but whether he had taken up his residence in the State of Connecticut with a fixed, settled determination of making his permanent residence in that state.\nThe point is dealt with in the judgments in Wahl v. Attorney-General[16]. The person whose domicile was in question there had been born in Germany and had a domicile of origin in Germany. He came to England and, after residing there for some years, applied for naturalization as a British subject under the Aliens Act of 1870. In his application he declared that he intended to continue to reside permanently within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and that he had no intention of permanently leaving the United Kingdom. The argument addressed to the courts in favour of change of domicile naturally emphasized this declaration and, indeed, the declaration was considered by Lord Macmillan as sufficient to turn the scale in discharging the onus resting upon the Attorney-General. Lords Dunedin, Warrington, Atkin and Thankerton rejected the contention and the House of Lords held that the domicile of origin had not been thrown off.\nLord Dunedin's judgment seems to me to be very useful in its application to the present case and I quote it in full:\nI have had the advantage of reading the opinion which will be delivered by Lord Atkin, and as I agree in omnibus with it I do not think it necessary to deliver a full opinion. Were it not for the declaration I do not think that in the light of many cases decided as to domicile anyone would say that the determination exuere patriam was proved. Coming to the declaration I make three remarks. First, naturalisation does not carry with it as an inevitable consequence change of domicile. Second, in signing the declaration it is extremely unlikely that the question of domicile was before his mind. Third, the declaration itself is ambiguous, for residence in the United Kingdom as an intention does not discriminate between English and Scotch domicile, though these are essentially different. It seems to me to put too great a burden on the class of residence in England which has been proved, not only to establish the factum, but to turn the ambiguity of expression as to the animus into a certainty.\nI think the appeal should be allowed.\nI may add that the judgment of Lord Atkin, in which Lord Dunedin concurs, illustrates admirably, I think, the searching analysis to which it is the practice of the courts to subject the facts adduced in support of an allegation that a domicile of origin has been changed and a new domicile acquired.\nBut my immediate purpose is to emphasize the third of Lord Dunedin's \"three remarks.\" An intention to reside in the United Kingdom, although it may be a starting point as evidence, tells us nothing per se as to change of domicile. So with regard to the United States, an intention indefinite as to locality to live somewhere in the United States is in itself inconclusive where the question at issue is: Has A, the person whose domicile is in dispute, taken up residence in a given state with the intention of residing permanently in that State? Residing in Philadelphia with the intention, not of making his permanent home in Philadelphia, but of making his home in Philadelphia, Baltimore or Washington, could not be effective to displace the domicile of origin.\nLord Dunedin's judgment suggests the advisability of entering a caveat against a possible misunderstanding. There are passages in the judgments of very eminent judges which seem to lay down this: that the intention necessary to constitute a change of domicile must amount to an intention directed to a change of civil status. I do not mean, of course, a change of political status (nationality), by which one ceases to be the subject of one country and becomes the subject of another, but a change of civil status by which it may be said, for want of a better expression, that one ceases to be the citizen of one country and becomes, to borrow the expression of Vice-Chancellor Wickens in the judgment to which I am now going to refer, \"the citizen of another.\" That view is discussed by Vice-Chancellor Wickens in Douglas v. Douglas[17] in a judgment which in some respects, at all events, is approved by Lord Macnaghten in Winans v. Attorney-General[18]; and that very learned judge feels himself forced to the conclusion that that is not the rule of English law, although he thinks such a rule would be a very convenient one.\nOn the other hand, there is a judgment of a very great judge, Lord Justice Turner in Jopp v. Wood[19] in which he employs language at least pointing; in the other direction which is quoted bv Ritchie C.J. in Wadsworth v. McCord[20]. Then there is the well known judgment of Lord Halsbury in Huntly v. Gaskell[21], and the passage in that judgment at pages 66 and 67 in which he approves the judgment of Lord Curriehill in Donaldson v. McClure[22], whose judgment, as Lord Halsbury says, was approved and quoted by Lord President Inglis in the case of Steel v. Steel[23]., Lord Curriehill's judgment, and the passage in Lord Halsbury's judgment to which I have referred, appear to have been accepted by Lord Buckmaster in Ramsay v. Liverpool[24]. It is not, in my view, necessary for the purposes of this case to consider the effect of those passages. I refer to 'the topic only because Lord Dunedin's language, which I have quoted, suggests the possibility that his view was in accord with that of Lord President Inglis and Lord Curriehill.\nYou cannot of course have a change of domicile in the international sense unless you acquire a new domicile in a jurisdiction in which, having acquired it, you acquire a new civil status in the sense mentioned by Wickens, V.C. But it is unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to express any opinion in the question whether the intention to acquire a new domicile as a factor in producing the legal result involves a specific intention to acquire a new civil status.\nSo far as this particular case is concerned, it must be remembered that the only change of domicile in question is that found by the Court of King's Bench, a change of domicile to Connecticut. Prima facie, the law of the foreign country would be the law of Quebec, that is to say, any party to an action alleging that a married woman was separate as to property would have to prove in proceedings in the Quebec courts either that there was a marriage contract, or that the law governing the several rights of the spouses in respect of their property is different from the law of Quebec; and the respondents rely upon an admission given at the trial that, by the law of Connecticut, a wife marrying without a marriage contract is separate as to property. The question with which we are strictly concerned then is: Had the husband acquired at the time of the marriage a domicile in Connecticut?\nThe facts in evidence are of the most meagre nature. The husband was born at St. Germain de Grantham in Quebec in 1894 and lived in that village with his parents until the year 1923 when he went to the United States. It is rather important to follow the evidence closely. The husband himself says that at the time he was married he had been in the United States since the 18th of February, 1923; that he was married in 1928: that during the period between 1923 and 1928 he had always lived in the United States; that he was a journeyman carpenter and worked on construction; that his parents were living in St. Germain and that after he went to the United States the family went there also. D. Dan 3 la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, ils sont partis pour les Etats-Unis? R. Je les ai fait demander aux Etats-Unis, ils sont mont\u00e9s.\nD. Pourquoi les avez-vous fait demander? R. Pour s'en venir rester aux Etats-Unis.\nD. Parce que vous vouliez y rester? R. Oui.\nD. Maintenant, est-ce que votre famille demeure encore aux Etats-Unis? R. Non.\nD. Pendant combien de temps votre famille est-elle demeur\u00e9e aux Etats-Unis? R. Cinq ans.\nD. Au moment de votre mariage, est-ce que la famille \u00e9tait aux Etats-Unis? R. En Canada, depuis le mois de mai.\nD. Apr\u00e8s votre mariage combien de temps \u00eates-vous rest\u00e9 aux Etats-Unis vous-m\u00eame? R. Je me suis mari\u00e9 dans le mois de septembre, je suis descendu au bout de deux ans, dans le mois de septembre, le 11 septembre.\nD. Aviez-vous l'intention, au moment de votre mariage, de revenir au Canada ou aviez-vous l'intention de rester aux Etats-Unis? R. J'avais l'intention de rester aux Etats-Unis.\nD. Etait-ce pour cela que vous aviez pris vos papiers am\u00e9ricains? R. Certainement.\nTwo years after his marriage he and his wife returned to St. Germain; and he says, \"Je suis revenu au Canada avec l'id\u00e9e de b\u00e2tir \u00e0 Drummondville\".\nNow, it will be observed that through the whole of this evidence there is nothing to show a residence in fact-in the State of Connecticut. In cross-examination, it is true, there is this question and answer:\nQ. Vous \u00e9tiez menuisier, vous dites, \u00e0 Bristol? A. Oui.\nBut there is nothing, I repeat, to show even a residence in fact in Bristol or in Connecticut. As to intention, apart from Rajotte's direct evidence as to intention, there are certainly no facts upon which an inference could reasonably be founded of an intention to settle permanently in Connecticut or anywhere in the United States. It is contended that he was domiciled in Bristol but, apart from the general statement quoted above, there is no evidence; and there are no concrete facts which would indicate the circumstances of his being there. Had he a house? Was he living in lodgings? Had he anything in the nature of permanent employment? His family, he says, were in the United States for some years, returning to Quebec before the marriage, but he does not tell us where. Nor is there anything about the circumstances or conditions of their life. I will come to his direct evidence as to intention in a moment.\nAs to evidence of the wife, she says that she had been living in Bristol about five years at the time of her marriage and that her family came to the United States two years after she did; that she was seventeen or eighteen years old when she left Quebec for the United States; and that she went there to work. She says that her father was a farmer and that the family had gone to Bristol in search of. work but still retained the ownership of the farm. Except as to direct evidence of intention, to which I shall come in a moment, there are not facts stated in her evidence from which it could properly be inferred that she had gone to Connecticut or, indeed, to the United States with the purpose of making her permanent home there.\nBefore coming to the direct evidence of intention, it is desirable, I think, to refer to some judicial observations. In Wadsworth v. McCord[25], Dorion, C.J., says this:\nAs Merlin, vo. Domicile, says, there is nothing more difficult to decide than questions of domicile. This was said in France where the population is sedentary, but the difficulty here is greatly increased. Here is a man who left Ireland a grown up person. His domicile was in Ireland. The law is clear that the domicile of origin is the real domicile until another domicile has been acquired. Twenty or thirty years may intervene, but if the person has not acquired another domicile the domicile of origin continues to be his domicile. There was a case lately in Ontario (Magurn v. Magurn[26]) where a man had been twelve years away from his domicile, and it was held that his original domicile was still his domicile.\nTo the same effect is the observation of Lord Wensleydale in Whicker v. Hume[27]:\nI perfectly agree with my noble and learned friend that, in these times of visiting abroad, transferring oneself even for years abroad, you must look very narrowly into the nature of the residence abroad before you deprive an Englishman living abroad of his English domicile.\nLord Macnaghten uses similar language in Winans v. Attorney-General[28]:\n* * * you must look very narrowly into the nature of a residence suggested as a domicil of choice before you deprive a man of his native domicil.\nIt is well, I think, to keep this consideration in mind when asking ourselves the question whether there are any facts in this case apart from the direct evidence of intention from which it can be seriously argued that an inference arises that either husband or wife had a fixed and settled purpose of remaining indefinitely in Bristol or Connecticut or even in the United States.\nI come now to the direct evidence of intention. First of all, there is a question whether such evidence is admissible. The observation of Mr. Justice Mignault, speaking on behalf of the majority of this Court in Taylor v. Taylor[29] appears to me to be an obiter dictum. It is not, so far as I can see, a part of or a step in the ratio decidendi; consequently, it is open to challenge in this Court and, when challenged, it would be our duty to examine the point on the merits. Nevertheless, it is the deliberate opinion of Mr. Justice Mignault, concurred in by the late Chief Justice of this Court and by my brother Rinfret. I do not find it necessary to decide now whether it correctly states the law of Quebec. Remembering who the learned judges were who were responsible for it, I should feel called upon to weigh the question with great care before differing from them.\nThe English rule is, no doubt, different. The rule, I think, is correctly stated on page 204 of Halsbury's Laws of England (Hailsham Ed.), Vol. 6, in these words:\nDirect evidence of intention is often not available, but a person whose domicil is in question may himself give evidence of his intentions, present or past. Evidence of this nature is to be accepted with considerable reserve;, even though no suspicion may be entertained of the truthfulness of the witness.\nAssuming, but not deciding, that this is the law of Quebec, it is, of course, of the greatest importance to analyse direct testimony as to intention with care and to ascertain precisely what is the nature of the intention which the witness is ascribing to himself at the pertinent period.\nThe two witnesses in this case are the plaintiff and her husband. I have gone through the evidence of the husband with great care and there is no statement by him that he had a fixed settled intention to make his permanent residence either at Bristol or in the state of Connecticut. He mentioned the fact that he had taken out some papers connected with American citizenship. The papers are not produced and of the nature of the representations made for the purpose of obtaining them we are not informed. The fact that he made some such application is, in the circumstances of this case, not a weighty fact for the reason (if for no other) given by Lord Dunedin in the judgment quoted above, namely, that there are many jurisdictions in the United States where a separate domicile in the international sense could be acquired, and that such an act is necessarily too equivocal to determine the question whether the applicant intended to make his permanent home in a particular state.\nThen, for the same reason that the declaration in Wahl's case[30], as to the intention to reside in the United Kingdom, was inconclusive upon the issue whether a domicile had been acquired in England, the direct evidence of Rajotte that he intended to remain the United States\u2014and his evidence goes no further than this\u2014can really be of no weight in determining whether or not he acquired a domicile in Connecticut or in any other state. These observations apply equally to the evidence of the respondent.\nThis is not a case in which, I think, the rule as to concurrent findings of fact ought to be applied, apart altogether from the question of the admissibility of direct testimony as to intention. It seems abundantly clear that the learned trial judge must have misdirected himself. He could hardly have appreciated the consideration that the domicile of origin could not be displaced until another domicile had been acquired; and that it was essential for the plaintiff to prove that her husband had a domicile in Connecticut, which was the state in which they were married, and the only state in respect of which there was an admission as to the matrimonial law. The majority of the Court of King's Bench appear also to have overlooked the fact that the direct evidence of intention, even if accepted at its face value, was inconclusive because the intention deposed to was not the only intention that could be relevant, namely, an intention to reside permanently in Connecticut.\nMoreover, domicile of choice is a conclusion or inference which the law derives from certain facts (per Lord Westbury, Udny v. Udny[31]), and I have not found a case in which the rule as to concurrent findings of fact has been applied to concurrent conclusions on the issue (usually one of mixed fact and law) that a particular domicile has been acquired or has been cast off. In Wadsworth v. McCord[32] this Court reversed the concurrent conclusions as to domicile of the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench. In Winans v. Attorney-General[33], the House of Lords reversed the concurrent conclusions of Kennedy and Phillimore JJ. before whom the information was heard, and of the Court of Appeal. In Wahl v. Attorney-General[34], the House of Lords reversed the concurrent conclusions as to domicile of the King's Bench Division and of the Court of Appeal. In Bell v. Kennedy[35] the House of Lords reversed the concurrent findings of Lord Kinloch and the Second Division of the Court of Session. In all these cases the critical question concerned the proper inference to be drawn from the facts in evidence. The rule mentioned has, I think, no relevancy in this case.\nAs regards the suggestion made from the Court that the husband might now be added as a party respondent, we are satisfied that, since it follows from our judgment that the wife, the plaintiff of record, had no cause of action, the Court of King's Bench would not in such circumstances, under the practice prevailing in the province of Quebec, have substituted the husband as plaintiff.\nIt is not necessary to consider the question of prescription and we express no opinion on it.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppedal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett & Hanna.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gaston Ringuet.\n[1] (1938) Q.R. 64 K.B. 484, reported as X v.

V, c. 48, ss. 8 and 11.\nThe respondent was incorporated by an Act of the legislature of Quebec with powers to construct a railway in that province. Some time prior to 1912, the respondent had begun the construction of a branch line from a point on its main line of railway for a distance of about 175 miles. By the Railway Subsidies Act, (1912) 2 Geo. V, c. 48, the Governor in Council was authorized to grant a subsidy to the respondent for an extension of this branch line \"not exceeding 50 miles\" in length, a distance of 40\u00b734 miles in length having at that time been already constructed. In addition, the respondent and the Minister of Railways for Canada entered into two supplemental agreements in writing which provided for the construction of the railway extension, for payment of this subsidy in the manner and time therein set forth and in accordance with section 11 of the Act, for the completion of the whole extension by August 1, 1916, declaring time \"to be essential and of the essence of the agreement\" and providing that \"in default of completion thereof within such time the company shall forfeit absolutely all right and title, claims and demands, to any and every part of the subsidy or subsidies payable under this agreement whether for instalments thereof at the time of such default earned and payable by reason of the completion of a portion of the line, or otherwise howsoever.\" The respondent received $43,161.06 as payment on account of subsidy for the completion of ten miles of the road in the spring of 1915; and on August 1, 1916, 24\u00b717 miles only of the line, in all, had been built, no further mileage ever having been constructed. The respondent, by its petition of right, claimed payment of the subsidy upon the line of railway so far completed, less the amount received on account; and it also claimed payment for services rendered in accordance with section 8 of the Act which provides that every company operating a railway, or portion of a railway, subsidized under the Act \"shall each year furnish to the Government of Canada transportation for * * * mail * * * over the portion of the lines in respect of which it has received such subsidy and, whenever required shall furnish mail cars properly equipped for such mail service\" and that in or towards payment for such charges the Government of Canada \"shall be credited by the company with a sum equal to three per cent per annum on the amount of the subsidy received by the company under the Act.\" The Exchequer Court of Canada held that the respondent was not entitled to recover any subsidy whatever; and it also held that with regard to the payment for services rendered in accordance with section 8 of the Act, the continuous extensions of the respondent's branch line, upon which subsidies have been paid, must be treated as a single line of railway and as if constructed under one subsidy contract; and it held further that the annual credits of interest upon subsidy as provided for in the Act were not cumulative.\nHeld, affirming; the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada in this respect, that all rights in respect of subsidies accrued or accruing were subject to a radical condition that, unless the work was completed on the prescribed date, they would be forfeited if they had not already been liquidated in money, and therefore the respondent is not entitled to recover the amount of subsidies claimed by its petition of right.\nPer The Chief Justice:\u2014The view upon which the Governor in Council acted apparently was that the statutory authority to pay came to an end on the prescribed date if the work had not then been completed; clause 5 of the subsidy contract which declares the effect of failure to complete the whole line by the first of August, 1916, was intended to give effect to that view of the statute. That condition was not overridden by the supplemental agreement: when the Subsidy Act is considered as a whole the conclusion must be that clause 5 had not the effect of defeating the intention of the statute. The enactment touching the date of completion cannot be regarded as directory merely and the Governor in Council did not exceed the discretion necessarily vested in him respecting the subsidiary terms of the contract in exacting conditions intended to secure the due and timely completion of the lines subsidized.\nHeld, also, varying the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that, for the purpose of construing section 8 of the Act, each section of the line was a separate \"railway or portion of railway subsidized under the Act\"; and, therefore, the credit of three per cent per annum on the amount of the subsidy received could only be applied towards the payment of charges for services rendered upon the section of railway in respect of which the subsidy was granted and paid.\nHeld further, affirming the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that the annual credits of interest upon subsidy as provided for in the Act were not cumulative.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1938] Ex. C.R. 82) varied.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the respondent was not entitled to recover subsidies from the Crown, but granting payment for services as to carriage of mails in accordance with provisions of the Railway Subsidies Act, 2 Geo. V, c. 48.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and F. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and D. I. McNeill for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The decision of this appeal is governed principally by section 11 of the Subsidy Act of 1912 (2 Geo. V, ch. 48) and of the supplementary contract of the 18th of January, 1915. The language of the statutory provision and of the contract is, of course, of cardinal importance and I reproduce them textually:\n11. Whenever a contract has been duly entered into with a company for the construction of any line of railway hereby subsidized, the Minister of Railways and Canals, at the request of the Company, and upon the report of the chief engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals and his certificate that he has made careful examination of the surveys, plans and profile of the whole line so contracted for, and has duly considered the physical characteristics of the country to be traversed and the means of transport available for construction, naming the reasonable and probable cost of such construction, may, with the authorization of the Governor in Council, enter into a supplementary agreement, fixing definitely the maximum amount of the subsidy to be paid, based upon the said certificate of the chief engineer and providing that the company shall be paid, as the minimum, the ordinary subsidy of $3,200 per mile, together with sixty per cent of the difference between the amount so fixed and the said $3,200 per mile, if any; and the balance, forty per cent, shall be paid only on completion of the whole work subsidized, and in so far as the actual cost, as finally determined by the Governor in Council upon the recommendation of the Minister of Railways and Canals, and upon the report and certificate of the said chief engineer, entitles the company thereto: Provided always\u2014\n(a) that the estimated cost, as certified, is not less on the average than $18,000 per mile for the whole mileage subsidized; (b) that no payment shall be made except upon a certificate of the chief engineer that the work done is up to the standard specified in the company's contract;\n(c) that in no case shall the subsidy exceed the sum of $6,400 per mile.\n* * *\nSupplemental agreement made this eighteenth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and fifteen.\nBetween His Majesty the King, represented herein by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, (referred to herein as the \"Minister\") acting under the authority of an Order in Council dated the fifth day of January, A.D. 1915, of the first part, and Quebec Central Railway Company, hereinafter called the \"Company,\" of the Second Part.\nWhereas under and by virtue of The Railway Subsidies Act, 1912, chapter 48, a subsidy contract was duly entered into between His Majesty the King and the Quebec Central Railway Company for the construction of a line of railway mentioned and set forth in paragraph 27 of the second section of the said Act, namely:\u2014\n\"27. To the Quebec Central Railway Company, for the following lines of railway:\n(a) * * *\n(b) For an extension of its line of railway from a point (31\u00b734 miles from St. George) in the parish of St. Sabine, county of Bellechasse, to a point in the township of Dionne, county of L'Islet; not exceeding 50 miles; not exceeding in all 51\u00b734 miles.\nas by reference to the said subsidy contract which is dated the seventeenth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, and filed in the Department of Railways and Canals under the number 20825, will more fully appear.\nAnd whereas by section 11 of the said Act it was enacted as follows:\n(Here follows section 11 already quoted).\nAnd whereas the Company having duly entered into the said subsidy contract, has requested that, in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, 1912, chapter 48, it be permitted to enter into such supplementary contract or agreement fixing the maximum and the minimum amount of the subsidy payable under the said subsidy contract.\nAnd whereas the Chief Engineer of the Government Railways has duly furnished, his certificate as required of him by the said Act in that behalf, making the sum of $26,200 as the probable and reasonable cost of the construction per mile of the line of railway mentioned.\nIt is therefore covenanted and agreed by and between His Majesty the King (represented as aforesaid, and under and by virtue of an Order in Council dated the fifth day of January, 1915, and pursuant to the said Act of 1912, chapter 48), for Himself and His Successors and the Company for itself and its successors and assigns, as follows, namely:\u2014\n1. That the maximum amount of subsidy to which the Company shall be entitled under the said subsidy contract is hereby fixed at $6,400 for the said 50 miles.\n2. That the minimum amount of subsidy to which the Company shall be entitled under the said subsidy contract shall be $3,200 per mile for the said 150 miles, together with sixty per cent of the difference between $6,400 per mile so fixed and the said $3,200 per mile. 3. That the balance, forty per cent, shall be paid only on completion of the whole work for the said 50 miles, and in so far as the actual cost, as finally determined by the Governor in Council, entitled the Company thereto.\nProvided always:\n(a) That no payment shall be made to the Company under these presents and the Company shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder except in compliance with the provisions of the statutes in each case made and provided and upon the certificate of the Chief Engineer that the work done is up to the standard specified in the Company's contract no. 20825.\n(b) That these presents shall be read with and taken to form part of the said subsidy contract no. 20825, and the line of railway therein mentioned shall be constructed, completed and operated by the Company and the subsidies authorized shall be paid by His Majesty subject to and in accordance with all the provisoes, covenants, agreements and conditions in such subsidy contract contained, except in so far as the said provisoes, covenants, agreements and conditions may be inconsistent with or varied by these presents.\nIn witness whereof, &c.\nThe first point to be noticed is that, by force of section 11 and of the contract executed under that section, the provisions of sections 2, 4 and 5 are in this case in great part superseded. It is evident that under section 11 it is on the footing of the report and certificate of the Chief Engineer\nas to the physical characteristics of the country to be traversed and the means of transport available for construction and the reasonable and probable cost of construction,\nsanctioned and acted upon by the Governor in Council, that the Company acquires the contractual right to the minimum subsidy of $3,200 a mile and 60% of the difference between that sum and the maximum fixed by the same authority on the basis of the Chief Engineer's certificate as to reasonable and probable cost. The provision of section 4 with regard to \"actual, necessary and reasonable cost\" does not come into operation in connection with this minimum subsidy.\nThen, as to section 5, that section provides that the subsidies shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada. There is nothing in section 11 or in the supplementary agreement which affects this provision. But the section proceeds to enact that the subsidies may be paid in three different ways which are enumerated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), at the option of the Governor in Council on the report of the Minister of Railways and Canals, subject, however, to the important condition \"unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act\"; a condition which, obviously, has in view section 11 and a supplementary agreement under that section.\nNow, when we look at these paragraphs we find that the first method of payment which the Governor in Council is authorized to adopt at his option is payment only upon completion of the work subsidized. That provision is incompatible with the nature of the contract authorized by section 11 under which the Company on the execution of the supplementary agreement \"shall be paid\" a minimum subsidy which (as section 11 and the contract obviously contemplate) is to be paid before the completion of the work subsidized.\nThen, when we come to (b), the method of payment there designated which the Governor in Council may adopt at his option is:\nBy instalments, on the completion of each ten-mile section of the railway, in the proportion which the cost of such completed section bears to that of the whole work undertaken.\nHere it seems clear that the method of payment may well result in payment of the whole of the subsidy allocated in respect of the particular ten-mile section in question when that section is completed, a method, again, inconsistent with the provisions of section 11 which contemplates the deferment of the payment of 40% of the excess of the maximum subsidy over $3,200 a mile until the final completion of the railway, and generally the scale and conditions of payment are not consistent with the terms of s. 11.\nOnce more, subsection (c) imposes a condition which does not appear to be contemplated by section 11.\nIn truth, section 4 and these paragraphs of section 5 are enactments which would appear to contemplate a subsidy wholly calculated and conditioned as defined by section 2 and not one governed by the terms of section 11. By section 2, a subsidy is authorized (in respect of the \"undermentioned railways\") of $3,200 a mile for each mile of railway for railways not exceeding an average of more than $15,000 per mile to construct, that is to say, for the mileage subsidized; and a further subsidy towards construction of the same lines of railway which shall cost more than $15,000 a mile on the average for the mileage subsidized; and that further subsidy is to amount to 50% on so much of the average cost of the mileage subsidized as is in excess of $15,000 per mile, so that, however, the subsidy shall not exceed \"in the whole $6,400 per mile.\"\nIt will be seen at once that this section contemplates a method differing radically from that contemplated by section 11 under which a minimum subsidy is fixed by the Governor in Council on the basis of the report and certificate of the Chief Engineer as to the nature of the country to be traversed and the facilities that will be available and the reasonable and probable cost of construction of the railway subsidized. The maximum and minimum subsidies are fixed in advance and the minimum subsidy is to be payable prior to the completion of the whole of the line.\nThe line with which we are concerned is defined in subsection 27 (b) of section 2 of the statute of 1912 which is in the following words:\n27. To the Quebec Central Railway Company, for the following lines of railway:\u2014\n(a) * * *\n(b) for an extension of its line of railway from a point (31\u00b734 miles from St. George) in the parish of St. Sabine, county of Bellechasse, to a point in the township of Dionne, county of L'Islet; not exceeding 50 miles; not exceeding in all 51\u00b734 miles.\nBy section 6 of the statute it is provided that the construction of the lines subsidized shall be commenced by the 1st of August, 1912, and completed within a reasonable length of time, not to exceed four years from the 1st of August, to be fixed by the Governor in Council\nand shall also be constructed according to descriptions, conditions and specifications approved by the Governor in Council on the report of the Minister of Railways and Canals, and specified in each case in a contract between the company and the said Minister, which contract the Minister, with the approval of the Governor in Council, is hereby empowered to make.\nUnder this section a contract was duly entered into between the respondents and the appellant on the 17th \u2022day of April, 1914, in respect of the work described in subsection 27 (b) pursuant to an Order in Council of the same date. By the Order in Council the time for completion was fixed at the 1st of August, 1916. The first ten miles of the work in question were completed by the spring of 1915 and the sum of $43,161.06 was paid to the Company under the subsidy agreement on or about the 17th of May, 1915. A further 13\u00b78 miles of the extension were completed some time prior to June, 1916; and before the 1st of August, 1916, additional construction had increased it to 24\u00b717 miles.\nThe Crown relies upon the terms of this contract of 1914, which contains three rather important clauses, 5, 8 and 9. These clauses are as follows:\n5. That the Company shall commence * * * the construction of the said line of railway within two years from the first day of August, 1912, and * * * shall complete the same on or before the ninth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and sixteen (1916) * * * time being declared to be material and of the essence of this agreement; and in default of completion thereof within such time the Company shall forfeit absolutely all right and title, claims and demands, to any and every part of the subsidy or subsidies payable under this agreement, whether for instalments thereof at the time of such default earned and payable by reason of the completion of a portion of the line, or otherwise howsoever.\n8. That the Company shall in all respects comply with and abide by, and the said line of railway shall be subject to, all the provisions of the Subsidy Act, and of any other Acts of Parliament applicable thereto, as fully and to the same extent as if such provisions were set out at length herein.\n9. That upon the performance and observance by the Company, to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council, of the foregoing clauses of this agreement, His Majesty will, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of sections two, four and five of the Sudsidy Act, pay to the Company so much of the subsidy or subsidies, hereinbefore set forth or referred to, as the Governor in Council having regard to the cost of the work performed shall consider the Company to be entitled to, in pursuance of the said Act.\n* * *\nAs to the first of these clauses, it is contended on behalf of the respondents that it is inoperative because the date, the 9th of March, is not the date fixed by the Governor in Council for the completion of the subsidized work. I am unable to accept this contention because I think for the purpose of construing the contract we must look at the Order in Council (which, as above mentioned, fixed the date of completion as August 1st, 1916) and correct the obvious slip in the fifth paragraph; especially in view of the fact that after the execution of the contract all parties acted on the date formally fixed by the Governor in Council as the governing date. It is also contended that the Governor in Council is not entitled to exact from the Company the terms and conditions of clause 5 because such terms and conditions are not contemplated by the statute. After the most careful consideration, I am unable to agree with this contention to which I shall refer later.\nOn behalf of the Crown it is contended, and the learned trial judge has proceeded upon this view, that notwithstanding the supplemental agreement, clause 5 of the agreement of 1914 remains in full force and that it is a complete answer to the Company's claim. Before examining the question, it will be convenient to notice the proceedings in relation to the payment of $43,000 odd for the section of ten miles completed in 1914. First of all, the following paragraph of the Order in Council authorizing the supplemental agreement should be read:\nThat application has been made by the Company for admission to a supplementary subsidy agreement, in pursuance of the said Act, section 11.\nThat under date the 22nd December, 1914, the Chief Engineer of the Department of Railways and Canals has furnished a certificate, as called for by the said section, showing the estimated reasonable and probable cost of such construction to be $1,312,430 or $26,200 per mile, for the total distance, 50 miles, of the said railway. He points out that the average cost in excess of $15,000 per mile is $11,200 which is more than sufficient to produce full \"Further Subsidy\" of $3,200 per mile in addition to the ordinary subsidy, making a total of $6,400 per mile, and that the maximum amount of subsidy payable, namely, the ordinary subsidy together with 60% of the \"further subsidy,\" is $5,120 per mile, the balance, 50% of the \"further subsidy\" to be payable as the final cost may be actually determined.\nThe Minister recommends that authority be given for entry into a Supplementary Subsidy Agreement with the Company, accordingly.\nThe terminology of the Chief Engineer's certificate is rather confused, but both section 11 of the Subsidy Act and the operative parts of the supplemental agreement make it clear that what is here described as the \"maximum amount of subsidy payable\" is the minimum subsidy.\nSome days after the execution of the agreement of the 18th of January, the Company applied for the minimum subsidy in respect of the ten miles completed amounting, as mentioned in the Order in Council, to $5,120 a mile, an aggregate of $51,200. The inspecting engineer in reply gave particulars of a calculation based partly on paragraph (6) of section 5 of the Subsidy Act and partly on the supplemental agreement, with the conclusion that the amount of subsidy earned was $43,161.60. On the 24th of February, Mr. Bowden, the Chief Engineer, gave a certificate stating that the work already done \"is up to the standard specified in the Company's contract\" (a certificate it should be noticed which conforms to the condition prescribed by section 3 (a) of the supplemental agreement) and, further, that \"the progress made justifies the payment of\" $43,161.60. On the 30th of March the Company wrote to the Chief Engineer pointing out that they were entitled to the payment of the minimum subsidy under the supplemental agreement; but the Governor in Council did not proceed beyond the recommendation of the Chief Engineer and by Order in Council of the 4th of May, 1914, authorized the payment of the sum mentioned.\nIn my view, the claim of the Company was at that time a just and well founded claim. The Company had constructed a part of the subsidized line. There was a certificate by the Chief Engineer that the work done was up to the standard specified in the subsidy contract of 1914 as required by section 3 (a) of the supplemental agreement.\nThe supplemental agreement had the effect, as I have observed, of superseding paragraph (b) of section 5 of the Subsidy Act in so far as concerns the minimum subsidy. Section 11 of that statute enacts explicitly that the \"supplementary agreement\" is to provide \"that the Company shall be paid as the minimum\" the minimum subsidy and, as I have observed, it is evident that no part of the minimum subsidy is to be deferred until the actual cost of the line has been ascertained at completion. The supplemental agreement itself (clause 2) declares that\nthe minimum subsidy to which the said Company shall be entitled * * * shall be $3,200 per mile * * * together with 60% of\nwhat had been ascertained as $3,200 per mile. The minimum subsidy under the statute and the contract (as appears from the certificate of the engineer, notwithstanding the confused terminology) for the ten miles completed in November, 1914, amounted to $51,200. If proceedings had been taken at that time to recover the difference between that sum and the sum paid, $43,000 odd, there could have been, I think, no answer to the Company's claim.\nAs regards the balance of the Company's claim, there are several distinctions: First, as to the Company's claim for the minimum subsidy in respect of the ten-mile section completed in 1914 (or the amount of it), clause 5 of the subsidy agreement of 1914 could have had no application. Second, the Crown admitted the Company was entitled to the proper proportion of the subsidy for the ten-mile section, the only dispute being as to the quantum. Third, the Company had a certificate of the Chief Engineer under clause 3 (a) of the supplemental agreement. As regards the balance of the claim, on the other hand, clause 5 is operative unless displaced by the supplemental agreement and no cause of action had arisen prior to the 1st of August, 1916, because the Engineer's certificate that the work (subsequent to 1914) is up to the standard of the subsidy agreement was not obtained until after that date. And finally, the dispute is not merely as to the amount but as to the right of the Company to any part of the statutory subsidy which the Crown alleges has lapsed.\nI now turn to the critical question raised by the appeal: whether clause 5 of the subsidy agreement of 1914 remained operative in respect of the minimum subsidy after the execution of the supplemental agreement. It was not argued that the Company is entitled to relief against the clause as a penalty or forfeiture. In the view expressed above of the effect of section 11 and the supplemental agreement in respect of the \"minimum subsidy\" that might, perhaps, have been contended on the authority of Steedman v. Drinkle[2]; but the circumstances which in that case gave the plaintiff a title to equitable relief have no parallel here (see the judgment of Farwell J. in Mussen v. Van Diemen's Land Realty Co.[3]) and I have not considered whether the Exchequer Court has power to grant such relief. However that may be, no such question arises.\nSince we are only concerned with the minimum subsidy it is, perhaps, convenient to consider first the question of the effect of the supplemental agreement in relation to its application to the minimum subsidy for the ten miles completed in November, 1914, in respect of which, as I have already said, the Company had a valid claim in 1915. If the clause applies to and excludes that claim, obviously, the Company must fail on the residue of its claim in respect of which, by reason of the absence of a certificate under clause 3 (a) of the supplemental agreement, no cause of action had been constituted on the 1st of August, 1916.\nClause 5 declares the effect of failure to complete the whole line by the 1st of August, 1916, is to extinguish any right to any part of a subsidy payable under the agreement whether for instalments thereof at the time of such default earned and payable by reason of the completion of a portion of the line or otherwise. \"Instalments ... earned and payable\" include, I think, sums to which there is a valid claim enforceable by petition of right. The clause, therefore, embraces in its scope the Company's claim in respect of the ten miles mentioned.\nThe question to be examined is whether the application of the clause is excluded, first, by section 11 and, second, by section 3 (6) of the supplemental agreement.\nI shall first consider the effect of the supplemental agreement. The precise point is whether clause 5 is \"inconsistent with or varied by\" the stipulations of the supplemental agreement. The latter document recites section 11 which enacts, as we have seen, that the agreement under it is to provide \"that the Company shall be paid\" the minimum subsidy without qualification; nevertheless, it is made plain in the supplemental agreement that its foundation is the subsidy contract of April, 1914. The subsidy contract is recited and the recital proceeds\nthe Company has requested that, in pursuance of the provisions of the said Act, 1912, chapter 48, it be permitted to enter into such supplementary contract or agreement fixing the maximum and the minimum amount of the subsidy payable under the said subsidy contract.\nBy clause 1 of the agreement it is stipulated that\nthe maximum amount of subsidy to which the Company shall be entitled under the subsidy shall be $6,400 per mile.\nBy clause 2 it is agreed that\nthe minimum amount of subsidy to which the Company shall be entitled under the subsidy contract shall be $3,200 per mile and 60% of the excess of the maximum subsidy over that figure. By clause 3 (6) it is provided that\n* * * these presents shall be read with and taken to form part of the subsidy contract * * * and the subsidies authorized shall be paid subject to and in accordance with all the provisoes, covenants, agreements and conditions in such, subsidy contract contained except in so far as (they) may be inconsistent with or varied by these presents.\nThe intention, as we have seen, of section 11 and the supplemental agreement is to fix the amount of the minimum subsidy payable before completion of the whole work, the right to which is in no way left to the discretion of the Crown and the provisions of clause 9 of the subsidy contract cannot, therefore, stand together with clause 2 of the later agreement. Clause 8 of the subsidy contract must be read in light of the fact that section 11 of the statute has become operative and, consequently, that the options given by section 5, subject to the condition \"unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act,\" are largely nullified.\nBut clause 5 stands in a different category. It says nothing as to the conditions under which the subsidies may be earned during the progress of the work prior to the date fixed for completion. It does say that if the Company have earned and are entitled to be paid the minimum subsidy, that right will be extinguished if they are not paid before August 1st, 1916. In effect it declares that any rights acquired or in process of being constituted before and at that date come to an end if the line is not then completed.\nThe effect is that all rights in respect of subsidies accrued or accruing are subject to a radical condition that, unless the work is completed on the prescribed date, they shall be forfeited if they have not already been liquidated in money.\nThe view on which the Governor in Council acted apparently was that the statutory authority to pay came to an end on the prescribed date if the work had not then been completed; clause 5 of the subsidy contract is, I think, intended to give effect to this view of the statute.\nAfter much hesitation I have come to the conclusion that this condition is not overridden by the supplemental agreement. When the Subsidy Act is considered as a whole, I do not think clause 5 has the effect of defeating the intention of the statute. The enactment touching the date of completion cannot, I think, be regarded as directory merely and I think the Governor in Council does not exceed the discretion necessarily vested in him respecting the subsidiary terms of the contract authorized by section 6 in exacting conditions intended to secure the due and timely completion of the lines subsidized.\nAs to section 11, I do not think that section properly understood in its relation to the other enactments of the Subsidy Act precludes the Governor in Council from insisting upon such a condition even as applied to the minimum subsidy.\nThe learned trial judge seems to think that the documentary evidence discloses an intention on the part of the Company to agree that section 5 (6) remained in full operation after the execution of the supplemental agreement. I cannot agree with this. The Company insisted in January and February, 1915, upon their right to the full minimum subsidy as defined by that agreement and section 11. It was the Government which insisted on acting under section 5 against the demand of the Company and in contravention of the terms of the supplemental agreement.\nThe remaining questions arise under section 8 which is in the following words:\n8. Every company receiving a subsidy under this Act, its successors and assigns, and any person or company controlling or operating the railway or portion of railway subsidized under this Act, shall each year furnish to the Government of Canada transportation for men, supplies, materials and mails over the portion of the lines in respect of which it has received such subsidy, and, whenever required, shall furnish mail cars properly equipped for such mail service; and such transportation and service shall be performed at such rates as are agreed upon between the Minister of the department of the Government for which such service is being performed and the company performing it, and, in case of disagreement, then at such rates as are approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada; and in or towards payment for such charges the Government of Canada shall be credited by the company with a sum equal to three per cent per annum on the amount of the subsidy received by the Company under this Act.\nAs to the first point raised, it seems to me to be clear that the credit of three per cent per annum on the amount of the subsidy received can only be applied towards the payment of charges for services rendered upon the section of railway in respect of which the subsidy is granted and paid. I think, for the purpose of construing section 8, each of \"the undermentioned lines of railway\" enumerated by section 2 is a separate \"railway or portion of railway subsidized under the Act.\"\nAs to the question whether the credits are cumulative, I find the point a difficult one but I think it is a reasonable construction of the statute to read \"such charges\" as referring back to \"such transportation and service\" which, again, refers back to the obligation by which the Company \"shall each year furnish to the Government * * * transportation, etc.\" This seems to point to the conclusion that the enactment has in view a service performed in each one of a series of years and the charges for an annual service against which the three per cent credit is to be set off.\nThe last point, again, is not free from difficulty. As I have explained, by clause 5 of the subsidy contract the completion of the whole line is regarded as the consideration for every part of the subsidy; having regard, however, to the manner in which the ten-mile section was treated by the Chief Engineer and the Governor in Council, I am disposed to think that it may be taken, for the purposes of section 8, as a segregated unit.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and on the cross-appeal the judgment of the Exchequer Court varied in accordance with the views above expressed. The respondent Company should have the costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court and, generally speaking, his reasons therefor, in all respects save one. Section 8 of The Railway Subsidies Act, 2 Geo. V, chapter 48, provides:\u2014\n8. Every company receiving a subsidy under this Act, its successors and assigns, and any person or company controlling or operating the railway or portion of railway subsidized under this Act, shall each year furnish to the Government of Canada transportation for men, supplies, materials and mails over the portion of the lines in respect of which it has received such subsidy, and whenever required, shall furnish mail cars properly equipped for such mail service; and such transportation and service shall be performed at such rates as are agreed upon between the Minister of the department of the Government for which such service is being performed and the company performing it, and, in case of disagreement, then at such rates as are approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada; and in or towards payment for such charges the Government of Canada shall be credited by the Company with a sum equal to three per cent per annum on the amount of the subsidy received by the company under this Act.\nA similar provision is found in the other Subsidies Acts. The suppliant furnished to the Crown adequate transportation for mails at the rates in effect from time to time over the various sections of railway in connection with which subsidies have been paid. The contention of the Crown is that in computing the credit provided for by the last part of section 8 and similar sections, all the subsidized extensions of the suppliant's branch line are to be treated as a single line. The judgment appealed from gives effect to this contention but I am unable to agree that the proper construction of the statutory provisions leads to that conclusion.\nSection 8 and each of the corresponding provisions appears in separate Acts relating to separate and distinct sections of the line, and each section of the line is dealt with in a separate contract. Each section of the line is a separate \"portion of the lines in respect of which it has received such subsidy.\" I am not convinced that such a construction involves a cumbersome method of accounting, as the learned President seemed to suggest, but even if that were so, it would, in my opinion, be no valid reason for construing the statutory provisions in the manner adopted by the judgment a quo. Perhaps I should add that although on this one point I find myself in disagreement with that judgment, I am still satisfied that the annual credits are not cumulative.\nIn the result, therefore, the judgment should be varied by striking out paragraph 4 and substituting the following therefor:\u2014\nThis Court doth further order and adjudge that in calculating the amount to be paid the suppliant each year for the carriage of mails over each extension of railway referred to in paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 9 of the Petition of Right, each extension is to be taken separately for the purposes of such calculation, and His Majesty is entitled only to apply in or towards payment of the amount owing, an amount equal to one year's interest at three per cent. on the subsidy paid in respect of each such extension. His Majesty fails on the appeal and it should be dismissed with costs. The cross-appeal succeeds to some extent but not with reference to the claim for subsidy. As it was His Majesty who first appealed, the railway company should be awarded its full costs of the cross-appeal. In this way it would be compensated to some extent for not securing any costs in the Exchequer Court.\nCrocket J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court that under the express terms of the subsidy contract for the construction of the 50-mile extension of the respondent's line of railway from Ste. Sabine to a point in the Township of Dionne, in the County of L'Islet, it must be held that in default of completion of the whole work contracted for by the date fixed therefor, the railway company forfeited any claim or demand for any unpaid instalments of subsidy then earned in respect of the completion of any portion of the proposed extension. Time having been expressly declared to be material and of the essence of the contract, that is the unfortunate result. Though it may seem hard, in view of the fact that the respondent had actually completed 24\u00b717 miles of the proposed extension up to the standard specified in the subsidy contract, as certified by the Government engineers, for which upon the basis of those certificates the suppliant would have been entitled to receive as the minimum subsidy $5,120 per mile or $123,750.40 on completion of the whole work, and on the construction of the first 10-mile section of which the Crown had actually paid $43,161.06 on account, that the Crown should, in the circumstances in which the work had to be abandoned, refuse to pay any part of the agreed subsidy on the last 14-17-mile section or of the 40% balance retained by it in respect of the construction of the first 10-mile section, and insist upon the application of the rigid rules of law to such a case, there seems to be no other alternative, so far as courts of law are concerned, than to give effect to the defence which the Crown has now put forward.\nAs to the effect of s. 8 of the Subsidy Act in relation to the right of the Crown to \"apply in or towards payment for\" the respondent's charges against it for the carriage of mails over the subsidized extensions a sum equal to 3% per annum on the amount of the subsidy received by the company, I think also that the learned President was right in holding that the credit of 3% upon subsidies received is only to be applied annually against the sum payable annually for the mail services, which the railway \"shall each year furnish,\" and that the annual credit of interest upon subsidy was not intended to be cumulative as contended by the Crown. I concur, however, in the view of my Lord the Chief Justice and my brother Kerwin that in computing the credit provided for by that section the several sections upon which subsidies had been paid must be treated separately and not as one single line, as held by the learned trial judge, and I agree that paragraph 4 of the formal judgment should be varied accordingly and the appeal dismissed with costs. I think, for the reasons stated by my brother Kerwin, that the respondent also should have its full costs on the cross-appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, cross-appeal allowed in part, cost of appeal and cross-appeal to respondent.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewart, Scott, Kelley, Scott & Howard.\n[1] [1938] Ex. C.R. 82.\n[2] [1916] 1 A.C. 275.\n[3] [1938] Ch. 253 at 266.\n"}

V, c. 18) and agreement (under authority of that Act) between Dominion and Province\u2014Whether persons guilty of alleged negligence were \"officers or servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their duties or employment\" upon a \"public work\" within said s. 19(c). The Government of Canada, under authority of The Relief Act, 1933 (Dom., 23-24 Geo. V, c. 18), entered into an agreement, dated August 21, 1933, with the Government of the Province of British Columbia, by which the Dominion agreed to assume responsibility for the care of all \"physically fit homeless men\" and for that purpose to organize and execute relief projects. In consequence of an agreement and request by the Province under said agreement of August 21, 1933, the Dominion instituted the project now in question, which consisted, by arrangement with the Province, of carrying out certain improvements, such as grading, widening and straightening, to a certain provincially-owned highway. The arrangements provided that the Provincial authorities would indicate the nature of the work to be done, such as the line of any re-routing, the extent of widening, etc., but the actual work would be carried out by the men on the strength of the project. All personnel connected with the project were so connected either as labourers or in an administrative or supervisory capacity under the authority of and conditions set out in certain Dominion Orders in Council, which provided, inter alia, for recruiting and organizing labour, and for transportation, accommodation, subsistence, care, equipment and allowance for the men employed, and included a provision empowering the Minister of National Defence, through the officers of his department, \"to select and employ\" \"administrative and supervisory personnel.\" Appellant claimed against the Dominion Government for damage to appellant's property by fire, which damage, it was assumed for the purpose of certain questions of law raised, was sustained from a fire which originated from slash burning operations carried on by the project, the slash burning being done under provincial fire permit issued to the member of the project personnel then in charge of the work and the fire escaping through the negligence of such personnel in failing effectively to observe the directions as to patrol laid down by the permit.\nHeld: The persons employed on the project were \"officers or servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their duties or employment\" upon a \"public work,\" within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, as it stood at the relevant time (1934). (Judgment of Maclean J., [1939] Ex. C.R. 228, holding that the project was not a \"public work\" within the meaning of said s. 19(c), reversed).\nThe phrase \"public work\" (\"chantier public\" in the French version) as used in said s. 19 (c) discussed, with references to statutory definitions of the phrase, the history of the section, and The King v. Dubois, [1935] S.C.R. 378, and other cases.\nFor a work to be a \"public work\" within said s. 19(c), it is not necessary that the work or its site be property of the Crown in the right of Canada. It is sufficient to bring the work now in question within the designation if (in the words of the definition in the Expropriation Act, to which reference should be had in ascertaining the classes of things contemplated by \"public work\" in said s. 19 (c)) it was a work for the \"construction, repairing, extending, enlarging or improving\" of which public moneys had been \"voted and appropriated by Parliament,\" and if at the same time such public moneys were not appropriated \"as a subsidy only.\" Sec. 9 of The Relief Act, 1933 (enacting that \"any obligation or liability incurred or created under the authority of this Act * * * may be paid and discharged out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund\") is a sufficient voting and appropriation within the sense of this condition, and the moneys voted to defray the cost of the work in question were not \"appropriated as a subsidy only.\"\nIt was a fair inference from the agreement, the Orders in Council and the agreed statement of facts that the particular area upon which the employees of the Defence Department were engaged was sufficiently defined by the arrangement between the representatives of the Dominion Government and the representatives of the Provincial Government to bring it within the conditions of the decision in The King v. Dubois, supra.\nAPPEAL by the suppliant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the suppliant's petition of right in which it claimed $24,692.85 for damage to its property by fire caused, it was alleged, by negligence of officers and servants of the Crown (in the Right of the Dominion of Canada) employed on a certain relief project, consisting of highway construction in improving and enlarging the provincially-owned Nelson-Spokane highway between Salmo, British Columbia, and the United States boundary, organized and executed under the authority of The Relief Act, 1933 (Dom., 23-24 Geo. V, c. 18) and an agreement (made under the authority of that Act) between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the Province of British Columbia.\nUnder an order made in the Exchequer Court, points of law raised by the pleadings were argued before Maclean J. For the purpose of the argument a statement of facts was agreed to on behalf of the parties. After hearing argument on said points of law, Maclean J. (1) held that the project in question was not a \"public work\" within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, as it stood at the relevant time (1934), and dismissed the petition of right for want of jurisdiction.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions of law are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the Exchequer Court set aside; it was directed that judgment be given declaring that the parts of the Nelson and Spokane highway affected by the improvements known as project No. 65 constituted a public work within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act as it stood before the amendment of 1938, and that the \"personnel\" engaged \"in the slash burning operations\" carried on by project No. 65 as stated in par. 5 of the agreed statement of facts were, when so engaged, \"officers or servants of the Crown * * * acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon a public work\" within the meaning of the said s. 19 (c); appellant to have its costs throughout.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014In order to understand the questions arising on this appeal it is necessary that the following facts should be stated:\nA statute, known as The Relief Act, 1933, was enacted in that year by the Parliament of Canada and it provided, inter alia, that the Governor in Council may\n2. (a) Upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon,\u2014enter into agreements with any of the provinces respecting relief measures therein;\nand made provision also for\nspecial relief, works and undertakings in the National Parks of Canada and elsewhere.\nBy section 9, it was enacted that\nany obligation or liability incurred or created under the authority of this Act * * * may be paid and discharged out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund * * *\nOn the 21st of August, 1933, the Government of Canada, represented by the Minister of Labour, entered into an agreement with the Government of the Province of British Columbia, reciting the enactment of section 2 (a) just quoted as well as section 9 and stipulating inter alia:\n2. The Dominion will assume responsibility for the care of all \"physically fit homeless men,\" and will for that purpose organize and execute relief projects consisting of works for the general advantage of Canada which otherwise would not have been undertaken at this time. The conditions under which these relief projects will be carried out are the following: (1) Shelter, clothing and food will be provided in kind and an allowance not exceeding twenty cents per diem for each day worked will be issued in cash.\n(2) Eight hours per day will be worked; Sundays and Statutory Holidays will be observed, and Saturday afternoons may be used for recreation.\n(3) Persons leaving voluntarily except for the purpose of accepting other employment offered or for the reason that they no longer require relief and those discharged for cause will thereafter be ineligible for reinstatement.\n(4) Free transportation will be given from place of engagement and return thereto on discharge except for misconduct.\n(5) No military discipline or training will be instituted; the status of the personnel will remain civilian in all respects.\n* * *\n4. The Dominion may initiate such works for the general advantage of Canada as may be decided upon by the Dominion, and the Province may propose other works of a similar character for the purpose of providing occupation for physically fit homeless men.\nIn the agreed statement of facts it is said:\n2. The Province of British Columbia upon the recommendation of the Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works of that province agreed and requested that the Dominion should initiate work upon the Nelson-Ymir-Salmo-Nelway Road and in consequence of such agreement and request the Dominion instituted a project; known as No. 65, the project mentioned in paragraphs 6 et seq. of the Petition of Right.\n3. The project in question consisted, by arrangement with the Province of British Columbia, of carrying out certain improvements, such as grading, widening and straightening, to the provincially-owned Nelson-Spokane highway; the arrangements provide that the provincial authorities would indicate the nature of the work to be done such as the line which any re-routing of the road would take, the extent to which the same would be widened, etc., but the actual work would be carried out by the men on the strength of the project.\n4. All personnel connected with project 65 were so connected either as labourers or in an administrative or supervisory capacity under the authority of and conditions set out in Orders in Council P.C. 2248 of 8th October, 1932, P.C. 2543 of 19th November, 1932, and P.C. 422 of 20th March, 1933, which Orders in Council respectively provide, inter alia, as follows:\u2014\n(P.C. 2248). \"3. The Minister of National Defence to recruit and organize the requisite labour from those in receipt of relief from federal, provincial or municipal sources and to provide for transportation, accommodation, subsistence and care thereof. Each individual so employed to be issued with an allowance for each day of employment at a rate not exceeding twenty cents, this allowance to be issuable under such conditions as are from time to time determined by the said Minister.\n4. The Department of National Defence to make available from its surplus stock of clothing, equipment and tools such items as are required and available.\" (P.C. 2543). \"The Ministers further recommend that in this and the other works already authorized by the aforesaid Orders in Council of the 8th October, 1932 (P.C. 2248) there be paid by way of relief allowances in cash and kind to such administrative and supervisory personnel as in the opinion of the Minister of National Defence are required in connection with the said works the following:\nForemen\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $60 00\nper month with board and lodging.\nGang Bosses or sub-foremen\u2026\u2026 40 00\nCooks\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 50 00\nStoremen \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 30 00\nClerks or Timekeepers \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 20 00\nand that the Minister of National Defence, through- the officers of his Department, be empowered to select and employ the personnel in question pursuant to such conditions as he shall prescribe.\"\nto which were added, by P.C. 422, clauses with professional qualifications\u2014\n\"... presently unemployed and in need of relief ..... with the allowance as set out.....:\u2014\nEngineer \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.... $100 00\nper month with board and lodging.\nAssistant Engineer \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 80 00\nMedical Officer \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 70 00\nAssistant Medical Officer \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 60 00\nAccountant \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 50 00\nThe conditions set out in these Orders in Council; these conditions generally were kept effective from time to time by various Orders in Council up to and including P.C. 1506 of 14th July, 1934.\n5. For the purpose of this argument and such purpose alone it is to be assumed that the damage claimed was sustained from a fire which originated from slash burning operations carried on by project No. 65, the slash burning being done under provincial fire permit issued to the member of the project personnel then in charge of the work and the fire escaping through the negligence of such personnel in failing effectively to observe the directions as to patrol laid down by the permit.\nIt ought to be observed before proceeding further that this highway (the Nelson-Spokane Highway) with which project No. 65 was concerned, had not been declared by the Parliament of Canada to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, but both Governments proceeded upon the footing that it was such a work within the intendment of the agreement between them; and it seems quite clear that the phrase \"works for the general advantage of Canada\" in the agreement does not solely contemplate works which have been declared to be for the general advantage of Canada, by the Parliament of Canada, for the purpose of giving the Dominion Parliament legislative control over them under sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. Two questions arise; first, whether the persons \"employed\" (to adopt the term used by the Order in Council) on project No. 65, were \"officers or servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their duties or employment\" as such within the meaning of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, cap. 34) as it stood prior to the amendment of 1938.\nAs to the first question, although the ultimate purpose of the statute, the Orders in Council and the agreement and of the whole plan was the relief of distress, it seems to me that the fair inference from the facts is that the relationship between the personnel and the Government was one of contract and that the contract was one of employment. The men employed there were there by common consent of the Crown and themselves and the benefits they received must, I think, from the legal point of view, be regarded as remuneration for their labour.\nAs regards the administrative and supervisory personnel, the Order in Council of the 19th of November, 1932, provides that the Minister of National Defence, through the officers of his Department, is empowered to select and employ such personnel pursuant to such conditions as he shall prescribe. It would be difficult to contend that these persons so selected and employed or the men under them were independent contractors. I think they fall within the classes of persons for whose negligence the Crown is made responsible by the enactment in question.\nAs to the second question, the meaning of the phrase \"public work\" was very fully considered in The King v. Dubois[2] and The King v. Moscovitz[3]. Judgments were delivered in those cases which were the judgments of the majority of this Court. It was pointed out in the judgment in the Dubois case2 that the French version of the statute could not be entirely ignored and that the two versions, English and Trench, must be read together for determining the scope and application of the subsection, and attention was called to a significant change in the phraseology of the French version which was introduced into the Exchequer Court Act by the revision of 1927. It is, perhaps, convenient to quote paragraphs (6) and (c) of section 19 as they appear in the Revised Statutes and as they stood when the events occurred out of which the present claim arises, that is to say, prior to the amendment of 1938. They are as follows:\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n(b) Every claim against the Crown for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work;\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work;\nand, in the French version:\n19. La cour de l'Echiquier a aussi juridiction exclusive en premi\u00e8re instance pour entendre et juger les mati\u00e8res suivantes:\n(b) Toute r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne pour dommages \u00e0 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s caus\u00e9s par l'ex\u00e9cution de travaux publics;\n(c) Toute r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne provenant de la mort de quelqu'un ou de blessures \u00e0 la personne ou de dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, r\u00e9sultant de la n\u00e9gligence de tout employ\u00e9 ou serviteur de la Couronne pendant qu'il agissait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi dans tout chantier public;\nIn order to appreciate the nature of the change that took place in 1927, it is necessary to look at subsection (c) as enacted by the statute of 1917. It is in these words (in English):\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nand (in French):\n(c) Toute r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne provenant de la mort de quelqu'un ou de blessures \u00e0 la personne ou de dommages \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, r\u00e9sultant de la n\u00e9gligence de tout employ\u00e9 ou serviteur de la Couronne pendant qu'il agissait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi sur tout ouvrage public.\nIn 1927, it is seen, \"chantier public\" was substituted for \"ouvrage public.\" In the judgments mentioned, it was laid down (and this was an essential element in the ratio of the decision in each case) that the phrases \"public work\" and \"chantier public\" connote physical things of defined area and ascertained locality and do not include public services, although, for the reasons there given, it is not essential (to bring any given case within the scope of subsection (c)) that the act of negligence should have been committed during the presence on a public work of the negligent officer or servant. We said, at page 402:\nThe phrase \"pendant qu'il agissait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi dans tout chantier public\" is plainly inconsistent with any construction of the phrase \"public work\" which has the effect of extending its meaning in such a way as to include public services. The rule for the construction of the parent enactment (50-51 Vict., c. 16, s. 16(c)), laid down in Paul v. The King[4], that the phrase \"public work\" includes physical things of defined area and ascertained locality and does not include public services, is plainly sanctioned and adopted by these words as the rule applicable to the construction of section 19 in the Revised Statutes of 1927.\n\"Chantier,\" in this connection, implies defined area and locality and is incapable of application in such a way as to include public services, as such.\nThe observations at page 403 may also be referred to.\nIt was also laid down in the judgment in The King v. Dubois[5] that in ascertaining the classes of things contemplated by the term \"public work\" reference should be had to the definition of public work in the Expropriation Act. I do not feel any difficulty in holding that the provincially-owned highway, the Nelson-Spokane highway, with which project No. 65 was concerned, satisfies the description of \"work\" and \"chantier\" as employed in R.S.C., 1927, cap. 34, s. 19 (c). The real question is whether it constitutes a \"public work\" or a \"chantier public\" within the contemplation of that enactment.\nIt is not necessary, to bring the work within that category, that the work itself or the site of it should be the property of the Crown in the right of Canada. In Mason's case[6], which was considered and affirmed in Dubois' case[7], the work in question was an excavation in the bed of the sea of defined area and locality and the question of the ownership of the bed of the harbour was not considered. It was regarded as immaterial. And I think it is sufficient to bring the work with which we are now concerned within the designations \"public work\" and \"chantier public\" if, to quote the words of the Expropriation Act (R.S.C., 1927, cap. 64), it was a \"work for the construction, repairing, extending, enlarging or improving of which public moneys\" had been \"voted and appropriated by Parliament,\" and if at the same time such \"public moneys\" were not appropriated \"as a subsidy only.\"\nNow, it appears to me that section 9 of The Relief Act, 1933, is a sufficient voting and appropriation within the sense of this condition and I think this appropriation is not a \"subsidy merely.\" Where you have a work with which the Dominion Government has nothing to do except to pay a subsidy and, of course, to take the necessary steps to see that the conditions of the subsidy are fulfilled,\u2014where the connection of the Dominion with the work is thus limited, then you are within these words of exclusion.\nHere the Dominion Government undertook by its officers and servants to construct or improve the work as the case might be; and the moneys voted to defray the cost were not, I think, \"appropriated as a subsidy only\" as these words of the Expropriation Act ought to be understood. I think it is a fair inference from the agreement, the Orders in Council and the statement of facts that the particular area upon which the employees of the Defence Department were engaged was sufficiently defined by the arrangement between the representatives of the Dominion Government and the representatives of the provincial government to bring it within the conditions of the decision in The King v. Dubois[8].\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nCrocket J.\u2014This is another appeal from the Exchequer Court involving the much discussed problem of the liability of the Crown for injury to property resulting from the negligence of an officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work under the relevant section of the Exchequer Court Act, as it read after the amendment of 1917, by which the words \"on any public work\" were removed from their position in the original section and, with the substitution of the preposition \"upon\" for \"on,\" placed at the end of the section after the words \"while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\" The section remained as thus amended until Parliament in 1938 finally, and, if I may say so, very sensibly, removed the troublesome words \"upon any public work\" entirely from the section, and thereby established the doctrine of respondeat superior as regards the Crown, and rendered it liable for the negligence of its servants in the course of their employment, in the same way as any other master would be liable for the negligence of his or its servants.\nAlthough the petition of right, upon which the present problem arises, is dated January 31st, 1938, the damage to the suppliant's property claimed for occurred in July, 1934, so that we are again confronted, as the learned President of the Exchequer Court was confronted, with the same old problem as to what the words \"upon any public work\" really mean, and whether the suppliant's specific claim falls within the intendment of the section, as it stood in 1934.\nThe appeal comes before us from a judgment of the learned President of the Court, dismissing the petition of right for want of jurisdiction, as the result of a hearing before him of the point of law raised by the pleadings under Rule 149, that the case did not fall within the purview of the section already referred to, upon which the original exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to hear and determine it depended.\nThe argument before His Lordship seems to have been based upon an agreed statement of facts, made, of course, solely for the purpose of the argument, and a series of 14 Orders in Council, purporting to have been passed under the provisions of the Dominion Relief Act, 1933, and which were produced before him with the agreed statement of facts. His Lordship set out in his judgment all the relevant facts. From this it appears that the damage claimed for was caused by the destruction by fire of a large area of standing timber owned by the suppliant in the District of Kootenay, B.C., as the result of slack burning along the Nelson-Spokane provincial highway in the execution of relief Project No. 65 for the improvement and enlargement of the highway, which the Dominion Government had, in an agreement with the Government of British Columbia, agreed to organize and execute as a relief project under the supervision of the Department of National Defence. Paragraph 4 of the principal agreement provided that the Dominion might initiate such works for the general advantage of Canada as might be decided upon by the Dominion, and that the Province might propose other works of a similar character for the purpose of providing occupation for physically fit, homeless men. The agreement also provided that the Province should provide all necessary rights of way or property, whether owned by the Province or private individuals, which might be required for the proper execution of such projects. Also, that the Province would make available for the use of the Dominion without charge during the period of the agreement all relief camps established by the Province, camp equipment, tools, stores and supplies thereat or held in reserve therefor, such machinery as might be necessary and available for the proper execution of such projects and the apparatus for such machinery, and the assistance of such members of the permanent engineering staff of the Province as could be made available from time to time as required. It was also arranged that the provincial authorities would indicate the nature of the work to be done, such as the line which any re-routing of the highway would take, the extent to which the same should be widened, but that the actual work would be carried out by the men on the strength of the project. The requisite labour was to be recruited from those in receipt of relief from federal, provincial or municipal sources under terms and conditions set out in the Orders in Council. The administrative and supervisory personnel was to be selected by the Minister of National Defence through the officers of his Department, pursuant to such conditions as he should prescribe. The Dominion Government was to provide transportation, accommodation, subsistence and care for all men employed on the work, including an allowance for each day of employment at a rate not exceeding 20 cents,\u2014this necessarily, of course, out of an appropriation voted by Parliament for unemployment.\nUpon these admitted and undisputed facts the learned President held that the project in question was not a public work within the meaning of that enactment. \"The highway,\" His Lordship said[9], was owned by the Province, the Project was proposed by the Province and was carried out by the Dominion at the request, and with the agreement, of the Province. In essence it was financial assistance rendered the Province in carrying out necessary relief measures. That it took the form of highway improvement, and was carried out by and under the direction of the Dominion, does not alter the substance of the arrangement, and its real purpose. It may have been in the national interest that the Dominion should support and supplement the relief measures of the Province but that would not, I third:, make the Project a \"public work\" in the sense of the statute. It was really a Provincial work.\nHis Lordship in his reasons for judgment seems to have based his conclusion upon the judgment of this Court in The King v. Dubois[10]. It is true, as he points out, that in the reasons for that judgment, this Court distinctly laid it down, as a result of the transfer to the Exchequer Court of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Official Arbitrators by the Official Arbitrators Act of 1870 and the decisions of the Exchequer Court and of this Court upon the meaning of the term \"public work,\" that the expression must be read and construed by reference to its definition, as given in the interpretation sections of the Official Arbitrators Act, ch. 40, R.S.C. (1886), and the Expropriation Act, ch. 39, R.S.C. (1886), and that the amendment of 1917 above referred to effected no change in its meaning. That case also reaffirmed the principle that \"public work\" denotes, not a mere service or undertaking, but some physical thing having a fixed situs and a defined area. It did not, however, lay it down or suggest that the amendment, made by Parliament in 1917, did not effect any change in the application of the entire section. To my mind the transposition of the words \"upon any public work\" did effect a very material change in its application. Previously it had been held by the Exchequer Court and by this Court in Chamberlin v. The King[11] and Piggott v. The King[12] that the words \"on a public work\" in the section, immediately following as they did the words \"person or property,\" were descriptive of locality and that to make the Crown liable for injury to property under that section, such property must be situated on the work when injured. As Mignault, J., in his reasons in Wolfe v. The King[13] said, the amendment having been made in the year following the decision in the Piggott case[14], it is not unreasonable to suppose that the intention was to bring such a claim within the ambit of the amended clause, and in The King v. Schrobounst[15], it was unanimously held by Anglin, C.J.C., and Duff, Mignault and Rinfret, JJ., and McGee, J. (ad hoc), that as the section then stood (since the amendment of 1917), it was no longer necessary, in order to create liability, that the person or property injured should be upon the public work at the time; that the words \"upon any public work\" qualify the employment, not the physical presence of the negligent officer or servant thereon; and that the driver of a motor truck (employed by a Government Department) carrying Government employees to a public work was so employed.\nThe learned Chief Justice in delivering the judgment of the Court in the Dubois case[16] discussed both the Wolfe[17] and the Schrobounst15 judgments as well as that of this Court in The King v. Mason[18], and said nothing that to my mind detracts from the soundness or authority of any of them. Indeed, I think it clearly appears from what he said that, although the meaning of \"public work\" itself remained unaffected by the amendment of 1917, that amendment had materially enlarged the scope of the section by making, not the site of the public work itself, or the presence or position upon it of the person or property injured, but the employment of the officer or servant of the Crown in relation to it, the test of liability, so that if death or injury to the person or to property results from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, the Crown may be held to be liable, if such duties and employment are found to have been \"upon any public work,\" that is to say, as I take it, directly connected with its construction, repairing, improvement, etc.\nI think Mr. Newcombe has correctly summed up the conditions necessary to constitute a \"public work,\" as laid down in the Dubois case[19], viz.: it must be a physical thing, not a mere service or undertaking; it must have a fixed situs and a defined area; and it must come within the definition of \"public work\" as contained in the Official Arbitrators Act and the Expropriation Act of 1886.\nThis definition is as follows:\nThe expression \"public work\" or \"public works\" means and includes the dams, hydraulic works, hydraulic privileges, harbours, wharves, piers and works for improving the navigation of any water\u2014lighthouses and beacons\u2014the slides, dams, piers, booms and other works for facilitating the transmission of timber\u2014the roads and bridges, the public buildings, the telegraph lines, Government railways, canals, locks, fortifications and other works of defence, and all other property which now belong to Canada, and also the works and properties acquired, constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired or improved at the expense of Canada, or for the acquisition, construction, repairing, extending, enlarging or improving of which any public money is voted and appropriated by Parliament, and every work required for any such purpose; but not any work for which money is appropriated as a subsidy only.\nThis language, in my opinion, does not require that the physical thing, whatever it may be, should belong to the Dominion, though the first half of the paragraph ending with the words \"and all other property which now belong to Canada\" undoubtedly applies only to Dominion property. The definition, however, does not end there, but immediately goes on with the words\nand also the works and properties acquired, constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired or improved at the expense of Canada, or for the acquisition, construction, repairing, extending, enlarging, or improving of which any public money is voted and appropriated by Parliament, and every work required for any such purpose.\nThe last half of the paragraph seems to me plainly to comprehend works and properties other than those which the Dominion owns or may acquire, and to make, not the ownership of the work or property, but the expenditure of public money provided by Parliament the real criterion for determining whether a work is or is not \"a public work.\" As pointed out in the reasons of the learned Chief Justice in the Dubois case[20], s. 1 of the Official Arbitrators Act of 1870, by which the Official Arbitrators were originally invested with jurisdiction in matters of this kind, provided that where there was a supposed claim against the Crown\narising out of any death, or any injury to person or property on any railway, canal, or public work under the control and management of the Government of Canada, the claim might by the head of the Department concerned therewith be referred to the Official Arbitrators, who should have power to hear and make an award upon such claim. So that, under the provisions of the Official Arbitrators Act of 1870, from which s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act originated, it would appear that it was the control and management by the Government of Canada, rather than the ownership of the work or property, which determined the jurisdiction of the Official Arbitrators as well as the liability of the Crown.\nI thought at first there might be some question as to whether the last clause of the definition reproduced from the Official Arbitrators Act, R.S.C. (1886), does not exclude the project now under consideration, but I have concluded that it has no other effect than to except from the operation of the words immediately preceding any work for which money is appropriated by Parliament \"as a subsidy only\" and that this clause has no application to a case of this kind, where the Government, purporting to act under the authority of an Act of Parliament respecting relief measures generally throughout the entire country, has, through one of its Departments, agreed to execute a particular work and to assume the whole responsibility therefor.\nThe crucial question, in my opinion, is, not whether the highway, which the Dominion undertook to enlarge, repair and improve, and, in case of the Province proposing any diversions thereof, to construct, was a highway which was owned by the Dominion or by the Province, but whether the project, which the Dominion undertook, not only to initiate, but to organize and execute in a defined area, was or was not a \"public work\" within the meaning of the above definition. I have reached the conclusion after anxious consideration that it was, as it was executed at the expense of Canada, so far as the expenditure of public money is concerned, and under the sole control and management of a Department of the Federal Government.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Newcombe & Company.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Appellant used a process of centrifugal casting, in which the problem of preventing the diamonds \"floating\" was not encountered, and which process in itself did not, nor did the machine used therein, infringe respondent's patent; but, prior to the casting operation, appellant temporarily anchored the diamonds in place to a die plate by a thin film of adhesive which, when the die plate (with the diamonds thus previously anchored to it) had been transferred to the mold, would, at the outset of the casting operation, immediately disappear under the heat of the molten metal; and, in applying this adhesive, appellant used a machine and process of suction, to assist in arranging the diamonds and to retain them in place during the spraying of the adhesive.\nHeld (reversing judgment of Maclean J., [1939] Ex. C.R. 121): Appellant should have the declaration as prayed.\nIt is not the province of the court to guess what is or what is not the essence of respondent's invention; that must be determined on examination of his language; and on construction of his specification, the primary thing at which he was aiming was to solve the problem of \"floating\" and he mastered that by using suction to retain the diamonds in place during the pouring of the molten metal into the mold; that was clearly indicated as an essential, if not the essential, part of the invention; and though he also used suction to keep the diamonds in place during their arranging, that was only after the diamond holder had been placed in the mold; and it cannot be said that the substance of respondent's invention was taken by appellant's process (which does not employ suction at all after the diamond holder has been placed in the mold or after the formation of the tool has begun by the introduction of the molten metal into the mold). R.CA. Photophone Ld. v. Gaumont British Picture Corpn. Ld. et al., 53 R.P.C. 167, at 197, cited. Further, respondent at the time he applied for his patent could not have got a patent for the process which appellant employs in sticking the diamonds on a die plate by the adhesive and for that purpose making use of suction while arranging the diamonds and while applying the adhesive; in the state of the art, the employment of such process would have constituted no patentable advance. Such process of appellant could not be said to be the \"equivalent\" or operation in another form of respondent's process of pouring the metal and employing suction during it. Also, on consideration of those claims in respondent's specification alleged to be infringed, there was no description therein of a monopoly which clearly and plainly included a prohibition against anything the appellant does. (As to function and effect of claims in a specification, Electric & Musical Industries Ld. et al. v. Lissen Ld. et al., 56 R.P.C. 23, at 39, cited).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing its action which asked for a declaration that its machine for casting diamond core bits and its sale or use in Canada does not constitute an infringement of the defendant's letters patent no. 368,042, relating to a method and mold for setting diamonds. The judgment in the Exchequer Court declared that as between the parties to the action, claims 1 and 4 of the defendant's patent are infringed by the use or sale in Canada of the plaintiff's machine.\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was allowed; appellant to have judgment with the declaration as prayed, with costs throughout.\nR. S. Smart K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling and J. C. Osborne for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of the 25th of February, 1939 (1), in which it was held that a machine for the casting of diamond core bits described in exhibit 1 attached to the statement of claim, as sold or used in Canada, constituted an infringement of claims 1 and 4 of a Canadian patent of the respondent dated August 10th, 1937; and the action of the appellants was dismissed in which they claimed a declaration under the provisions of section 60 (2) that their machine or its sale or use in Canada would not constitute such infringement. The appellants began the construction of their machine early in the spring of 1937 before the issue of the respondent's patent and their design was to construct a machine in which diamond bits could be cast centrifugally. This is done by rotating the mold about a vertical axis at high speed so that the molten metal is disposed radially in the mold.\nThe respondent in his specification says:\nMy present invention relates to an improved method and mold for setting diamonds which while applicable for use in a variety of industries, is especially designed for setting diamond-cutters in tools and devices, as for instance in rotary drill-bits for earth boring,\nHe proceeds to say that\nHeretofore the common practice for setting diamonds, as cutters in industrial tools, has centered around the comparatively difficult, tedious, and therefore extremely expensive method of first drilling depressions in the face of the tool and then setting the diamonds in the depressions and forming facets from the surrounding material by means of punches and mauls.\nThis method, he declares, is\nexpensive and inefficient and necessitates the use of comparatively large and more expensive stones.\nThen he refers to the method which proceeds by\ntemporarily holding the diamonds in proper position in a mold, and then, through the application of heat and pressure upon a powdered metal confined within the limits of the mold, a cutting tool is produced.\nThis, he says, has the \"obvious disadvantage * * * that the diamonds are not held firmly\" in their place in the tool with the natural consequence that there is a high percentage of loss of diamonds. He adds that attempts have been made at \"casting diamonds in a slug,\" but he says that, the specific gravity of diamonds being considerably less than that of the molten metal of which the bit is to be composed, extreme difficulty has been encountered in holding the diamonds in their proper places \"during the process of pouring the molten metal.\" The dislodgement of the diamonds is known as \"floating\" and hitherto, he says, this has presented a problem which has defied solution. He then explains the process by which he carries out his invention in these words:\nI employ a pattern-holder for the diamonds in which they are initially seated, and after the pattern-holder has been located in the mold, I utilize a vacuum chamber in the mold and air-suction to retain the diamonds in their respective seats in the holder during the process of arranging the diamonds in the best chosen pattern and during the pouring of the molten metal for the formation of the tool. In this manner the diamonds are retained in their proper positions against dislodgement during arranging period and against \"floating\" and they are set with accuracy and firmly retained against loss during subsequent use.\nIt will be noticed that the invention is specially designed for \"setting diamond-cutters in tools, and devices\" and that the method resorted to is casting the diamonds in a slug which, hitherto, has proved inefficacious by reason of the dislodgement of the diamonds during the process of pouring the molten metal into the mold because the diamonds are lighter than the molten metal; and that this is overcome by placing the diamonds in a pattern holder which is then placed in the mold and by then utilizing air suction to retain the diamonds in their seats during the process of arranging them, and during the formation of the tool by pouring the molten metal into the mold.\nI turn now to the appellants' machine and process which are described in exhibit 1 of the statement of claim.\nThe process of centrifugal casting was well known in other fields. In that process, as employed by the appellants, the mold is rotated about a vertical axis at high speed, between four and five hundred revolutions a minute, and the molten metal, subjected to centrifugal force, is disposed radially. The die plate in which the diamonds are placed at the end of the mold has, of course, a vertical extension and as the metal during the casting operation is thrown with great force in a horizontal direction against the end of the mold, the problem of floating of the diamonds does not arise. But, it is necessary temporarily to anchor the stones in place to this die plate prior to the casting operation. This is done by the appellants by employing a thin film of adhesive which temporarily holds the diamonds on the perforated die plate while it is being transferred to the mold but which immediately disappears under the heat of the molten metal at the outset of the casting operation.\nIt is not suggested that in this casting operation the centrifugal machine itself or the centrifugal process constitutes any infringement of the respondent's patent.\nThe appellants, in applying the adhesive to the die plate for retaining the diamonds temporarily in place until the casting operation proper begins, make use of a machine and a process the essential features of which are the employment of suction for the purpose of assisting in arranging the diamonds in a perforated die plate and for retaining them in place during the process of spraying the adhesive over the die plate and the diamonds and while it solidifies. This last step of the process is virtually instantaneous. The adhesive once set anchors the diamonds in the die plate but, as has already been said, it immediately disappears under the heat of the molten metal at the outset of the casting operation.,\nThe learned President has held that in this process the appellants have taken the substance of the respondent's invention. He comes to this conclusion without reference to the claims in the respondents patent, which he does not discuss, and without reference also to a contention much pressed during Mr. Gowling's able argument to which I shall come later.\nNow, there is no suggestion, as I have said, that the respondent is entitled in any way to complain of the appellants' process of centrifugal casting, or of the machine that he utilizes in that process. By it, as already mentioned, the molten metal is thrown under the impulse of centrifugal force horizontally into the mold and against the die plate placed at the periphery of the circle through which the mold revolves in the process. The die plate, which holds the diamonds, having a vertical extension, it is necessary that the diamonds should be stuck in their places in order to preserve the pattern in which they have been arranged while the die plate is being placed in position at the outer end of the mold, and, as we have seen, the adhesive is used for that purpose, it is used as a convenient way of preventing the diamonds being shaken or dropping out of the holes in which they have been placed.\nIt is plain, therefore, that the difficulty which the patentee emphasizes,\u2014the problem which he says had been encountered in all attempts to cast (diamonds in a slug and which had baffled solution before his invention, the problem, namely, of preventing the diamonds \"floating\" because of their low specific gravity as compared, with that of the molten metal, is a problem which never arises. It is not encountered in the process of the appellants. Therefore suction by air is not used to hold the diamonds in place during the process of casting; there is no vacuum chamber and none of the apparatus of suction in the appellants' casting machine. The diamonds are held in place by the adhesive until the molten metal begins to be thrown against the end of the mold when it instantly disappears under the influence of heat and thereafter the pressure of the stream of molten metal and the centrifugal force hold the diamonds in place.\nLet us observe again what it is that the patentee says about his invention. It is an invention for setting diamond cutters in tools and devices and for this purpose he uses a vacuum chamber in his mold and air suction to retain the diamonds in their respective seats in the holder during the process of arranging the diamonds and during the pouring of the metal for the formation of the tool; and the result declared is that in this manner the diamonds are retained against dislodgement during the arranging period and against \"floating.\"\nIt does not appear to me that the patentee's own account of the essence of his invention is really at all doubtful. The primary thing at which he was aiming, according to his own story, was to solve the problem of \"floating\" and he mastered that problem by the use of suction to retain the diamonds in their seats during the process of pouring the molten metal. He resorts to suction, it is true, as a convenient means of keeping the diamonds in place during the process of arranging, but that is only after the diamond holder has been placed in the mold and, convenient and useful as that part of the process may be, it does not appear to me that the patentee regards it as so absolutely essential as the use of air suction during the pouring of the metal for the purpose of preventing floating.\nOn the face of it, therefore, it seems to me to be very difficult indeed to say that the substance of this invention has been taken by a process which does not employ suction at all after the diamond holder has been placed in the mold, or after the formation of the tool has begun by the introduction of the molten metal into the mold.\nThere are some observations of Lord Justice Romer, as he then was, in R.C.A. Photophone Ld. v. Gaumont-British Picture Corpn. Ld. et al.[2], which I think ought to be quoted:\nWhat is the principle? I do not know that it has ever been more clearly enunciated than it was by Lord Parker in Marconi v. British Radio Telegraph Company[3]. \"Where * * * the combination or process besides being new produces new and useful results, everyone who produces the same results by using the essential features of the combination is an infringer even though he has in fact altered the combination or process by omitting some unessential part or step and substituting another part or step which is equivalent to the part or step he has omitted.\" The word in this passage to which I should like to call particular attention is the word \"unessential.\" It is only in respect of unessential parts of an invention to which the principle of mechanical equivalent can be applied. The principle is, indeed, no more than a particular application of the more general principle that a person who takes what in the familiar, though oddly mixed metaphor is called the pith and marrow of the invention is an infringer. If he takes the pith and marrow of the invention he commits an infringement even though he omits an unessential part. So, too, he commits an infringement if, instead of omitting an unessential part, he substitutes for that part a mechanical equivalent. But it is not the province of the Court to guess what is or what is not the essence of the invention; that is a matter bo be determined on an examination of the language used by the patentee in formulating his claims. In the case of Submarine Signal Co. v. Henry Hughes & Son, Ld.[4], I thought that the patentee had clearly indicated that an electric oscillator was an essential feature of the invention described in his eleventh claim. I consequently held that the defendant, who had not used an electric oscillator, but something that might properly be described as a mechanical equivalent of it, had not infringed. Further reflection has not caused me to change the view that I then expressed. The patentee in that case had made the electric oscillator part of the pith and marrow of his invention and the principle of mechanical equivalent was inapplicable.\nObviously, the invention, as described by the inventor himself, involves the use of air suction to hold the diamonds in place while the molten metal is being introduced into the mold. There can be no doubt, in my mind, that as the inventor puts it, that is an essential part of his process. That part of his process is clearly not taken by the appellants. Adapting the language of Lord Romer, it is not the province of the court to guess what is and is not of the essence of the invention of the respondent. The patentee has clearly indicated that the use of air suction at that stage of the process is an essential, if not the essential, part of the invention described in the specification. In these circumstances, I find myself unable to agree that the appellants have taken the \"pith and marrow\" of the respondent's invention.\nLet us look at this matter, from another point of view. I ask myself the question, could the respondent at the time he applied for his patent have got a patent for the process which the appellants employ in sticking the diamonds on a die plate by the adhesive and, for that purpose, making use of suction while arranging the diamonds and while spraying the adhesive? I do not think that question is susceptible of any but one answer. The idea of holding diamonds in place while a plastic is being set about them by the use of suction was perfectly well known and the evidence is that it was common in the art, not only in setting diamonds in jewellery but also in setting them in diamond tools. It is not, as I understand, suggested that there is anything either in the respondent's or in the appellants' arrangements for the application of suction that would not suggest itself to any skilled person possessing a competent knowledge of the art.\nMr. Gowling argues that the appellants' operation of employing suction during the arrangement of the diamonds and the application of the adhesive is really the respondent's operation in another form, that the application of the adhesive and the pouring of the molten metal are equivalent steps; and that, therefore, there was a colourable taking.\nNow, the first answer to that lies in what I have just said. Subject to any actually existing patent, there was nothing patentable in the application of suction for the purpose of retaining the diamonds in place while applying the adhesive. It was an old idea and there is no invention in it. There was no invention in making use of it for the purpose of producing a diamond tool. That being so, it is quite impossible that it can be an infringement of the respondent's patent. To put it in another way, it was (subject, of course, to any actually existing patent) before the respondent applied it to his patent, part of the common stock of knowledge in the art, and to employ it constituted no patentable advance in the art and could not, therefore, be an infringement of the respondent's patent.\nIn the second place, the premise of the argument must be rejected. For all relevant purposes, the process of applying the adhesive and the process of pouring the metal are not equivalent. The metal is poured into the mold for the purpose of fashioning the tool to which the diamonds are to adhere permanently. The respondent employs suction during that process and as an essential part of it. The appellants do not employ suction at all during that process. For the purpose of retaining the diamonds in place at the outset and during that process, the respondent employs suction. The appellants do not employ suction at any point of time while the tool is in process of formation or while the diamonds are in the mold. It is only after the suction has completely served its purpose in another machine that the appellants begin their process of casting, of forcing the metal under centrifugal impulse into the mold where the diamonds are held, not by suction, but at the outset by the adhesive that has been applied, and afterwards by the pressure of the molten metal and by the centrifugal force. In the respondent's process the action of the molten metal is not to anchor the diamonds in place in the diamond holder as the appellants' adhesive does; on the contrary it is to envelope the diamonds so that as the molten metal cools they become embedded in the molded tool; up to that point the diamonds are kept in place by the suction of air.\nLet us turn now to the claims. With the greatest possible respect, I must say that I am quite unable to find in these claims the description of a monopoly which clearly and plainly includes a prohibition against anything the appellants do. The claims to be considered are claims 1 to 4 and claim 6. The only claims referred to in the judgment of the Exchequer Court are claims 1 and 4 and they are the only claims mentioned in the pleadings, but it seems to have been agreed at the trial that the claims to be considered are the claims numbered 1 to 4 and 6. I shall consider them in their order; but before doing so I quote a passage from the judgment of Lord Russell of Killowen cited by the appellants[5].\nThe function of the claims is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly claimed, so that others may know the exact boundaries of the area within which they will be trespassers. Their primary object is to limit and not to extend the monopoly. What is not claimed is disclaimed. The claims must undoubtedly be read as part of the entire document, and not as a separate document; but the forbidden field must be found in the language of the claims and not elsewhere. It is not permissible, in my opinion, by reference to some language used in the earlier part of the specification to change a claim which by its own language is a claim for one subject-matter into a claim for another and a different subject-matter, which is what you do when you alter the boundaries of the forbidden territory. A patentee who describes an invention in the body of a specification obtains no monopoly unless it is claimed in the claims. As Lord Cairns said, there is no such thing as infringement of the equity of a patent (Dudgeon v. Thomson[6]).\nThe first claim is in these words:\n1. The method of setting diamonds in a molded casting which consists in seating the. diamonds to be set in a pattern holder, supporting the diamond holder in the mold and applying suction of air to the diamonds while in their seats before and during the process of molding the casting.\nThe method is a method of \"setting diamonds in a molded casting\" and \"consists in\" the following steps:\n1. Seating the diamonds in a pattern holder;\n2. Supporting the diamond holder in the mold; and\n3. Applying the suction of air to diamonds while in their seats before and during the process of molding the casting.\nIt seems clear to me that there is nothing in this claim that suggests that the suction of air is to be applied before the pattern holder is placed in the mold. If it were otherwise, the claim would be invalid as embracing something not disclosed in the specification. The invention disclosed is one in which suction is not and cannot be applied to the diamonds before the diamond holder is placed in the mold.\nBut, apart from that, this, at least, would appear to be beyond argument that, if the intention of the patentee had been to make such a claim he could have expressed himself in much less obscure language. He has not performed the duty of expressing his intention as clearly as possible to claim a monopoly which prohibits the application of the suction of air solely for the purpose of arranging the diamonds in a holder and sticking them there by an adhesive before the diamond holder is placed in the mold.\nThe second claim reads:\n2. The steps in the method of setting diamonds in a casting which consists in locating a pattern holder and diamonds in a mold, in supporting the diamonds to be set in a pattern holder, and applying air suction to the pattern holder and diamonds to prevent \"floating\" of the diamonds. This, obviously, does not embrace the appellants' process. According to this method air suction is applied solely to prevent floating of the diamonds. It is unnecessary to repeat what has been said upon that.\nClaim 3 is as follows:\n3. The steps in the method of setting diamonds in a molded casting which consists; in fashioning seats in a diamond holder to form a pattern holder, seating diamonds in said seats, supporting the pattern holder in a mold, and. applying air suction to the diamonds to prevent \"floating\" of the diamonds.\nand to this the same observation applies.\nClaim 4 is in these words:\n4. The method of setting diamonds in a tool which consists in seating the diamonds in a mold, applying air suction to the diamonds to hold them in situ, and pouring molten metal in the mold to envelope portions of the diamonds.\nThe method in respect of which the monopoly is claimed is a method of \"setting diamonds in a tool\" and the steps of the process are:\n1. Seating the diamonds in a mold;\n2. Applying air suction to hold the diamonds in situ; and\n3. Pouring molten metal into the mold to envelope portions of the diamonds.\nThe application of air suction here is an application to diamonds which are seated in a mold and, therefore, excludes the appellants' process.\nClaim 6 is in these words:\n6. In a diamond-setting mold, the combination with means for seating diamonds in the mold, and means for applying air-suction to the seated diamonds to prevent \"floating\" of the diamonds.\nThis is a combination claim and the things combined are means for seating diamonds in a mold and the means for applying air suction to the seated diamonds to prevent floating, which is outside the appellants' process.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the appellants should have judgment with the declaration as prayed and with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Henderson, Herridge, Gowling & MacTavish.\n[1] [1939] Ex.

The appellants, alleging that they were riparian proprietors of certain properties situated west of Chats Falls and although admitting that the water level of the river was not in consequence of these works raised above the ordinary high water mark, claimed that they were nevertheless entitled to recover damages in virtue of section 12 of the Watercourse Act on several grounds mentioned in their statement of claim. Section 12 enacts that \"(1) The owner or lessee of any such work shall be liable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the flood gates or otherwise. (2) Such damages shall be assessed and fixed by the Quebec Public Service Commission.\" The respondent contested the appellants' right to claim damages and further alleged that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim under paragraph (2) of section 12. The trial judge dismissed the appellants' action, finding upon the evidence that no damages had been sustained. The appellate court affirmed that decision on many grounds, holding inter alia that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction because such damages should have been assessed by the Quebec Public Service Commission under section 12 of the Act. The appellants also advanced before this Court a new contention that the dam of the respondent company, being part of a single work connecting the province of Quebec with the province of Ontario, was, therefore, part of a work which the former province was without legislative competence to authorize.\nHeld that the finding of the trial judge that no damages had been sustained by the appellants should not be disturbed, such finding being amply supported by the evidence.\nHeld, also, reversing the judgment of the appellate court on that point, that under articles 7295 and 7296 of R.S.Q. (1909) the Superior Court possessed jurisdiction to entertain an action for damages such as the present and to give judgment for such damages as might be assessed. Section 12 of the present Watercourse Act is not new legislation; similar legislation having been passed in 1856 (19-20 Vict., ch. 104), subsequently appearing as chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada (1861) and again as articles 5535 and 5536 R.S.Q. (1888). Since the first enactment in 1861, there has been a series of decisions in the province of Quebec in which it was held that the right to damages given by the statute was one which could be enforced by action in any competent court; and the legislature of Quebec by re-enacting in 1888 and again in 1909 the legislation first passed in 1856 and later embodied in chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada (1861) must be taken to have given statutory sanction to the course of decision culminating in the judgment of this Court in Breakey v. Carter (Cassels Digest, 2nd ed. 463). By force of articles 7295 and 7296 of R.S.Q. (1909) the Superior Court would have been, so long as that legislation remained unchanged, competent to entertain such an action as the present. It must be taken that, by these articles, the legislature declared an action for damages under article 7296 (1) to be competent in the Superior Court. Terms more explicit than those contained in paragraph 2 of section 12 would be required to deprive the courts of Quebec of the jurisdiction they possessed under the then existing statute. Subsection 2 of section 7296 R.S.Q. (1909) was providing for the ascertainment of damages by experts; and by enacting section 12 of the Watercourse Act to replace ss. 2 of s. 7296 R.S.Q., the legislature must be deemed not to have taken away the jurisdiction of competent courts. The more natural interpretation of the action of the legislature in enacting section 12 would be that recourse to experts for assessing damages was being replaced by the Public Service Commission and that competent courts had not been deprived of jurisdiction. Held, further, that the appellants' ground of appeal based on the contention that the dam was part of a simple work connecting the province of Quebec with the province of Ontario was not open to the appellants in this court. Upon the facts, the dam was a work wholly situated within the province of Quebec, constructed there under the authority of a provincial statute and the property in relation to which the appellants allege they had suffered prejudice was also situated in that province. Prima facie, therefore, the reciprocal rights and liabilities of the parties must be governed by the law of that province. It was not alleged in the pleadings that this dam affected the flow of the river south of the interprovincial boundary, and the issues of fact which might have to be considered for the purpose of examining this contention of the appellants are not among the issues to which an order was directed, or which were considered by the courts below, or presented to those courts by the pleadings or otherwise.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 65 K.B. 504) aff.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Trahan J. and dismissing the appellants' action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. B. Scott K.C. and P. F. Foran for the appellants.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice\u2014The appellants' claims are in two separate groups. The first of these is based upon the ground that for various reasons the works of the respondents are illegal; those in the second group are founded on the right to damages given by section 12 of the Quebec Watercourse Act.\nIt is convenient to deal first with these latter. Section 12 is in these words:\n12. (1) The owner or lessee of any such work shall be liable for all damages resulting therefrom to any person, whether by excessive elevation of the floodgates or otherwise.\n(2) Such damages shall be assessed and fixed by the Quebec Public Service Commission.\nThe works in question were constructed under authority of an order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the 20th of June, 1930, purporting to be given pursuant to sections 4 et seq. of The Watercourse Act. Admittedly, the water level of the river was not, in consequence of these works, raised above the ordinary high water mark; but it is urged that the appellants as riparian proprietors are entitled to recover damages in virtue of section 12 on several grounds.\nThe damages under that section are claimed in virtue of the allegations in paragraphs 13 to 18 inclusive in the declaration, and these paragraphs are textually as follows:\n13. That since the erection and construction of the said dams as aforesaid the said defendant has caused the waters of the said river Ottawa to be raised thereby to a level corresponding to and exceeding the level of the said river in the spring time at high water mark notwithstanding the protests of the plaintiffs against such action and have since maintained said waters at said unnatural level throughout all periods of the year.\n14. That the action and conduct of the defendant has caused loss, damage and injury to the plaintiffs by the continuous presence of a large body of water adjoining their properties, because of the perpetual seepage, percolation and changes in the bank of the said river opposite the properties of plaintiffs by which the bank of the river has been weakened and destroyed and the flowing of the said river on to the property of the plaintiffs has ensued, especially after wind storms, and from the action of the ice on the shore and the breaking up of the ice in the spring time of the year; and the drainage of the said lots and the dwellings thereon for sanitary and other purposes has been rendered impossible, and the shade and ornamental and useful trees growing thereon have been undermined and destroyed and their replacement rendered impossible.\n15. That the defendant has neglected to strengthen the shores of the said river so altered by them so as to prevent such percolation and changes weakening in the said shores.\n16. That the said property of the plaintiffs was naturally well adapted to the laying out of a summer resort.\n17. Plaintiffs' property as a summer resort has been further damaged because the raising of the waters of the said river has interfered with boating, bathing, and landing facilities connected therewith, and has taken away all rights of accession and alluvion.\n18. That the sales and the disposal of the lots of the plaintiffs have been lessened and the market therefor has been destroyed because of the degradations and changes which have been caused on the said lots of the plaintiffs by the above-mentioned acts and proceedings of the defendant in connection with the waters of the Ottawa river, and the said market in any event can never be reopened so long as the present state of affairs caused by the action of the defendant is allowed to continue.\nBy the plea these allegations are denied. The trial lasted several days and evidence was given on both sides on the issue thus raised and the learned trial judge held that the evidence did not justify a finding that the plaintiffs were entitled to such damages. He found:\nConsid\u00e9rant que les faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve ne donnent pas ouverture aux conclusions de la demande et que, d'ailleurs, ils ne sont pas suffisamment pr\u00e9cis et concluants pour permettre au tribunal d'asseoir une condamnation \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9tabli en fait et en droit le bien fond\u00e9 de son plaidoyer.\nHaving regard to the character of the allegations which are denied by the plea and which the learned trial judge thus found to be negatived by the evidence, it is plain that the learned judge was in an exceptionally advantageous position to pass upon the issues with which he was dealing; and, having fully considered that evidence, I am quite satisfied that we should not be justified in interfering with his findings.\nThere is one topic upon which it is desirable, perhaps, to make an observation, and that concerns the claim based upon the alleged reduction in the width of the beach.\nIt is quite clear that the right of acc\u00e8s and sortie to the river as a navigable river is in no way interfered with. It should also be noticed that in the province of Quebec the beds of navigable rivers, as well as the banks, are the property of the Crown (article 400 C.C.); and the appellants, whose property is bounded on the southerly side by the Ottawa river, have no title to any of the soil below high water mark. The learned trial judge has found, and this is not now disputed, that the respondents' works have not the effect of elevating the waters of the river above ordinary high water mark and that the property of the appellants has, therefore, not been inundated; and it seems indisputable that the respondents, who ex hypothesi in virtue of the Order in Council, have authority from the Crown for raising the waters of the river, are not in consequence alone of this inundation of Crown property answerable at the suit of the appellants. They could have no claim as against anybody acting for the Crown for prejudice suffered by reason of the deepening of the channel or by reason of the penning back of the waters of the river on Crown property; and, if there were any prejudice arising from the sole fact that as a result of the work constructed by the respondents under contract with the Crown, the beach became covered with water at seasons when it would otherwise be bare, that prejudice could, in my opinion, not be the basis of a claim for damages under section 12.\nI rest my judgment, however, in this respect upon the finding of the learned trial judge that no such damages were sustained and that this finding is amply supported by the evidence.\nAs to illegality, the grounds of complaint, including the claim in respect of the lodging of the plans and other documents in the Registry Office have, I respectfully think, been satisfactorily dealt with in the Court of King's Bench and I say nothing further about any of them with the exception of one which was raised in this court for the first time.\nThe appellants sought to advance a contention not mentioned in the courts below that the dam of the respondents is part of a single work connecting the province of Quebec with the province of Ontario and is, therefore, part of a work which the former province is without legislative competence to authorize.\nThis is a contention which is clearly not open to the appellants in this court. As the facts appear from the record before us, the respondents' dam is a work wholly situated within the province of Quebec, constructed there under the authority of a provincial statute, and the property in relation to which the appellants allege they have suffered prejudice is also situated in that province. Prima facie, therefore, the reciprocal rights and liabilities of the parties must be governed by the law of that province. It is not alleged in the pleadings that this dam affects the flow of the river south of the interprovincial boundary, and the issues of fact which might have to be considered for the purpose of examining this contention of the appellants are not among the issues to which evidence was directed, or which were considered by the courts below, or presented to those courts by the pleadings or otherwise.\nAnother question of law of great importance was raised and argued which, in the views above expressed, it is strictly unnecessary to pass upon. I think, however, it is inadvisable to put it aside without comment.\nSection 12 of the Watercourse Act has already been quoted. The Court of King's Bench has held, acceding to the contention of the respondents, that this enactment must be interpreted according to the generally recognized rule that, where a right of compensation is given by statute, in respect of something the statute authorizes, and by the same enactment extrajudicial machinery is provided for ascertaining the amount, the matter of compensation is not cognizable by the courts, until, at all events, the amount has been determined in accordance with the statutory method; and accordingly that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim for damages arising under section 12.\nSection 12 is not new legislation. In 1856, the legislature of the old province of Canada passed a statute, restricted in its operation to Lower Canada which, in its title, is described as An Act to authorize the improving of Watercourses. Thereby (sections 3 and 4) riparian proprietors were authorized to improve any watercourse bordering upon or passing through their property for industrial purposes, subject to the payment of such damages as might result from these improvements to other persons in the ordinary manner.\nThis statute, which was chapter 104 of 19-20 Vict, appeared as chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada of 1861, and again as articles 5535 and 5536, R.S.Q. (1888).\nSince the first enactment of this legislation in 1861 there had been a series of decisions in the province of Quebec in which it was held that the right to damages given by the statute was one which could be enforced by action in any competent court. This appears to have been first held in 1869 in the case of Nesbitt v. Bolduc2; Loranger Commentaires du Code Civil, vol. I, p. 140, no. 25. This decision was followed in Jean v. Gauthier3; and in Breakey v. Carter4.\nIn 1885 the Supreme Court of Canada held (in Breakey v. Carter)5 that the mode of assessing damages prescribed by chapter 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada did not exclude the right to proceed by ordinary action; and after this decision the legislation was re-enacted by R.S.Q. (1888), articles 5535 and 5536. Later, the construction of these articles of R.S.Q. (1888) came before this Court in Gale v. Bureau6; and it was there held that, in view of the previous course of jurisprudence in the province of Quebec and the decision of this Court in Breakey v. Carter7 (and the subsequent re-enactment of the legislation in identical terms) the statute must be construed and applied conformably to those decisions; and, consequently, that the Superior Court of the province of Quebec had jurisdiction to entertain an action for damages and to assess the damages under article 5536, R.S.Q. (1888). During the progress of the litigation in Gale v. Bureau6 through the Courts the legislation was again re-enacted in identical terms by articles 7295 and 7296 of R.S.Q. (1909).\nThere appears to be no room for doubt that, under these articles of the Revised Statutes of 1909, the Superior Court possessed jurisdiction to entertain an action for damages such as the present and to give judgment for such damages as might be assessed. The legislature of Quebec, by re-enacting in 1888 and again in 1909 the legislation first passed in 1856, and later embodied in the provisions of chapter 51, C.S.L.C. (1861), must be taken to have given statutory sanction to the course of decision culminating in Breakey v. Carter7, decided by this Court in 1885. The rule in such a case is stated by Lord Halsbury in Webb v. Outrim8 in a passage quoted from the judgment of Griffith C.J. in these words:\nWhen a particular form of legislature enactment, which has received authoritative interpretation, whether by judicial decision or by a long course of practice, is adopted in the framing of a later statute, it is a sound rule of construction to hold that the words so adopted were intended by the legislature to bear the meaning which has been so put upon them.\nThis rule was affirmed afresh and applied in Barras v. Aberdeen9. In that case, three of the Law Peers, Lord Buckmaster, Lord Warrington of Clyffe and Lord Russell of Killowen, adopted and applied the rule as laid down by Lord Halsbury and also as laid down by James L.J. in Ex parte Campbell10. Lord Blanesburgh and Lord Macmillan would appear to have thought that the language of James L.J. required some qualification, but neither of them would, as their judgments shew, have had any doubt about the application of the rule in a case like the present; where a course of decision in the province of Quebec, beginning in the year 1869, culminated in a decision of this Court in 1885 and the statute, which was the subject of these decisions, was thereafter re-enacted without modification in its terms. It is evident, I think, that Lord Blanesburgh, who thought the rule not applicable in Barnes v. Aberdeen,11 would have had no hesitation in applying it in the circumstances now under consideration. That, I think, sufficiently appears from his observations at page 433.\nWe start from the premise then that, by force of articles 7295 and 7296 of R.S.Q. (1909), the Superior Court would have been, so long as that legislation remained unchanged, competent to entertain such an action as the present. It must be taken that, by these articles, the Legislature declared an action for damages under article 7296 (1)11 to be competent in the Superior Court.\nThe question raised by the contention of the respondents is this: by the change embodied in subsection 12, as it now appears in the Revised Statutes, has the Legislature taken away this jurisdiction?\nFor subsection 2 of article 7296 R.S.Q. (1909) providing for the ascertainment of damages by experts, the following is substituted:\nSuch damages shall be assessed and fixed by the Quebec Public Service Commission.\nI am very much disposed to think that something more explicit than this is required to deprive the courts of Quebec of the jurisdiction they possessed under the existing statute. The legislature is conclusively presumed to have known the effect of the re-enactment of the statute after the earlier decisions,\u2014to have known, that is to say, that by the statute, as it stood before it was amended, the Superior Court had jurisdiction, but that the proceeding by way of assessment by experts was also available. There is at least much to be said for the view that the more natural interpretation of the action of the Legislature in amending subsection 2 is that recourse to experts is being replaced by the Public Service Commission, and that the courts have not been deprived of jurisdiction. Reference ought to be made to The King v. Southern Canada Power Co. (1) and to the judgment therein delivered by Lord Maugham. Damages were recovered under section 12 of the Watercourse Act in that case by the Crown in an action brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada. It does not appear to have been suggested throughout the litigation that the jurisdiction of the Quebec Public Service Commission in respect of damages was exclusive although an objection was taken by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, the contention being that the action ought to have been brought in the Superior Court.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Foran & Foran.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Geoffrion & Prud'homme.\n1 (1938) Q.R. 65 K.B. 504.\n2 (1869) 15 R.L. 513, note.\n3 (1877) 3 Q.L.R. 360.\n4 (1881) 7 Q.L.R. 286.\n5 Cassels Digest, 2nd ed. 463.\n6 (1910) 44 S.C.R. 305.\n7 Cassels Digest, 2nd ed. 463.\n6 (1910) 44 S.C.R. 305.\n7 Cassels Digest, 2nd ed. 463.\n8 [1907] A.C. 81, at 89.\n9 [1933] A.C. 402.\n10 (1870) L.R. 5 Ch.

Act, section 92, paras. 8 and 15.\nThe appellant was elected mayor of the town of Grand'M\u00e8re, in the province of Quebec, on July 2, 1935. At the time of his election and up to the commencement of this action, the appellant and the municipal corporation were bound by a contract entered between them on May 14, 1928, whereby, following a conveyance (effected on the same date by the appellant to the municipal corporation) of certain lots of land to be used as public streets, the adjoining lots, so long as they had not been sold by the appellant to third parties, were not to be \"assessed on the valuation roll of the corporation at more than thirty-five dollars each\". It was further agreed that the same conditions would apply to the unimproved lots which the appellant, within two years following the contract, would repossess for nonpayment by the buyers of those lots. The respondent, in his capacity of elector, ratepayer and property-owner, instituted proceedings, under section 3 of the Municipal Bribery and Corruption Act, R.S.Q., 1925. c. 107, where conclusions were to the effect that the appellant \"be declared disqualified for five years from the date of the judgment from holding any office in or under the council of the town of Grand'Mere\". This action was dismissed by the Superior Court, which held that the appellant's relations with the municipality under the above contract were rather those of a creditor of the municipality for prestations for which the latter had made itself responsible and that they did not come within the provisions of the above-mentioned Act, the effect of which was to forbid any member of the municipal council to make a contract during his tenure of office., but not to prohibit his election to the council after such a contract had been in force for some time and the obligations resulting therefrom towards the council had been fully performed; in other words, it was held that the appellant had fully performed his obligations to the municipality prior to his election and that, therefore, the prohibition provided by section 3 of the Act did not disqualify him. This judgment dismissing the respondent's action was reversed by the appellate court, which set aside the construction given to the Act by the trial judge as well as all the other grounds invoked by the appellant.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the appellate court (Q.R. 66 K.B. 133), that the appellant has violated the provisions of section 3 of the above-mentioned Act. According to the evidence, he clearly had an interest in a contract with the municipal council to which he had been elected and of which he continued to be a member until the action was commenced; that contract existed throughout his tenure of office and during that time he derived appreciable benefits therefrom, and he cannot reasonably claim that he did not do so knowingly.\nAs to the ground raised by the appellant, that the offence raised against him, having already been provided for by the provisions of section 161 of the Criminal Code, the latter overrides the provincial Act and makes it inoperative:\nHeld that a mere comparison of the above-mentioned sections of both Acts shows that the two provisions do not relate to the same thing: the provincial Act prohibits the existence of' any contract or employment relationship between a municipal council and a member thereof, while the Criminal Code prohibits any offers, proposals, etc., intended inter alia to influence the vote of such a member. The two sections are far from identical and, therefore, the provincial field is not in the present instance occupied by the Dominion field. Moreover, the provincial Act comes within the provisions of paragraphs 8 and 15 of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act and therefore its constitutionality cannot be successfully attacked.\nAs to the other ground raised by the appellant that the municipal council, at the time of the occurrences forming the basis of the action, was governed by the Cities and Towns' Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 102), that section 123 of that Act covered the same offence as the one mentioned in section 3 of the Municipal Bribery and Corruption Act and that therefore the provision of section 123 of the first Act has the effect of setting aside the application of section 3 of the last Act.\nHeld that the two Acts do not cover the same case and the provision of one Act does not exclude the provision of the other Act; section 123 of the first Act simply prohibits the nominating or electing to the office of mayor or alderman or the appointing to or holding of any other municipal office, while section 3 of the second Act makes of either one of these Acts an offence entailing not only disqualification from immediately holding the office to which the municipal elector was elected, but in addition disqualification \"from holding any public office in the council or under the council thereof, for five years\". The two provisions, far from conflicting, are complementary to each other.\nAs to the other ground raised by the appellant, that, the contract he entered into with the municipality being a contract of sale and in view of the fact that section 227 (11) of the Municipal Code, which also contains a provision prohibiting the holding of municipal office by a member of the council who has a contract with the corporation, provides that the word \"contract\" does not include \"the sale * * * of land,\" it would be consistent with the economy of the municipal law of Quebec to rule that such a contract is not covered by the prohibition and offence provided in section 3 of the Municipal Bribery and Corruption Act.\nHeld that such ground is not well founded. First, the parties in the case are not governed by the Municipal Code, but by the Cities and Towns' Act which contains no restriction of the kind mentioned in the Municipal Code; and, secondly, the above-mentioned section 3, which applies in this case, makes no distinction, and, therefore, there is no reason why the courts should make such a distinction, at least in the present instance. Moreover, the contract in this case is not a contract of sale, but a contract sui generis.\nSection 19 of the Municipal Bribery and Corruption Act provides that \"the term 'member of a municipal council' shall include municipal councillors, aldermen and delegates to the county council,\" and, therefore, the appellant urged the ground that the Act does not apply to the mayor of a municipality.\nHeld that the mayor is included in the expression \"member of a municipal council\" as found in section 3. By its very terms, section 19 is not a definition, but it simply specifies some persons which should be included in the term \"member of a municipal council\" (Guibord v. Dallaire, Q.R. 50 K.B. 440 followed); and, moreover, the words \"shall include\" are not ordinarily construed as implying a complete and exhaustive enumeration. The Queen v. Herman (L.R. 4 Q.B.D. 284); Robinson v. The Local Board of Barton-Eccles (8 App. Cas. 798) and Dyke v. Elliott (L.R. 4 P.C. 184) followed.\nHeld, also, that the legal position of the appellant would not be improved by the alleged fact, assuming it to be right, that the benefits and privileges which he has derived from the contract throughout his tenure of office would be illegal: it is the effect of the contract that must be considered and the appellant must suffer the consequences thereof. Moreover the courts can not in this case pronounce nullity of the contract or even recognize the existence of that nullity, first, because neither party to the suit have so requested and, above all, for the reason that one of the contracting parties, the corporation of the town of Grand'M\u00e8re, has not been made a party to the action.\nHeld further that, in such a case, it is not necessary that a \"conviction\" should first be pronounced against the delinquent in a criminal proceeding; and the so-called \"conviction\" may be prayed for, at the same time as the disqualification, in the conclusions of one and the same penal action instituted under articles 1150 and seq. C.C.P. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Marchand J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's action which prayed that the appellant be declared disqualified for five years from holding any public office in the council of the city of Grand'M\u00e8re, in the province of Quebec.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nLeon M\u00e9thot K.C. for the appellant.\nAuguste D\u00e9silets K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014L'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu maire de la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le 2 juillet 1935.\nAu moment de son \u00e9lection, et depuis lors jusqu'\u00e0 l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action, il existait entre lui et la ville un contrat, datant du 14 mai 1928, en vertu duquel, \u00e0 la suite d'un acte de cession (pass\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour par l'appelant avec la ville) de divers immeubles pour servir de rues municipales, tant et aussi longtemps que l'appelant n'aurait pas vendu \u00e0 des tiers les lots avoisinant ceux qui \u00e9taient c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 la ville, ces lots avoisinants ne pourraient pas\n\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s dans le r\u00f4le de perception de la Corporation \u00e0 plus que trente-cinq piastres chacun.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9, en plus, convenu que si, dans les deux ann\u00e9es qui suivraient le contrat, l'appelant reprenait, pour d\u00e9faut de paiement, les lots non b\u00e2tis qu'il avait c\u00e9d\u00e9s par vente ou promesse de vente,\nces lots non b\u00e2tis ainsi repris et appartenant de nouveau \u00e0 (l'appelant) devraient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s seulement \u00e0 trente-cinq piastres aussi longtemps qu'il en restera propri\u00e9taire et qu'il n'y \u00e9rigera pas de construction.\nIl a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9\nentendu que la Corporation ne pourra pas forcer (l'appelant) \u00e0 construire des trottoirs sur les dits lots, \u00e0 moins que sur la rue o\u00f9 ces trottoirs doivent \u00eatre \u00e9rig\u00e9s, la majorit\u00e9 des propri\u00e9taires en pieds de front l'exigent.\nL'intim\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'\u00e9lecteur, de contribuable et de propri\u00e9taire dans la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re, a conclu, par son action, que le d\u00e9fendeur (f\u00fbt) d\u00e9clar\u00e9, par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir, inhabile pendant l'espace de cinq ans \u00e0 compter de la date du jugement, \u00e0 remplir une charge dans le Conseil de la Cit\u00e9 de Grand'M\u00e8re ou sous le contr\u00f4le du dit Conseil.\nL'action s'appuyait sur Particle 3 de la Loi concernant les man\u0153uvres frauduleuses et la corruption dans les affaires municipales, ch. 107 de S.R.Q. 1925:\n3. Tout membre d'un conseil municipal qui, sciemment, pendant la dur\u00e9e de son mandat, a ou a eu directement ou indirectement, par lui-m\u00eame ou son associ\u00e9, quelque part ou int\u00e9r\u00eat dans un contrat ou un emploi, avec, sous ou pour le conseil, ou qui, sciemment, pendant la dur\u00e9e de son mandat, a, par lui-m\u00eame ou par son associ\u00e9 ou ses associ\u00e9s, quelque commission ou int\u00e9r\u00eat, directement ou indirectement, dans un contrat ou relativement \u00e0 un contrat, ou qui tire quelque a vantage: d'un contrat avec la corporation ou le conseil dont il fait partie, est, sur jugement obtenu contre lui en vertu des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente section, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inhabile \u00e0 remplir une charge dans le conseil ou sous le contr\u00f4le du conseil pendant l'espace de cinq ans.\nL'appelant, pour sa d\u00e9fense, a invoqu\u00e9 un grand nombre de moyens que nous examinerons par la suite.\nIl a r\u00e9ussi devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure,[3] qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que les relations entre lui et la ville, r\u00e9sultant du contrat en question, \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t celles d'un cr\u00e9ancier de la ville pour les prestations auxquelles elle s'est oblig\u00e9e; et qu'elles ne tombaient pas sous le coup de la loi cit\u00e9e ci-dessus, parce que l'effet de cette loi \u00e9tait de d\u00e9fendre a un membre du conseil municipal de faire un contrat pendant l'exercice de ses fonctions, mais non pas de prohiber son \u00e9lection comme membre du conseil apr\u00e8s qu'un contrat de ce genre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu depuis un certain temps et que les obligations qui en d\u00e9coulaient pour celui-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es. Le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait d'avis que, dans le cas actuel, l'appelant avait enti\u00e8rement rempli sa part d'obligations envers la ville ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 son \u00e9lection et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la prohibition pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 3 de la loi ne le frappait pas d'incapacit\u00e9.\nIl d\u00e9bouta, en cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9 des fins de son action.\nMais la Cour du Banc du Roi,[4] \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9, a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement, a rejet\u00e9 l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la loi par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, ainsi que tous les autres moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l'appelant; et elle a maintenu l'action avec d\u00e9pens. L'appelant nous a de nouveau soumis tous les points qu'il avait plaid\u00e9s devant les deux cours de la province.\nIl a soulev\u00e9 d'abord une question constitutionnelle. Il a attir\u00e9 notre attention sur le fait que le Code criminel contient un article qui se lit comme suit:\n161. Est coupable d'un acte criminel et passible d'une amende de mille dollars au plus et de cent dollars au moins, et d'un emprisonnement de deux ans au plus et d'un mois au moins, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du paiement de l'amende, d'un emprisonnement additionnel de six mois au plus, tout individu qui, directement ou indirectement,\n(a) Fait des offres, propositions, dons, pr\u00eats, promesses ou conventions de payer ou de donner une somme d'argent ou quelque autre compensation ou valeur appr\u00e9ciable, \u00e0 un membre d'un conseil municipal, soit pour son propre avantage, soit pour l'avantage de toute autre personne, dans le but de 1'induire \u00e0 voter ou \u00e0 s'abstenir de voter \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du conseil dont il fait partie, ou d'un comit\u00e9 de ce conseil, pour ou contre une mesure, motion, r\u00e9solution ou question soumise au conseil ou au comit\u00e9; ou\n* * *\n(d) Etant membre ou fonctionnaire d'un conseil municipal, accepte ou consent \u00e0 accepter quelque offre, proposition, don, pr\u00eat, promesse, convention, compensation ou valeur pr\u00e9vus au pr\u00e9sent article; ou, pour quelqu'une de ces causes, vote ou s'abstient de voter pour ou contre une mesure, motion, r\u00e9solution ou question, ou fait ou s'abstient de faire un acte officiel;\nEt l'appelant pr\u00e9tend que, comme le Code criminel pour-voit d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l'offense qui lui est reproch\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente action, il a pour effet de l'emporter sur la loi provinciale et de rendre cette derni\u00e8re inop\u00e9rante.\nMais il suffit de comparer l'article du Code criminel et celui de la Loi concernant les manoeuvres frauduleuses et la corruption dans les affaires municipales pour voir que les deux articles ne se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent pas au m\u00eame cas.\nLa loi provinciale prohibe l'existence d'un contrat ou d'un emploi entre le membre du conseil municipal et le conseil de la corporation dont il fait partie. La loi criminelle prohibe des offres ou propositions, etc., dans le but d'induire un membre d'un conseil municipal \u00e0 voter ou \u00e0 s'abstenir de voter \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du conseil ou d'un comit\u00e9 de ce conseil, ainsi que l'acceptation de, ou le consentement a accepter, ces offres ou ces propositions, etc., par le membre ou le fonctionnaire du conseil municipal. Dans ce dernier cas, la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale punit \u00e0 la fois celui qui a fait les offres et le membre du conseil qui les a accept\u00e9es. Les deux articles sont loin d'etre identiques; et, par cons\u00e9quent, suivant Pexpression employ\u00e9e en pareil cas, en mati\u00e8re de droit constitutionnel, le champ provincial n'est pas occup\u00e9 ici par le champ f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nD'autre part, il est indiscutable que la loi provinciale invoqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e tombe sous le paragraphe 8 de l'article 92 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, qui a trait aux \"institutions municipales dans la province\"; et elle tombe, en outre, sous le paragraphe 15 du m\u00eame article 92, qui permet aux provinces d'imposer, \u00e0 titre de sanction, des amendes, des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s ou l'emprisonnement pour assurer l'ex\u00e9cution des lois provinciales adopt\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute mati\u00e8re comprise dans l'une quelconque des cat\u00e9gories de sujets \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans cet article 92. Par cons\u00e9quent, la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi provinciale dont il s'agit ne saurait pr\u00e9senter aucun doute.\nMais l'appelant soumet en plus que la Loi concernant les manoeuvres frauduleuses et la corruption dans les affaires municipales ne s'applique pas aux membres du conseil municipal de la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re parce que cette derni\u00e8re, \u00e0 P\u00e9poque des \u00e9v\u00e9nements dont l'action se plaint, \u00e9tait r\u00e9gie par la Loi concernant les cit\u00e9s et les villes (c. 102 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1925) et que cette loi contiendrait, elle aussi, un article qui pourvoit \u00e0 la m\u00eame offense que celle qui est pr\u00e9vue par l'article 3 du chapitre 107. Ce serait l'article 123, dont le texte, en autant qu'il concerne l'appelant, se lit comme suit:\n123. Ne peuvent \u00eatre mis en nomination pour les charges de maire ou d'\u00e9chevin, ni \u00eatre \u00e9lus \u00e0 ces charges, ni \u00eatre nomm\u00e9s aux autres charges municipales, ni les occuper:\n* * *\n90. Quiconque a, directement ou indirectement, par lui-m\u00eame ou par son associ\u00e9, un contrat avec la municipalit\u00e9.\nL'appelant soumet que cette disposition particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes a pour effet d'\u00e9carter l'application de Particle 3 du chapitre 107.\nNous ne le croyons pas. En premier lieu, les deux lois ne couvrent pas le m\u00eame \u00e9v\u00e9nement. L'article 123 du chapitre 102 se contente d'emp\u00eacher la mise en nomination ou P\u00e9lection aux charges de maire ou d'\u00e9chevin, ou la nomination \u00e0 ou Poccupation des charges municipales. L'article 3 du chapitre 107, en plus, fait de Tun de ces actes une offense qui comporte non seulement Tinhabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper imm\u00e9diatement la charge \u00e0 laquelle le conseiller municipal aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu, mais, en plus, Tinhabilit\u00e9\n\u00e0 remplir une charge dans le conseil ou sous le contr\u00f4le du conseil pendant l'espace de cinq ans.\nA la prohibition d'occuper la charge pour laquelle l'\u00e9lection a eu lieu, le chapitre 107 ajoute done, sous forme de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9, l'inhabilit\u00e9\n\u00e0 remplir une charge dans le conseil ou sous le contr\u00f4le du conseil pendant l'espace de cinq ans.\nEt les deux lois, loin d'\u00eatre en conflit, se compl\u00e8tent, au contraire, l'une par l'autre. A la proc\u00e9dure par voie de quo warranto, le chapitre 107 ajoute la proc\u00e9dure par voie d'action p\u00e9nale. Non seulement elle emp\u00eache le membre \u00e9lu d'entrer en fonctions, mais elle le punit d'incapacit\u00e9 pour cinq ans parce qu'il a enfreint la loi. Les deux lois ne sont pas du m\u00eame ordre et l'une n'exclut pas l'application de l'autre.\nIl faut donc se demander maintenant si l'appelant a vraiment enfreint les dispositions de l'article 3 du chapitre 107.\nSur ce point, nous sommes absolument d'accord avec le jugement unanime de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nL'appelant avait \u00e9videmment un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans un contrat avec le conseil de la corporation municipale auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu et dont il a continu\u00e9 de faire partie jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e. Ce contrat a exist\u00e9 pendant la dur\u00e9e de son mandat. Pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode de temps, il en a tir\u00e9 des avantages appr\u00e9ciables. Il ne peut raisonnablement pr\u00e9tendre qu'il ne l'a pas fait sciemment. Il avait sign\u00e9 son contrat; il a d\u00fb donner son consentement \u00e9crit \u00e0 son \u00e9lection; il a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment asserment\u00e9 comme maire. Il a si\u00e9g\u00e9 comme tel et en a exerc\u00e9 toutes les pr\u00e9rogatives pendant au del\u00e0 de deux ans avant que l'action ne f\u00fbt intent\u00e9e. En plus, la preuve d\u00e9montre que, chaque fois que les estimateurs de la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le role d'\u00e9valuation annuel, il a eu des conf\u00e9rences avec les estimateurs et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier qui les accompagnait, pour faire valoir les avantages qui lui r\u00e9sultaient du contrat qu'on lui reproche maintenant; et que, dans chaque cas, les estimateurs ont fix\u00e9 le chiffre de son \u00e9valuation en vertu du contrat, et non pas d'apr\u00e8s la valeur r\u00e9elle de ses biens imposables, ainsi que l'exigeait la loi (art. 485). Il n'y a donc aucun doute \u00e0 la fois sur l'existence du contrat prohib\u00e9 et sur les avantages que l'appelant en a tir\u00e9s.\nMais l'appelant nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re au Code municipal (art. 227, par. 11), qui contient \u00e9galement une disposition d\u00e9fendant l'exercice des charges municipales par un membre du conseil qui a un contrat avec la corporation, et qui stipule que le mot \"contrat\" dans ce cas\nne s'\u00e9tend pas au bail, ni \u00e0 la vente ou \u00e0 l'achat de terrains, ni \u00e0 une convention se rapportant \u00e0 l'un de ces actes.\nIl dit que le contrat qu'il a pass\u00e9 le 14 mai 1928 avec la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re est un contrat de vente et qu'il serait conforme a l'\u00e9conomie de la loi municipale de la province de Qu\u00e9bec de d\u00e9cider qu'un pareil contrat n'est pas vis\u00e9 par la prohibition et l'offense pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 3 du chapitre 107.\nCette objection ne vaut pas, pour au moins deux raisons:\nTout d'abord, les parties ne sont pas r\u00e9gies par le Code municipal mais par la loi des villes, laquelle ne contient aucune restriction du genre de celle que l'on trouve dans le Code municipal. Mais, en plus, l'article 3 du chapitre 107, qui est celui qui s'applique \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce, ne fait aucune distinction; et il n'y a pas lieu pour les tribunaux d'en introduire une, au moins dans le cas actuel, lorsque la loi elle-m\u00eame n'en fait pas.\nL'appelant invoque encore l'article 19 de la Loi concernant les manoeuvres frauduleuses et la corruption dans les affaires municipales, Cet article declare que l'expression \"membre d'un conseil municipal\" comprend les conseillers municipaux, les \u00e9chevins et les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s de comt\u00e9. En langue anglaise, l'expression est: \"shall include municipal councillors, aldermen and delegates to the county council.\"\nDans ses termes m\u00eames l'article 19 n'est pas une d\u00e9finition. Il ne fait que pr\u00e9ciser que les conseillers municipaux, les \u00e9chevins et les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s de comt\u00e9 sont compris dans l'expression \"membre d'un conseil municipal.\" Il est plus que probable que cet article se trouve au chapitre 107 pour \u00e9carter tout doute sur l'inclusion, entre autres, des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s de comt\u00e9, vu que le bureau des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s n'est pas un conseil municipal. Mais, en plus, le mot \"comprend\" ou les mots \"shall include\" ne sont pas d'ordinaire interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme supposant une \u00e9num\u00e9ration compl\u00e8te et exclusive.\nSur le point particulier qui nous occupe, il suffit de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 l'article 47 de la loi des villes, qui est \u00e0 l'effet que \"le conseil municipal est compose d'un maire et du nombre d'\u00e9chevins d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la charte, \u00e9lus en la mani\u00e8re ciapr\u00e8s prescrite.\" En vertu de cet article, le maire d'une ville est donc indiscutablement un des membres de son conseil municipal. Et il serait inadmissible que l'on inter-pr\u00e9t\u00e2t l'article 19 du chapitre 107 comme excluant le maire de l'op\u00e9ration de la loi, sp\u00e9cialement de l'op\u00e9ration de l'article 3 de cette loi, lorsque l'on songe que le maire est, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le membre le plus important du conseil municipal, et que l'interpr\u00e9tation que nous soumet l'appelant aurait pour cons\u00e9quence de le soustraire aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour manoeuvres frauduleuses ou corruption dans les affaires municipals, alors que les conseillers municipaux en seraient passibles. Cette simple constatation, qui conduirait \u00e0 l'absurdit\u00e9, est suffisante pour \u00e9carter une pareille interpr\u00e9tation.\nLe raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de s'appuie, en outre, sur l'interpr\u00e9tation constante par la jurisprudence du sens qu'il faut donner aux mots \"shall include\". La loi concernant les manoeuvres frauduleuses et la corruption dans les affaires municipales est de droit public ou administratif. Elle s'inspire des statuts \u00e9dict\u00e9s en pareille mati\u00e8re en Angleterre, o\u00f9 ces mots (\"shall include\") ont subi une interpr\u00e9tation extensive plut\u00f4t que limitative. Et c'est ainsi que Lord Coleridge, dans The Queen v. Herman,[5] dit:\nThe words \"shall include\" are not identical with or put for \"shall mean\". The definition does not purport to be complete or exhaustive. By no means, does it exclude any interpretation which the sections of the Act would otherwise have. It merely provides that certain specified cases shall be included.\nLa Chambre des Lords, dans la cause de Robinson v. The Local Board of Barton-Eccles[6] avait \u00e0 appliquer, dans The Public Health Act, un statut qui contenait une clause d'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 l'effet que \"'Street' shall apply to and include * * *\". Lord Selborne y d\u00e9clara ce qui suit:\nAn interpretation clause of this kind is not meant to prevent the word receiving its ordinary popular and natural sense whenever that would be properly applicable, but to enable the word as used in the Act, when there is nothing in the context or the subject matter to the contrary, to be applied to some things to which it would not ordinarily be applicable (pp. 800 et suiv.).\nA son tour, dans Dyke v. Elliott[7], le Conseil Priv\u00e9 s'exprime comme suit:\nIt was contended in the Court below, but without success, that the words in the prohibitory clause were to be restricted by the words in the definition clauses, and that contention has been repeated here. In the Court below that argument was used in support of a contention that \"steam-tug\" was not within the definition. Here, in support of the contention that the uses are limited to the uses specifically mentioned in definition. The words, however (as was pointed out by the learned Judge), are not \"shall mean\" but \"shall include\". In some of the clauses in the same part of the Act the other words \"shall mean\" are used, and in the other clauses in which the words \"shall include\" are used, the most absurd consequences would follow if the words \"shall include\" were construed as equivalent to \"shall mean\", e.g., the clause; as to what shall be included under the words \"United Kingdom\". Indeed, as to this particular clause itself, consequences no less absurd would follow if the things included were to be considered as an exhaustive enumeration, and so as to be the only things comprised. Their Lordships have, therefore, no hesitation in concurring with the learned judge that the words in the definition can have no effect in restricting the meaning to be put on the words of the prohibitory section. And the whole question its really what is the meaning of the words in that section \"naval service\".\nNous devons done d\u00e9cider que le maire d'une ville est bien compris dans l'expression \"membre d'un conseil municipal\", telle qu'elle se trouve \u00e0 l'article 3 du chapitre 107; et que, par suite, il est passible des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s qui y sont \u00e9dict\u00e9es, s'il se rend coupable de l'infraction qui y est pr\u00e9vue.\nC'est d'ailleurs dans ce sens que la Cour du Banc du Roi en la pr\u00e9sente cause l'a unanimement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e, suivant en cela un arr\u00eat rendu par la m\u00eame cour dans la cause de Guibord v. Dallaire,[8] qui est au m\u00eame effet; et auquel on peut ajouter la d\u00e9finition contenue dans le paragraphe 5 de l'article 4 de la Loi concernant les cit\u00e9s et les villes:\n50. Les mots \"membre du conseil\" d\u00e9signent et comprennent le maire et tout \u00e9chevin de la cit\u00e9 ou de la ville.\nQuant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'il s'agirait ici d'un contrat de vente, et qu'il devrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la, tol\u00e9rance du Code municipal, nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait allusion \u00e0 l'objection qui s'oppose \u00e0 l'application du Code municipal en l'esp\u00e8ce, parce que l'offense de Pappelant n'en rel\u00e8ve pas et parce que nous sommes ici dans le cas d'une ville et d'un membre de son conseil municipal qui tombent sous le coup du chapitre 107 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec. Il convient d'ajouter que le contrat que nous avons \u00e0 \u00e9tudier dans cette cause n'est pas un contrat de vente. C'est un contrat sui generis en vertu duquel l'appelant a c\u00e9d\u00e9 certains immeubles pour que la municipalit\u00e9 les transforme en rues; et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu en retour qu'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait de certains avantages sous forme de limite d'\u00e9valuation municipale pour ses autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s; et, comme nous l'avons vu, d'une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale concernant la construction des trottoirs.\nEt pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'appelant se charge lui-m\u00eame de d\u00e9montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'une vente, puisqu'il pr\u00e9tend que la convention intervenue entre lui et la ville en est une qui est prohib\u00e9e par la loi, en ce sens qu'une corporation municipale de ville n'a pas le droit de convenir que l'\u00e9valuation municipale ne sera pas faite suivant la valeur r\u00e9elle des immeubles, mais qu'elle comportera une \u00e9valuation fixe qui demeurera stable pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie d'ann\u00e9es, c'est-\u00e0-dire: tant que l'appelant demeurera propri\u00e9taire des autres lots mentionn\u00e9s dans le contrat.\nPour le besoin de l'argument, nous pouvons prendre pour acquis que cette convention est ill\u00e9gale. Il n'est pas, en effet, n\u00e9cessaire de nous prononcer sur ce point. Mais, comme le fait valoir l'intim\u00e9, la position juridique de l'appelant n'est pas meilleure du fait que les avantages et privil\u00e8ges qu'il retire et qu'il a retir\u00e9s de ce contrat durant l'existence de son mandat sont ill\u00e9gaux. M\u00eame si le contrat est ill\u00e9gal, c'est l'effet r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qui compte; et l'appelant doit en subir les cons\u00e9quences.\nL'appelant ne peut emp\u00eacher que le contrat ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 entre lui et la ville. Surtout il ne peut pas se soustraire au fait que ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en vigueur et respect\u00e9 de part et d'autre et que l'appelant en a invoqu\u00e9 les stipulations et retir\u00e9 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices pendant la dur\u00e9e de son mandat de maire. En ce sens, au moins, le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 et est demeur\u00e9 une r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Les tribunaux ne peuvent en ignorer les conventions jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par eux-m\u00eames. Et m\u00eame quand il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9, on ne pourra emp\u00eacher qu'il ait exist\u00e9 et qu'il ait produit des effets dont chaque partie a tir\u00e9 les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, b\u00e9n\u00e9fices que ni l'un ni l'autre n'a jusqu'ici manifest\u00e9 l'intention de remettre \u00e0 son co-contractant.\nDans ces conditions et au point de vue pratique, les actes qualifi\u00e9s d'inexistants ne se distinguent pas des actes nuls de droit. Chez les uns et chez les autres, la nullit\u00e9 a besoin d'\u00eatre reconnue par les tribunaux. Le contrat a eu lieu en fait et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mat\u00e9riellement accompli. Il faut que les tribunaux se prononcent, \"m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 la nullit\u00e9 op\u00e8re de plein droit.\" (Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire pratique vbo Nullit\u00e9, Nos 4 et 5; Planiol, Trait\u00e9 El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil, 6e \u00e9d. tome 1, n\u00b0 330; Planiol & Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ois, vol. 6, n\u00b0 297; Colin & Capitant, Cours El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ois, 3e \u00e9d. vol. 1, pp. 77 et 81; Solon, Th\u00e9orie sur la nullit\u00e9, vol. 1, n\u00b0 16).\nEt en plus de tout ce que nous venons de dire au sujet de la nullit\u00e9 de son contrat, que l'appelant invoque lui-m\u00eame dans le but de se soustraire \u00e0 la loi C. 107, il reste que, dans le cas actuel, il serait impossible aux tribunaux de prononcer la nullit\u00e9 ou m\u00eame de reconna\u00eetre l'existence de cette nullit\u00e9, parce que ni l'une ni l'autre des parties en cause ne la demande (Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, art. 113) ; que, comme le fait remarquer le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, le contrat.\nsemble encore donner aux parties sinon les droits m\u00eames qu'il comporte, du moins d'autres recours possibles;\net que, par dessus tout, la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re, l'une des parties contractantes, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en cause (Lachapelle v. Viger[9]; Burland v. Moffatt[10]; Corporation de la paroisse de St-Gervais v. Goulet[11]).\nSans doute, l'appelant, dans un argument alternatif qui est plut\u00f4t la contradiction du pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, pr\u00e9tend-il que, nonobstant le contrat, ses lots, au moins pendant la p\u00e9riode de temps o\u00f9 il a occup\u00e9 ses fonctions de maire, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s strictement suivant leur \"valeur r\u00e9elle\". Mais il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 en convaincre le juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui, sur ce point, s'est content\u00e9 d'exprimer un doute; et il a contre lui de ce chef l'opinion unanime de la Cour du Banc du Roi qui est clairement d'avis que l'estimation figurant au r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation s'est simplement conform\u00e9e aux stipulations du contrat, sans que les estimateurs aient, en aucune fa\u00e7on, cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 inscrire les lots de l'appelant au r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation suivant leur valeur r\u00e9elle, contrairement au devoir \u00e0 eux impos\u00e9 par Particle 485, et sans tenir aucun compte de leur r\u00e9elle valeur.\nIl reste donc le motif qui, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a fait pencher la balance en faveur de l'appelant, mais qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9 par tous les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Ce motif serait qu'en vertu du contrat, au moment de son \u00e9lection et par la suite, l'appelant n'\u00e9tait plus que le cr\u00e9ancier de la corporation, vu que, quant \u00e0 ce qui le concernait, l'appelant avait rempli toutes ses obligations, lorsqu'il a c\u00e9d\u00e9 les immeubles \u00e0 la ville. Nous partageons l'avis de la Cour du Banc du Roi que ce motif ne saurait \u00eatre admis, soit en fait, soit en droit. La manoeuvre que vise Particle 3 du chapitre 107, c'est d'emp\u00eacher l'existence de relations contractuelles entre le membre d'un conseil et la corporation municipale pendant la dur\u00e9e du mandat du membre du conseil. Or, il para\u00eet \u00e9vident que le contrat consenti par l'appelant avait ici une continuit\u00e9 qui a maintenu l'existence des relations contractuelles bien au del\u00e0 de l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lu maire. Apr\u00e8s avoir c\u00e9d\u00e9 le terrain n\u00e9cessaire aux rues, l'appelant a continu\u00e9 de tirer des avantages de son contrat. Les lots dont il est rest\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire ont continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment au contrat et l'appelant a continu\u00e9 d'en r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. Il est impossible \u00e0 l'appelant de pr\u00e9tendre que ce contrat n'existe plus en autant qu'il est concern\u00e9, pendant que les effets en persistent. La limitation du montant des taxes \u00e0 payer a op\u00e9r\u00e9 d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e et a continu\u00e9 d'op\u00e9rer pendant que l'appelant exer\u00e7ait ses fonctions de maire et au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 s'instruisait la cause actuelle.\nSi m\u00eame l'article 3 du chapitre 107 faisait, sous ce rapport, une distinction entre le d\u00e9biteur et ce que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance appelle le \"cr\u00e9ancier\", en vertu du contrat que cet article prohibe\u2014distinction qui ne para\u00eet pas pouvoir \u00eatre faite au moins en l'esp\u00e8ce (O'Carroll v. Hastings,[12]\u2014il resterait qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'un contractant pour un ouvrage \u00e0 l'entreprise, qui a termin\u00e9 ses travaux mais \u00e0 qui il reste d\u00fb un solde sur le prix, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans Therrien v. Deschambault,[13] mais d'une personne dont les relations contractuelles persistent et ont persist\u00e9 pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du mandat de l'appelant jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9 f\u00fbt venu s'en plaindre par l'action qu'il a intent\u00e9e. Il est tout \u00e0 fait inexact de dire que ce contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 avant que l'appelant ne f\u00fbt \u00e9lu maire, m\u00eame si l'on n'envisage que les obligations de ce dernier. Mais cela devient encore davantage \u00e9vident si l'on songe \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant que ce contrat doit \u00eatre maintenant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ultra vires et nul, sous pr\u00e9texte que la ville de Grand'M\u00e8re n'avait pas le pouvoir n\u00e9cessaire pour le consentir. Il en r\u00e9sultera toutes sortes de consequences dont il suffit de mentionner la plus importante: c'est-\u00e0-dire que les parties devraient \u00eatre remises dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant que le contrat f\u00fbt consenti; et, par cons\u00e9quent, que la ville devrait remettre \u00e0 l'appelant les immeubles que, depuis, elle a convertis en rues, et o\u00f9 il est probable qu'elle a construit des trottoirs et des \u00e9gouts; et que, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'appelant devra subir une nouvelle estimation de ses immeubles sur les r\u00f4les d\u00e9valuation successifs et payer \u00e0 la ville le surplus de taxes que cette nouvelle \u00e9valuation pourra comporter. Il suffit de se rappeler ces choses pour envisager jusqu'\u00e0 quel point la position de maire, que l'appelant a pr\u00e9tendu avoir le droit de continuer d'occuper, mettait ses devoirs de membre du conseil en conflit in\u00e9vitable avec ses int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers. Et c'est l\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que 1'article 3 du chapitre 107 a voulu pr\u00e9venir et \u00e9viter; c'est 1'offense qu'il a voulu punir au moyen des prescriptions qui y sont \u00e9dict\u00e9es.\nIl ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 mentionner un point qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois au cours de l'argumentation devant nous. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 raison du texte de la version anglaise plut\u00f4t que de celui de la version fran\u00e7aise du statut.\nLa version fran\u00e7aise dit que l'inhabilit\u00e9 du membre du conseil pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e\nsur jugement obtenu contre lui en vertu des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente section;\nmais la version anglaise traduit les mots que nous venons de mettre entre guillemets par les suivants: \"if legally convicted thereof under this division\". L'emploi du mot \"convicted\" a d'abord fait penser \u00e0 cette Cour que la d\u00e9qualification devrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d'une condamnation pr\u00e9alable devant un tribunal de juridiction criminelle. Un examen plus attentif du texte de la loi fait voir qu'il ne s'agit, en somme, que d'une condamnation \"under this division\", pour employer la version anglaise, et surtout\nd'un jugement obtenu contre lui en vertu des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi,\npour employer la version fran\u00e7aise, qui est probablement plus claire.\nOr, pour obtenir un jugement en vertu des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente section, ainsi que le dit la version fran\u00e7aise, et c'est-\u00e0-dire en vertu m\u00eame de la Loi concernant les man\u0153uvres frauduleuses et la corruption dans les affaires municipales (c. 107), la poursuite, suivant l'article 17 de la loi, est prise\npar action p\u00e9nale intent\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions des articles 1150 et suivants du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nCet article indique clairement que l'intention de la loi est que la demande en d\u00e9qualification du membre du conseil municipal d\u00e9linquant soit intent\u00e9e devant les tribunaux civils et qu'elle y sera instruite suivant la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8res sommaires.\nIl convient d'ajouter que, dans le cas actuel, l'intim\u00e9 a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pratique dans, la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu de laquelle la condamnation du membre du conseil pour l'infraction \u00e0 l'article 3 du chapitre 107 et la d\u00e9qualification qui s'ensuit ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9es par une seule et. m\u00eame action. Et c'est probablement la raison pour laquelle ce moyen n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 devant les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, soit par les procureurs int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, soit par les juges qui ont entendu la cause.\nL'appelant a donc failli sur tous les points invoqu\u00e9s par lui; et son appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: L\u00e9on M\u00e9thot.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: D\u00e9silets & Deshaies.\n[1] (1939) Q.R. 66 K.B. 133.\n[2] (1938) Q.R. 76 S.C. 382.\n[3] (1938) Q.R. 76 S.C. 382.\n[4] (1939) Q.R. 66 K.B. 133.\n[5] (1879) L.R. 4 Q.B.D. 284, at 288.\n[6] (1883) 8 App. Cas. 798.\n[7] (1872) L.R. 4 P.C. 184, at 191.\n[8] (1930) Q.R. 50 K.B. 440.\n[9] (1906) Q.R. 15 K.B. 257.\n[10] (1885) 11 Can.
