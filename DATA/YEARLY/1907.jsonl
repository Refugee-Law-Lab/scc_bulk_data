(1906) ch. 146) to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to extend the time for service on the Attorney-General of notice of an appeal in a reserved Crown case may be exercised after the expiration of the time limited by the code for the service of such notice. Banner v. Johnston (L.R. 5 H.L. 157) and Vaughan v. Richardson (17 Can. S.C.R. 703) followed.\nAPPLICATION, on behalf of the prisoner, for an order extending the time for the service of a notice of appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, affirming the conviction of the prisoner, Wetmore J. dissenting.\nThe prisoner was convicted, on 16th November, on the charge of murdering one Barrett Henderson, and sentenced to be hanged on the 18th of January, 1907. Pursuant to the provisions of section 743of \"The Criminal Code, 1892,\" the case was reserved for the opinion of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, in banc, and was heard on the questions reserved in the said court on the 9th of January, 1907, at Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, and judg- ment was reserved. Subsequently, on the 15th of January, 1907, judgment was pronounced on the re served case affirming the decision of Newlands J., at the trial, in respect to the matters objected to, by the majority of the said court in banc, Wetmore J. dissenting.\nAn application was then made to the Minister of Justice, at Ottawa, for a new trial under the provisions of section 748 of the \"Criminal Code, 1892,\" and, owing to the time occupied in correspondence, travel ling from Regina to Ottawa, and obtaining a reply from the Minister, more than fifteen days elapsed after the date of such affirmance of the conviction, and, in the meantime, no notice of appeal therefrom had been served upon the Attorney-General as required by the provisions of section 1024 of the \"Criminal Code,\" R.S.C. (1906) ch. .146. In consequence of the expiration of the time so limited, the application was made, in Chambers, for an order to extend the time for the service of the necessary notice.\nBethune and Balfour appeared in support of the application.\nDAVIES J.\u2014An application was made to me, at Chambers, today on behalf of the prisoner for an order under the 750th section of the \"Criminal Code of 1892,\" now section 1024 of the \"Criminal Code,\" R.S.C. (1906), ch. 146, to extend the time for service of notice of appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories refusing a new trial.\nAs the court of appeal was not unanimous in af- firming the conviction of the prisoner he had a right, on serving notice on the Attorney-General\nwithin fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.\nto appeal to the latter court against the affirmance of such conviction.\nFor reasons set out in the affidavits and exhibits produced before me, he did not give the notice of appeal and now, after the expiration of the fifteen days, applies for an extension of the time.\nThe only question upon which I had any doubt was as to my power to grant the extension after the expiration of the fifteen days. A construction requiring the application to be made within the fifteen days would, in a section such as this dealing with the criminal law and where sometimes, as in the case before me, the prisoner's life is at stake, be a very narrow one and might in many cases which can be conceived of in a country of the extent of the Dominion of Canada, if adopted, defeat the object which Parliament seems to have had in view. I, therefore, felt strongly inclined to adopt the broader construction and to hold that the power of extension is exercisable under the section even after the expiration of the prescribed period.\nThere are two authorities which seem to be conclusive upon the point. One is that of Banner v. Johnston ([1]), at pages 170 and 172, and the other that of Vaughan v. Richardson ([2]).\nReference is also made to The North Ontario Election Case; Wheeler v. Gibbs ([3]), which was discussed by Sir William Ritchie C.J., in The Glengarry Election Case ([4]), at page 460.\nI have had the advantage of consulting with the Chief Justice and with Mr. Justice Girouard, who agree with me that in view of these authorities, there can be no doubt of my power to make the order.\nOrdered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the applicant: James Balfour.\n[1] L.R. 5 H.L. 157.\n[2] 17 Can.

The appellants, being creditors of the insolvent to the amount of $600, filed a tierce opposition asking to have the license restored to the curator to be disposed of by him for the benefit of the creditors generally.

In that case the direct issue between the parties was as to the ownership of a certain quantity of spool wood admittedly of a value exceeding $2,000.\nHere the appellant, a creditor of one Herschorn for the sum of $600, by a proceeding known under the Quebec Code of Procedure as a tierce opposition asked that a judgment rendered ex parte seven months before, and to which the curator to the estate was a party, be set aside. By the judgment to which this opposition was fyled the respondent was declared to be entitled to the possession as owner of certain property then in the hands of the curator to Herschorn's estate, and the question in issue on the tierce opposition was the right of the present appellant to have the ex parte judgment rendered in favour of the respondent set aside.

L.R. 75) which sustained the verdict at the trial (10 Ont. L.R. 280) that the rate for water supplied to any class of consumers must be an equal rate to all members of such class and a by-law providing for a rate on certain manufacturers higher than that to be paid by others was illegal. Attorney General v. City of Toronto (23 Can. S.C.R. 514) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nBy Act of the Ontario Legislature in 1856[3], a Board of Water Commissioners for the City of Hamilton was established, and sections 9 and 10 provided that:\u2014\n(Section 9) \u201cThe Board of Commissioners for the time being shall regulate the distribution and use of the water in all places and for all purposes where the same may be required, and from time to time shall fix the prices for the use thereof and the times of payment, and they may erect such number of public hydrants and in such places as they shall see fit, and direct in what manner and for what purposes the same shall be used, all of which they may change at their discretion. * *.\u201d\n(Section 10) \u201cThe owner and occupier of any house, tenement or lot shall each be liable for the payment of the price or rent fixed by the Commissioners for the use of the water by such occupier, and such price or rent so fixed shall be a lien upon the said house, tenement or lot in the same way and manner as other taxes assessed on real estate in the said City of Hamilton are liens, and shall be collected in like manner if not previously paid to the Commissioners.\u201d\nBy an amendment in 1860[4] it was provided that\n(Section 1.) \u201cThe Water Commissioners for the City of Hamilton shall, in addition to the powers con- ferred upon them by the said Act, have full power and authority to levy and raise such a yearly or other rate or assessment or water rent on all and singular the real property within the said City, whether owned by private individuals or bodies corporate, by, near or contiguous to which the water pipes may pass, and upon the stock in trade, household furniture and goods and chattels belonging to or in possession of the owners or occupants of such real estate (save and except always the property, real and personal, of any railway company) as shall, in the opinion of the Commissioners, be sufficient to pay the yearly interest, at a rate not to exceed four per centum per annum on the cost of the said water works and the yearly expenses thereof, or such portion of such interest and expenses as in their judgment should be levied and raised in each year and be borne by such owners and occupants; and the Commissioners shall have power and authority from time to time to fix the rate or rates such owner or occupant or both such owner and occupant shall pay, having due regard to the advantages derived by such owner or occupant or conferred upon him or his or their property by the water works and the locality in which the same is situated * *.\u201d\nIn 1861 by the Act 24 Vict. ch. 56, the water works were vested in the City which was given all the powers formerly vested in the Commissioners. Sections 3 and 4 of that Act provide as follows:\n(Section 3) \u201cThe Corporation of the City of Hamilton shall, through its Council, have full power and authority to exercise all the powers conferred upon the said Commissioners (save as aforesaid), and in addition thereto it shall be lawful for the said cor- poration, through its council, from time to time to establish by by-law a tariff of rents or rates for water supplied or ready to be supplied in the said City from the said water works; which said tariff of rents or rates shall be payable at the times and in the manner established in the said by-laws, by all proprietors, occupants or others supplied with water from the said works, or whom the said council may be prepared and ready to supply with water; which said tariff of rates shall and may be made payable by all such proprietors, occupants or others as well by those who refuse as by those who consent to receive into their houses, stores or other buildings the water-pipe to supply the said water; but such tariff of rents or rates shall not be payable by the proprietors or occupants of any such house, store or other building until after the said council shall have notified them that they are prepared and ready to supply the same with water, and if from the time of such notification to the next period appointed for the payment of such tariff, rents or rates there shall be any broken period, then such tariff shall be payable pro rat\u00e2 for such broken period as if accruing and due day by day * *.\u201d\n(Section 4) \u201cThe council shall not have power to impose a special rate as provided for by (section 1, 23 Victoria, chapter 87), other than the water rate or rent hereinbefore referred to; but any sum required to pay the interest of the debentures issued for the said water works and the yearly expenses thereof, which the water rents may be insufficient to meet, shall be levied by a general assessment in the same manner as assessments for other purposes under the general assessment laws.\u201d\nIn 1902 the city passed two by-laws which occa- sioned the litigation in these cases. The first was bylaw No. 224, which provides that\u2014\n\u201c(1). From and after the first day of January, 1903, all water supplied to manufacturing establishments in the City of Hamilton that apply for meters under this by-law, or now have meters approved by the manager of the water works, shall be charged for at the rate of seven and one-half cents per thousand gallons, as shewn by meters supplied by the city corporation, the applicants for such meters to pay for them and for their introduction, and also to pay meter rent, to cover the cost of inspection and repairs as follows:\nFor \u00bd inch and \u00be inch meters............. $3.00 per annum\nFor 1 inch meters.................................. $3.40 per annum.\u201d\nEtc., etc.\n\u201c(3). Railway premises, breweries, distilleries and premises where aerated waters are made shall not be included under the term manufacturing establishments used in this by-law, and in the case of any applicant for the supply of a meter under this by-law, where there is a doubt as to the premises in respect of which it is applied for being a manufacturing establishment within the meaning of this by-law, the Assessment Commissioner shall make an investigation and shall report the result to the manager of the water works.\u201d\nAt the time of the passing of this by-law the respondents had a water meter on their premises approved of by the manager of the water works, and which had been put in and maintained at the expense of the respondents.\nAnd by-law No. 237 was as follows:\n\u201c(1). From and after the first day of January, 1903, all waters supplied to breweries, distilleries and premises where aerated waters are made shall be charged for at the rate of 12 cents per thousand gallons, as shewn by the meters supplied by the City Corporation, the occupants of the premises to pay for such meters and for their introduction, and also to pay meter rent to cover the cost of inspection and repairs at the rate specified in By-law No. 224: the water rates and meter rents imposed by this by-law to be payable in the manner and at the times mentioned in section 7 of said By\u2011law No. 224, and to be subject to the penalties therein provided.\u201d\nThe respondents paid, under protest, the rates imposed under the latter by-law for the years 1903 and 1904, and in December, 1904, they respectively took action against the city by which they prayed\u2014\n(1) That it be declared by this Honourable Court that by-laws numbers 224 and 237 of the defendant Corporation are illegal and invalid in so far as they authorized the defendant Corporation to levy and collect from the plaintiffs water rates in excess of the general rates charged by the defendant Corporation to manufacturers in the City of Hamilton.\n(2) And that it may be declared that the defendant Corporation has no power or authority to levy and collect water rates at the rate specified in such by-laws.\n(3) A mandamus commanding the defendant Corporation to repeal such by-laws or the portions thereof complained of.\n(4) And an injunction to restrain the defendant Corporation from levying on or seeking to collect from the plaintiffs water rates calculated at a higher rate than that charged generally to other manufacturers in the City of Hamilton. (5) And such further and other relief as may be just.\nMr. Justice Street, who tried the case, was of opinion that the city was bound to supply water to all consumers without discrimination as to rates as decided in Attorney-General v. The City of Toronto[5], and gave judgment declaring the by-laws illegal in so far as they purported to authorize the city to collect from the plaintiffs a higher rate than that imposed on other manufacturers and restraining the city from levying or seeking to collect any higher rate[6]. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for the same reasons[7]. The city appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBlackstock K.C. and Rose, for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. and Bell, for the respondents, were heard on the merits and also raised the question of jurisdiction to hear the appeals.\nThe judgment of the court on the question of jurisdiction was delivered by\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The appeals are by the City of Hamilton from judgments in these cases, in similar terms, declaring to be invalid certain by-laws of the city authorizing the levying and collecting from the respondents, water rates, at a higher rate than those imposed upon other manufacturers in the city, and restraining the city from recovering or levying from the respondents, respectively, any greater rates. The judgments appealed against are of the Court of Appeal for Ontario whereby judgments at the trial were affirmed.\nOn opening of the appeals, objection was made by the respondents to the jurisdiction of this court to hear the appeals, no leave having been obtained from the Court of Appeal, or from this court.\nNo relief is sought in the action but the declaration and injunction above mentioned; and no return of rates already paid is sought. Therefore, the only clause of the Act, 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 34, regulating the right to appeal to this court from the Court of Appeal for Ontario which could be invoked, as possibly permitting an appeal, is clause (d), which allows it:\nWhere the matter in question relates to the taking of an annual or other rent, customary and other duty or fee, or a like demand of a general or public nature, affecting future rights.\nWe are of opinion that these cases cannot be held to come within the language of that clause, and that, without leave, this court has no jurisdiction.\nWe, however, allow the appeals to stand to afford the appellants an opportunity, if so advised, to apply to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal.\nThe appellants afterwards filed an order of the Court of Appeal granting leave to appeal to this court, and on a subsequent day judgment was given on the merits as follows.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think these appeals must be dismissed. I recognize the force of much that was said on argument in support of the principle that a municipality constructing water works and providing dwelling houses, manufactories and citizens generally with such supplies of water as they found necessary for their domestic or trade or other purposes should have the same power to regulate their water rates as an ordinary incorporated water company has in supplying its customers.\nThat argument, however, is one to be directed more to the legislature which confers the powers and determines their extent and limits than to this court whose duty it is simply to construe the language the legislature has used.\nI do not see what bearing the case of Fortier v. Lamb[8] can have on these cases, and I do not agree that it in any way modifies or affects the judgment of this court in Attorney-General of Canada v. City of Toronto[9].\nAs to the latter case I agree that there is much in the reasoning of the court there which is applicable to the cases at bar. But I do not think that case absolutely concludes those now before us because the question arose on a statute differently worded and presented a somewhat different point for decision.\nAlike, however, in that case as in these there is involved the validity of a city by-law claiming in one way or another to confer upon the city the power to differentiate or discriminate in the prices actually charged as between different members of the same class of customers for water supplied.\nAs to the power of the legislature to confer such powers upon a civic corporation I do not entertain any doubt. It falls within those plenary powers vested in those bodies by the \u201cBritish North America Act, 1867,\u201d and if any of them in attempting to confer such powers used apt and proper language I conceive it would be the duty of this court to give the language its full and proper effect. The question would be and ought to be simply whether such language has been used as confers the power claimed.\nTo determine whether it has been used in the legislation under discussion is the duty now before us. We have been referred to the history of the legislation with regard to the water works of Hamilton and I have gone carefully over the several statutes to which our attention has been called.\nIt seems to me, however, that the power of the city if found anywhere must be found in the statute of 24 Victoria, ch. 56. The 3rd section of this statute while expressly retaining to the city council power and authority to exercise all the powers of the former Commissioners goes on to say: \u201cAnd in addition thereto it shall be lawful for the said corporation through its council from time to time to establish by by-law a tariff of rents or rates for water supplied or ready to be supplied in the said city from the said water works.\u201d The section goes on to enact provisions necessary to enable the general words I have quoted to be effectively carried out.\nThe 4th section declares that \u201cthe council shall not have power to impose a special rate as provided for by section 1 of 23 Vict. ch. 87, other than the water-rate hereinbefore referred to, but any sum required to pay the interest for the debentures issued for the said water works and the yearly expenses thereof which the water rates may be insufficient to meet shall be levied by a general assessment in the same manner as assessments for other purposes under the general assessment laws.\u201d\nComparing these two sections with the previous legislation conferring powers upon the former Commissioners, it seems clear to me that the power to pass the by-laws in question must be found in these sections and in these alone.\nIt was pressed strongly upon us by Mr. Blackstock that the use of the phrase \u201ctariff of rates or rents\u201d by the legislature indicated a clear intention of giving to the municipal council the powers of differentiating or discriminating claimed by them. In interpreting this legislation I would not desire to apply the technical or strict canons of construction sometimes applied to legislation authorizing taxation. I think the sections are, considering the subject matter and the intention obviously in view, entitled to a broad and reasonable if not, as Lord Chief Justice Russell said in Kruse v. Johnson[10], at p. 99, a \u201cbenevolent construction,\u201d and if the language used fell short of expressly conferring the powers claimed, but did confer them by a fair and reasonable implication I would not hesitate to adopt the construction sanctioned by the implication. I cannot, however, find in the special phrase quoted or in any other of the language used, anything which by any fair and reasonable construction could be held by implication to contain the power to discriminate as between manufactories in establishing the tariff of rents or rates. I have assumed all through my argument that the appellants\u2019 factories were manufacturing establishments within the meaning of these words as used in the by-laws. The argument that they were not was not strongly pressed, and I could see little ground to support it. If they were, the question became reduced to the simple one of the power of the city under the two sections of the statute I have specially quoted to discriminate in its charges for water as between one manufacturing establishment and another. As I have already said, to possess such power by the city the legislature must either have expressly conferred it or used language which fairly and reasonably implied it. I cannot find it has done either and so must hold the by-law which assumes the power and attempts to exercise it, invalid to the extent it professes to discriminate.\nBy-laws passed by municipalities in Canada which are partial and unequal in their operation as between the classes affected by them must to be held intra vires be supported by legislation which expressly or by necessary implication sanctions and authorizes the inequality.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014These cases both depend on the validity of the same by-laws of the appellants, for both respondents come within the class specially singled out for what is claimed by them to be an illegal discrimination in regard to water rates.\nThey fall so far within the principles upon which the decision of this court in The Attorney\u2011General of Canada v. The City of Toronto[11], proceeded, that I am surprised to find an appeal here on the subject.\nThe by-law in question in that case was attempted to be supported upon the ground that service of water to those who did not pay the ordinary taxes of the municipality could not be expected at the same rates as in the cases of those who bore the taxes, and out of those taxes the risks and burthen of procuring and vending or supplying the water.\nMr. Justice Osler, who wrote the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case, said therein:\nI also agree with the learned judge below, that the price, rent or rate paid for the water is not a tax or in the nature of a tax, at all events, where it is actually supplied to a consumer and not attempted to be charged upon property under sec. 12 of the 35 Vict. ch. 79, whether used or not. Under the by-laws in question the water is sold and what is paid by or charged to the consumer is the price.\nThese sentences put tersely the reasons why the Court of Appeal did not think the by-law, in the Toronto case, infringed the principles of law that forbid a municipal corporation passing an unreasonable or discriminating by-law.\nThough plausible, these reasons did not prevail here nor in the Privy Council.\nThe appellants have not been able to put forward here, in support of the by-law now in question, anything possessing even the semblance of such plausibility. There is in Hamilton a general water rate that is based on a percentage, according to the assessed value of the property, and is imposed upon all property which is upon the appellant\u2019s mains, and can be served by appellants therefrom.\nThe respondents must pay that water-rate, even though they should have the facility to get their supply of water elsewhere at a cheaper rate.\nBut if they want water they cannot, being of a specified class, get it by paying the water-rate until they have installed a meter to measure it. And when they have so installed the meter, they cannot get the water unless they pay a special rate far beyond the general water rate, and nearly double what any other class of manufacturers (save those of aerated waters) have to pay.\nAnd yet it is urged that there is no improper discrimination.\nSome people would no doubt be glad to make the test for discrimination rest upon religious faith, or want of faith, and be able to shew, or at least to argue, that there was no improper discrimination in that.\nIn Hamilton they seem to apply the test of the relative profits, derivable from the different kinds of manufacturing business, or possibly the relative moral character of each, or perchance the relative economic results from the point of view of the production of general material wealth.\nNone of these, or any other grounds I have heard suggested, justify in law the clear discrimination that exists in the provisions of this by-law.\nIt was urged, however, that inasmuch as the origin of the city owning these works was that a company long ago had built and owned the works, or part of them, now in question, and had powers given them which, it is alleged, would uphold such discrimination, and these powers were, with the transfer of the works by a process needless to dwell upon, acquired therewith by the city, hence the discrimination in question can and must be upheld.\nI do not unreservedly accede to the proposition that such a general and comprehensive transfer of powers (as alleged and in language appears here) to a municipal corporation would, regardless of the general purview of the statutes transferring plant and powers, of necessity transfer and invest the municipal corporation with something in the nature of a power that in its hands might become most oppres- sive, though innocuous in the hands of the private corporation.\nI must also be permitted to doubt the existence, in a private corporation of the character of the one in question, which was intended to serve the public in a way that gave it a practical monopoly, of any very wide powers of discrimination.\nThe purview of its character manifestly was against such a power of reckless or unlimited discrimination. Unless given, by more express terms than appears, in the statutes in question for consideration in this case, I would not be disposed to hold it was intended to be given. I think entirely too much importance was attached in argument to this transfer of powers and to the use of the word \u201ctariff,\u201d and the plural terms \u201cprices,\u201d \u201crents,\u201d and \u201crates\u201d in these statutes.\nAnalagous terms appeared in the statutes in question in The Attorney-General of Canada v. The City of Toronto[12]. Moreover, the general history of the development of the water supply, powers and duties, was much alike in the two cases.\nFirst a private company, and then water commissioners and then the municipal corporation, are in each case parallel leading features.\nThere may be cases wherein the cost of supplying the water may render an even rate per gallon most inequitable. I can conceive of cases, where the uniform charge of a flat rate per gallon might be in itself a grave discrimination against some of those supplied, in possession of properties having great natural advantages, and in favour of those whose properties had corresponding natural disadvantages, to supply whom might cost double that of the former. I will not go further than to say that I have not overlooked possible modifications of rates that might exist and yet not be improperly discriminating in character.\nIf the \u201cuniformity of rates\u201d spoken of by Sir Henry Strong in his judgment in the Toronto Case12 excludes the possibility of giving due consideration to such possible conditions, then I cannot in that regard agree with it. I do not, however, so read it. The general principles it enunciates, and at some length elucidates, I heartily agree in. I would regret to see them impaired.\nI think these appeals must be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The question in these appeals is whether or not the City of Hamilton, in administering its water works, can lawfully charge one class of manufacturers a higher price for water supplied than another, both classes being supplied by meter, and the only difference between them being the nature of their business.\nThe city has passed by-laws assuming to charge the one class 7\u00bd cents per thousand gallons, and the other class, of which the plaintiffs are two, twelve cents per thousand gallons.\nThe waterworks were constructed, and are maintained and administered, at the expense of the city, and as one of its departments. It is not an independent company selling a commodity to customers, and which can sell to one and refuse to sell to another or which can sell at one price to one customer and exact a different price from another. The works and the water are the property of the inhabitants, who are the corporation, maintained and provided for their benefit, and ought to be administered with all possible equality; and it would in my opinion require very clear and unambiguous language on the part of the legislature to authorize the discrimination attempted by these by-laws.\nIn Attorney-General of Canada v. City of Toronto[13], it was held that under the authority given to municipal corporations to fix the rate of rent to be paid by each owner or occupant of a building supplied by the corporation with water, the rates imposed must be uniform.\nThe language of the Acts governing that case gave the city power\nfrom time to time to fix the price rate or rent which any owner, etc., shall pay as water rates, or rent * * * from time to time shall fix the price for the use thereof and the times of payment,\nwhile in the present case the power conferred is\nfrom time to time to establish by by-law a tariff of rents or rates for water supplied, or ready to be supplied in the said city from the said water works. 24 Vict. ch. 56, s. 3(Can.).\nI am unable to perceive that the power conferred in the present case is any wider, or more extensive, than in the Toronto Case13, and I think the words fall far short of conferring the power of fixing one rate for one kind of business, and another rate for another kind of business.\nIn that case Strong C.J. used the following language, at page 519:\nThe water works were not constructed for the benefit of the ratepayers alone, but for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the city generally whether tax payers or not. And referring to section 480(3) of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d he adds:\nThat provision makes it a duty obligatory upon the city to furnish water to all who may apply for it, thus treating the corporation not as a mere commercial vendor of a commodity but as a public body entrusted with the management of the water for the benefit of the whole body of inhabitants, and compelling them as such to supply this element, necessary not merely for the private purposes and uses of individuals but indispensable for the preservation of the public health and the general salubrity of the city. It must, therefore, have been intended by the legislature that the water was to be supplied upon some fixed and uniform scale of rates, for otherwise the city might by fixing high and exhorbitant prices in particular cases, evade the duty imposled by this section. In other words, the city * * * is in a sense a trustee of the water works, not for the body of ratepayers exclusively, but for the benefit of the general public, or at least of that portion of it resident in the city; and they are to dispense the water for the benefit of all, charging only such rates as are uniform, fair and reasonable.\nTo the like effect and with equal emphasis, is the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in the same case, at pages 525-6, holding that in such a case there may not be any inequality or discrimination in price.\nIt was argued that the power to establish a tariff of rents or rates distinguished the present from the Toronto Case[14], and imported a power to discriminate between users of water. But even tariffs of customs, for example, do not discriminate in the duty exacted upon goods of the same kind and quality, but only upon those of different kinds or qualities.\nI am clearly of opinion that these appeals must be dismissed, with costs both here and below.\nDUFF J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeals with costs.

The forgeries were not discovered until some months after these cheques had been paid by the drawee to the several other banks, on presentation, and charged against the Receiver General on the account of the department with the bank. None of the cheques were marked with the drawee\u2019s acceptance before payment. In the meantime, the accountant of the department, being deceived by false returns of checking by the clerk, acknowledged the correctness of the statements of the account as furnished by the bank where it was kept. In an action by the Crown to recover the amount so paid upon the forged cheques and charged against the Receiver General:\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (11 Ont. L.R. 595) that the bank was liable unless the Crown was estopped from setting up the forgery.\nPer Davies, Idington and Duff JJ., that estoppel could not be invoked against the crown.\nPer Girouard and Maclennan JJ., that, apart from the question of the Crown being subject to estoppel, under the circumstances of this case a private person would not have been estopped had his name been forged as drawer of the cheques.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ.\u2014The acknowledgment by the accountant of the department of the correctness of the statements furnished by the bank, being made under a mistake as to the facts, the accounts could be re-opened to have the mistake rectified.\nThe defendant bank made claims against the other banks, as third parties, as indorsers or as having received money paid by mistake, for the reimbursement of the several amounts so paid to them, respectively. On these third party issues, it was held,\nPer Girouard and Maclennan JJ.\u2014The drawee, having paid the cheques on which the name of its customer was forged, could not recover the amounts thereof from holders in due course. Price v. Neal (4 Burr. 1355) followed.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ.\u2014As the third party banks relied upon the representation that the cheques were genuine, which was to be implied from their payment on presentation, and subsequently paid out of the funds to their depositor or on his order, the drawee was estopped and could not recover the amounts so paid from them either as indorsers or as for money paid to them under mistake.\nIn the result, the judgment appealed from (11 Ont. L.R. 595) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Anglin J. at the trial[2], whereby it was adjudged that His Majesty the King should recover from the said appellant the sum of $71,731.75 and costs, and whereby the claim of the said appellant against the above-named third parties (except as to the sum of $5.06 which they were adjudged to be entitled to recover against the Quebec Bank) was dismissed with costs.\nThe questions in this action arise on twelve instruments in the form of bankers\u2019 cheques. The Government of Canada employs the Bank of Montreal as its banker, and at the bank\u2019s Ottawa branch keeps a large number of bank accounts under distinc- tive titles, one of which is known as the \u201cDepartment of Militia and Defence Account.\u201d The cheques in question purported to be drawn on this account between 18th December, 1901, and 17th October, 1902. They were apparently all drawn on the regular printed official forms of cheques used by the Department of Militia and Defence, and purported to be signed in the customary manner by the proper officers of that department. They were of three classes:\nSix of them, aggregating $20,005, made payable to the order of Chas. Cote (a fictitious name assumed by one Abondeus Martineau, the supposed forger), were indorsed by the latter in the name \u201cChas. Cot\u00e9,\u201d and were delivered by him to the Quebec Bank, which thereupon credited the amounts thereof to him in an account opened by him in that name in said Quebec Bank, and which afterwards collected the amounts thereof from the Bank of Montreal through the Ottawa clearing house.\nFour of them, aggregating $30,200, made payable to the order of Chas D. Cot\u00e9 (a fictitious name assumed by said Martineau), were indorsed by the latter in the name of \u201cChas. D. Cot\u00e9,\u201d and were by him dealt with in a similar manner in the Sovereign Bank of Canada, and the proceeds were afterwards collected by that bank from the Bank of Montreal through said clearing house.\nTwo of them, aggregating $25,500, were drawn payable to the order of said Martineau, and indorsed and delivered by him to the Royal Bank of Canada which thereupon placed the proceeds thereof to his credit in said bank, and which afterwards collected the amounts thereof from the Bank of Montreal through said clearing house. All these cheques were paid as aforesaid by the Bank of Montreal shortly after their respective dates, and were forthwith charged and debited in said Department of Militia and Defence account, and also in the pass-book sheets, which, in accordance with the usual course of business with all the departments, were sent almost daily to the Department of Militia and Defence.\nThe learned trial judge found the facts substantially as above stated, and further, that all the cheques were forged by Martineau, who fabricated the official signatures of the signing officers by means of tracings from real signatures; that with one exception all these cheques purported to be regularly signed by the two proper signing officers of the Department of Militia and Defence; that one cheque, however, for $3,819.04 was signed by only one officer of the department; and that the Bank of Montreal was not guilty of any negligence or want of care in paying the cheques, with the exception of the one cheque for $3,819.04.\nThe learned judge also found that in the pass-book sheets rendered to the department the cheques in question were charged by the bank against the department as paid on its account, and that the cheques themselves were also sent to the department with the passbook sheets containing charges for the same as the vouchers for such charges; that the cheques in question, after being duly received by the department, were lost or destroyed whilst in the possession of the Crown officers, and were not produced by the Crown at the trial; and further, that the cheques were in fact destroyed by Martineau to whom they were handed for examination by the accountant of the department; that receipts were given periodically for the cheques in question, which receipts also contained an acknowledgment of the correctness of the balances shewn at the credit of the department in the pass-book sheets; such balances having been arrived at after making the charges aforesaid in respect of the cheques in question.\nShepley K.C., and Gormully K.C., for the appellants. As against the Crown the bank\u2019s case rested on contract by an account settled between them and on the customer\u2019s obligation to take reasonable care against exposing the bank to unnecessary danger of loss. See Schofield v. Lord Londesborough[3], at p. 523.\nThe acknowledgment by the department of the correctness of the accounts furnished by the pass-book sheets sent to it almost daily precludes the Crown from now denying that they were correct. Bank of England v. Vagliano. Bros.[4]; Blackburn Building Soc. v. Cunliffe, Brooks & Co.[5]\nAs to the third parties, these banks on presenting the cheques to the appellants warranted their genuineness. Chalmers on Bills, 6 ed., p. 211; East India Go. v. Tritton[6].\nApart from warranty the appellants paid these cheques on a mistake as to the facts, and can recover the amount so paid. The case of Imperial Bank v. Bank of Hamilton[7], is not against this position, but was decided on the ground that Cocks v. Master-man[8] did not apply to a case of simple forgery. But see Kelly v. Solari[9]. The third party banks did not present these cheques for payment as Martineau\u2019s cheques, but as their own, claiming to be holders in due course. See Capital & Counties Bank v. Gordon[10].\nAylesworth K.C., Attorney-General of Canada, and J.H. Moss, for the respondent cited Schofield v. Lord Londesborough3; Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Marshall[11].\nLafleur K.C., and Matheson, for the Quebec Bank, third party, referred to Gaden v. Newfoundland Savings Bank[12].\nJ.A. Ritchie for the Sovereign Bank, relied on Price v. Neal[13], and also referred to United States Bank v. Bank of Georgia[14].\nGeo, F. Henderson and A. Greene, for the Royal Bank of Canada, cited Bavins, Junr. & Sims v. London & South-Western Bank[15].\nGIROUARD J.\u2014As I understand these appeals I do not think it is necessary to review all the authorities quoted at bar upon forgery of negotiable instruments. The \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d in my opinion, covers nearly the whole case, and as the House of Lords observed in The Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[16], with respect to the \u201cImperial Bills of Exchange Act,\u201d in construing a statute that expressly codifies the law, the court cannot interpret it by the light of previous decisions, except in the case of words of doubtful import or other exceptional circumstances. I accept this rule as a guide and intend to base the conclusions I have arrived at mainly upon the enactments of the statute, especially sections 24 and 54.\nSection 24, par. 1, as amended by 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 10,\u2014amendments which I believe are partly peculiar to Canada,\u2014says that, subject to the provisions of the Act, where a signature on a bill is forged the forged signature is wholly inoperative, unless the party whose signature is forged is precluded from setting up the forgery. It further provides that if a cheque payable to order is paid by the drawee upon a forged indorsement out of the funds of the drawer, the latter shall have no right of action against the drawee for the recovery back of the amount so paid, unless he gives notice in writing of such forgery to the drawee within one year after he has acquired notice of the forgery.\nThis proviso does not meet the case of payment by the drawee upon a forged signature of the drawer, but only upon a forged indorsement, because in the former case he is supposed to know the signature of the drawer, and, in the latter one, is not presumed to know the signature of any indorser. I think the main action of the King against the Bank of Montreal is clearly covered by this first paragraph of section 24.\nIs the King precluded from setting up the forgery? I do not propose to consider this question from the point of view intended by the \u201cAudit Act\u201d or arising out of any prerogative of the Crown. I do not think it is necessary to do so, to arrive at a correct solution of the question. I propose to examine the situation as between mercantile men. Of course I do not lose sight of the relations of mandator and mandatary which undoubtedly exist between the drawer and the drawee so much so that, on the continent of Europe, cheques are generally called mandats. In fact the Act, sec. 74, declares that the duty and authority of a bank to pay them are terminated by notice of the customer\u2019s death.\nBut where is the estoppel in this case, either by language or conduct? Where is the negligence on the part of the Crown? A very clever scheme\u2014as amusing as it was cunning\u2014had been devised and carried out by one of its employees, who for months braved the watching eyes of employees of four banks and the government. He has frankly told the story in his examination in the penitentiary, and it is admitted that it is true in every respect. It is conceded that he obtained the large sum of money involved in these appeals by a series of crimes, always drawing the cheques upon government forms, forging the signature of the drawer, and using the name of a fictitious payee and indorser.\nThe Bank of Montreal claims that, in view of the daily and monthly statements and so-called settlements made with the departments of the government, the Crown is precluded from setting up the forgery. How these documents can amount to a ratification is more than I can conceive. The forgery was not known, not even suspected by any one. This is a very different case from Ewing v. Dominion Bank[17], decided by this court on the ground that appellants had, by their conduct, precluded themselves from setting up the forgery, in which the Privy Council refused leave to appeal[18].\nIn face of the facts proved, I do not see how the Bank of Montreal can succeed, unless we hold that the employer is responsible for the crimes of his servants. The Crown may have certain privileges and safeguards provided for by the \u201cAudit Act\u201d and other prerogatives, but certainly it cannot be in a worse position than ordinary business men. I cannot see that the government has omitted any duty which it owed to the bank, and I must confess that none has been suggested at the argument which commends itself to my mind.\nI would therefore dismiss the main appeal of the Bank of Montreal with costs.\nNow with regard to the third party actions taken by the Bank of Montreal against three banks which, for value, in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, had received the amounts of the forged cheques from the Bank of Montreal, and handed them over to the forger or his order, I believe that these actions must also fail.\nParagraph 2 of the same section 24 has been quoted in support of the claim of the Bank of Montreal. It declares that if a bill bearing a forged indorsement is paid in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, by or on behalf of the drawee or acceptor, the person by whom or on whose behalf such payment is made, shall have the right to recover the amount so paid from the person to whom it was so paid, provided that notice of the indorsement be given, etc. But this enactment does not apply to a bill where the signature of the drawer is forged. In such a case there is no bill (section 3), and the section does not apply. In the latter case, the necessary inference of the section is that the drawee who pays the amount of such paper has no remedy whatever, except, of course, against the forger.\nIt is argued that the law of mistake applies to a case like this. In my humble opinion it does not, because it is governed by special rules established by the law merchant.\nThe appellants have invoked the authority of the Imperial Bank of Canada v. The Bank of Hamilton[19], confirmed by the Privy Council[20]. But that case has no similarity to the present one. There the signature of the drawer was genuine and only the body of the cheque had been altered. Whatever was the jurisprudence in old days, it has been settled by the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d sec. 54, which limits the liability of the acceptor to the genuineness of the signature of the drawer, thus impliedly excluding his liability of the forgery of the body of the bill.\nSection 54 provides that\nthe acceptor of a bill, by accepting it, is precluded from denying to the holder in due course the existence of the drawer, the genuineness of his signature and his capacity and authority to draw the bill.\nTrue, in this case, the cheques were not accepted, although cheques may be accepted like bills of exchange. True, also, the statute does not say: The drawee who accepts or pays is precluded, etc.; but is it necessary? Is it not to be implied? Paying a bill seems to me to be a stronger evidence of the above facts or presumptions, than a mere acceptance. I cannot imagine that any authority is necessary to establish the soundness of this proposition. However, the decisions are not wanting upon this point.\nEver since Price v. Neal[21] has been decided, the jurisprudence has been considered as well settled at least so far as the present case is concerned. Lord Mansfield, stopping counsel from going on with his argument, saying that this was one of those cases that could never be made plainer by argument, continued:\nIt was incumbent upon the plaintiff to be satisfied \u201cthat the bill drawn upon him was the drawer\u2019s hand,\u201d before he accepted or paid it; but it was not incumbent upon the defendant to inquire into it. Here was notice given by the defendant to the plaintiff of a bill drawn upon him; and he sends his servant to pay it and take it up. The other bill, he actually accepts; after which acceptance, the defendant innocently and bon\u00e2 fide discounts it. The plaintiff lies by for a considerable time after he has paid those bills, and then found out \u201cthat they were forged;\u201d and the forger comes to be hanged. He made no objection to them at the time of paying them. Whatever neglect there was, was on his side. The defendant had actual encouragement from the plaintiff himself, for negotiating the second bill, from the plaintiff\u2019s having without any scruple or hesitation paid the first; and he paid the whole value, bon\u00e2 fide. It is a misfortune which has happened without the defendant\u2019s fault or neglect. If there was no neglect in the plaintiff, yet there is no reason to throw off the loss from one innocent man upon another innocent man.\nIt may be said that this decision is old. It was rendered the year before this country became part of the British Empire, in 1762. Moreover, it seems to lay down a principle not involved in its determination which may be considered as an obiter dictum as to the forgery of the body of the bill. But in respect of the forgery of the signature of the drawer, I venture to say that its soundness has never been questioned.\nThe trial judge in these cases, Anglin J., expresses doubts that it is yet law. I entertain no such doubts. Its principles are sanctioned by the Civil Code of Quebec and all the European Codes. They are embodied in the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d sec. 54, except as to the genuineness of the body of the bill.\nLike nearly all the other decisions of Lord Mansfield, the true founder of commercial law in England, it has stood the attacks of both the bar and the bench for a century and a half. It is yet the leading case in England, the United States and Canada, when the facts are as in the present case. It is only when the forgery affects the body of the instrument by raising the amount that its soundness has been doubted or denied, although that point was not involved. The principal and in fact the only question was whether or not the drawee who accepts or pays a forged bill can recover the money back from the holder in due course. The jurisprudence seems to be overwhelming that he cannot.\nIn 1871, Mr. Justice Allen, speaking for the Court of Appeals of New York, in the National Park Bank v. Ninth National Bank[22], reviewed the whole jurisprudence:\nFor more than a century (he says) it has been held and decided, without question, that it is incumbent upon the drawee of a bill to be satisfied that the signature of the drawer is genuine, that he is presumed to know the handwriting of his correspondent; and if he accepts or pays a bill to which the drawer\u2019s name has been forged, he is bound by the act and can neither repudiate the acceptance nor recover the money paid.\nThe doctrine was broached by Lord Raymond in Jenys v. Fawler[23], the Chief Justice strongly inclining to the opinion that even actual proof of forgery of the name of the drawer, would not excuse the defendants against their acceptance. In 1762, the principle was flatly and distinctly decided by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in the leading case of Price v. Neal[24], which was an action to recover money paid by the drawee to the holder of a forged bill. Lord Mansfield stopped the counsel for the defendant, saying that it was one of those cases that never could be made plainer by argument; that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to be satisfied that the bill drawn upon him was the drawer\u2019s hand, before he accepted and paid it, but it was not incumbent for the defendant to inquire into it. This case has been followed, and the doctrine applied, almost without question or criticism, in an unbroken series of cases, from that time to this, and it has been distinctly approved in very many cases, which have not been within the precise range of the principle decided. See Ancher v. Bank of England[25]; Smith v. Mercer[26]; Wilkinson v. Johnson[27]; Cocks v. Masterman[28]; Cooper v. Meyer[29]; Sanderson v. Collman[30]; Smith v. Chester[31].; Bass v. Clive[32]; Bank of Commerce v. Union Bank[33]; Goddard v. Merchant\u2019s Bank[34]; Canal Bank v. Bank of Albany[35].\nCases have been distinguished from Price v. Neal[36] and its applicability to a transfer of a forged instrument, between persons not parties to it, has not been extended to forgeries of indorsements or handwriting of parties to negotiate instruments other than the drawer. But, as applied to the case of a bill to which the signature of the drawer is forged, accepted or paid by the drawee, its authority has been uniformly and fully sustained, and the rule extends as well to the case of a bill paid upon presentment, as to one accepted, and afterwards paid. Bank of St. Albans v. Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank[37]; Levy v. Bank of the United States[38]; Bank of United States v. Bank of Georgia[39]; Young v. Adams[40]; Gloucester Bank v. Salem Bank[41].\nA rule so well established, and so firmly rooted and grounded in the jurisprudence of the country, ought not to be overruled or disregarded.\nAny number of decisions might be added to the foregoing. I will content myself with a reference to a few of them: Salt Springs Bank v. Syracuse Savings Institution, 1863,[42]; Howard & Preston v. Mississippi Valley Bank of Vicksburg, 1876,[43]; First National Bank of Marshalltown v. Marshalltown State Bank, 1899,[44]; Crocker-Woolworth National Bank of San Francisco v. Nevada Bank of San Francisco, 1903,[45]. See also Union Bank of Lower Canada v. Ontario Bank, 1880,[46]; Ryan v. Bank of Montreal, 1887,[47].\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that all the appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The nature of the plaintiff\u2019s case is of the simplest. The defendant has been acting for many years as banker for the plaintiff\u2019s government in Canada and has from time to time large sums of money standing to the credit of the plaintiff\u2019s government account against which certain government officials are authorized to draw cheques.\nThe defendant during the years 1901 and 1902 paid certain alleged cheques aggregating $75,705, and charged the same against the plaintiff\u2019s said account. These alleged cheques were proved at the trial, and found by the trial judge, to be forgeries and the amount represented by them has therefore been charged by the defendant against the plaintiff wrongfully and without authority.\nUnder these facts the plaintiff has a right to recover back the amount of the forged cheques sued for and improperly charged against him unless by some acts or series of acts or conduct on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s officials, the King has been estopped from denying the genuineness if the cheques or unless as contended by the defendant the accounts rendered from time to time by the bank to the Department of Militia must be treated under the circumstances as having been settled by agreement and cannot be re-opened.\nIt appears that the account of the Department of Militia and Defence upon which the forged cheques were drawn was an active one, a very large number of cheques being paid and charged against it daily, and during the period in question the practice was adopted by the defendants of making out what were called \u201cpass-book sheets\u201d which were sent frequently, and sometimes daily, by registered letter addressed to the accountant of the department with which were also enclosed the original cheques. At the end of each month a complete statement was sent shewing all cheques paid during the month, and the letters of credit and moneys received during the month by the bank and the balance at the credit of the department. With this monthly statement was sent a blank form of receipt to be signed by the accountant acknowledging that he had received the cheques entered in the statement and had examined the same and found the balance to be correct.\nThe accountant of the department assigned to Martineau (the forger of the cheques in question) the duty of comparing these statements with the cheques and the books of the department, and on his reporting them to be correct the accountant or his assistant was in the habit of signing the receipt and returning it to the bank. Martineau was, of course, on the lookout for the forged cheques as they were sent up from the defendant\u2019s bank, and immediately destroyed them, but, as they were included in the pass-book sheets, he reported them along with the genuine cheques as being duly vouched and they were accordingly receipted for by the accountant along with the genuine cheques. The balances for each month which were thus acknowledged to be correct during the period in question included and charged against the Militia Department the forged cheques.\nIt is urged on behalf of the defendants that these facts as above outlined constitute a breach on the part of the plaintiff of a duty owing to the defendants and that by reason of such breach of duty the plaintiff is debarred from recovering.\nThe natural and logical legal basis for such a defence is the principle of estoppel and, indeed, Mr. Gormully invoked the application of this principle on the facts proved as a good defence. The trial judge, however, held that estoppel could not prevail against the Crown; the appeal court of Ontario sustained that ruling and then an ingenious attempt was made by defendant\u2019s counsel to shift the ground of the defence and it was argued that by accepting the pass-book sheets and acknowledging their receipt and by acknowledging the correctness of the monthly balances shewn by the defendants, a contractual relation was established by implication and that the plaintiff was bound by the signature of the accountant of the department as by a settled account.\nI agree with the courts below that the ordinary doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked as against the Crown in any such case as this and on any such facts as are proved here.\nWith regard to the argument that a contractual obligation arose between the Crown and the bank out of the officer\u2019s signature to the acknowledgment of the correctness of the pass-book sheets as rendered, I am quite unable to appreciate it apart from the doctrine of estoppel.\nWhy the signature as to the correctness of these pass-book sheets should have a different effect from the signature of settlement to any ordinary account so as to prevent it being re-opened in case of the discovery of a mistake, I am at a loss to understand. The officer signing the account as correct was deceived into doing so by a clever forger. The same forger deceived the bank by the forged signatures. If the circumstances under which the accounts were acknowledged to the bank could be held to be an estoppel well and good. But the doctrine cannot be applied as against the Crown and outside of it I cannot find any contract settling the accounts as between the government and the bank and prohibiting their being re-opened in case of mistake.\nThe bank became the plaintiff\u2019s debtor for the money had and received and, outside of estoppel, nothing but payment, accord and satisfaction or a release under seal would be an answer to plaintiff\u2019s demand.\nI assent to the argument of the Attorney-General that the \u201cAudit Act\u201d prescribes and defines the only means by which accounts between banks and the government can finally be settled and that no departmental officer has any authority outside of this Act to sign any settlement binding the Crown. The Crown cannot be estopped by the act of clerk or official.\nIn this case the pass-book sheets daily sent from the bank to the department were so sent as a matter of convenience to the respective officers of the bank and the department. Such a course would seem business- like and proper; but it is quite outside of the \u201cAudit Act\u201d and I do not concede the argument of the defendant as to the limited usage of that Act or that it is to be strictly confined to the internal arrangements between the government departments and does not cover the dealings with the banks mentioned in it.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal of the Bank of Montreal as against the King must be dismissed with costs.\nThe next question we have to deal with is the right of the Bank of Montreal to recover back these moneys from the several banks to which they paid the cheques respectively, notwithstanding the change of position to their prejudice which the delay had caused through these banks having in the meantime paid out the moneys received to the forger relying upon the payment of the cheques by the payee as representation of their genuineness. I have reached the conclusion that on this branch of the case also the judgment and reasoning of the Court of Appeal must on the findings of fact of the trial judge be sustained.\nI have read the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Girouard in which he also agrees with the conclusions of the Court of Appeal, but upon the sole ground that the cases of the three banks are governed by the principles laid down in the case of Price v. Neal[48], and Smith v. Mercer[49], principles emphatically affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States and many of the states courts in the cases he cites.\nThe general doctrine asserted and supported by such very high authorities is that the acceptor of a bill or cheque is presumed to know the handwriting of the drawer; that it is rather by his fault or negligence than by mistake if he accepts or pays on a forged signature, and that once paid he cannot on discovery of the forgery recover back the money irrespective of equities.\nThe rule contended for makes no distinction between the bon\u00e2 fide holder of a bill or cheque ignorant of the forgery who has discounted or paid money for the bill or cheque before he presents it for payment, and one who does so only after the payee has honoured the bill or cheque relying upon the representation of its genuineness which may be said to be made by the payee, and before having any notice or knowledge of the forgery.\nIn the one case it is obvious that the holder having first paid out his money on the faith he himself had in the genuine character of the bill or cheque or in the credit and responsibility of the person from whom he received it, could not be said to have relied upon the subsequent act of the payee in paying the bill or cheque, while in the other case he may well have done so. But no such distinction was made in the case of Price v. Neal[50], relied on. As a matter of fact the holder of the first bill in that case appears to have paid for it to the person from whom he received it before it was presented to and paid by the drawee. The rule proceeds upon the idea that a banker\u2019s supposed duty to know his customer\u2019s signature can be invoked as well by a third party (the holder of the bill) as by the banker\u2019s customer. So far as the rule has been held applicable to the case of a holder who cannot be said in any way, in parting with his money, to have relied upon any act or representation of the drawee in paying the bill or cheque on presentation and not to have altered his position or been prejudiced in any way in consequence, it has been subjected to much criticism and challenge.\nThe rule has only been embodied in the \u201cBills of Exchange Act\u201d so far as acceptances are concerned, nothing being said as to the effect of payment. The extent to which that section 54 of the Act applies with regard to acceptances is not now before us. If the rule laid down so broadly in Price v. Neal[51] is to be held in force now it must be as part of the law merchant, and it is at least significant that the Act is limited to declaring the effect of acceptances of bills while the effect of payment is not referred to.\nThere is a distinction between the facts in the cases of the Royal Bank and the Quebec Bank on the one hand and on that of the Sovereign Bank on the other. In the case of the first two banks the forger deposited the cheques in dispute in the savings bank branch of the bank and under the special conditions set out in the evidence. In the one case the depositor was precluded from drawing the money out for three days and in the other for fifteen days, ample time in each case to ensure that the cheques would be presented for payment and either paid or refused payment before the depositor had any right to withdraw any of the moneys. I would not think that the decision of the House of Lords in the case of Capital & Counties Bank v. Gordon[52] was applicable to a deposit on such special conditions or that it could be held under the authority of that case that the crediting of the cheques to the depositor\u2019s account made the money his. It was, in the circumstances of the deposit and credit made in these two banks, merely a conditional credit and subject to the special terms to which the depositor must be taken to have assented when he deposited his money. Gordon\u2019s Case[53] does not go further than to determine that, in the absence of special agreement to the contrary, the crediting a depositor with the amount of cheques deposited by him makes that credit a fund upon which the depositor has a right to draw. But, of course, the parties by special agreement can alter that and this I would hold was done. In that case these two banks would be merely collecting agents for the payee of the cheques, and not having indorsed the cheques, but having collected the moneys for the payee and paid it out to him before they had any notice of the forgeries would not be liable to refund the moneys to the Bank of Montreal.\nAs there is no indorser on any of these cheques to whom notice of dishonour had to be given in order to hold them liable, and the rule laid down in Cocks v. Masterman[54], as explained and qualified in Imperial Bank of Canada v. Bank of Hamilton[55], cannot be invoked, I prefer to rest my judgment in the case of all of the three banks substantially upon the ground on which the Court of Appeal determined them, namely, that by paying the cheques to the persons presenting them the Bank of Montreal represented to them that the cheques had in fact the genuine signatures of the drawers, and if upon the faith of that implied representation the holders of the cheques received the moneys, as I think they did, and subse- quently paid them away to the person who deposited the cheques with them or otherwise had their positions altered to their prejudice respectively, in consequence of such implied representations and in ignorance of the forgeries, they cannot be compelled subsequently by the drawee who paid the money on discovering that the cheques were forgeries to pay back the money.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs, as well against the King as against the three several banks.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am unable to find any contract in the facts presented here that would preclude the Crown from the right to have rectification of such a clear mistake or series of mistakes as occurred in one or more of its subordinate officers assenting to a stated account and incidentally thereto, in some instances, assenting erroneously to the number of cheques alleged in the statement as correctly representing the number chargeable. I see nothing, but the possible something that might rest on the doctrine of estoppel, not binding on the Crown, that could be considered if the case were one between private persons or corporations, that in law could by any possibility support the appellant\u2019s defence to this action. I think, therefore, the appeal as to the Bank of Montreal against the Crown must fail.\nIn regard to the rights of the appellants to recover back from each of the third parties such respective sums as either got by reason of their presentation for payment of one or more of the forged cheques, there arise some more difficult questions.\nUpon the facts presented in this case the right to recover cannot rest on any implied guarantee. Nor do I see how the contention, set up here for the first time, that sub-section 2 of section 24 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act,\u201d 1890, as amended by 60 & 61 Vict. ch. 10, entitles the appellants to recover can be maintained.\nIt seems to me that the liability covered by, if not created by, this sub-section is only applicable to the case of the forged indorsement of a genuine bill of exchange. It surely never was intended to be extended to the case of a forged bill, which in law is no bill.\nThe remaining ground taken on which to rest these claims is the right to recover money paid by mistake.\nLet us bear in mind that the action for money had and received by means of which this right has usually been asserted, rests upon the principle that prim\u00e2 facie it is against equity and good conscience that the party who received it should retain it, and remember further that in many instances this prim\u00e2 facie case is answered by virtue of conditions existing at the time of payment, or subsequent events creating, so to speak, a countervailing equity that would make it against equity and good conscience to insist on the return of the money.\nA mere messenger, for example, receiving money by mistake, and handing it over to his employer, occupies a position that no one would think should render him liable in an action for money had and received once he has in good faith discharged his duty of paying it over. The banker collecting bills of exchange is in somewhat the same position.\nThe whole business of bankers dealing with negotiable securities presents many phases somewhat analogous to the cases of agency, wherein it would be in- equitable to ask for a return of the money from the very hand that received it.\nThe case here is clearly not that of an agent collecting, but of a bank discounting what was a forgery, but supposed to be a genuine bill, and placing to the credit of its customer the supposed value of such discounted bill.\nBut when the question of pure agency is thus eliminated how much nearer are we to a solution of the question before us?\nWherein does the actual position of the banker when he has, for a trifling percentage given credit for the proceeds of a discounted bill, substantially differ from that of the mere agent?\nThe case of the East India Company v. Tritton[56] was held to be a case of agency. But the reasoning upon which the court proceeded was that when the agent had received the money he had no anwser to his principal, then asking it from him.\nApart from special rules of business the banker may have relative to particular accounts or classes of accounts, what answer can he make (to a demand by his customer for the money credited to him), in the absence of all knowledge or means of knowledge of fraud, or wrong, and in face of the fact that the discounted bill has been paid him, and the assurance thus been given by the drawee that the bank may rely on it? When the nature of the banker\u2019s business is thus considered, his position in such a matter (even when he is not acting as a mere agent), is such that he can but seldom be supposed to have the money, paid him by mistake, remain with him. The equity to recover it back soon ceases, as a general rule. The attempts to harmonize the requirements, in this regard, of reason and justice, with settled rules of law as set forth in decided cases, may not have been uniformly successful.\nI will not venture upon the unnecessary task, where so many have failed, of formulating as was done in Cocks v. Masterman[57] a hard and fast rule applicable to all cases of the kind.\nI have no doubt, however, that there are many cases, including those in question here, where the delay in discovery and consequent demand for rectification, coupled with change of position by reason of such delay, and the recipient banker having paid over in good faith, and in due course of business the moneys received in payment of forged bills, would render it manifestly unjust that the bankers who were in duty bound to pay such bills, if genuine, and made the mistake of assuming them so, should recover as claimed here.\nThe case of The Imperial Bank v. Bank of Hamilton[58] has clearly rendered the hard and fast rule laid down in Cocks v. Masterman[59] no longer a safe guide, in the wide form there given, and possibly shaken some other cases.\nThe result, however, leaves untouched the reasoning and principles of law upon which such equities as arise here rest, and I think furnish an answer to the appellants\u2019 claims in question.\nIt enables us to affirm that, in law, there is a wide distinction between the cases, where of necessity the money paid by mistake must pass from the hand receiving it, and the cases where it has not and by reason of the nature of the dealing is not intended to do so. The Imperial Bank had in fact paid away its money to the forger before it presented the forged cheque to the Bank of Hamilton.\nThe case did not give rise to any such equities as exist here.\nThe judgment, as I read it, implies that notice of the mistake must be given within a reasonable time, and before loss has been occasioned by the delay in giving it.\nI need not repeat the fact in question here bearing upon these points, for they are so fully and clearly set forth by Mr. Justice Anglin in his judgment as to render further attempted elucidation of them useless.\nI think the appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred with Girouard J.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree for the reasons stated by Chief Justice Moss in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gormully, Orde & Powell.\nSolicitors for the respondent, His Majesty, the King: Barwick, Aylesworth, Wright & Moss.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Quebec Bank: Nellis, Matheson & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Sovereign Bank of Canada: Belcourt & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Royal Bank of Canada: MacCraken, Henderson & McDougal.\n[1] 11 Ont.

(1906), c. 146, ss. 1013,1015, 1016,1024\u2014Admission of evidence\u2014Res gestae.\nEvidence of statements made by a person, since deceased, immediately after an assault upon him, under apprehension of further danger and requesting assistance and protection, is admissible as part of the res gestce, even though the person accused of the offence was absent at the time when such statements were made. Reg. v. Beddingfield (14 Cox 341); Rex v. Foster (6 C. & P. 325) and Aveson v. Kinnaird (6 East 188) followed.\nStatements not coincident, in point of time, with the occurrence of the assault, but uttered in the presence and hearing of the accused and under such circumstances that he might reasonably have been expected to have made some explanatory reply to remarks in reference to them, are admissible as evidence.\nOn the trial of an indictment for murder the evidence was that the deceased had been killed by a gun shot wound inflicted through the discharge of a gun in the hands of the accused and the defence was that the gun had been discharged accidentally.\nHeld, that, in view of the character of the defence and the evidence in support of it, there could be no objection to a charge by the trial judge to the jury that the offence could not be reduced by them from murder to manslaughter but that their verdict should be either for acquittal or one of guilty of murder.\nTwo questions were reserved by the trial judge for the opinion of the court of appeal but he refused to reserve a third question, as to the correctness of his charge on the ground that no objection to the charge had been take at the trial. The court of appeal took all three questions into consideration and dismissed the appeal, there being no dissent from the affirmance of the conviction on the first and third questions, but one of the judges being of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered upon the second question reserved. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\u2014\nThe majority of the court, being of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, declined to express any opinion as to whether or not an appeal would lie upon questions as to which there had been no dissent in the court appealed from, but it was held,\u2014\nPer Girouard J.\u2014That the Supreme Court of Canada was precluded from expressing an opinion on points of law as to which there had been no dissent in the court appealed from, McIntosh v. The Queen (23 Can. S.C.R. 180) followed. Viau v. The Queen (29 Can. S.C.R. 90) ; The Union Colliery Company v. The Queen (31 Can. S.C.R. 81) and Rice v. The King (32 Can. S.C.R. 480) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, affirming the conviction of the appellant at the trial on an indictment for murder, upon a reserved case stated by the judge who presided at the trial.\nThe case reserved was stated by the trial judge, Mr. Justice Newlands, as follows:\u2014\n\"STATED CASE.\"\n\"The above named Josiah Gilbert was charged before me with the murder of one Barrett Henderson on or about the 15th day of August, A.D. 1906, near Regina in this judicial district. The accused pleaded not guilty and was tried before me with a jury at Regina on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days of November, 1906, and was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging at Regina on the 18th day of January, 1907.\n\"At the trial the annexed evidence was admitted after being objected to by counsel for the accused. \"After the verdict the counsel for the accused applied to have the following questions reserved and I have, decided to reserve the same under section 937 of the Criminal Code for the opinion of the court.\n\"1. Were: the statement; of the deceased made while running towards Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them admissible?\n\"2. Were the statements made by the deceased to McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm admissible?\n\"Said counsel for the accused also applied to have the following question reserved:\u2014\n\"3. Was the learned trial judge right in stating to the jury in his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in reducing the verdict from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted only a verdict of murder or not guilty?\n\"In my charge to the jury I said, 'As far as man-slaughter is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As far as this case is concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before you of provocation. As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has been given in evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from murder to manslaughter. The verdict as far as I can see can either be one of not guilty, or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as far as I can see, that are open before you.'\n\"No objection was taken to this charge at the trial so I declined to reserve this question.\"\n\"Regina, December 14th, 1906.\"\n\"H. W. Newlands, J.S.C.\" After hearing the arguments of counsel, the court, in banc, affirmed the conviction, the opinion of the court being unanimous as to the first and third questions. Mr. Justice Wetmore dissented from the opinion of the majority of the court as to the points of law involved in the second question.\nHis Lordship Chief Justice Sifton and their Lord-ships Justices Newlands and Stuart concurred in the following opinion delivered by His Lordship Mr. Jus\u00adtice Harvey.\nHarvey J.\u2014\"The accused was charged with murder and tried by my brother Newlands with a jury and convicted, and the matter now comes before this court by way of a reserved case as to the admissibility of certain evidence which was given on the trial.\n\"Two men were passing near the scene of the alleged murder about the time it was supposed to have been committed and their attention was drawn to the accused whom they saw running with something in his hand, which they took to be a gun and which the subsequent evidence shews was a gun. At almost the same moment they heard a shout and saw the deceased apparently fleeing from the accused and waving his hands and calling to them to stop. The gun was dropped, but the pursuit continued until the deceased reached the witnesses, and on his way to them and when reaching them, he shouted more than once, 'Hold on, hold on; he shot me and he will shoot me again. Hold on, boys, hold on.' The first question which is reserved is whether the evidence of these statements was properly admitted, and I am of the opinion that this question should be answered in the 20 1\/2 affirmative. Apart altogether from whether the words were uttered in the presence of the accused, it appears to my mind clear that the circumstances, including the utterance of the words used, were so closely connected with the shooting as to be properly admissible for, although the witnesses in question did not hear the sound of a shot, another witness did hear such sound and almost immediately after saw the two men running as they were when they first attracted the attention of the two witnesses first mentioned.\n\"The strongest case which could be referred to against the admissibility of this evidence was Reg. v. Bedingfield ([1]), in which Chief Justice Cockburn refused to receive the evidence of a statement made by the deceased to a person whom she met after coming out of the house where the accused was and where the murder was alleged to have been committed. It is easy to see a difference in principle between the two cases. In the present case there was a continuity of circumstances of which the shooting was part and in which the accused was a participant, which did not exist in the Bedingfield Case ([2]). So that for the purpose of this case it is not necessary to dissent from Chief Justice Cockburn's view though some of the text writers, Taylor, par. 583; Phipson, p. 49, express the view that he interpreted the rule too strictly.\n\"In Rex v. Foster ([3]) the court, consisting of three judges, held as admissible a statement made by the deceased in answer to a question by a witness who did not see the act which was the cause of the death but came up after. This case appears to have been accepted as authoritative, and the principle is given by Taylor, par. 583, as follows: \"The principal points for consideration are, whether the circumstances and declarations offered in proof were so connected with the main fact under consideration as to illustrate its character, to further its object or to form in conjunction with it one continuous transaction.\"\n\"It appears to me beyond question that the present case falls within this principle and the authority of Rex v. Foster ([4]).\n\"The second question reserved is as to the admissibility of evidence of an expression of the deceased at a later time and in no way connected with the res gestce. An exchange of conveyances was being made by the deceased and the accused, and the witness states that while the deceased was being helped by him across, he turned around and saw the accused who was about five or six feet behind, whereupon 'he made a big jump into the buggy and said, 'Don't let him knife me.\"\n\"This utterance appears to me to be nothing more than an unequivocal exclamation indicating fear of injury from the accused on the part of the deceased. The principle on which an exception to the rule that hearsay evidence is inadmissible is made in the case of statements made in the hearing of an accused, or in a civil case in the hearing of an opposite party, is that he has an opportunity of denying it, and if he fails to do so, it is some evidence as against him of the truth of the statement. When one considers that the utterance in question is not a statement of fact at all and is not susceptible of denial by the accused, it is at once evident that the principle has no application and at the same time the principle of exclusion as hearsay has no application. The question appears to me to be one then simply of whether the state of mind of the accused in this respect is material, and if it is, there is no rule as far as I am aware that requires the exclusion of this remark. It seems to me that the evidence of the witness when he said that when de-ceased saw accused near him 'he made a big jump into the buggy' stands in exactly the same position as the evidence of what deceased said, for each indicates the same thing, viz., fear of accused, and nothing more except that the spoken words are less equivocal than the act.\n\"The charge is one of deliberately shooting the deceased while the defence is that the shooting was purely accidental. If it were shewn that after the shooting the state of mind of the man shot were one of friendliness to the accused, it surely would be deemed to have an important bearing on the question in issue, and in the same way evidence indicating aversion and fear have as important a bearing in the opposite direction. Wigmore, in his work on Evidence, points out very fully the difference between the admission of utterances as proof of the truth of the facts stated and their admission to prove a state of mind which he terms their circumstantial use as opposed to the other or testimonial use, and states, in par. 1790, that to the use circumstantially the hearsay rule makes no opposition 'because the utterance is not used for the sake of inducing belief in any assertion it may contain.'\n\"For the reason stated I am of opinion that this evidence was properly admitted.\n\"A third question, though not reserved, was argued by counsel, viz., that the learned judge erred in charging the jury that there was no evidence to justify them in finding a verdict of manslaughter. \"No one gave evidence of the actual shooting except the accused himself, and his evidence and evidence of admissions made by him before the trial was the only evidence of the actual occurrence. These all concurred in maintaining that the shooting was purely accidental. If the jury had believed this evidence, the only verdict they could have found would have been one of acquittal; but if they did not believe it, the only conclusion from the evidence was that the shooting having been established the intention to effect the natural consequence of the act existed and that the act was one of murder. It is quite easy to see that a hypothesis could be advanced that the actual facts made the case one of manslaughter, but that the accused, being the only eye witness of the shooting, determined to concoct a story which would enable him to escape the consequence of even that act; but this would be simply a hypothesis, and the jury were bound to bring in a verdict on the evidence and not on hypothesis. I am of opinion that the judge's charge was right in this respect.\n\"In the result therefore the learned trial judge's rulings on the two questions reserved and on the other question which was argued should be confirmed and the conviction should be affirmed.\"\nThe opinion of Mr. Justice Wetmore was delivered, as follows:\u2014\nWetmore J.\u2014\"I agree with my brother Harvey that the evidence of the statements made by the deceased Henderson to the witnesses Koch and Dick while coming towards them and after he arrived there was properly admitted as being part of the res gestce. I also agree that there was no misdirection in the case. But I am of opinion that the statement made by the deceased and testified to by McKinnon, namely, 'Don't let him knife me,' was improperly received in evidence. This statement was offered in evidence as a statement made in the presence and hearing of the accused and only upon that ground. It was not pretended that it was admissible on any other ground. Evidence of this character is admissible because the jury or judge of fact is able to draw an inference from the conduct, the language, or the silence of the other party in whose presence and hearing the statement is made. Evidently, if the statement was not heard by such party, no inference could be drawn from his conduct, language or silence. In this case I may say that any reference that might be drawn was to be drawn from the silence of the accused. In order to render such testimony admissible I think that the judge ought to be thoroughly satisfied that the party accused heard the statement. I will concede that, ordinarily, if it is established that the statement was made in the presence of the accused and that he was at such a distance at the time that the statement would likely be heard by him, this would be sufficient to admit the evidence of the statement. But if the circumstances are of such a character that render it possible that the statement might not have been heard by him or render it doubtful whether it was heard by him, evidence of the statement ought not to be received. In this case the witnesses Koch and Dick were not very far distant from where the deceased and the accused were at the time the statement was made, and I think they would have been likely to hear it. Now, if they did not hear it, I think it is open to doubt whether the accused heard it. I am not prepared, however, to state that I would hold that the evidence of this statement was improperly received if there was nothing further in the case than what I have stated. But it was developed at a subsequent stage of the proceedings that the accused was hard of hearing, and he distinctly swore that he did not hear the statement made by the deceased and testified to by McKinnon. This state of facts having come out, in my opinion rendered the testimony of McKinnon as to the statement inadmissible, or in other words improperly received. It is urged that inasmuch as the testimony when received was admissible, it is not rendered inadmissible by testimony subsequently given. I dissent from that proposition. If testimony of this character is received under a mistaken apprehension of facts it must be considered none the less inadmissible if future developments of facts shew that it ought not to have been admitted. In a case of that sort I am of opinion that either the jury should be discharged from giving a verdict or the objectionable testimony expressly withdrawn from their consideration by the trial judge. I am inclined to think that the latter course would have been quite sufficient for the purpose. It was further urged that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the admission of this testimony. I cannot accede to this proposition either. It is very difficult to state what will or will not influence the mind of a juryman. The remark 'Don't let him knife me' had no direct reference to the shooting; it must be remembered that when the remark was made the accused had no gun with him and a remark such as 'Don't let him shoot me' would not be pertinent as he had no means of shooting. The words, Don't let him knife me' might be pertinent however, and it was a remark from which a juryman might infer 'Don't let this man who shot me, as I told you, knife me.' Nor can I bring my mind to the conclusion that this was a mere exclamation of fear alone. Doubtless it was an exclamation of fear, but it was an exclamation which not only expressed fear but expressed fear of the accused. I am of opinion, for the reasons above stated, that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.\"\nChrysler K.C. and James Balfour for the appellant. The statutory provisions affecting the case are to be found in the \"Criminal Code, 1892,\" sections 742, 743, 744 and 750, and in the new Code as consolidated in the Revised Statutes of 1906, sections 1013, 1015. 1016 and 1024.\nThe court of appeal, the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, in banc, was not unanimous in affirming the conviction, Mr. Justice Wetmore being in favour of allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial; therefore, we comply with the condition of section 742 of the old Code. We come to this court upon a judgment as entered there and we appeal against the affirmance of the conviction by a judgment which was not unanimous; it is of no consequence what might have been the individual reasons of any of the judges for their opinions which led to that judgment.\nWe refer to the Queen v. Cunningham ([5]), which is referred to in McIntosh v. The Queen ([6]), by Taschereau J., at page 185. The question has been since discussed in the case of Viau v. The Queen ([7]), in the judgment of the court by Taschereau J. In the present case the third question, although not reserved, was argued and decided in the court below which treated the point of procedure as having been waived. See also Rice v. The King ([8]), per Strong C. J.\nWe rely upon Reg. v. Bedingfield ([9]), on which Lord Cockburn subsequently wrote a pamphlet which will be found in the Law Journal for 1880, at page 5. See also Best on Evidence ([10]). Archbold in his work on Criminal Evidence, concludes that Reg. v. Bedingfield ([11]), was affirmed by the decision in Goddard's Case ([12]). See also remarks on Rex v. Foster ([13]), in Roscoe on Criminal Evidence([14]), and cases discussed at pages 48 and 49; Reg. v. McMahon([15]); Eastman v. Boston & Maine Railroad Company ([16]); Vicksburg and Meridian Railroad Company v. O'Brien([17]), and Greenleaf on Evidence([18]), at pages 192 and 262.\nLatchford K.C. for the respondent.\nChief Justice:\u2014The appellant in this case was tried at Regina, Province of Alberta, in the month of November, 1906, and found guilty of the murder of one Barrett Henderson; thereupon he was sentenced to death.\nThe learned judge before whom the case was tried, at the request of counsel for the prisoner to reserve some questions as to the admissibility of evidence, stated a special case for the opinion of the court of appeal. The questions reserved for the opinion of the court were:\nWere the statements of the deceased made while running towards Dick and Koch and thereafter on joining them admissible?\nWere the statements made by the deceased to McKinnon on arriving at the house on deceased's farm admissible?\nThe counsel for the accused also applied to have the following question reserved:\nWas the learned trial judge right in stating to the jury in his charge that there was no evidence to justify them in reducing the verdict from murder to manslaughter and that the case warranted only a verdict of murder or not guilty?\nThe judge in the case, as reserved, says:\nIn my charge to the jury I said: \"As far as manslaughter is concerned the Code states that culpable homicide, which would other-wise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. As far as this case is concerned there has been absolutely no evidence put before you of provocation. As far as I can see in the case there is nothing that has been given in evidence that would justify a reduction of this charge from murder to manslaughter. The verdict, as far as I can see, can either be one of not guilty or that of guilty of murder. Those are the only two verdicts, as far as I can see, that are open before you.\nNo objection was taken to this charge at the trial so I declined to reserve this question.\nThe court of appeal, Wetmore J. dissenting, held that the statements made by the deceased to McKinnon on arriving at the house on the deceased's farm were admissible. The court was unanimously of opinion that the statements made by deceased while running towards Dick and Koch and after joining them were properly admitted and also that there had been no misdirection.\nA question was raised here as to whether an appeal lies to this court on the question reserved as to which there was no dissent in the court of appeal, but as we all agree that the appeal should be dismissed we do not think it necessary to express any opinion on that point of practice nor as to whether or not the question of misdirection was ever properly before the court below. Section 1016, Criminal Code; McIntosh v. The Queen ([19]).\nThe first statement of the deceased was made immediately after the assault. The only evidence as to the actual shooting was given by the accused, but a witness, Vine Brooks, heard the sound of a shot and immediately afterwards saw two men whom she describes as running away from the barn one apparently pursuing the other. Koch and Dick to whom the statement admitted in evidence was made were passing on the highway not far from the barn in which the fatal shot was fired. When first seen by the witnesses the accused was running through the field with something in his hand, which subsequent evidence shews was a gun, and, almost immediately, their attention was drawn to the deceased who was running from the accused towards them shouting, as they afterwards ascertained, for protection. The pursuit continued, although the gun was dropped by the accused, until the deceased reached the witnesses when he shouted to them several times as he approached\u2014\nHold on, hold on, he shot me and he will do it again; hold on boys, hold on.\nWhen Koch and Dick were examined their evidence as to what occurred under these circumstances when the deceased approached them and immediately there- after when with them in the vehicle was objected to. The trial judge held it to be admissible and his ruling was sustained by the unanimous judgment of the court of appeal, and, as was intimated at the close of the argument here, we entertain no doubt that the evidence was properly admitted.\nAt the trial, in the court of appeal and at the argument here, counsel for the accused relied in support of their objection on the case of Reg. v. Bedingfield ([20]), wherein the admissibility of this kind of evidence was discussed and Cockburn, C.J. excluded all testimony of declarations after the act was done. This ruling was much criticized at the time and led to a vigorous discussion of the whole subject by Judge Pitt Taylor, in England, and Professor Thayer, in the United States, in the course of which the chief justice issued a pamphlet in defence of his ruling wherein he defines the term res gestce:\nWhatever act, or series of acts, constitute, or in point of time immediately accompany and terminate in, the principal act charged as an offence against the accused, from its inception to its consummation or final completion, or its prevention or abandonment,\u2014 whether on the part of the agent or wrong-doer in order to its performance, or on that of the patient or party wronged, in order to its prevention,\u2014and whatever may be said by either of the parties, during the continuance of the transaction, with reference to it, including herein what may be said by the suffering party, though in the absence of the accused, during the continuance of the action of the latter, actual or constructive,-as e.g., in the case of flight or applications for assistance\u2014 form part of the principal transaction, and may be given in evidence as part of the res gestce, or particulars of it.\nThere can be no doubt that under this definition the statement of the deceased to Koch and Dick would be admissible as having been used under the apprehension of further danger and when asking for assistance and protection even if the accused was absent.\nIt will be observed further that in the Bedingfield Case ([21]) when the woman Eliza Rudd came out of the house with her throat cut all action on Bedingfield's part had ceased and she was not fleeing as in the present case from her assailant.\nIn Rex v. Foster ([22]), the court, consisting of three judges, held as admissible a statement made by deceased in answer to a question by a witness who did not see the act which was the cause of the death but came up after.\nThe case of Aveson v. Lord Kinnaird ([23]) bears strongly upon the point, Park J. and Patterson J. concurring. In that case Lord Ellenborough said\nif at the time she fled from the immediate personal violence of the husband I should admit what was said.\nThe admissibility of the second statement to McKinnon is not so clear. It was made under these circumstances: After the deceased running up to Koch and Dick in the road where they were joined by Gilbert had given his first explanation of the shooting and asked for their protection; the parties then present separated, Koch and Gilbert going to the latter's barn to get his team while Dick and the deceased went over to the shack in which Henderson lived with his hired man McKinnon who, on their arrival, very naturally asked for an explanation of the occurrence which has not been given in evidence. Subsequently, however, Gilbert appeared on the scene with Koch; then ensues a conversation with McKinnon during the course of which Gilbert attempted to explain that the shooting was due to an accident. The deceased who was being placed in a buggy, to be conveyed to the hospital at Regina for medical treatment, perceiving the accused who stood about six feet away from him made a jump exclaiming, \"Don't let him knife me.\"\nIt has been argued that this statement of the deceased is not admissible as part of the res gestce not being coincident in point of time with the main facts to be proved. However that may be we are all of opinion that the words spoken on this occasion are admissible on the ground that they were uttered in the presence and hearing of the accused, and under such circumstances, in the light of what he had previously stated to McKinnon, that he might have been reasonably expected to make some answer or remark in reply thereto or explaining that his proximity to deceased did not involve any such danger as he seemed to feel.\nThe presumption, even taking the previous statement of counsel as to the condition of accused's hearing as a fact, would be that he might reasonably be presumed to have heard. And the learned and careful trial judge has in the exercise of a discretion vested in him decided the preliminary fact and allowed the evidence on the ground that the necessary conditions had been fulfilled.\nThe later statement of accused when giving evidence denying having heard the statement, could not have any effect on the previous ruling or become a test of its correctness.\nThe charge in view of the character of the defence and evidence in support of it cannot be complained of in so far as we can express an opinion in the ab- sence of the text of the charge which is not before us.\nThere was no case of culpable homicide of less degree than murder presented on the evidence. And the accident testified to by the accused would have, if credited, entitled him to acquittal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nGirouard J.\u2014Following the decisions of this court in McIntosh v. The Queen ([24]); Viau v. The Queen ([25]) ; The Union Colliery Co. v. The Queen ([26]); Rice v. The King ([27]), I feel that I have no jurisdiction to express any opinion upon the points of law involved in questions one and three. It was decided in those cases that no appeal lies to this court on questions as to which there was no dissent in the court of appeal. For that reason I agree that the appeal must be dismissed as to those two points.\nAs to the second question, I concur in the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice. I wish to add merely a word. The trial judge was undoubtedly the sole judge as to the admissibility of the statement or exclamation to McKinnon. He could not suppose that the prisoner, when standing within four or five feet, did not hear it. When, subsequently, the prisoner, being examined, disclosed the fact that he did not hear the deceased, the counsel for the prisoner does not appear to have requested the trial judge to leave the veracity of this statement to the jury. Perhaps he did, and it may be that the judge left the question to the jury. We have no means of knowing. At all events, the point is not reserved, and is not even mentioned by the learned judge. I, therefore, believe that, as to this second question also, the appeal should be dismissed.\nDavies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Balfour.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Latchford & Daly.\n[1] 14 Cox 341.\n[2] 14 Cox 341.\n[3] 6 C. & P. 325.\n[4] 6 C. & P. 325.\n[5] Count.

Have the Canadian Courts of Admiralty the same jurisdiction as those in England to try an action in rem by one foreign ship against another for damages caused by a collision in foreign waters?\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court, Toronto Admiralty District (10 Ex. C.R. 1) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a judgment of the local judge for the Toronto Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe action arose out of a collision between the ship \"D. C. Whitney\" and the ship \"Monguagon,\" owned by the St. Clair Navigation Company, and upon which there was a cargo of coal owned by the Southern Coal and Transportation Company, on the night of the 28th of November, 1901, at the Baltimore & Ohio coal dock at Sandusky in the State of Ohio, one of the United States of America.\nThe following facts are admitted:\n(\u0430) The ship \"Monguagon\" was lying securely fastened at the Baltimore & Ohio dock with about three-quarters of a cargo of coal which she had taken on board awaiting to be supplied with the balance of the cargo on the following morning.\n(b) The \"B. C. Whitney\" was coming into the Port of Sandusky light claiming to be making for the same dock.\n(c) The steamer \"D. C. Whitney\" came into collision with the \"Monguagon,\" her bow striking the stern of the \"Monguagon\" with sufficient force to part her line and drive her some three hundred feet forward where her bow went ashore and she shortly afterwards sank.\n(d) The owners of the \"Monguagon,\" the St Clair Navigation Company, are an incorporated company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Michigan. The ship \"Monguagon\" is an American bottom; the other plaintiff, the Southern Coal and Transportation Company, is an incorporated company, incorporated under the laws of West Virginia, and the Inland Star Transit Company is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio and the ship \"D. C. Whitney\" is an American bottom.\nThe plaintiffs in their claim allege that the collision occurred through the negligent navigation of the \"D. C. Whitney;\" the \"Monguagon\" was lying alongside the dock and having all necessary lights required in that condition displayed.\nThe \"D. C. Whitney\" for a defence claim that the trial court had no jurisdiction to try the case for the reasons before set forth that the ship and parties to the action were all Americans and the collision occurred in American waters; that the damages were due to inevitable accident; that the \"Monguagon\" did not exhibit proper and sufficient lights and did not have a proper and sufficient watch on deck making an effort to avoid the collision or to lessen the consequences thereof; and that the \"Monguagon\" had no business at the said dock and should not have been there.\nThe ship \"D. C. Whitney\" was found in Canadian waters and she was seized on a process issued out of the Toronto Admiralty District of this court, by a marshall of this court or by a deputy marshall of this court at or near Amherstburg, Ontario, and in Canadian waters.\nThe defendants, the owners of the \"D. C. Whitney,\" consequently provided a bond in which the bondsmen submitted to the jurisdiction of this court and agreed to abide by any judgment that might be recovered against the ship \"D. C. Whitney.\"\nThe local judge held that the court had jurisdiction and the action was tried, resulting in a judgment for plaintiffs, the damages being assessed by a referee. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. D. McPherson for the appellants. The learned counsel contended first that the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court in Admiralty was derived wholly from \"The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" and \"The Canada Admiralty Act, 1891,\" and was thereby limited to cases of Canadian ships in Canadian waters. Secondly, even if the court had jurisdiction it should not be exercised in a case like this where the parties could resort to their own courts, citing The \"Ida\"[2]; The \"Belgenland\"[3].\nHanna for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action in the Toronto Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada, commenced on the 30th day of October, 1902, by a writ of summons in rem against the ship \"D. C. Whitney.\"\nThe summons was subsequently amended as to the names of the plaintiffs and a copy of the amended summons served upon the captain of the ship on the 24th day of November, 1902, some two days after she had been arrested under a warrant of arrest.\nThe affidavits which led the warrants were sworn to in Detroit, United States, on the 10th, 12th and 13th days of November, by the respective secretaries of the two plaintiff companies, the owners, respectively, of the ship and cargo of the ship \"Monguagon.\"\nThese affidavits simply state that the plaintiffs, respectively, had claims as owners of the ship and cargo against the ship \"D. C. Whitney\" for damages for collision in a certain amount and that the collision occurred on the 27th November, 1901, in the port of Sandusky in the State of Ohio. No statement is made that the ship \"D. C. Whitney\" was, at the time of the making of the affidavit, in Canadian waters or within the Canadian jurisdiction, or that its owners or any of them resided or were domiciled in Canada nor could, of course, any such statement have been made, under the facts,\nThe warrant itself must either have been issued on the 13th or 14th of November, as the ship was arrested under it on the latter date. The warrant is not returned with the papers, it appearing by the affidavit of the officer who arrested the ship that he served the original as well as the copy upon the captain.\nAs appears by the record and as admitted on the argument, both ships were American bottoms and registered and owned in the United States, and the Inland Star Transit Company, the owner of the ship \"D. C. Whitney,\" as also the plaintiff companies, were all American corporations carrying on their business in the United States.\nAt the time of her arrest, the \"D. C. Whitney\" was on a voyage from one port of the United States to another port of that country, and had actually entered the River Detroit on her voyage and was arrested in that river nearly opposite the Town of Amherstburg.\nThe channel of the river where she was sailing when arrested was on the Canadian side of the international line and ran between the Canadian shore and an island on the river belonging to Canada and was, in fact, Canadian waters.\nThe ship had not entered and it was not pretended that she was entering any Canadian port or haven or doing anything else than exercising her right of innocent passage up the river.\nThe waters where she was arrested are by the seventh section of the Ashburton Treaty of 1842 made between Great Britain and the United States declared to be equally free and open to the ships and vessels of both countries. The article reads as follows:\nArticle VII. It is further agreed that the channels in the River St. Lawrence on both sides of the Long Sault Islands and of Barn-hart Island, the channel in the River Detroit on both sides of the island Bois Blanc, and between that island and both the American and Canadian shores, and all the several channels and passages between the various islands lying near the junction of the River St. Clair with the lake of that name, shall be equally free and open to the ships, vessels and boats of both parties.\nThe ships which collided, therefore, being both American ships, the owners companies incorporated in the United States, not doing business in Canada and the collision having occurred in the harbour of Sandusky, State of Ohio, the only pretence for the exercise of jurisdiction on the part of the Toronto Vice Admiralty Court was the presence of the \"D. C. Whitney\" in one of the channels of the Detroit River, on the Canadian side of the international boundary line, while in the exercise of her right of innocent passage along that channel on her voyage to and from American ports. The defendant appeared under protest and subsequently pleaded that the court had no jurisdiction under the circumstances, and again, at the opening of the trial, formally took the objection, the evidence being received subject to it.\nThe local judge in admiralty held, after argument, that he had jurisdiction to hear the case, relying upon certain English decisions quoted in his judgment, which do not, however, in any way touch the ground on which I think our judgment must rest. Without, however, dealing with the general jurisdiction of the admiralty or expressing any opinion as to whether or not \"The Canadian Admiralty Act of 1891\" imposes any limitation upon the extent of the jurisdiction of the court thereby created, as argued by Mr. Macpherson, or whether the powers and jurisdiction of this colonial court are not rather those conferred by the Imperial Act, \"The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" as maintained by the judgment appealed from, I am of the opinion that, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction never attached.\nThis is not a personal action but one entirely in rem, and while it is enough to confer jurisdiction in an action in rem that the property should be in the lawful control of the state under the authority of which the court sits, and that the sovereign authority has conferred jurisdiction as stated by Lord Chelmsford in the case of Castrique v. Imrie[4], at page 446, I do not think that the \"D. C. Whitney,\" a foreign ship, while sailing from one port of a foreign country to another port of that country and passing through, in the course of her voyage, one of the channels declared by convention or treaty to be equally free and open to the ships, vessels and boats of both countries, can be said to be within any jurisdiction conferred on any Canadian court by the sovereign authority in the control of the Dominion of Canada, even though that channel happened to be Canadian waters.\nIf the res had entered into any of the ports, harbours or havens of Canada for safety, shelter or commercial purposes of any kind, she might then fairly be said to have submitted to any Admiralty jurisdiction the courts of Canada had a right to exercise towards her. In such case, the point argued by Mr. Macpherson as to the limited character of the admiralty jurisdiction conferred upon the Exchequer Court of Canada might have arisen.\nIn the facts and circumstances of this case I do not think it does arise. At the time the suit originated and the summons in rem issued, and also when the affidavits which led the warrant issued and at the time of the issue of the warrant also, I cannot see how there could be a pretence of jurisdiction. Neither owners nor ship were, at any of these times, within the limits of Canada or the waters thereof. The wrongdoing for which she was arrested took place (if at all) in a foreign port a year previously, and the ship's arrest while exercising her right of innocent passage in Canadian waters in accordance with the treaty rights of her nation from one foreign port to another cannot, of itself, justify the attempted exercise of jurisdiction.\nThe summons, the affidavits and the warrant were all issued and made before even the ship came into Canadian Avaters.\nTo uphold this exercise of jurisdiction, therefore, we should be obliged to hold that the moment after a collision takes place in any part of the world, whether within or without the British Empire, each and every vice admiralty court throughout the Empire is immediately seized of jurisdiction over the case and a suit may be instituted in any of them at the instance of one of the colliding ships against the other even if both are foreign bottoms and owned by foreigners and the collision took place in a foreign port or river and that, in such suit, warrants to arrest may be issued ready to be executed in case the offending ship afterwards came within the territorial waters of the colony, Dominion or place whose court so assumed jurisdiction and that such warrants may be executed afterwards if and when such ship comes within those waters.\nNay, we would have to go further and hold that the arrest of the ship would be legal even if she was exercising her right of innocent passage through the territorial waters.\nI do not think that that is the law. Jurisdiction only attaches over the res when it comes or is brought within the control or submits to the jurisdiction of the court and not till then. Such jurisdiction does not exist against a ship passing along the coast in the exercise of innocent passage or through channels or arms of the sea which, by international law or special convention, are declared free and open to the ships of her nationality, unless expressly given by statute. I do nor think it is possible successfully to argue that the right to initiate an action, make affidavits and issue a warrant, can exist before the foreign ship even comes within our territorial jurisdiction.\nThe jealousy with which Parliament legislates on such a question is to be seen in the legislation of the Imperial Parliament, section 688 of the \"Merchant Shipping Act, 1894,\" authorizing a foreign ship which has injured a British ship or property in any part of the world, to be detained if found within three miles of the coasts of the United Kingdom, so as to compel her owners to abide the result of any action in the courts of that kingdom. See observations of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in The Queen v. Keyn[5], at pages 218 and 219. But where is the law authorizing the arrest or detention of a foreign ship while passing within three miles of the coast for injuries alleged to have been done by such ship to another foreign ship outside of the British territorial waters? Supposing one of the great foreign transatlantic steamers collided with an American ship while going out of the harbour of New York on her way to Antwerp or some other foreign port. Could it be contended seriously that the several vice admiralty courts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland immediately became seized of jurisdiction over the collision and that the owners of the injured ship could at once issue warrants of arrest in these courts and seize the liner if, perchance, she came afterwards within three miles of the coast of either that province or that colony? And yet the argument as to jurisdiction in this case, if sound, must go that far. It does not seem to me, with great respect, open to serious argument.\nIt is not necessary to discuss the question raised as to the jurisdiction of the court over the owners of the res until and unless they were served within the jurisdiction because no service was made or attempted to be made on such owners nor indeed was any application made to serve them abroad.\nThe plaintiff relied upon his arrest of the ship as sufficient to give jurisdiction so far as the res was concerned.\nOn the question of personal service out of the jurisdiction, the cases seem conclusive that neither under the old law nor under the rules under the \"Judicature Act\" would the court have possessed jurisdiction in personam over the owners of the res, unless they could have been served within the territorial jurisdiction and this even in the case where a foreign ship collided with and injured a British ship on the high seas. In re Smith[6], and The \"Vivar\"[7].\nI am of opinion that the affidavits were made and the warrants issued in the case before jurisdiction attached; that the arrest was, under the circumstances, illegal; and that the defendant, appearing under protest and objecting to the jurisdiction, was within and protected his rights; that the Toronto Admiralty District Court had no jurisdiction over the case and that the case, on that ground, should have been dismissed.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in both courts.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant has been properly found, as I think, by the learned judge, upon the facts, liable for having run against and sunk a vessel of respondents moored in the harbour of Sandusky, in the State of Ohio.\nThe proceedings were had in the Toronto Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada. They were begun by a writ of summons issued on the 30th of October, 1902, and the appellants' ship was arrested on the 14th of November, 1902, by the sheriff of Essex, in the Province of Ontario and within the Toronto Admiralty District.\nThe arrest was made in one of the channels of the Detroit River. The channel in question is wholly within Canada, being bordered both on the east and west sides by Canadian soil.\nThe appearance was entered herein by the appellants' solicitor on the 29th November, 1902. He served the plaintiffs' solicitors with notice thereof, of which, omitting the style of cause, the following is a copy:\nTAKE NOTICE that I appear under protest for the ship \"D. C. Whitney,\" of Cleveland, Ohio, in this action.\nDated at Toronto, this 29th day of November, A.D. 1902.\nW. D. McPherson,\nSolicitor for defendant.\nThe preliminary act of the respondents is dated at Windsor, 8th December, 1903. That of the appellant is not dated and appears as a notice addressed to the respondents and their solicitor. It contains no allusion to the protest as to jurisdiction.\nThe statement of claim was delivered 22nd February, 1904. The statement of defence was delivered 7th March, 1904. This latter begins by alleging in the first five paragraphs in continuation of the protest lodged in these proceedings where an appearance was entered that each of the plaintiff companies were incorporated under the laws of a state of the United States, with head offices there, and neither was authorized according to the was of Ontario to do business there or in the Dominion and, in fact, did not do so; that the plaintiffs' ship is of American register; the appellant ship also of that register, and the company owning her incorporated under the was of Ohio with head office there and transacting no business in the Dominion of Canada; that from the time of the occurrence in question the appellant had at all times been engaged, to the knowledge of the plaintiffs, in her usual occupation of sailing in American waters, in the Great Lakes, between American ports, and that if plaintiffs or either had preferred a claim, it could and would have been adjudicated upon without delay in a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States of America.\nThen, the sixth paragraph submits that, under the circumstances, the honourable court had no jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the action; or if the court should be of the opinion that it had jurisdiction, then, in the discretion of the court, it should refuse to exercise it or compel appellants to submit thereto.\nThe seventh paragraph says\nif the honourable court upholds the jurisdiction to try and adjudicate this action, then, for a defence, but under protest as aforesaid, the company owning the appellant say, etc., etc.\nThe defence on the merits is then in the remaining part of such seventh paragraph and eleven following paragraphs fully set forth.\nThe trial took place at Windsor on 29th, 30th and 31st of March, 1905.\nAt the opening of the trial appellants' counsel objected to going on with the trial and submitted that the court had no jurisdiction to investigate the matter as the collision took place in American waters and the two ships in question were American ships.\nThe court ruled that the evidence be taken subject to the question of jurisdiction. The trial proceeded and appellants' counsel took part contesting ably every foot of ground.\nMr. Justice Hodgins, the local judge in admiralty, having thus tried the case, of which he was in this way seized, gave judgment on the 21st of June, 1905, holding he had jurisdiction, condemning the appellant to pay damages and referring the assessment thereof to the local deputy registrar of the court at Windsor, who was also directed to tax the costs. Formal judgment was entered of record on the 22nd of June, 1905, in accordance with these findings.\nOn the 5th of December, 1905, the inquiry was begun before the local deputy registrar at Windsor, as directed, in presence of counsel for each of the parties and was so continued that day and the next and on the 5th February, 1906.\nOn the 14th February, the local deputy registrar made his report to the judge. By that he assessed the damages in favour of one plaintiff at $3,751.35 and the other at $463.60, and certified that, in his opinion, the plaintiffs were entitled to the costs of the reference.\nIt is to be observed that the counsel for appellant not only appeared and contested vigorously throughout the trial before the learned judge, after having made the protest above set forth, but also appeared before the local registrar on the reference, without any further protest or objection and contested the claim in every way that he might be entitled to do as if he had never protested.\nIt is further to be noted that no motion was ever made to set aside the proceedings or any of them.\nAppellants' counsel contented himself with resting upon his protest and now avers that he did so advisedly and gives as his reason therefor that if he had made an application to the learned judge to set the proceedings aside and failed he could not hope to carry an appeal therefrom to this appellate court, but hoped to bring the question of jurisdiction here by appeal from the findings when his case would be appealable as of right.\nInstead, however, of doing so at the earliest opportunity, he took another chance throw by appealing from the report to the learned local judge, who heard his appeal, evidently at length, and, as he remarks, on several questions not set forth specifically in the notice of appeal.\nThe learned judge, on the 25th April, 1906, gave judgment on this appeal, reviewing at length the many contentions set up by the appeal and made some unimportant allowances that appellant got the benefit of.\nFormal judgment with these variations was entered accordingly, on the 25th April, 1906. From that judgment the appellant brings this appeal and seeks thereby a judgment declaring all these proceedings null and void by reason of want of jurisdiction in the court below.\nIt certainly is not a contention to be encouraged in the slightest degree, after all the vast expense the respondents have incurred, largely increased no doubt by the contentious part, taken as of right, by the appellant,\nThe appellant chose to run the risk of doing so advisedly and not by accident or pressure for want of time or opportunity to adopt the simpler course of moving to set aside the proceedings.\nThe appellant had a fairly arguable case that might have been presented to the local judge at the earliest stage of the case for the exercise of the discretion of the court. He asks us to act or to direct the learned judge to act upon that discretion now.\nI apprehend that, under such circumstances, there can be no possible right to appeal on the ground of want of jurisdiction unless it appear clear beyond all peradventure, that the court appealed from had no jurisdiction whatsoever.\nOn the 1st day of July, 1891, 54 Vict. (Imp.), ch. 27, known as the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" was brought into force in Canada.\nSection 3 provides as follows:\n3. The legislature of a British possession may by any colonial law,\u2014-\n(a) Declare any court of unlimited civil jurisdiction, whether original or appellate, in that possession, to be a colonial court of admiralty, and provide for the exercise by such court of its jurisdiction under this Act, and limit territorially or otherwise the extent of such jurisdiction; and\u2014\n(b) Confer upon any inferior or subordinate court in that possession such partial or limited admiralty jurisdiction under such regulations and with such appeal (if any) as may seem fit;\nProvided that any such colonial law shall not confer any jurisdiction which is not, by this Act, conferred upon a colonial court of admiralty.\nThe Canada \"Admiralty Act, 1891,\" was enacted pursuant to the powers given in the section I have just quoted. Sections three and four thereof enact:\n3. In pursuance of the powers given by \"The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890\" aforesaid, or otherwise in any manner vested in the Parliament of Canada, it is enacted and declared that the Exchequer Court of Canada is and shall be, within Canada, a colonial court of admiralty and as a court of admiralty shall, within Canada, have and exercise all the jurisdiction conferred by the said Act and by this Act.\n4. Such jurisdiction, powers and authority shall be exercisable and exercised by the Exchequer Court throughout Canada and the waters thereof, whether tidal or non-tidal, or naturally navigable or artificially made so, and all persons shall, as well in such parts of Canada as have heretofore been beyond the reach of the process of any vice-admiralty court, or elsewhere therein, have all the rights and remedies in all matters (including cases of contract and tort and proceedings in rem and in personam), arising out of or connected with navigation, shipping, trade or\" commerce, which may be had or enforced in any colonial court of admiralty, under the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890.\"\nIt is within the meaning of the last two sections and all that they imply that we must seek for the jurisdiction of the learned trial judge to try this cause and for the proceedings in his court leading up to the trial.\nOne or two observations may be made upon these sections as it is urged that in some way or other the Exchequer Court of Canada, in the exercise of its powers, must be held to be upon a different footing from the High Court in England. I am unable to find any reasons for such a contention. The jurisdiction of the court must be exercised within Canada. Again it must be exercised throughout Canada and the waters thereof. These terms designate the place within which the jurisdiction is to be exercised; and the place within which the appellant came and was seized clearly and indisputably was within the area thus designated. That by no means implies that the offences or the contract out of which the necessity for proceedings may arise, in rem or in personam, must have taken place within Canada or upon the waters thereof.\nThe subject matter with which the court thus constituted has to deal may arise out of or be connected with\nnavigation, shipping, trade or commerce which may be had or enforced in any colonial court of admiralty under the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890.\"\nThen turning to sub-section two of section 2, of the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" we find it reads as follows:\n2. (2) The jurisdiction of a colonial court of admiralty shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be over the like places, persons, matters and things as the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England, whether existing by virtue of any statute or otherwise, and the colonial court of admiralty may exercise such jurisdiction in like manner and to as full an extent as the High Court in England, and shall have the same regard as that court to international law and the comity of nations.\nCould anything be more comprehensive? Could language be more explicit in the way of authorizing the constitution of a court within Canada for the purpose of exercising this jurisdiction? It seems to me as if to all intents and purposes the result is just the same as if the Parliament and sovereign power that enacted the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" had constituted the Canadian court a branch of the High Court in England, for convenience sake, to exercise the powers which that court might at the time of the passing of the Act have been endowed with.\nWhether the limits of that jurisdiction are fixed as found by the law when the Dominion exercised the right thus conferred and established courts within that right or are liable to their being shifted from time to time as the parent parliament may determine by later legislation regarding the Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, without express reference to the colonial courts, may become an interesting inquiry. But, in the view I take of this case, the necessity for following such inquiry and considering the \"Merchant Shipping Act\" of later date, does not arise.\nHaving thus looked at the nature of the jurisdiction thus existing here, we can suppose this arrest of the appellant to have taken place on the Thames in England, and all I have related to have transpired in the Admiralty Division of the High Court in England, instead of in the court below; is it for a moment conceivable that, having ignored the uniform practice of moving against the proceeding, as was done in the case of Borjesson & Wright v. Carlberg[8], and the second case, page 1322, or The \"Jassy\"[9], or The \"Vivar\"[10], and numerous other cases, an appellant would be heard after trial and reference, as here, to raise questions of the jurisdiction, unless in a case where the jurisdiction never could have existed?\nThere are cases of such absolute want of jurisdiction in a court that nothing can cure and bind. There are cases of another sort where the objection must be taken by plea or otherwise and be determined or waived. This case is, I conceive, of the latter.\nSuppose the appellant had been acquitted in these proceedings and the respondents' action dismissed and they had in such event sought a remedy for their alleged grievance in an American court having jurisdiction, could they have hoped to succeed? Could the appellant, in such case, not have set up the supposed dismissal in the court below as a bar?\nMost assuredly it seems to me so. And yet, on what could such a plea of res judicata rest if there was no jurisdiction in the court below?\nThe objection to the jurisdiction was rested neither in pleading, nor at trial, nor in factum here upon the narrow ground of practice that a ship in motion cannot or ought not to be proceeded against, but upon the broad ground that a foreign ship having offended by colliding with another foreign ship in foreign waters could not be proceeded against when it came within Canadian waters. At this stage appellant ought not to be heard on either of the narrow grounds of practice.\nIt is said, however, that actual seizure and taking possession is necessary to exercise of jurisdiction. Is that so? The case of The \"Nautik\"[11] seems against such notions of jurisdiction. See also cases cited therein.\nThe relation of seizure to jurisdiction is fully and learnedly set forth by Jeune J. in the case of The \"Dictator\"[12], at pages 311 and 312.\nThe need for seizure was to enforce the appearance and bail.\nAnd we find here bail was given and in form it of necessity must be, as it was, as appears by bonds on file, as given without being under protest.\nI conclude that, once there was bail given, and an appearance made, though under protest, but that protest not followed up by an effective motion to challenge the jurisdiction, there was an end to the question of jurisdiction in the case, by thus passing the means by which it might have been raised, if there existed on the facts a case in which jurisdiction could, in any circumstances, be asserted.\nIn short, all that is involved in these objections and considerations are merely matters of practice and in no way going to the root of jurisdiction and should not prevail here or be heard here.\nThat brings us to the consideration of the law upon which such jurisdiction rests.\nThe case of The \"Diana\"[13], and of The \"Courrier[14] in the same volume at page 541, seem absolutely decisive of the matter.\nIn the former case Dr. Lushington says:\nThe decision of this question depends mainly, if not exclusively, upon the construction which the court ought to give to the seventh section of 24th Vict. ch. 10:\u2014\"The High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim for damages done by any ship.\" The object of the Act, as stated in the title and preamble, is \"to extend the jurisdiction\" of the court. The seventh section, which deals with the subject of damage, does not particularize any circumstances to which the jurisdiction of the court is to extend, but gives the court jurisdiction in the widest and most general terms; and there can be no doubt that the present case falls within those terms.\nHe then proceeds to point out that but for this amending Act the former state of the law might have presented some difficulties in the way of asserting jurisdiction over matters arising in foreign waters.\nAnd in the latter case it appears that, as here, the parties were both foreigners and the collision in question had arisen in the Port of Rio Grande and thus beyond British waters.\nI am unable to distinguish this case from those and I may observe that but for the attack made upon the assertion of jurisdiction based upon proceedings arising from the service or arrest in a place where presumably the vessel was in motion, I should have satisfied myself with the citation of these authorities, the statute on which they rest and the relations of the jurisdiction in the court below to that statute.\nThe recent case of The \"Jassy\"[15], is noteworthy though not a decision of the point raised here, yet shewing a recognition of the law I rely on as if undoubted. The \"J.,\" a vessel owned by the State of Roumania, on 30th April, 1905, collided with the Greek steamship \"C.\" at Sulina, in Roumania. On the 18th March, 1906, the owners of the \"C.\" arrested the \"J.\" in an action in rem. The \"J.\" was then at Liverpool.\nThrough inadvertence an appearance was entered unconditionally. It was shortly afterwards discovered that the Roumanian Government claimed The \"Jassy\" was one of the public vessels of that state and that this fact had been overlooked by the agents who instructed the appearance. A motion was made to dismiss the action on the ground of the public ownership by a foreign state of the arrested vessel and it was dismissed accordingly.\nNo one seems to have thought of taking any such objection to the jurisdiction as is raised here, though the facts there presented exactly the identical case before us, except that the arrest was made in port and that port Liverpool instead of in the waters of a Canadian channel, as herein, whilst the vessel is assumed, but not proven to have been in motion.\nIndeed, it seems so far from that to have been assumed by solicitors, counsel and the court (as a thing impossible of question), that, but for this fact of a foreign state owning the vessel, the action was brought in a court having jurisdiction to try it.\nI have perused a great many cases and authorities cited and arising from such citation, that seem to me quite irrelevant to the questions in issue here.\nThis case rests upon the maritime lien that arises from a collision and attaches to the offending vessel by virtue of such collision and the resulting damages in favour (to the extent thereof) of the owners of the innocent and damaged vessel.\nWherever the offender goes, she is subject to that iien, and it becomes the duty of the court having such right to enforce a lien of that kind whenever the offender comes within its jurisdiction, upon being applied to, to take steps to enforce the lien. To refuse it would be a denial of justice. Yet questions might in the exericse of such jurisdiction so arise that a proper discretion might lead to refusal to exercise it.\nThe collision with a vessel which is the property of a foreign power, even if that vessel be a wrongdoer, is by the comity of nations removed from any such jurisdiction, unless at the request of the foreign power so owning.\nThe right to navigate carries with it no exemption from such jurisdiction.\nThe right and the duty of an admiralty court are not in conflict.\nThe cases of crimes committed abroad or of damages resulting to persons therefrom, or of sailors' rights to assert their claims for wages, or of material men or others supplying necessaries to a vessel, and all cases in the nature of actions in personam, stand on an entirely different footing from the cases arising from collision and consequent lien ipso facto, as it were. The cases of life salvage is specially provided for in 24 Vict. ch. 10, sec. 54. In all these cases no lien exists as is shewn by the cases of The \"Two Ellens\"[16]; The \"Veritas\"[17], and other cases though the result of adjudication upon such claims may create a lien.\nThe wrong done by the trespasser in a collision case may in law and fact transfer by means of the resulting lien arising from the act so done virtually the most valuable interest in the vessel from the owner to the persons entitled to the lien. It seems idle in such a case to set up the possible wrong to be done such an offender by her arrest and ignore the rights her wrongdoing has created and vested in others suffering therefrom.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN and DUFF JJ. concurred in the judgment of Davies J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

The space between the two tracks was very narrow and seeing a car coming from the west as she was about to step on the track, she recoiled, and at the same time the car she had left started and she was crushed between two, receiving injuries from which she died. In an action by her father and mother for damages the jury found that the company was negligent in running the east bound car at excessive speed and starting the west bound car and not sounding the gong in proper time. They found also that deceased was negligent, but that the company could, nevertheless, have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care.\nHeld, that the case having been submitted to the jury with a charge not objected to by the defendants and the evidence justifying the findings the verdict for the plaintiffs should not be disturbed.\nThe plaintiffs should not have had the funeral and other expenses incurred by the father of deceased allowed as damages in the action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal in delivering judgment stated the facts as follows:\nThe action was brought by the plaintiffs, the father and mother of Lillian Mulvaney, to recover damages for the death of their daughter, caused by the alleged negligence of the defendants in operating their street railway.\nThe facts are, that on the 23rd March, 1905, at about 8 o\u2019clock in the evening, the deceased, Lillian Mulvaney, aged twenty years, was a passenger on a west bound car, and alighted from it at the corner of Queen and Soho streets, intending to go south across Queen street. She, after alighting, crossed in front of the car which she had left, and while upon or near the south track was struck by an east bound car and so injured that she shortly thereafter died. She was seen by the motorman in charge of the west bound car to pass in front of his car, but she was not apparently seen by the motorman of the east bound car until he was within about 12 feet away. After the deceased had passed in front of the car which she had left it was moved forward a short distance. The east bound car was then coming at a rapid rate estimated by some of the witnesses up to as high as twenty miles an hour. When upon the devil strip, as it is called, that is the strip between the two tracks, or possibly when she had actually stepped upon the south track, some one shouted and this apparently directed her attention to the rapidly approaching east bound car, with the result that she attempted to retrace her steps, but her retreat had then been cut off by the forward movement of the west bound car.\nOn the trial questions were submitted to the jury which, with their answers, were as follows: 1. Were the injuries which resulted in the death of Lillian Mulvaney caused by any negligence of the defendants?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n2. If so, wherein did such negligence consist?\nAnswer\u2014The excessive rate of speed of the eastbound car, and the moving of the westbound car and the gong not sounding in the proper time.\n3. Or, were such injuries caused by the negligence of the said Lillian Mulvaney?\nAnswer\u2014No.\n4. Was the said Lillian Mulvaney guilty of contributory negligence?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n5. If you find that she was guilty of contributory negligence, nevertheless could the defendants by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n6. If the plaintiffs are held to be entitled to succeed, at what sum do you assess the damages?\nAnswer\u2014$2,000.\nFirst\u2014To Alexander Mulvaney, $500.\nSecond\u2014To Mary Mulvaney, $1,500.\nThe trial judge directed a verdict to be entered for plaintiff with the damages assessed by the jury. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellants. The negligence immediately causing the accident was that of the plaintiff, and the fifth question should not have been left the jury. Butterfield v. Forrester[1]; Davies v. Mann[2]; Halifax Street Railway Co. v. Inglis[3].\nThe damages were excessive considering the relation of the deceased towards support of the family. Certainly the funeral expenses should not have been allowed. Clark v. London General Omnibus Co.[4] N. Ferrar Davidson for the respondents. The findings of the jury should not be disturbed, especially when approved by the Court of Appeal. George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard[5]; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rainville[6]; Price v. Ordway[7].\nThe gong was not sounded on the east bound car nor the speed slackened both of which were required by the rules. See Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Hainer[8]; Sims v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[9]\nThe damages assessed were reasonable and proper. St. Lawrence & Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett[10]; Lambkin v. South Eastern Railway Co.[11]; Johnston v. Great Western Railway Co.[12]\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014Action for damages for the death of their unmarried daughter, by the father and mother of Lillian Mulvaney, about twenty years of age, who was injured so that she died within a week afterwards, by the appellants\u2019 cars at a street crossing in the City of Toronto. Verdict of the jury of $500 for the father and $1,500 for the mother. Judgment affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and now appealed to this court.\nThe deceased was a passenger on a car of the defendants going west upon Queen street, intending to alight, and to go south upon Peter street, which intersects Queen street on its south side. The time was about eight o\u2019clock in the evening of the 23rd of March. The line on Queen street is double tracked, the space between tracks being very narrow, little more than sufficient to allow meeting cars to pass each other with safety. The west bound car on which the deceased was riding ran upon the north track so that she required to cross the south track to go to Peter street. The company\u2019s practice is to stop at the near side of crossings, and passengers may alight either at the front or rear, but on the right or outer side of the car. The car in question stopped at the near side of Peter street; and the deceased alighted at the front of the car, and proceeded to cross in front of the car towards Peter street. At this moment another car was coming from the west on the south track, by which the deceased was struck and received the injury from which she died. The east bound tram passed at a high speed, and was not stopped until it had proceeded a number of car lengths eastward. The injuries to the deceased were about the head and feet, and she was found lying at the rear of the west bound car with one foot pinned under a wheel. There was evidence that when the deceased was about to step from the south track she recoiled and drew back seeing the east bound car approaching, and at that moment the west bound car started forward, the result being that she was crushed between the two.\nAfter a very full and careful charge by the learned Chief Justice, questions were submitted to the jury, which, with their answers are as follows:\n1. Were the injuries which resulted in the death of Lillian Mulvaney caused by any negligence of the defendants?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n2. If so, wherein did such negligence consist?\nAnswer\u2014The excessive rate of speed of the eastbound car, and the moving of the westbound car and the gong not sounding in the proper time.\n3. Or, were such injuries caused by the negligence of the said Lillian Mulvaney?\nAnswer\u2014No.\n4. Was the said Lillian Mulvaney guilty of contributory negligence?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n5. If you find that she was guilty of contributory negligence nevertheless could the defendants by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident?\nAnswer\u2014Yes.\n6. If the plaintiffs are held to be entitled to succeed, at what sum do you assess the damages?\nAnswer\u2014$2,000.\nFirst\u2014To Alexander Mulvaney, $500.\nSecond\u2014To Mary Mulvaney, $1,500.\nIn submitting the questions the learned Chief Justice carefully explained to the jury the meaning of contributory negligence, and used the following language:\nThe question for you to consider is: Was it after all the negligence of the Street Railway Company, or was it her own negligence in going around the front of that car to cross when she ought to be, you would thing probably, and probably was, looking right west? No doubt she would be looking southerly also crossing the tracks, but one would think that she would be looking westward. However, it is for you to say. Then there is the minor degree of negligence, not exactly negligence causing the accident, but negligence which contributes to the accident which the law says disentitles people to recover. Our technical name for that is contributory negligence and it is not so high a degree of negligence as the negligence which I have just spoken of, but it is negligence which contributes to the accident in the sense that it is the proximate and immediate cause of the accident, even if somebody else may be at fault and commit a breach of duty. The defence argues that at any rate even if she was not guilty of negligence that caused the accident, she was guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident in the sense which I have mentioned, and that is the question which I am putting to you here. It goes on round in a circle again, and the law says that even though a person was guilty of contributory negligence, yet if the person or corporation which was guilty of the original negligence could have prevented the accident the person is still entitled to recover. What is meant is this: We will assume there is a primary negligence on the part of the street railway, then you find there was such primary negligence. Then we will suppose, just for the sake of argument, that you find she was guilty of contributory negligence, that is to say, that she contributed to her own accident to such an extent that her negligence was the immediate cause of the accident, although the railway company was negligent. Then the question arises: Is there anything more that the railway could have done, notwithstanding her negligence, is there any secondary negligence which caused the accident, even though she was negligent? It is not very easy to make it clear. It is one of these legal matters that are a little involved, but I have endeavoured to make it as clear as it can be. What secondary negligence is there here? Nothing exactly of a definite nature, but the argument is that the car was not under proper control, and if it had been even when she was going into the danger, that it might have been averted; so that with reference to that fifth question if you find she was guilty of contributory negligence, nevertheless could the defendant, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident?\u2014The argument for the plaintiff still is that the two causes again came in there to make a secondary kind of negligence, namely, the alleged excessive rate of speed, and the moving of the westbound car, if those things existed.\nNo objection was taken to this charge by counsel for the defendants, except that after the jury\u2019s answers to the questions were received, Mr. Bain submitted that on those findings the judgment should be entered for the defendants, and that the contributory negligence of the deceased was such as to disentitle the plaintiffs to succeed.\nThat was the main ground of the argument before us. It was strongly pressed that the final and ultimate negligence which caused the accident was that of the deceased and that the fifth question was improper and tended to confuse the jury. We do not think there is anything in this objection having regard to the evidence and the careful explanation of the nature of contributory negligence which the learned Chief Justice had made in his charge. It is plain also that the jury must have been led by the evidence to believe that but for the starting of the west bound car, when the deceased was, in the full view of the motorman of the car, in a place of great danger, having regard to the rapidly approaching car from the west, also in full view, the deceased would not have been hurt, notwithstanding her negligence.\nThe verdict, therefore, cannot be disturbed by reason of any objection to the manner in which it was presented to the jury.\nIt was also objected that the damages were excessive. But although they are large, I do not think them so excessive as to warrant us in setting the verdict aside.\nIt was, however, contended by counsel for the defendants, both in their factum and on the argument before us, that the damages allowed to the father ought to be reduced by a sum of $193, being the amount of the funeral and other expenses incurred by the father as a consequence of his daughter\u2019s death.\nWhen evidence of these expenses was offered at the trial it was distinctly objected to by the defendants\u2019 counsel. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, however, supported his contention by the authority of a recent decision of Clark v. The London General Omnibus Co.[13], and to this authority the learned Chief Justice yielded and received the evidence.\nIn his address to the jury the learned Chief Justice told them that this part of the claim amounting to $193 was part of the damages, and belonged to the father and added:\nThen whatever small sum you like to add to that for him will be what you would give the father. I think we ought to agree with defendants\u2019 counsel that this sum of $193 must have been included by the jury in the $500 allowed by them as the father\u2019s damages. That this was improper, and that the charge of the learned judge was wrong is now not disputed inasmuch as the decision followed by the learned judge at the trial has since been reversed by the Court of Appeal[14], and it has been decided that such expenses cannot be recovered in such an action.\nIf the point had been taken in the Court of Appeal, doubtless effect would have been given to it either by directing a new trial, or by deducting the sum of $193 from the sum allowed by the jury to the father. The objection not having been taken in the Court of Appeal, I think we cannot give effect to it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Henderson & Davidson.\n[1] 11 East 60.\n[2] 10 M. & W. 546.\n[3] 30 Can.

The circumstances of the case and questions in issue upon the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. and J. J. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C. and Harris K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed with costs. I agree in the opinion of His Lordship Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This case has been tried three times and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has directed a fourth trial and from that order the plaintiff, who secured last verdict, being his first success of the kind, appeals.\nThorough search for plans and proper means to produce them in evidence, and when produced, a supplementing of the evidence thus furnished by comprehensive surveys of river, side lines and rear lines, that would have applied, and so to speak, fitted the original plan to the ground, as it was settled upon, ought to have determined by one trial, once and for all, the questions in issue.\nThe angles and courses setting forth on this plan the many lots, are of such a character, and so varied, that the means of checking such surveys are abundant.\nUnless the river is one of those that shifts its course every few years, the main courses of it furnish, I would suppose, a key to the whole.\nIt may be more amusing to follow the games of chance arising, from trying how little evidence, or what kind of evidence, may be available, admissible or effective in a case of this sort, than to settle down co a thorough investigation of the historical and mathematical problems I suggest.\nThe new trial has been granted because of misdirection by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury.\nIt seems to me that the learned trial judge misunderstood the effect of what was said in the report of this case in 35 S.C.R. 527. All that this court had to do on that occasion was to dismiss an appeal against an order for a new trial. That duty done, and I conceive properly done, the court could not go further and direct anything. The remarks in doing so bound nobody. They might be considered of weight or not as an exposition of the law.\nIt is the decision of the case, and in that decision the determination of some point of law necessarily involved therein, that governs as a precedent, or binds in a new trial.\nThere was nothing of that kind in the remarks to which the learned trial judge attached so very much importance.\nThe parties were entitled to have had the new trial herein proceed as if the case had never been tried before. In such cases the less the jury hears of former trials or hints of former results, the better.\nI am forced to conclude that the learned trial judge erred in referring to a part of the case, a possible turning point of the case, as decided here, and as if the remarks made here on the point in question hound the jury unless and until the defendants had established something which might well have been impossible or inconvenient. It seems as if the learned trial judge detected the fallacy but felt bound, in a way he was not, by what transpired here.\nException is taken also to the learned trial judge's charge relative to the north boundary of, or the location of the Finlay Cameron lot, and the alleged trespasses immediately north of it. The remarks made In regard to the river and Mount Horeb road as bearing on this branch of the case, certainly tend to produce an impression beyond what, after some consideration, I think is warranted by the evidence of McKenzie, which I will deal with later on.\nStripped of sophistries and needless verbiage, the mining lease in question here only attempts to give the right to minerals in the lands lying between Peter Grant's land on the north as granted to him, and the lands of James Fraser on the south, both being granted by the same patent, in the lease said to be in or of 1784, but in reality dated 3rd Nov., 1785.\nThis patent granted in all 3,400 acres to seventeen different grantees, but apportioned the land intended for each amongst the grantees, in quantities set forth in the habendum. The grant is expressly made of\nthree thousand four hundred acres situate, lying and being on the East River emptying into Pictou Harbour, within the County of Halifax and province aforesaid and abutted and bounded according to the plan annexed, three thousand four hundred acres. And hath such shape, form and marks as appears by a plat thereof, hereunto.\nThe plan is thus incorporated with the deed. The width and area of each grant is marked on the plan corresponding to the area allotted by the patent to each grantee. As minerals, now in question, were not reserved to the Crown, the vacant space, appearing between the Peter Grant and James Fraser grants is all that was left for any miner's lease to operate on. In common with other vacant spaces, between the grants, according to this plan, it had not written across it anything to indicate the width or area.\nAccording to the scale upon which this plan is drawn, there would be only thirty-five chains between these grants. And as by this plan appears, a grant ten chains wide, to Finlay Cameron, not so long as these grants in depth, from the river, but the same depth as plaintiff's lease, there would only be twenty-five chains width in this vacant space for this lease, though claiming 64.03 chains to operate upon.\nI am unable to understand why, as suggested, but not proved, the measurement by scale of these vacant spaces should, necessarily, be unreliable.\nThe vacant spaces were doubtless left ungranted, as counsel conceded, because less desirable for settlement than others. It is hardly likely that such selection was left to the sole judgment of the surveyor. Each man would, for himself, by self or friends, I should say, judging from, the greatly varying size of the grants, here laid out, have to decide that. No doubt there was much said and done in the way of investigating, and allotting before the settlement assumed the remarkable shape this plan indicates, and though the surveyor has not put down, on the plan, figures to indicate the areas of ungranted lands, it does not follow, he omitted to chain across them. It would be most remarkable, if the surveyor should have omitted to ascertain and report the width of these intervening spaces, for the information of the Government, and the proposed settlers.\nAnd when I apply the scale to the tier of parallel lots, on the west side of the river and the same scale to those opposite, and on the east side of the river, including vacant spaces in both cases, and in the latter case, going to the southerly line of the Fraser 350 acre grant, in making such a test, the results are such, after making allowances for the overlappings of the two blocks, on either side, as they appear on the plan, that I am convinced, that the whole plan was, including vacant spaces, worked out on a scale.\nSuch approaches to accuracy do not exist in some of the other numerous plans, before us, and such results are not merely accidental.\nI am further unable to understand how the error, if error there be, in the width of this vacant space, can so enure to the plaintiff's benefit, as to entitle him on an investigation of the facts, as to the width, to have a jury told by the learned trial judge, at the close of the case, that a prima facie case exists in plaintiff's favour.\nI proceed to consider the story of this survey from the above mentioned grant down.\nThe improbable supposition that so wide an area would be passed, by those settlers, especially as we find it coveted, and settled afterwards, meets us at the first step in our investigation.\nA vacant space at the north end of the same side was taken by one McDonald in 1803.\nIn 1811, John Holmes had granted to him the following part of the space now in question.\nThe lot described in the said plan number three on the said branch of the said East River, beginning at the upper bounds of lands claimed by a certain Alexander Grant, from thence to run north seventy degrees east, four hundred and seventy rods, along the line of Alexander Grant, thence south twenty degrees east sixty-eight rods or until it comes to the farm lot of said Fraser, thence south seventy degrees west five hundred and twenty rods along the line of said James Fraser farm lot until it comes to the river, thence following the several courses of said river down stream, until it meet the place of beginning containing in the whole two hundred acres.\nAnd we find, at that time, no trace of any James Fraser farm lot, except the one which forms the southerly boundary of lands in this mining lease, unless we look at the deed in 1799 from the heirs of Finlay Cameron, to one James Fraser; the same man I imagine. Now it is as clear as anything possibly can be that the Holmes grant came south to one or other of these James Fraser lots. I will refer to this again presently, and possibly shew how an error occurred.\nWho was the neighbor on the northerly side of Holmes? No one else than Alexander Grant, the son of Peter Grant, whose land was the northerly boundary of this vacant space and this mining lease.\nAnd Alexander Grant is recognized, by this grant to Holmes, as a claimant in 1811, to the land next north of Holmes' grant, so much so, that his land was the northern boundary line of that surveyed out for Holmes. Nothing else happened until Alexander Grant, five years later, 25th January, 1816, got his claim finally recognized by the Crown granting him the following:\u2014\nBeginning on the eastern side of the east branch of the East River of Pictou, on the south eastern angle of Peter Grant's farm lot, from thence to run north seventy degrees east along the southern side line of said farm lot four hundred and seventy rods, thence south twenty degrees east on ungranted lands sixty-five rods, or until it meets the north-eastern angle of John Holmes' lands, thence south seventy degrees west along the northern side line of said lands four hundred and eighty rods, or until it meets the river, thence by the different courses of the same down stream until it meets the place of beginning.\nIn an ordinary case, we would say that these two grants covered all the vacant space between the farm lot of James Fraser, the original grantee, and the southern line of Peter Grant now the subject of inquiry. But this is an extraordinary case.\nIf we take the farm lot of James Fraser to mean his own original grant, or the line of his acquisition from the heirs of Finlay Cameron, of his lot, the result is the same, for both had been granted by the Crown, without reserving such metals as now in question.\nThe two descriptions I copy clearly cover the vacant space. It is not a question of accuracy of measurements of width, for that is expressly provided against by the terms, in each case, used alternatively to the chains of distance; by the words in the first \"or until it comes to the farm lot of James Fraser\"; and in the next grant \"or until it meets the north eastern angle of John Holmes' lands.\" Generally speaking one would be unable to find any more space upon which there could be found anything for a further grant of the Crown to operate.\nBut here it is said, true that may be so, but we find there was according to the scaling of this plan only twenty-five chains to operate upon, and there must be an error, and as there was an error it must enure to the benefit of discoverers in a future century.\nI think the ground of error can easily be found if we follow the surveyor along in the survey of Holmes' lot.\nHe ran along, as that shews, the south boundary of Alexander Grant's claim 470 rods. That took him seventy rods at least past the east end of Finlay Cameron's grant and, if allowance is to be made for the bend in the river, about fifty rods more. I say fifty rods, because there is that difference between the length of the north and south boundaries caused by the bend of the river. The surveyor crosses south to the farm lot of said Fraser. Being so far easterly beyond rear end of Finlay Cameron lot, are we to assume that he had in mind that lot? Fraser had acquired the lot from Finlay Cameron's heirs twelve years before. This is not expressed to be the line of an extension of the north line of Fraser farm lot, as assuming knowledge in the surveyor of the fact of this acquisition, it might have been well described to be. It is to the farm lot \"or until it comes to the farm lot of said Fraser.\" Then he runs from the extreme east point to which that had brought him \"along the line of said James Fraser's farm lot.\" How could he? Only one way, and that was along the north line of the original James Fraser farm lot which possibly shewed then blazed trees. And as he may not have known anything of the Finlay Cameron lot or Fraser's acquisition of it, he proceeded west in way he says. It is to be remembered there were only twenty-five chains between the Cameron and Alexander Grant lines and if the latter claimed two hundred acres, his southerly line would be only eighteen chains from James Fraser's original grant of farm lot. He sought a blazed line and found it, one chain further on. Instead of giving Holmes seventeen chains he would be giving him eighteen chains. That might appear as nothing in the woods, of any value.\nAssuming such an error either discovered and rectified or undiscovered, I cannot see how we can infer from either discovery and rectification or oversight of it, a widening of the space between Fraser and Peter Grant so as to find 64.03 chains to meet the needs of this lease.\nThe obvious thing is that two surveyors in 1811 and 1816, surveyed the very space in question and could not find even the width there previously supposed to exist.\nIt was only twenty-six years after the original survey was made and when the marks of that work could no doubt, in many places, if not in all, be traced on the ground, that this claim of Alexander Grant was recognized and this grant to Holmes shewing its recognition was made.\nTo discard evidence which all that, together with the grant, in 1816, confirming Alexander Grant's claim, furnishes because of an error of description, in one or other, that may involve at the worst a width of about eight chains and adopt another hypothesis that there was a width of 64.03 chains; enough for nearly four 200 acres farms of the length of Grant and Fraser farms; when the eyes, then looking on the ground, only found there a width for two at most, and not even that except by the error I refer to; seems to border on the absurd.\nYet we are told that there was the grant in this same patent, that gave Alexander Grant his land, of another part to James Fraser, and that it shews a width of eighteen chains including the Finlay Cameron lot. It plainly includes the latter. Its bounds are as follows:\nThat certain tract of land marked \"B\" on the annexed plan containing three hundred acres and is abutted and bounded as follows, viz., northerly and easterly by the said John Holmes' lands and un-granted lands, southerly by lands heretofore granted him, the said Fraser, and westerly by the said east branch of the. East River.\nI fail to see how being bounded by Holmes' land on the north, this explains anything, in a way to help plaintiff. I observe it comes in the patent next after Alexander Grant's grant, and by reason thereof, as well as by the Holmes land, lying between, it could not disturb Grant in any way. James Holmes says this Fraser was the son. The language above quoted, written before he was born, fails to confirm his statement.\nThe issue of a grant to Fraser, including the land already granted Cameron, and claimed by him (Fraser), through Cameron, suggests speculation as to what was meant by this.\nThese lands were all subject to settlement duties and he may have desired confirmation in view of possible lapses both on his own part and that of Cameron. Or the fact may be that he had located too far south, and that it only shews one or two more blunders in this world.\nThe utmost that can be said if the plan of 1816 be absolutely correct is that there was a space of forty-one chains and twenty links between the southerly line of Peter Grant's grant and the northerly line of Fraser's 1785 grant. And out of this comes ten chains granted Finlay Cameron, leaving thirty-one chains and twenty links. To get this result lots, as laid down in the original plan, and this later one of 1816, have to be transposed to conform to a theory.\nSurely if ever Crown surveys and grants conclusively settled anything, the inference to be drawn from this grant and plan and measurements thereon is against this lease. In any event, it is left only thirty-one chains and twenty links to operate upon, instead of sixty-four chains and three links. Eighty of these chains would be in the undiscovered, perhaps undiscoverable territory south of Holmes' lot, more probably south of Finlay Cameron's grant as Holmes comes up to that at least, and the remainder would be in Holmes' and Alexander Grant's territory.\nWhen we apply these facts and considerations to the charge in question, what foundation had the charge to rest upon?\nIs it not, with the greatest respect, obviously unfair to the defendants to have presented to the jury a presumption, existing at the close of the case, as against them, upon facts which left little further, they could do at this distance of time to shew their rights, when upon these facts the presumption or prim\u00e2 facie case if it ever existed, had thus been dispelled.\nWhat are the facts upon which presumption for appellant rests? He got a mining lease of lands surveyed by Holmes in 1872. Nothing came of the project upon which that was initiated, save and except a survey by him; a placing of stones, a marking of a maple tree; and a fir tree supposed to be in the southerly line of Peter Grant's land; and a survey or inspection in 1875 for a similar purpose, of which nothing came. In 1875 the stones were gone, but the maple tree stood, as also the fir. In 1889 the plaintiff came, and re-survey or inspection took place. But the maple had passed. Yet there was a stump supposed to be its stump. The plaintiff got the lease then, which is now in question.\nThis action began on the 12th July, 1900, and having been tried, this Mr. Holmes, who conceived the idea that there was such a wide area of mining land, yet vested in the Crown, appeared as a witness and told, that when he went to survey in 1872 he met Mr. William Grant, the grandson of Peter Grant, and questioned him. One is tempted to ask, why he should have inquired of Grant, what he, Holmes, born and brought up so short a distance away and bred to the profession of a surveyor probably knew so much better than Grant.\nHowever, the following is what he relates as taking place:\u2014\nQ. How do you find this particular point No. 1, was it at random? A. I went to William Grant. He owned the land. He told me I knew the line as well as he did. William Grant shewed me his north line * * * Having found what Grant told us was the north line., we took a line from the main road and extended it up to the top of the hill a quarter of a mile. We came across at right angles, twenty chains, what the grant called for * * * When we came to the twenty chains, Peter Ross and I told Grant that was the complement his grant gave him, and if he shewed another line we would go there. He said he claimed up to the Holmes line * * * When I shewed Grant where the twenty chains were, we told him we would go where he chose; he would not give us any line. We gave him his complement, and ran from there to the maple tree down at the river.\nIn 1875 Grant was evidently determinedly hostile and nothing he said then can be construed as any admission of anything.\nHolmes, having acted upon this alleged admission of William Grant, we are told defendants are bound by what he said.\nThe Crown cannot any more than a private individual can go, by means of a surveyor armed with such powers as the law gives a surveyor, to execute a commission given him, and planting stakes where he sees fit, create a presumption in favour of such line as the surveyor sees fit to adopt.\nIt is said, however, that this proceeding rests upon the admission of William Grant made in disparagement of his title under which the defendants claim.\nThe land spoken of, is not confined to the original Peter Grant lot, and if he or William had encroached upon neighbouring land to the north of the original north line, this answer could in no way affect this title even if such loose expressions can be of value as to a boundary line.\nIn fairness the whole conversation must be considered. In effect it seems to say \"that is my north line and Holmes' line is my south line.\" No regard is paid in the statement to what the space covered, and the difference of title in the several parts of it.\nThe cases of Mountney v. Collier (1853)[3], and Crease v. Barrett[4], at p. 931, are all I find in regard to statements of boundary lines and that presented by former is a clear cut case of fact, not shewn here, and latter case is not unlike this.\nI do not think such admission as made here can be a safe basis to rest the prima facie case the learned trial judge directed the jury had been made here, and required to be rebutted or displaced.\nBut in the last trial the witness Holmes shifted his ground, and said he really believed, from what Alexander Grant had told somebody, in his presence in 1836, when he (Holmes) was a youngster sixteen years of age, that he had been mistaken and a line four chains or more further south, was the right line of Peter Grant's grant, and that would throw his south line that much further south. I will deal presently with the plan he produced and spoke to and another made by McKenzie, together, as the latter is founded on the former.\nThe plaintiff rested his case upon that evidence, and plan of Holmes, and after the defendants had given much evidence, as to what is known in the case as the elm tree line, respecting which I will say nothing, and other matters, Mr. McKenzie was called in rebuttal and testified to the correctness of a plan, that he produced, which was the result of his visiting the locality, under the guidance of Mr. Holmes in 1889. He spoke of a recent visit in 1901, to refresh his memory, I take it, and from which his impressions as set forth in the plan were confirmed.\nI merely wish to deal with the plan, which is of the same general character as the plan produced by Mr. Holmes and to refrain from dealing at length with the evidence of McKenzie.\nThe remarkable feature of both, is that the lands in question have spread out and grown, in a way that is quite inconsistent with all I have related, as to the original plan and the plan annexed to the 1816 grants. There appear two new strips of land in both, and two new proprietors in the Holmes plan between the James Fraser original grant and the Holmes grant.\nOne of these is the Finlay Cameron grant, clearly covered in the grant of 1816 to Fraser, as part of his 300 acres, 72 rods in width, but now appearing south of and alongside the same.\nAnother is that of \"Fraser Saddler grant 1816\" lying between the James Fraser grant of 1816, and the Holmes grant, though the north line of the James Fraser 1816 grant is, as shewn above, bounded on the north by the same land. If gross error existed, in widths originally expressed, as given them, I could understand an expansion of the Holmes and Alexander Grant's grant, which filled the whole vacant space in question.\nIf, for example, each of them had been found to have in fact, respectively, a width of twenty-seven chains, and twenty-six chains twenty-five links, instead of seventeen chains, and sixteen chains twenty-five links, respectively, their grants having minerals reserved to the Crown, and subject to such a mining lease as that in question, the lease would operate thereon.\nExpansion of that sort I could conceive of, if evidence shewed it as possible, but I decline to accept intercalations of the sort put before us in plain violation of the descriptions given in the grant of 1816 without direct evidence. And to write across it words \"granted 1816\" when no such grant appears in the evidence is, to say the least, confusing.\nThere is a deed Ex. W.W.C. given by James Fraser Senior to James Fraser Junior on 9th February, 1816, fifteen days after the Crown grant of 1816 which certainly is, in light of what preceded it, a sort of puzzle. It appears in defendants' claim of title. It purports to cover 420 acres more or less. It has John Holmes' farm lot for north boundary\nfor five hundred and sixty rods or until it comes to the rear line of said James Fraser Senior's farm lot from thence to run south twenty degrees east along said rear line one hundred and thirty rods or until it comes to the said line of said James Fraser Senior's farm lot, from thence to run south seventy degrees west along said line five hundred and ten rods until it comes, etc.\nWe have Holmes' farm lot, given in his grant, at five hundred and twenty rods, along his southerly line; so this Fraser deed runs forty rods past it. We have Fraser's lot given at 660 rods (see plan) and the given area confirms that as correct. And we have the entire Fraser line of that date, consisting of two parcels, one 18 chains and other 22 chains wide or a total of thirty chains.\nWhat is this rear line? What is the southerly line referred to in this lastly quoted description?\nThe Holmes plans, Ex. W.W.\/9 & W.W.\/5, give the Finlay Cameron grant, the Fraser Sadler grant, and the Holmes grant, as of the same length and forming part of a rectangular block of land.\nWe know Finlay Cameron grant was 100 chains, and Holmes grant one hundred and thirty chains, and that Fraser grant of 1816 extended far beyond either.\nIt is not necessary that I should solve this puzzle.\nThe deed from Fraser Senior to Fraser Junior, being subsequent to the Crown grants, can have no effect on the question I am dealing with just now.\nIt may or may not be necessary for the purpose of their title, for defendants herein to clear up this and the elm tree line.\nI am only concerned with what obviously has a bearing on the judge's charge, and just now with the fundamental part of it, which at the beginning and at the close presented a prima facie case, in favour of the plaintiff. Did it exist? I remark on this Fraser deed to shew I have not overlooked it, and that it cannot form any basis for a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff.\nTurning from the Holmes plan to the McKenzie plan, Ex. W..W.\/6, we find, though it shews Finlay Cameron lot, and some other person's narrow strip, lying between Fraser grant of 1816, and his original grant of 1785, that they are not alike in the rear lines.\nThe cross measurement, however, of the McKenzie plan is more important, so I pass these minor differences of which some explanation, perhaps involving minor inaccuracies, may exist. Their disregard of accuracy, in measurement of lines from river to rear will appear presently, in what to me is much more formidable, in estimating the strength of this corroborative evidence of Mr. McKenzie.\nTo begin with, there is a clear issue of fact, presented by the comparison of the McKenzie plan, with the original plan.\nMeasured on the east side of the river, from the north line of plotted lands, to the south line of the original Fraser grant, there is by scale in the original plan presented a width of 115 chains and by the McKenzie plan when scaled a width of 152\u00bd chains. Which plan is right? Who has blundered? They cannot both be right.\nWe were asked to believe the vacant spaces were inaccurate. I have said why I do not think so. Are these the only inaccuracies? Are these the only sources of differences of results? Have they anything to do with the enormous difference of results over so comparatively short a space of ground? Was the surveyor of the work appearing on the original plan systematically accurate or the reverse?\nWhatever he was, his plan has left abundant means of demonstrating inaccuracy if it existed. The configuration of the ground with its river running through it and of the plotting done thereof make his plan an easy mark. Has the river changed? Is it in soil that would render change probable? Has it still those sharp bends and those long divergences starting from one or other of those bends first in a general course one way, and then another, alternating as it were?\nTo destroy confidence in the original plan is absolutely necessary to have any in McKenzie's fragmentary plan. No such general line of attack was made. I assume the original plan as to the river correct. I assume, when Finlay Cameron's grant of 100 acres appeared thereon, south of a most marked bend in the river, and so far past that bend, as it were, that the man surveying and placing it south of this river bend knew what he was doing.\nI cannot conceive why he would place it there if, in truth and fact, he had surveyed and laid it out further north as McKenzie and Holmes plainly put it in their plans.\nBy his plan the end of this lot, butting on the river, is so nearly straight, that he has placed 100 chains as length of rear, and the consequent result of 100 acres is the given area. The north line must have been found about equal to the south as indeed the plan shews.\nThe other plans I refer to, place the west end of the Finlay Cameron lot, so that it abuts on the acute slant of the river, where the north and south boundaries cannot be equal.\nIt moreover occupies that slant so much that there. was no place to fit in Holmes' lot, as I purpose shewing it was fitted in, south of the apex of the bend in question.\nThe north line of Peter Grant's lot, is on the McKenzie plan identical, in scale length, with that of the north line of the Peter Grant lot in the original plan, doubtless copied according to scale. The north line according to Holmes' plan is ten chains longer, according to scale, than the north line of the original lot. The end butted on the river, according to the original plan at a part of the river, where there would not be so much difference between north and south lines, as to make it worth considering. At least the south line or short one being found 150 chains and the rear width 20 chains, the area was 300 acres. It is not so in other and especially Holmes' plan.\nThe rear of Peter Grant's line and that of the James Fraser original grant appear to the eye, on the original plan when tried by the same perpendicular or meridian line, as if Grant's rear projected easterly over the Fraser original rear line, yet, on these McKenzie and Holmes plans, the original Fraser rear line projects easterly beyond that of Peter Grant.\nWhat does this mean? Fraser's original south line was 158 chains and Peter Grant's 150 chains. Why do these lines and the relative position of these lands differ so much though the plans are a hundred years apart? Has the river changed? Or has the shifting of the location of Peter Grant's land, by the intercalations I have referred to, of twenty to thirty chains further north, on the river, had anything to do with it? Let any one look at the plans and compare them in light of the course of the river. I leave it there, for I have not the instruments or means at hand to acquire more accurate results. A tracing of the original on the same scale placed over McKenzie's plan will shew curious results.\nIs the whole work, on the ground, on both sides of the river, actually, in corresponding parts throughout, as diverse as the results got on the east side, by tests? If such comparative tests were applied to both sides of the river and there were found corresponding errors or inaccuracies as the case may be, they should go far to settle this conflict between the different plans.\nIf confidence still exists in Holmes' and McKenzie's locations, as an interpretation of the original plan, I would like to know how the plan remained so absolutely accurate as to the original grants of James McDonald, and of James Fraser, which are yet respectively, exactly 20 chains and 22 chains wide, and all else, for the most part, so extravagently in error, save in the case of Peter Grant's grant which comes out within thirty links, in width of the original. But if the second edition of Holmes' relations were to be applied then where would Peter Grant be in McKenzie's plan? Where would the intercalations go?\nI cannot understand this absolute accuracy of width at the north and at the south and the intervening gross inaccuracies.\nMen inaccurate by nature or habit continue inaccurate, and the most accurate of men, in the same way, though seldom shewing absolute accuracy, shew a general approach thereto, with remarkable uniformity.\nThis original plan will even at the distance of a hundred and twenty years, if thoroughly investigated, be found accurate or the reverse.\nWhere, according to this plan in 1785, Cameron and Peter Grant's lands were, they must now be. Their acts of locating them only furnish some evidence-to interpret the plan. If the work on the ground upon which the plan was founded gave more or less than the figures on the plan indicate that might govern. It may be inferred, for example, from the case of the Hugh McDonald lot, found to be 11.27 chains instead of 10 chains that he got more. Others may have got more, or less, though owing to the general aim of the Crown surveys to give full measure very unlikely less.\nIt does not follow that, if over a wide range a surplus width, counting by figures on a plan, be found, it of necessity falls to the Crown or its lessees, still less in one place. All the errors of that sort cannot of necessity fall in one place. Yet is not that what Mc. Kenzie's evidence comes to?\nFinding extra width disturbs but settles nothing.\nTest the matters in question by the Holmes' grant, of 17 chains wide, as it stood in 1811 on the south side of the apex of the bend in the river, and next Finlay Cameron, when it was 470 rods on the north line, and on the south 520 rods. Fit it into the angle that was left in the river when Finlay Cameron's land was allotted him, and see how exactly such delimitation would suit the facts.\nIt is removed by McKenzie to the north side of the apex and there the north line must be the longer one, and the south one the shorter one, for the mathematical results of fitting it into the northerly line of the triangle in the river, obviously must be so. Yet when I scale them I find about 5\u00be inches equal to 112 chains or 448 rods of north line as against 4\u215d inches equal to 92\u00bd chains or 370 rods for south line.\nCertainly these are not the same boundary lines or these lots the same.\nWithout, so far as I can see, observing this, explaining it, or alluding to it, the learned trial judge on the strength of the following in McKenzie's evidence The Court:\u2014Q.\u2014Are the angles and turns of the river correctly represented on this plan\u2014G. 3? A.\u2014Very nearly so.\nmade the impressive remarks as to roads and rivers that are complained of.\nThe Mount Horeb road I certainly understood counsel in answer to repeated questions, to concede, lay on the south side of the Finlay Cameron grant. If so then we have that part of the learned trial judge's charge going in the wrong direction.\nIf the intercalations are omitted from the plan and ought to appear as substitutions or superpositions, so to speak, as the evidence of some witnesses indicates, then the Mount Horeb road may be still on the south line of where Finlay Comeron's 100 acre lot lay. In that, however, McDonald Roy and his corroborated would be right, and the learned trial judge's original impression be right, but what he got from McKenzie be absolutely wrong, and the impression left on the jury correspondingly so.\nIf these observations are nearly correct, though touching only a fringe of the case, there is much to complain of in the possible effect of the learned trial judge's charge in this regard.\nThere appear on the later plans brooks that do not appear on the original. One of these brooks might have fitted this Holmes lot, in either place chosen to set it down. Whether the brook attracted the settling man, or the eye of the artist saw no difference, in later times, as to which brook should be used, I know not. I pass the coincidence. I note only this, that the brook may have in a hundred years transformed the apex of the river so much by its wearings and deposits, that some of, or some part of, the inferences I have been drawing, may not be justifiable. There is no evidence of it however.\nI cannot usefully add much more on the issue now before me which is the concrete, or possibly concrete effect, of Mr. Justice Russell's charge relative to the alleged prima facie case, of the plaintiff, at the beginning and ending of his charge and that part I have just dealt with.\nI cannot share Mr. Justice Graham's abstract theories as to it.\nI cannot accept, as he has apparently been able to do, the evidence as to so wide a vacant space as conclusive, and I am therefore less inclined to adopt his abstract proposition as to the possible meanings of such a charge. The evidence of McKenzie shews that his method of cross measurements was dependent upon hearsay as to lines, and at the offsets he makes errors may have crept in. And though he swears to having had plans with him that ought to have so startled him, when contrasted with his results, as to have put him to some more systematic method of checking his work than is observable in the evidence, yet we are left to guess at explanations.\nI am clear not only that the charge was technically erroneous, but that it must of necessity be destructive of the defendants' case, unless jurors are in Nova Scotia, of a class by themselves, above impressions from the Bench.\nI have not read any of the numerous affidavits filed on the application to amend the notice. The plans filed therewith as well as the argument here indicate a probability that the course of the river may have been dealt with in the affidavits in such a way as to change or confirm my present impressions. I have purposely abstained from the reading of them, as I think this motion ought to be disposed of upon the case that was presented to the minds of court and jury at the trial. A careful reading of the evidence, of the charge, of the opinion judgments below and of the appellants' factum, and a careful consideration of all that is apparent to me therein, has produced the results I have written and led me to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI am by reason of what has transpired in regard to the last appeal herein to this court in this case, constrained to say, that however much there may be incidentally in what I have said helpful or hurtful to either side in the method of investigation I have followed and I think in part should be followed in such a case, yet I have dealt only with one aspect of this case, and only part of it, and that nothing herein should be presented to a future jury as the decision of this case beyond the result that a direction involving any presumption of law, as presenting at the close of the trial a prima facie case, in favour of such a case as plaintiff at last trial presented is not good law.\nA presumption of law in favour of a junior grant as against a senior grant wherein the respective plans conflict and the senior grant has had the original plan incorporated with the grant as here is perhaps possible in human experience, but hardly likely to arise here.\nThere is another phase of the trial that to my mind is against this appeal:\nThe parties were agreed that if judgment must go for plaintiff in the case, the damages must be assessed by a named referee. All else, however, that would entitle the plaintiffs to judgment must be found by the jury.\nNow all that was left to and got from the jury on 3 this trial were the following questions and answers:\n1. Were any ores mined by the Pictou Charcoal & Iron Company and sold to the Nova Scotia Steel Company taken out south of the south line of Peter Grant's grant dated Nov. 3rd, 1785?\nAns.\u2014Yes.\n2. Is the property described in the agreement between the New Glasgow Coal & Railway Company and James Fraser and others covered by the Finlay Cameron grant in 1785?\nAns.\u2014No.\n3. Has it been proved that the line claimed to run from the elm tree is the north line of the lot granted to Peter Grant in 1785?\nAns.\u2014No.\nI am at a loss to know how a verdict, in an action of trespass, can be entered on such findings, and so followed by judgment that the scope of the referees' duties may be definitely ascertained.\nIn view of the difficulty I have in this regard I asked counsel on argument if any such rule existed in Nova Scotia as in Ontario where the judge can submit parts of the case as he sees fit by question to a jury, and reserve the rest for himself to deal with, and they were agreed that there is not. I, therefore, in absence of such rule or any power, without consent of parties, in a trial judge to deal with anything but the answers on issue raised, would desire before adopting the Pudsey decision and applying it to this case, to consider further if I found it necessary to decide the point. I would not be disposed to think that order 38, rule 10, of the \"Nova Scotia Judicature Act\" could be stretched so far as to cover the omissions here.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. MACLENNAN J.\u2014After considering this case very fully in all its bearings, I think the order for a new trial should stand.\nI do so substantially for the reasons given in the Court of Appeal by Mr. Justice Longley. I say substantially because Mr. Justice Longley has fallen into one or two inaccuracies in his statement of the evidence. He states that the description and survey made by Holmes of the land in 1872 denned it by corner stones, as described in the plaintiff's lease, whereas Holmes himself says that he marked the corner with wooden stakes, and not with stones, and that although he saw stones in 1875, where he had put stakes no stones were there in 1889, the date of the lease, and he thought they had not been there for 12 or 16 years before. The evidence is that when the lease was made there was neither a marked maple tree, nor corner stones, by which the demise could be located. It follows that the only means of doing so was by ascertaining the Peter Grant south line. The description of the lease does not begin where a marked maple tree and marked corner stone had stood at some former time, but at a point where these objects were to be found at the making of the lease.\nNot only was there no corner stone at the supposed point of commencement, at the making of the lease, but there was none at any of the other three corners as described in the lease, and the only part of the description, by which the land could be located, either at the making of the lease, or at any time afterwards, was the Peter Grant line, and the bearings and measurements.\nThe tree and stones might be rejected as false demonstratio, but the Grant line, and the bearings and measurements, would still be sufficient to save the lease from being void. Under these circumstances I think the onus was cast upon the plaintiff to establish the Grant line, and to shew that the workings were south of that.\nI also agree with Mr. Justice Longley in his opinion of the great importance of the grant of 1785 (called by him 1784). and the plan annexed thereto, in their bearing upon the case. I think both plan and grant must be taken to be accurate, and to shew correctly the position, relative to each other, of the several parcels, as well as their respective dimensions and acreage and the bearings of their boundaries.\nIt is inconceivable that a plan, annexed to and forming part of a Crown grant, intended to exhibit sixteen different parcels of land, differing much from each other in length, breadth and area, all fronting upon a river, winding and irregular in its course, and granted to sixteen different persons, should not have been prepared with great care, so as to shew with correctness the relations of the parcels to each other, or in other words, have been drawn to a scale, and that it should not have been the result of a correct survey of the whole tract.\nAnd here I may express surprise that there is no mention in the case, from first to last, of the field notes of that old survey. It may be that it was shewn in the former trials that they had been searched for, and were not found, and that the absence of all reference to them is thus accounted for. There is a memorandum upon the old plan which might perhaps help a search in the Crown Land Department for the field notes of the survey on which it was made. That memorandum is as follows, \"B. 17, page 83,\" and is written upon the Peter Grant parcel, and upon one other.\nBut in the absence of the field notes, which if produced might have shewn an error in the scale, I think the plan must be taken to be correct and that the breadth of the ungranted land between Peter Grant's 300 acre parcel and Finlay Cameron's 100 acre parcel, must be taken to be what is indicated on that plan, by the scale, namely, 26\u00bc chains and not 64.03 chains, as claimed by the plaintiff's lease.\nIt was argued that the grant to John Holmes in 1811 of a parcel 17 chains wide, and a grant to Alexander Grant in 1816 of another parcel 16\u00bc chains wide, making together 33\u00bc chains in width between the Peter Grant and the Finlay Cameron land, was evidence that the old plan of 1785 was wrong, and that there was at least 33\u00bc chains in width included in the plaintiff's lease.\nI do not think, however, that is so. The old grant and plan being earlier must still govern in the absence of evidence of error in the plan.\nThe subsequent grants to Holmes and Alexander Grant of 33\u00bc chains, or any other subsequent solemn act or declaration of the Crown, could have no effect in displacing the grants to Peter Grant and Finlay Cameron respectively, made years before.\nI am also of opinion that, the questions submitted to the jury and answered by them, are insufficient to enable the master to take an account, because both the Peter Grant and the Finlay Cameron lines are left undefined.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the opinions stated by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry C.

Rep. 332) that he was not hired as a business manager but as an expert in the veneer business and as the evidence established that he was not competent he was properly discharged and could not recover.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] affirming by an equal division of the judges a verdict for the plaintiff at the trial. The facts are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and fully stated in the judgments published herewith.\nTeed K.C. and Jonah, for the appellants.\nFred R. Taylor, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action for wrongful dismissal tried before Mr. Justice Landry without a jury in which he found for the plaintiff and awarded him damages in the nature of a quantum meruit for the time he was in defendants' employment before being dismissed, of $375, and for the wrongful dismissal, $625, in all, $1,000.\nThe decision of the trial judge and also of the full court in New Brunswick turned upon the question as to whether or not the plaintiff's dismissal was wrongful.\nThe court was equally divided, Landry J. upholding his own decision as trial judge and Chief Justice Tuck and Hanington J. concurring with him, while Barker, McLeod and Gregory JJ. were of the opinion that in view of the specific knowledge and qualifications required by the defendants of the man they wanted with respect to the special line of veneering goods in the manufacture of which they were engaged as shewn in the letters written by Prescott, one of defendants, to plaintiff, and of the specific representations made by the plaintiff to the defendants in his replies of his knowledge and qualifications on these special matters and on the faith of which he was engaged; and in view of the actual qualifications which a fair test extending for six weeks of employment shewed him to possess, he was rightfully and properly dismissed.\nA careful perusal of the judgment of the learned trial judge has convinced me that he failed to appreciate from the correspondence and evidence the real and substantial purpose for which the plaintiff was engaged and the special knowledge and qualifications required of him and which he represented himself to possess.\nThe learned judge seemed to think that the plaintiff had been engaged as a general manager of defendants' business, and that his general knowledge of the veneer business rendered him competent to discharge the duties of such general manager; and that his special representations of knowledge and ability had not been put to the test.\nI am quite unable to agree in these conclusions. What was wanted by the defendants was not simply a general manager of their business which might not necessarily imply a man able himself to manufacture the veneering they were making and selling, but a practical man who knew himself how to do the work and could teach workmen who did not.\nIn the first letter to defendant Prescott tells him the kind of man wanted. He says:\nWhat we want is a man who is a good veneer maker and knows how to make all kinds of built-up woods that are salable, such as panels, dresser drawer fronts, chair seats, etc. Now, if you are open later on to talk with us, please state your side of the question. We would want you to take full charge of the mill, that is the manufacturing.\nPlaintiff sends a lengthy reply, but the part to which I specially call attention is that which seems to be a direct answer to defendant's demands. He says: I understand fully the making of such articles as you speak of as well as others, with proper machines and proper men to run them, and ordinary intelligent man can be brought to become quite expert.\nThat seems to be quite clear and explicit except, perhaps, the last sentence, which it might be argued does not necessarily imply ability on his part to teach the \"ordinary intelligent man\" to do the necessary work.\nAny doubt upon that point is, however, removed entirely by a subsequent letter from plaintiff in which the following sentences occur:\nThis gave me my ideas of going into the veneer business to learn it thoroughly, and although there is no end to learn in it I feel from all the experience I have had I have mastered the entire principle of it, knowing machines required for various work, what veneer has got to be when completed, etc. To be frank with you I have had in mind sometimes and intended eventually to connect myself with a young veneer business that I might promote the growth and work it up to the best of my ability to a large business. While I have a fine position with the Gale Manufacturing Co. here, I am of course looking into the future somewhat, and would make a change I thought later on might benefit me. I can at all times, I believe, lay my hands on good competent machine men who know their business as also instruct those who do not. I give almost my entire time and attention to all the work done in the Gale factory which is as I previously wrote you one of the largest and best equipped in the United States.\nHere is a man who is told that what the inquirer required was\na man who is a good veneer maker and knows how to make all kinds of built up woods that are salable,\nreplies first by saying that \"he fully understands the making of such articles,\" and follows that up with another letter in which he says:\nI feel from all the experience I have had I have mastered the entire principle of it; and further with reference to the difficulties defendants had stated they had had with respect to getting practical workmen:\nI can at all times, I believe, lay my hands on good competent machine men who know their business as also instruct those who do not (adding), I give almost my entire time and attention to all the work done in the Gale factory which is as I previously wrote you one of the largest and best equipped in the United States.\nHe not only claims to have practical knowledge and to have mastered the entire principle of the manufacture of veneering, but such knowledge as entitled him to instruct ignorant and inexperienced workmen, and in his closing sentence leads defendant to believe that he occupied a practical and important post in one of the largest veneering factories in the United States which he would be loath to give up.\nThis was just the kind of man the defendants required, and after a personal interview the plaintiff was, after Prescott had consulted his partner, engaged by telegram and went to the factory.\nAt this personal interview plaintiff repeated to Prescott the statement he had previously made by letter\nthat he held a good position with the Gale Co., which he could hold and he would be loath to leave it.\nNo denial as to having made this statement is given by plaintiff or apparently any explanation, but as a matter of fact it was utterly untrue as this interview was held on the 15th July, at Portland, and he had left the Gale's factory on the 17th June previously, and was not at the time of the conversation in Gale's employment.\nWith reference to this point I may here say that Gale and his foreman, Anna, were both examined by commission and their evidence shews beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff's representations as to his employment with them and the nature of that employment as also as to his practical knowledge of the business were utterly fallacious and misleading.\nNow with reference to the possession by the plaintiff of the actual practical knowledge and qualifications which it seems to me clearly were required of him and which he as clearly represented he possessed, it is hardly contended that if this was the basis and purpose on which and for which he was employed, that he could succeed.\nOriginally the claim was framed that plaintiff was hired as \"foreman.\" At the trial it was amended so as to read \"superintendent\" and the case proceeded and was argued before us by the respondent upon the assumption that he was so hired, and that this meant a business manager and superintendent and did not include a practical foreman.\nIf he was hired as the latter no possible doubt could exist as to the result.\nHe himself admits in his examination that he had had no practical working knowledge or experience and that such knowledge as he did possess had been picked up by observation solely and the evidence shews clearly that as a practical foreman capable of doing the work himself or instructing ignorant workmen how to do it he was quite incompetent. The question was therefore reduced down to the nature of the employment he was engaged for.\nAs before stated I cannot entertain any doubt upon that point in view of the correspondence between the parties as a result of which he was employed.\nMr. Justice McLeod, who delivered the leading judgment for the appellant below, has with great care and thoroughness analyzed the evidence alike as to plaintiff's representations of qualifications and actual qualifications.\nI fully agree in all he has so fully and so well said in his judgment and have only thought it desirable to go into the questions as fully as I have done because of the great difference of judicial opinion in the court below and the misconception as I thought of the true nature of the hiring.\nAt the argument before us it was suggested by one of my colleagues from the bench that the agreement was one within the Statute of Frauds for a yearly service not to be completed within the year and was not in writing and could not therefore be sued on. The point was not adopted or relied upon by counsel, however, for either appellant or respondent and does not seem to have been mentioned at the trial nor in the court below, and we do not think it open on this appeal.\nIn the result I think the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment entered for the defendants with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment (for plaintiff, now respondent) of Mr. Justice Landry in an action for wrongful dismissal of the respondent and also for work and labour.\nThe action is at common law and under a system of practice and pleading provided by the Supreme Court Act of that province.\nThe Act is as to pleading framed upon the lines of the English Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, and the pleadings in this case are framed just as they would have been in a similar action under the latter Act.\nThe issue of whether or not there has been shewn by the plaintiff a contract that complies with the Statute of Frauds, which is in force in New Brunswick, is distinctly raised by the non-assumpsit plea on record here.\nThe authorities are collected in Mews Digest, Vol. 11 at foot of column 832 and top of column 833, and are too clear for argument, though since the Judicature Act in England the Statute of Frauds must, in cases of intended reliance on its provisions, be there specifically pleaded.\nBefore such introduction the equity rule required the statute to be pleaded, but the common law rules did not.\nApplying this and its consequent application of the Statute of Frauds to the first count of this declaration there is not the necessary note in writing to enable the plaintiff to succeed.\nThe parties had a great deal of correspondence on a variety of matters preliminary to any contract and then Mr. Prescott, one of the defendants (now appellants), met the plaintiff at Portland in the State of Maine, where they talked over many things, relating to a possible agreement, but separated without forming any contract, as Mr. Prescott wished to consult his partner, now co-defendant, then in England.\nThe following telegram and letter are all that appear in the written evidence which in any way can be said to form part of the contract:\nAlbert, N.B., July 29, 1902.\nTo Daniel Adams, care Cushing Adams,\nB. Falls, Vt.\naccept your offer; when can you come?\nAPTUS VENEER CO. West River, N.B., July 29th, 1902.\nDaniel Adams, Esq.:\nDear Friend Adams,\u2014I simply got cable from Mr. Allcroft saying engage Mr. Adams at $3,000 a year. Am sailing early in August. Now I will try and instruct you so you will be able to find us. You will take the train from St. John about 12 o'clock, \"noon,\" on Intercolonial Railway. You can get a ticket direct to Albert. You will change cars at Salisbury Station. While in St. John put up at Hotel Dufferin and mention to the manager or clerk that you are coming up to Albert to see me. They will then see that you get the correct train. It is no use to take any other as you would not connect and we only have one train a day. All the chair seats you want to bring ship to Aptus Veneer Co., Hillsboro, N.B. I can work the customs there better.\nYours,\n(Sgd.) George D. Prescott.\nI do not think it can be successfully contended that these form such an agreement, or memorandum or note thereof, in writing, as to enable the plaintiff, in this case, to recover.\nThe intended agreement, set up in the declaration, was to extend for a year. It was not intended in any way, to begin to operate until some time after this telegram and this letter of the same date were signed. The signature of Allcroft is wanting and if we can find it covered by the signature to the telegram, yet it does not appear to the letter, and if we assumed authority to put it there Mr. Prescott has failed to do so.\nBut if want of signature could by some ingenuity be overcome, then how can it be said that any agreement appears on those documents? The consideration does not appear in the telegram at all. That is fatal to it as an agreement. But what of the letter? What was the man to do? Where is the contract for breach of which suit is brought by the first count? Doubtless it was verbal and that is no use. Indeed, the long argument as to what plaintiff's position was to be, shews not only that it was verbal, but the need of a writing to define it.\nI think the case of Harper v. Davies[2] is clearly in point and that the plaintiff fails in the first count, but is entitled to succeed on the common counts.\nI find since writing the foregoing that the plaintiff's letter of 25th June stated 1st of August as the time he would be free. That and the date in declaration seem as regards the Statute of Frauds conclusive against there being in law a contract.\nSince writing foregoing opinion I have also had the pleasure of reading the judgment of my brother Maclennan.\nI have reconsidered the whole case and read the evidence of those who could alone tell what the contract was, but cannot change the result arrived at above.\nI find that the term \"at $3,000 a year\" used in Prescott's letter of 29th July is repeated in the oral evidence, but nothing more by which to fix any definite term of the length of engagement.\nIt is exceeding doubtful, if this with what the correspondence suggests as possible purpose of the parties, where they have not stated anything definite can within the later authorities be held more than a general hiring, requiring reasonable notice before dismissal, unless for cause. See Green v. Wright[3], and the cases referred to in Bain v. Anderson[4].\nIt was counsel for appellant who answered me in argument as to the statute, and his answer was that there was in the case a mass of correspondence which he had no doubt would be found to comply with the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. I have no doubt his reply was in perfect good faith, and that as he had not been of counsel at the trial, he overlooked the point.\nEven if this might, as my brother Maclennan suggests, be held a waiver by defendant of the statute, I fail to see how defendants' waiver, by failure to argue it, can be a dispensation with the need for a defendant in an action, on the common counts, to shew if he can shew, as a defence thereto, that the work was done under a special contract, which on the authorities must comply with the statute.\nSee the cases of Case v. Barber in Sir T. Raymond's reports[5]; Foquet v. Moor[6], and remarks in Snelling v. Huntingfield[7], at end.\nAppellant's counsel distinctly took the ground that by virtue of the misrepresentation inducing defendants to contract they were entitled to rescind the contract. I assume they were justified in doing so by the evidence as presented in argument here. I infer that what took place was a rescission and that the parties stood then as if the express contract had never existed.\nI think the following expression of the law applicable to a contract obtained by fraud as Mr. Justice Blackburn expressed it in The Queen v. Saddlers' Co.[8], at pp. 420 and 421, applies:\nAnd the reasoning seems to me to amount to laying down the principle that, inasmuch as a man cannot take advantage of his own wrong every act or thing brought about by his fraud or wrong is as against him to be treated as if it never had existed. In this I cannot agree. Fraud, as I think, renders any transaction voidable at the election of the party defrauded; and if when it is avoided nothing had occurred to alter the position of affairs the rights and remedies of the parties are the same as if it had been void from the beginning; but if any alteration has taken place, their rights and remedies are subject to the effect of that alteration.\nSee also Leake[9], and cases cited.\nWhatever goods a defrauded party gets, by such a contract, he must on electing to avoid it return or pay for.\nI am unable to see any distinction between a contract of hiring which well might have coupled with it, the element of a sale, or delivery of goods into it, and any other.\nThis plaintiff assuredly did work worth paying for. He was engaged, as the evidence of Prescott shews, when asked if he could not have got a cheaper man merely to do veneering,\nI don't know. I wanted a man who could make table tops, extension tops, cheffoniers, drawer fronts and other things. I wanted a man that could do the whole thing, and that is the kind of man I thought I was hiring. I wanted a man to take the responsibility off my shoulders. I wanted to go into the office and do the financing.\nA man hired to perform such manifold duties as required and \"to do the whole thing\" in a factory producing a great variety of goods as this was intended for, might do many well, and fail in others, and fail in some of the material parts he had misrepresented himself capable of.\nHe either was called on to perform those duties, he was incapable of, early or he was not. If he was then he ought to have been dismissed long before he was, to entitle the defendants to rescission. I think it ought to be assumed, as he was not dismissed, that he was doing useful work in some of the many other things he was capable of doing, than veneering in which he was not an expert.\nI incline to think there is a great deal in what the trial judge found, as to other motives for discharge. I would, in light of what followed, be inclined to assign amongst such motives this, that as the result of learning from plaintiff the knowledge picked up by him in other factories, the defendants found the undertakings they had in view in hiring him likely to grow too vast for them.\nIn this, if no other regard, the plaintiff is entitled at defendants' hands to consideration.\nIn law, the motives impelling a man to rescind a voidable contract cannot, if otherwise entitled to rescind, avail to refuse him relief.\nI do not think the appellants have succeeded in bringing this case within Harmer v. Cornelius[10], That was the case of a single duty undertaken where clearly the service done if the servant incompetent to do what he represented must necessarily be worthless.\nThe cases where, as in the Panama & South Pacific Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber, Gutta Percha & Telegraph Works Co.[11], and In re The Bodega Company[12], the element of fraud, of necessity permeated and rendered the work done worthless, are also distinguishable.\nI may remark that the ground upon which Tibbs v. Wilkes[13] relied upon by plaintiff, rightly goes, is on the facts here entirely against him. If he could have shewn a monthly hiring, or term of payment his case might have been different.\nBut that and all cases of dismissal for misconduct stand on an entirely different footing from this, which is not one of misconduct, after engagement and duties entered upon. In that class of cases plaintiff has no right to recover for a quantum meruit because the contract stands and has not been fulfilled.\nIn conclusion whilst I agree in dismissing the action raised by the first count, I submit with great respect, the duty devolves on us when we come to the common counts, to give effect to the Statute of Frauds; and if the court below had not assumed a contract for a year existed, I should have said, we must infer there was none, and in any event hold that, the defendants having rescinded, and been justified in rescinding, for misrepresentation, the services must be compensated on a quantum meruit basis.\nI would adopt the basis of the learned trial judge as to the amount to be allowed though with some doubt, but as I am in the result not in accord with the rest of the court, I need not pursue the subject further as to costs, etc.\nI would refer to the case of Stock v. Great Western Railway Co.[14], and the same case in 9 U.C.C.P. 134; Copper Miners Co. v. Fox[15]; Pulbrook v. Lawes[16] and notes to Cutter v. Powell[17], at pages 9'et seq.; Prickett v. Badger[18].\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014Appeal by the defendants in an action for work and labour, and wrongful dismissal. At the trial, without a jury, the plaintiff had a judgment for $1,000, being $375 for his actual services, and $625 damages for wrongful dismissal.\nThe judgment was affirmed on appeal, the judges being equally divided in opinion.\nThe plaintiff's declaration contains two counts, the first upon an agreement for service in the capacity of a foreman, to continue for a year from the 8th of August, 1902, at a yearly salary of $3,000 a year, payable monthly, broken by dismissal before the expiration of the year; and. the second for work as a hired servant.\nThe pleas to the first count are three; namely, first, non assumpsit; 2nd, agreement obtained by the plaintiff by misrepresentation of his skill and ability to perform the duties and service required of him; and thirdly, defendants induced to enter into the agreement by fraud of the plaintiff. The only plea to the second count is never indebted.\nAt the opening of the trial the learned judge permitted the plaintiff to amend the first count by substituting the word \"superintendent\" for \"foreman.\"\nThe pleadings are framed under a procedure similar to the old English common law procedure, under which the plea of non assumpsit has the effect of setting up the Statute of Frauds, which declares that no action may be brought upon a contract not to be performed within a year, unless the contract or some memorandum or note thereof in writing is signed by the party to be charged.\nI think that if the statute had been relied upon at the trial I should have been obliged to hold that no contract or memorandum or note thereof in writing such as declared upon had been signed by the defendants, and that they should succeed upon their plea of non assumpsit.\nBut so far as appears the defendants did not either at the trial or in the court of appeal claim the benefit of the statute.\nIt is optional with a defendant to plead the statute, and if he do not, a recovery may be had although the contract be one not to be performed within a year. If this is so it follows that even if pleaded that defence may be waived.\nI think it was waived in this case in the courts below, and at page 2 of the appellant's factum in this court he says:\nAllcroft cabled his authority to engage the respondent, and he accordingly was engaged on or about the 29th day of July at the yearly wages of $3,000.\nAnd when attention was called to the statute, from the bench, on the argument before us, counsel did not take up the point.\nI, therefore, think the case must be considered irrespective of the statute, and I am of opinion that, having regard to the whole of the evidence both written and oral, the proper conclusion is, as was assumed by the parties themselves, and by the courts below that a contract such as declared on in the first count was made out, although not by signed writing alone.\nThe question then remains whether the defendants have proved the second plea to the plaintiff's first count, and whether the agreement was obtained by the plaintiff from the defendants by misrepresentation of the skill and ability to perform the duties required of him. At the conclusion of the argument I had a strong impression that the defendants had proved that plea, and a subsequent careful consideration of the evidence has confirmed that impression, and I find my views so well expressed by my brother Davies that I forbear repeating them.\nThe existence of the special contract excludes any contract to be implied from the performance of service, and the plaintiff's failure upon the express contract involves failure in his whole case, and it follows that the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs, both here and below.\nDUFF J. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Trueman & Jonah.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont. L.R. 615) affirmed, Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the conviction of the appellant by the police magistrate of Toronto for keeping a common betting house.\nThe appellants were operating as bookmakers at the annual spring meeting of the Ontario Jockey Club, an incorporated association. In a building near the public stand they had a number of booths on castors which they moved about the building or in fine weather on the lawn in front for the purpose of making bets with persons attending the races. Having been convicted of the offence of keeping a common betting house the magistrate at their request, stated a case for the opinion of the Court of Appeal which contained the following:\n\u201c1. That the Ontario Jockey Club is a duly incorporated race association.\n\u201c2. That the common betting house herein referred to was opened, kept and used by the defendants during the actual progress of a race meeting.\n\u201c3. That the defendants kept a betting booth placed in that part of the grounds of the Ontario Jockey Club specially set apart for betting purposes.\n\u201c4. That such betting booth was opened, kept and used by the defendants for the purpose of betting with persons resorting thereto.\n\u201c5. That all the defendants were engaged in conducting the business of the said betting booth, which was leased by the defendant Saunders and under his immediate superintendence.\n\u201c6. That a very large number of bets were made by the defendants against certain horses winning the different races, with persons resorting to said booth.\n\u201c7. That in the enclosure specially set apart by the Ontario Jockey Club for betting purposes as aforesaid there are 36 betting booths, including the one above mentioned, known as two dollar books, which were leased to persons called bookmakers for the purpose of betting as aforesaid.\n\u201c8. That the defendants conducted and managed a betting booth as aforesaid during the whole of the race meeting, and the defendant Saunders paid there- for and for the betting privilege the sum of $100 for each day.\n\u201c9. That the betting booths in question are of the following dimensions, six feet two inches in length, five feet two inches in width, and four feet seven and one-half inches high, and are equipped for the purpose of carrying on betting therein, and are supplied with castors so that in fine weather they may be moved from under the covered part of the betting section of the grounds to a distance of a few feet from the roof.\n\u201c10. The defendants\u2019 position was changed daily from booth to booth, there being a daily drawing for position among the bookmakers, but during each day these defendants occupied the same booth, where they made bets with persons resorting thereto.\n\u201cThe questions submitted are:\n\u201c(a). Am I right in holding that a betting booth as aforesaid falls within the terms of section 197 of the Criminal Code as a house, office or other place?\n\u201c(b). Am I right in holding that the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 204 of the Criminal Code do not apply to the offence of which the defendants are found guilty?\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal having affirmed the conviction the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC.H. Ritchie K.C. and Godfrey for the appellants, contended that a wooden booth such as was used in this case was not an \u201coffice\u201d or \u201cplace\u201d for making and recording bets, under section 197 of the Criminal Code, 1892 (now sec. 227); and if it was it was within the exception of section 204 (now 235), being on the course of an incorporated association citing Tremeear, Cr. Code, pp. 146, 152; Stratford Turf Association v. Fitch[2].\nCartwright K.C., Deputy Attorney-General, for the respondent, referred to Powell v. Kempton Park Racecourse Co.[3]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This case comes before us by way of appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which confirmed a conviction by the police magistrate for the City of Toronto on a case reserved for the opinion of that court.\nA statement of the facts will be found in 12 Ontario Law Reports, page 615.\nThe offence with which the defendants were charged before the police magistrate was, as stated in the reserved case, that of keeping a disorderly house, to wit, a common betting house. Section 197 of the Criminal Code defines a common betting house as\na house, office, or other place opened, kept or used for the purpose of betting between persons resorting thereto and the owner, occupier or keeper thereof.\nSection 198 enacts that every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to one year\u2019s imprisonment who keeps a common betting house as hereinbefore defined.\nIt has been found as a fact by the police magistrate, admitted by all the judges below and not seriously denied by counsel for defendants at the argument here, that the betting booth used by the defend- ants must be held upon the authorities Powell v. Kempton Park Racecourse Co.[4], and Brown v. Patch[5], to be a place within the meaning of section 197. The defendants were convicted by the police magistrate on the ground that to use such a betting booth as was described by the witnesses for the purpose of betting between persons resorting thereto, and the owner, occupier or keeper thereof, is an indictable offence under sections 197 and 198 of the Criminal Code. On a reserved case the conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Meredith J. and Garrow J. dissenting. It was not denied that the defendants used the booths in question for the purpose of betting with all comers, but it was put forward as a defence to the charge that the booths or moveable stands having been erected on the premises of an incorporated racing association to be used for the purpose of making bets during the actual progress of a race meeting brought the defendants within the proviso of section 204.\nSection 204 declares every one guilty of an indictable offence, who:\n(a) Uses or knowingly allows any part of any premises under his control to be used for the purpose of recording or registering any bet or wager or selling any pool; or\n(b) Keeps, exhibits or employs in any part of any premises under his control any device or apparatus for the purpose of recording any bet or wager, etc.; or\n(c) Becomes the custodian or depositor of any money * * * wagered; or\n(d) Records or registers any bet or wager.\nBy sub-section 2 of section 204, it is expressly declared that the provisions of the section shall not extend to bets between individuals or to bets made on the race-course of an incorporated association during the actual progress of a race meeting. These words were added as an amendment when the Criminal Code was enacted in 1892.\nBets between individuals are not illegal at common law and the provisions of this section do not extend to bets between individuals or to bets made on the race course of an incorporated association during the course of a race meeting. I quite agree that the amendment of 1892 was intended to reserve the race courses of incorporated associations as places where bets might be recorded and registered, and any apparatus or structures used for the more conveniently recording such bets or wagers provided this was done during the actual progress of a race meeting, were exempted from the operation of that section.\nBut to use a place for the purpose of recording or registering bets or wagers is something entirely different from using a place for the purpose of betting between persons resorting thereto and the owner or occupier thereof.\nBets between individuals or bets made on the race course of an incorporated association during the actual progress of a race meeting can be recorded in any place used for that purpose, but to keep a place whether within or without the grounds of a racing association for the purpose of betting whether during the progress of a race meeting or not, is an offence under section 197.\nIn my opinion two distinct and separate statutory offences are created by sections 197 and 204, and that which may be invoked successfully as a defence in one case cannot avail in the other. To keep a place for making bets which may be recorded at that place or elsewhere and to keep a place for recording bets wherever made are distinct and separate acts, each of which has been made an offence and each of which is declared to subject the offenders to a different penalty. The exception created by sub-section 2 of section 204 with respect to anything therein, does not apply to those places that are kept for the purpose of betting. I do not understand the rule of construction to be that all the sections of the Code dealing with nuisances are to be read together to see how they can be made to harmonize any more than the sections dealing with offences against the person or against property. Distinct and separate acts are by these sections declared to be common nuisances and the only question to be considered is: Do the facts proved in evidence support the charge as laid in each particular case?\nNo useful purpose can be served by going over the ground already covered by the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Court of Appeal. I quite agree with him that the intention of Parliament, which can only be gathered from the language it has used, was to exempt from the operation of section 204 betting on race courses controlled by incorporated associations during the actual progress of a race, but not to sanction the existence of betting houses on such race courses at such times and under such circumstances. Section 197 makes no exception; at all times and under all circumstances betting houses are prohibited and it is not for this court to introduce into this clause qualifying expressions which the legislature has not chosen to put there.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Davies for his dissent. DAVIES J.\u2014While I concur with the judgment of the Court of Appeal in their answer to the first question of the case submitted, that a betting booth such as that described in the case falls within the terms of section 197 of the Criminal Code as \u201ca house, office, room or other place,\u201d I am not able to concur with the majority of that court in holding that the provisions of sub-section 2 of section 204 do not apply to the offences of which the defendants were found guilty so as under the circumstances and conditions to exempt them from liability to conviction.\nMr. Justice Osler concurred with the majority on this point considering himself bound by previous decisions of the same court, but without, as he himself says, being called upon to consider whether these decisions were sound or not. Apart from him the court was equally divided.\nI concur in the conclusions reached by Garrow and Meredith JJ. that the conviction should be quashed on the ground that the provisions of sub-section 2 of section 204 must be read as applying to the offence of which the defendants were convicted.\nI agree with Garrow J. when he says:\nThe proper construction in a word is in my opinion to hold that sections 197-198 have no application to the case of betting carried on upon the race-course of an incorporated association during the actual progress of a race meeting whether or not such betting takes place within or without doors or in any particular \u201chouse, office, room or other place,\u201d so long as it is within the boundaries of the race course and so long as the betting is confined to the races then in progress upon that race course.\nThe history of the two sections 197 and 198 and of section 204 of the Criminal Code, so far as it seems desirable to know it for the purposes of this argument, is that section 204 formed a part of the criminal law for years before 1892 when the Code was enacted but without the latter words of the exempting subsection on which this controversy turns, namely, betting when \u201cmade on the race course of an incorporated association during the actual progress of a race meeting.\u201d These words were added to section 204 at the time the Code was enacted and sections 197 and 198 were also then for the first time introduced into our criminal law.\nThese two new sections 197 and 198 define a common betting house and declare it to be illegal and a disorderly house.\nIt is a defined place\nopened, kept or used for the purpose of betting between persons resorting thereto and the owner, occupier or keeper, or opened, kept or used for the purpose of any money being received or on behalf of any such person as and for the consideration of any bet on any race, etc.\nThe object and purpose of Parliament in enacting the several sections of the Criminal Code under review was no doubt the suppression of betting and poolselling between professional bookmakers and poolsellers and their patrons. To that end sections 197 and 198 defining and penalizing the keeping of a common betting house for the purpose of betting or for the purpose of receiving any money by the keeper of such house for or in connection with any bet were no doubt introduced into the Code when it was passed in 1892. To more effectually insure the carrying out of the same objects section 204 of the then criminal law was retained penalizing the using of any part of any premises under his control by any one for the purpose of recording any bet or wager or for the purpose of becoming the custodian or depositary of any money staked or wagered upon the result of any election, race or trial of skill or endurance, but it was so retained with an additional and important exemption added. That exemption included three specific kinds of betting even when done by the class of persons struck at in the penalizing parts of the section. First, betting when the bet or stake was payable to the winner of any race or game, or to the owner of any horse engaged in a lawful race, and not to the bookmaker or poolseller; secondly, betting between individuals. These still remained perfectly lawful. So long as the person struck at (the poolseller or bookmaker using a defined place to carry on his calling) was not a party to the bet or a possible beneficiary of the bet, so long as the practices by or through which such person carried on his calling which Parliament aimed to suppress were not involved, neither the bet or anything incidental to it was prohibited; and, thirdly, introduced for the first time as an exemption, betting\nmade on the race course of an incorporated association during the actual operation of a race meeting.\nThis latter exemption covered bookmakers as well as other individuals and left betting with bookmakers and poolsellers using premises under their control to record bets and to receive stakes, legal, when carried on within the limitations specified in the exempting words.\nBut if the substantive act of using part of any premises to receive deposits or stakes of a bet as well as to record such bet or any number of such single bets were thus permitted when done at the special places, times and on the races specified in the exemption, how can it be contended successfully that any other necessary or ordinary incident or act in the carrying on of the main substantive thing permitted such as holding himself out at a particular place for the purpose of doing the act, continued to be an offence?\nIt must be conceded that the using of a part of the race premises such as a betting booth or house for the purpose of recording bets and there receiving stakes and deposits or the money representing the bets upon the result of any race when the betting and recording and money received were all done and happened on the race course of an incorporated association during the actual progress of a race meeting and with reference alone to one of the races at that meeting was permitted by sub-section 2 of section 204. Now what are these limited acts as to time, place and event so permitted and not prohibited but the keeping of a common betting house, on the race-course but exclusively for the races being run there.\nI think for the purpose of construing the exemption clause the three sections must be read together, and that so far as that exemption clause extends to sanction or allow any act which otherwise would be illegal it must be read as covering that act even if the act is made an offence by both sections.\nIn my opinion the special privilege or permission conceded by the sub-section to carry on betting in a special place at a special time and with reference to special races, necessarily permitted all acts ordinarily essential to the carrying out of the substantial purpose.\nIf the amendment made to the exempting sub-section contemporaneously with the introduction of the new sections 197 and 198 penalizing the common betting house did not operate to exempt betting made and recorded at such house or place when confined within the limitations expressed in the amendment then it appears to me to be quite meaningless because all betting made between individuals had already been exempted as also all bets which were payable to the owner of the horse racing. The only effect of the amendment could be to extend the sanction of the clause to betting at the common betting house made between the keeper of the house and outside parties when erected on the race grounds and which betting was confined within the special limitations expressed in the amendment.\nKeeping a house or place for the purpose of betting between persons who resort thither to bet with the keeper of such house or place is an indictable offence within section 197 of the Code, but it is not such an offence when it is kept on the grounds of an incorporated race association and the sole and exclusive purpose for which it is kept is for the special classes of betting defined and limited by the sub-section of 204.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and answer the first question of the case submitted in the affirmative and the second in the negative.\nIDINGTON, MACLENNAN and DUFF JJ. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 12 Ont.

Idington and Maclennan J. dissenting.\nApplication to His Lordship Mr. Justice Duff in Chambers for a writ of habeas corpus and referred by him to the court.\nThe application for the writ was made on behalf of Placide Richard, who was confined in the common gaol at Dorchester, N.B., on commitment under a conviction for an offence against Part II. of The Canada Temperance Act. The ground on which his discharge was claimed was that for a first offence against the Act a fine of $200 had been imposed while the penalty authorized by the Act was \"not less than $50\" which, it was contended, meant neither more nor less than $50. Or if the magistrate had authority to impose a greater penalty than $50 he could not go beyond $100, the minimum for a second offence.\nJ. A. Ritchie, who opposed the application, took the preliminary objection that a judge only could grant a writ of habeas corpus. Mr, Justice Duff had no power to refer the case and the court could not deal with it.\nMasters K.C. and C. Lionel Hanington were heard contra.\nThe court took time to consider the objection and it was overruled. The following opinions were presented on the point.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the course adopted by Mr. Justice Duff under the circumstances explained in his reasons for judgment and of which course the majority of the court fully approves, there is ample authority in the case of In re Sproule[1].\nIt is quite impossible to add anything of value to the very learned discussion of the whole subject in that case by three such eminent lawyers as Ritchie C.J., Strong C.J., and Taschereau C.J.\nIn Mr. Justice Duff's conclusions on the merits, we also concur and for his reasons.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Mr. Justice Duff, to whom an application for habeas corpus was made by the petitioner under section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" has referred\n[Page 396[\nthe same to the full court. Mr. Ritchie, counsel for the City of Moncton, New Brunswick, from which province the case comes, raised objection that we have no jurisdiction to hear the application and that the jurisdiction is limited to the judge individually. He admits that a prisoner could go before every judge separately, but he cannot go to the full court and get the opinion of all the judges as forming the court. Of course, no one can dispute that this court is a statutory one, but it has never been disputed that it is a superior court and as such has jurisdiction over every proceeding in the court whether sitting as such or in chambers. This rule is not new; it was fully discussed In re Sproule[2] by Ritchie C.J., Strong and Taschereau JJ., Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting.\nChief Justice Ritchie said:\nThat this is a matter pertaining to the court, and one with which it can deal, and not a jurisdiction conferred on a judge of the court outside of and independent of the court, and that the judge has no independent jurisdiction unconnected therewith, is, I think, very obvious from the fact that he can only act as a judge of this court through the instrumentality of the writ of this court, obedience to which could not be enforced by authority of the judge but by the court, which alone could issue an attachment for contempt of the court in not obeying its process, the contempt being contempt of the process of the court, not of the fiat of the judge authorizing its issue, and therefore the impossibility of enforcing obedience to the process of the court without the assistance of the court, seems to me to prove, conclusively, that the matter is within the jurisdiction of the court.\nAnd further on, at page 181, the learned Chief Justice said:\nThe writ of habeas corpus is not the writ of a judge on whose flat it issues. It is a high prerogative writ which issues out of the Queen's superior courts, and, in my opinion, is necessarily subject to the control of those courts, not necessarily by way of appeal, but by virtue of the power possessed by the court over the process of the court. Mr. Justice Strong and Mr. Justice Taschereau expressed their opinion in the same sense. Therefore if a judge of this court had jurisdiction to hear the application, I am of the opinion that the full court had also.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Duff on the merits.\nDAVIES J. concurred.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014In pursuance of the powers given by the \"Supreme Court Act\" respecting habeas corpus, my brother, Mr. Justice Duff, made an order upon the keeper of a common goal in Westmoreland, in New Brunswick, to return Placide Richard, with cause of his detention, if any, to him, the Honourable Mr. Justice Duff, in his chambers, at Ottawa, and by the order fixed Saturday, the 16th of March instant at said chambers, for hearing the application for the discharge of said prisoner.\nThat order has been returned and fully heard before the learned judge who has referred the matter of the disposal thereof to the full court. Objection has been taken, upon the opening of the motion before us, to our right to take up such reference and hear the motion.\nI understand that a majority of the court, after consideration, have come to the conclusion that the objection should be overruled.\nI am unable to agree with the majority of the court in regard either to the power to hear this motion, or the expediency of adopting such a practice as enlarging into the full court any motion which the statute gives a judge in chambers power to hear and determine, but fails to provide for being enlarged into the full court.\nAssuming for a moment that, in the absence of any express prohibition, such a course were open to us, I think, with the greatest submission and respect, that its adoption would be, to say the least, highly inexpedient.\nSection 83 of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" section 44, sub-section 3 of the \"Canadian Railway Act,\" and sections 104 and 106 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" each confer power upon a single judge to give leave to appeal to this court.\nOther similar powers are given to a single judge of this court.\nI know not where, if we establish in this case a precedent for doing so, we can stop the practice of hearing chamber motions by the full court.\nThose concerned in, and pressing for or opposing such motions, most of which, arising under such statutes as I refer to, are quite as important as this one, will be very astute in suggesting and magnifying the importance of the point to be decided.\nWe held in the case of Williams v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3], that no appeal would lie to us from a refusal of a single judge to give leave to appeal. This was upheld in the Privy Council.\nBut if we can hear this motion by way of acting in an advisory capacity, and we can hear it in no other way, why not in the same way hear any other?\nIf permissible, we might thus overcome the want of an appeal from the single judge in the cases I have enumerated.\nIt might be urged, moreover, that as there was no appeal, it would improve matters to have the judge, who for the time being might be holding chambers, aided in this way.\nIn the case now in hand, I am happy to think that my brother Duff is, if I might be permitted to say so, quite able to do without the light to be got from the proposed argument before the full court. Moreover, the prisoner is entitled to his judgment in the matter.\nAgain there is an appeal given by the statute to the court from the learned judge's judgment, in case he refuses the writ or remands the prisoner.\nThere is much more reason for an anticipatory bearing of the subject matter (of what might well be subject for an appeal), where no appeal exists, than in the case where such relief can be given.\nThe matter may be summed up in a few words; the statute creating this court did not give, nor has any amendment thereto given, us the power, either directly or indirectly, to adopt the proceeding about to be entered on. Moreover, such a thing has never been done before, except where the statute expressly empowered the court to make the order.\nThe statute has, in some cases where Parliament chose to distinguish, given the power either to judge or court, as the case might be.\nIt is said, however, that the case of Re Sproule[4] is to be relied on as establishing a precedent in this court supporting the practice about to be adopted.\nI am with due respect, utterly unable to comprehend how. I repeat what has been so often said that to constitute the decision in a case a precedent to bind, there must have been something decided thereby necessary to the determination of the case or matter under consideration, and that must be something properly under consideration.\nAll beyond is obiter dicta.\nIf I understand Re Sproule[5] in light of that, all it did decide and all it stands for, as good law, is that this court has jurisdiction to set aside an order made, or quash a writ improvidently granted, by one of the judges thereof, and that the order was so made and writ so issued when going beyond what was involved in\nan inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada\nas shewn by the facts of that case.\nI have not had time to read since this motion was launched the ninety pages of the report of Re Sproule.\nI see, however, that the motion there was to quash and nothing more decided on such motion than I have stated. I agree therewith. I do not think it at all applicable to this case. We have not heard of anything like it in this case. And I have no doubt we will not in this case, hear of anything like it.\nThe decision was given on a substantive motion to quash.\nHow can a decision, granting a motion to quash, bind this court to sit in full court, to hear a motion for discharge?\nIf there are opinions expressed in the judgments in that case that go the length some of the head notes of the report suggest, I beg respectfully to differ.\nBut I see nothing even there to warrant our sitting to consider the motion now pending. Section 62 now in question of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is as follows:\nEvery judge of the court shall except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n2. If the judge refuses the writ or remands the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.\nIt, as plainly as language can express it, gives to the judges of this court, singly, and only to each of them so sitting singly, and not to the court\nconcurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several pro-evinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.\nBut for the second sub-section of the clause it might be fairly arguable, having regard to the past history of the writ of habeas corpus, that its return might be made to the court though issued by a single judge.\nThe second sub-section giving an appeal seems to destroy any such implication as within the purview of this section.\nWith every respect for the opinions that may have led to the head-notes I have referred to, I submit that in trying to find the limits of the jurisdiction of this court, which is only the creature of a statute, we ought to keep to the plain meaning when we find it so clearly written as expressed above.\nIt confides to the judge the right to issue the writ, and to determine the result of its issue. If he cannot grant it or release the prisoner he says so, and then appeal clearly lies. If appeal is not given in case of discharge any opinions given by us in relation thereto would be obiter dicta and can receive no consideration, for we would be deciding nothing.\nIn the past history of the writ of habeas corpus we find it a moot point whether at common law it could have been issued by a judge in chambers; that it always could have been issued by the court and that when, in the troublous times of Charles L, its issue with greater certainty and expedition was found necessary the statute 16 Car. I. ch. 10, was enacted to give the writ, in cases named, to bring the body of any person restrained before the Court of King's Bench or Common Pleas.\nIt was found necessary to amend this and 31 Car. II. ch. 2, gave power where the commitment was not for treason or felony, plainly and specially expressed in the warrant of commitment, that the prisoner should be brought before the Lord. Chancellor, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal or the judges or barons of the court from which the writ should issue or such other person or persons before whom the writ should be made returnable.\nSection 3 of that Act made it clear that any of these judges could in the cases specified hear the motion in vacation as well as in term.\nI need not follow the next important Act of 56 Geo. III. ch. 100, expanding the remedies of such writ, or later amendments of the law, relative to habeas corpus.\nThis outline of legislation is referred to here to indicate how differently these Acts present the legal functions of judge and court from that which section 62 of our Act presents the duties to be done by each of us and this court, and how when the former are studied historically the cases shew strict adherence to the statutes in giving effect to them. It is most instructive to trace the history of the legislation on the subject of habeas corpus. Its development shews how careful the courts and judges have been, not to arrogate to themselves any power as inherent in any one beyond that expressly given by statute, or coming down as part of the common law.\nEvery step taken beyond the common law has been rested upon statute. And it seems to me, when we are asked to go beyond that which the statute expressly empowers us in this statutory court, we are invited to err.\nThere seems to be abundant reason for constituting and separating the respective powers and duties of judge and court in the way that section 62 has done.\nThe moot point of the common law right of a judge in vacation to grant the writ was finally settled by the Canadian prisoner's case reported in 9 A. & E. 731.\nThe writ which, on the facts there and the nature of the charge, had to rest on the common law had been issued in vacation. The return was not heard until term, and then only by consent of counsel as the report indicates; and after an exhaustive argument by Sir John Campbell, then Attorney-General, in support of the objection that, at common law a judge could not in vacation direct the issue of the writ, the court decided that the practice had always been that a judge could grant the writ in vacation returnable before himself or the court.\nNo two of the provinces present, by legislation, identically the same procedure.\nThe statute giving the judges of New Brunswick or court power is chapter 133 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick (1903). The judge is entrusted with nearly all the duties created by this Act.\nIn certain cases, specified and provided for, he can refer to the court. None of these touch what is being done here. A consideration of this Act, however, shews why the jurisdiction given by section 62 above quoted confers on every judge of this court concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces.\nIn Ontario the judge can make the writ returnable to the Divisional Court. I refer to this to shew that jurisdiction given a judge or court differs in each case.\nI assume that the word \"concurrent\" in section 62 must be interpreted distributively; and that this case coming from New Brunswick must be governed by the Act of New Brunswick referred to. The Act in New Brunswick must be that to which we must look for the basis of the concurrent power; a power, however, limited as section 62 expresses.\nIt seems clear to me that the motion should not be heard.\nHaving at the close of the argument on the preliminary objection had the opportunity of considering the same and come to this conclusion, I took no part in the hearing on the merits and take no part in the decision thereof.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother Idington, and having heard the argument on the merits I am of opinion that the conviction was right.\nMr. Ritchie also raised the objection that the applicant was not committed \"in a criminal case,\" which it had to be to empower the judge to issue the writ. The court did not wish to hear counsel for the applicant as to this.\nThe argument then proceeded on the merits.\nMasters K.C. and Hanington, in support of the application. The expression \"not less than 50\" as the penalty for a first offence means \"$50 and no less\" as said by Armour C. J., and held by the court in Reg. v. Smith[6]. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Reg. v. Porter[7] has held the same, and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick also in Reg. v. Rose[8]. In Stimpson v. Pond[9] Judge Curtis, an associate judge of the United States Supreme Court, expressed the same view of a similar expression.\nIf the magistrate has jurisdiction to impose a greater penalty than $50 his discretion must be exercised reasonably and the statute has fixed the limit at the penalty for a second offence, namely, $100. See Reg. v. Smith (1), per Falconbridge J.\nJ. A. Ritchie, contra. The words \"not less than $50\" should be construed according to their grammatical sense, which is, $50 or more and the excess is in the discretion of the magistrate. See Reg. v. Cameron[10].\nDUFF J.\u2014Application under section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" for habeas corpus to procure the discharge from custody of a prisoner convicted of an offence under section 100 of \"Canada Temperance Act,\" as amended by section 1 of 4 Edw. VII. ch. 41. The warrant under which the prisoner is held recites that he was convicted at Moncton, N.B., of the offence of unlawfully keeping intoxicating liquors for sale contrary to the provisions of Part II. of the \"Canada Temperance Act,\" for which offence he was condemned to pay a fine of $200 and costs; and that having made default in payment of these sums he was committed to the common gaol of the County of Westmoreland for one month unless they should in the meantime be paid.\nThe argument on the return of the order nisi disclosing a conflict of judicial opinion respecting the construction to be put upon the enactment under which the prisoner was convicted\u2014which had been construed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in one sense and by a Divisional Court in Ontario in the opposite sense\u2014it seemed in order to set the question at rest desirable to, and I accordingly did, refer the application to the court.\nOn the point raised respecting the jurisdiction of the court to hear and adjudicate upon the application, I agree with the views expressed by the Chief Justice and Girouard J.\nTwo questions arise: First, does section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" confer in such a case jurisdiction in habeas corpus? In other words, are the proceedings leading to a conviction for such an offence within the meaning of the words \"criminal case\" used in that section?\nThis question seems to be now presented for the first time. In Ex parte McDonald[11] an application for an order directing the issue of a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a prisoner convicted under the same enactment, was heard before Girouard J. and disposed of on its merits. No objection to the jurisdiction was taken and no opinion was expressed upon the point before us. But the point I think is concluded by the language of the Judicial Committee in Bussel v. The Queen[12], at page 838. Sir Montague Smith, referring to the enactment in question, there says:\nNext, their Lordships cannot think that the Temperance Act in question properly belongs to the class of subjects \"property and Civil Rights.\" It has in its legal aspect an obvious and close simillarity to laws which place restrictions on the sale or custody of poisonous drugs, or of dangerously explosive substances. These things as well as intoxicating liquors can, of course, be held as property, but a law placing restrictions on their sale, custody or removal, on the ground that the free sale or use of them is dangerous to public safety, and making it a criminal offence punishable by fine or imprisonment to violate these restrictions, cannot properly be deemed a law in relation to property in the sense in which those words are used in the 92nd section. What Parliament is dealing with in legislation of this kind is not a matter in relation to property and its rights, but one relating to public order and safety. That is the primary matter dealt with, and though incidentally the free use of things in which men may have property is interfered with, that incidental interference does not alter the character of the law. Upon the same consideration the Act in question cannot be regarded as legislation in relation to civil rights. In however large a sense these words are used, it could not have been intended to prevent the Parliament of Canada from declaring and enacting certain uses of property, and certain acts in relation to property, to be criminal and wrongful. Laws which make it a criminal offence for a man wilfully to set fire to his own house on the ground that such an act endangers the public safety, or to overwork his horse on the ground of cruelty to the animal, though affecting in some sense property and the right of a man to do as he pleases with his own, cannot properly be regarded as legislation in relation to property or to civil rights.\nTheir Lordships, it is true, abstain from deciding the question whether the competence of Parliament to pass the enactment can be supported on the. ground that it was passed in exercise of the exclusive power to legislate respecting the criminal law conferred by section 91 of the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" But it seems to me that there is no good ground for holding that\u2014where Parliament under its power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada declares in the interests of public order that certain acts shall be offences punishable by fine or imprisonment\u2014the proceedings by which such laws are enforced are any the less proceedings in a \"criminal case\" because in enacting them Parliament did not formally profess to be dealing with the criminal law.\nThe second question is whether in imposing a fine of $200 the convicting magistrate has exceeded the powers conferred by the statute under the authority of which he acted. The material provision (section 100, amended as above mentioned) is as follows:\n100. Every one who, by himself, his clerk, servant or agent, exposes or keeps for sale, or directly or indirectly, on any pretence or by any device, sells or barters, or in consideration of the purchase of any other property, gives to any other person any intoxicating liquor, in violation of the second part of this Act, shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a penalty for the first offence of not less than fifty dollars, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month, with or without hard labour, and for a second offence to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars, or imprisonment for two months, with or without hard labour, and for the third and every subsequent offence, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four months, with or without hard labour.\nThe point to be determined is whether or not this section in conferring the power to impose a penalty of \"not less than $50,\" authorizes the imposition of a penalty greater than $50. I have come to the conclusion that it does not.\nThe construction of the language is not unattended with difficulty. But on the whole, the reasoning of Armour C.J. in Beg. v. Smith[13], convinces me that this interpretation\u2014which was adopted by the majority of the court in that case\u2014does no violence to the words used, and is that most consonant with the probable intention of Parliament as one may gather it from the scope and purpose of the enactment as a whole.\nThe power to impose fines unlimited in amount in respect of the offences created by this Act is clearly a power which, not being conferred expressly, can only be held to be conferred at all if plainly and necessarily implied in the language used. There is, I think, in the section quoted, no such plain and necessary implication. There is nothing in the section or, I think, in the Act as a whole, which would justify us in imputing to the words referred to any meaning other than that which they literally convey, namely, that the penalty imposed shall not be less than the sum mentioned. One may concede that the use of the phrase \"not less than $50\" is an unhappy way of providing for a penalty of $50 precisely; but beyond that, except in the case of a second offence, no power is given to the magistrate by the terms of the statute; and one cannot presume an intention to authorize the magistrate to inflict any penalty he pleases. The point is compactly put by Curtis J. in Stimpson v. Pond[14] in a passage cited by Armour C.J., which I quote:\nPower to inflict a particular penalty must be conferred by Congress in such terms as will bear a strict construction. The only power expressly given by this Act is to impose a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars. This power may be exhausted by imposing a penalty of just one hundred dollars. The terms of the Act do not authorize the infliction of a penalty greater than one hundred dollars. Is there a safe implication that authority to inflict a greater penalty was intended to be conferred? The objections to this seem to me too strong to be overcome. In the first place, mere implication can hardly ever be safe ground on which to rest a penalty and when penalties of unlimited magnitude are the subjects of the implication, the danger of making it, and the improbability of the implication, are proportionately increased.\nApplication granted.\n[1] 12 Can.

City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co. (38 Can. S.C.R. 239) followed.\nHeld, per Davies J.\u2014The resolution exempting any company and not any property of a company was too indefinite and uncertain to be the basis for a claim for exemption.\nIn 1893 a woollen mill was established in Woodstock by the Woodstock Woollen Mills Co., and operated for some years without taxation. In 1899 the mill was sold under execution and two months later the Carleton Woollen Co., (appellants) were incorporated and acquired the said mill from the purchaser at the sheriff's sale and have operated it since.\nHeld; that the appellants could not by so acquiring the mill which had been exempted be said to have \"established a woollen mill\" without shewing that when it was acquired it had ceased to exist as such which they had not done. Judgment appealed from, affirming that of Barker J. at the hearing (3 N.B. Eq. 138) affirmed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] affirming the judgment of the judge in equity[2] who allowed a demurrer to the plaintiffs' bill.\nAn Act of the Legislature of New Brunswick, 36 Vict. ch. 81, sec. 1, authorized the council of the Town of Woodstock to exempt the property of manufacturing enterprises from taxation for ten years. The council passed a resolution providing that any company establishing a woollen mill in the town would be so exempt. The Woodstock Woollen Mills Co. established a mill and operated it without taxation until they got into financial difficulties when it was sold under execution and purchased by one White. Shortly after this the appellant company was incorporated and acquired the mill and machinery which they have operated ever since. For three years the company was not taxed but in 1902 and the two years following they were. In 1904 executions were issued for the taxes of 1902 and 1903 and a quantity of the company's goods were seized to satisfy the same. The company then filed a bill in equity to restrain the town from selling said goods to which the latter demurred. On argument of the demurrer it was allowed on the ground, not taken by defendants, that the resolution for exemption passed to the council discriminated between companies establishing a woollen mill and individuals doing the same. The plaintiffs bill was, therefore, dismissed. This judgment was affirmed by the full court and the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Carvell for the appellants. It was not necessary to state in the bill the authority under which the town council passed the resolution of exemption as all Acts of New Brunswick are by law public acts of which judges must take judicial notice without being specially pleaded. O.S.N.B. (1903) ch. 1, sec. 6; Henderson v. The Mayor of St. John[3]; The King v. City of St. John[4]; Kiely v. Kiely[5].\nThe appellants either established a woollen mill or continued the old one established in the spring of 1893. If they established the mill they were entitled to the exemption for ten years. If they simply continued the old one, they were entitled to the exemption until and including the year 1903 which would include the taxes for the years for which the goods were seized.\nThe resolution creating the exemption was within authority under the Act above referred to. The statute is stronger than any of the Ontario statutes referred to by Barker J. in his judgment and specifically states that the council may from time to time, at their discretion, give encouragement to any manufacturing enterprises by exempting their property from taxation by resolution. The council is not prevented from extending the exemption to any other person or company and if they consider the existing resolution too narrow, they can rescind it at any time. Up to the present time it has not done so.\nThe expression \"any company\" in the resolution should be construed to mean and include \"person\" C.S.N.B. (1877) ch. 118, sec. 1 (31).\nIt might be open to a rival manufacturer or other tax-payer to attack the validity of this resolution on the grounds set forth by Barker J. in his judgment and followed by the court appealed from, but not to the municipality itself. The respondent is estopped from denying that the appellants are entitled to the exemption claimed, when relying upon the existence of the resolution; see 11 Am. & Eng. Encyl. (2 ed.) page 43. Carr v. London and Northwestern Railway Co.[6]; Pickard v. Sears[7]; Freeman v. Cooke[8]; Peoples Bank of Halifax v. Estey[9].\nVince and Hartley for the respondent. The Act. authorizes the council to exempt the property of manufacturing enterprises for a period not exceeding ten years, but the resolution purports to give exemption for ten years to any company establishing a woollen mill, and thus unfairly discriminated between companies and individuals, between woollen enterprises already established and companies which might afterwards establish such enterprises. The council exceeded its authority in exempting any company establishing a woollen mill when it was authorized by the Act to exempt only the property of manufacturing enterprises used in the actual prosecution of any such enterprise.\nAll municipal taxation must be imposed equally and uniformly and those who claim exemption must accept the onus of shewing clearly that they are entitled to it. The exemption should be denied unless it is so clearly granted as to be free from fair doubt. Such statutes must foe construed most strongly against those claiming the exemption. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, (3 ed.) sec. 776; Jonas v. Gilbert[10] per Ritchie C.J.; Pirie v. Town of Dundas[11]; Reg. v. Pipe[12]; Re Nash and McCracken[13]; Reg. v. Johnson[14] at page 556; People's Milling Co. v. Meaford[15]; Rossi v. Edinburgh Corporation[16]; City Toronto v. Virgo[17].\nThe appellants have not alleged positively and with precision what is essential to their rights and within their knowledge. Trites v. Humphrey[18] at page 24; Macnamara v. Sweetman[19]; Woodward v. Cotton[20]; 1 Daniels' Chan. Prac. (5 ed.) 569; Arcot v. East India Co.[21]; Carnatic v. East India Co.[22]; Bailey v. Birkenhead L. & C. Junction Ry. Co.[23]; Foss v. Harbottle[24]. The bill is not sufficient; it does not set up the Act by authority of which the claim under the resolution was made.\nThe allegations in the appellants' bill do not shew that they did establish a woollen mill in the town and the facts disclosed shew that their business was conducted in the same building with the same plant and machinery and with part of the same manufactured and unmanufactured goods as had been owned and used by the Woodstock Woollen Mills Co. These facts are not sufficient to support the contention that the appellants established a woollen mill in the town. 1 Bouvier (ed. 1897) 691. Hornsey Local Board v. Monarch Investment Building Society[25]; Hard-castle on Statutes 77. If the construction contended for by the appellants is to prevail, all that need be done by a company enjoying the exemption is, to reorganize or sell out every nine or ten years and so enjoy perpetual exemption.\nFor definition of \"company\" see Smith v. Anderson[26]. As to estoppel see Vestry of St. Mary, Islington v. Hornsey Urban District Council[27] at page 705. As to loss of exemption on sale of property see Poison v. Town of Owen Sound[28]; Morgan v. State of Louisdnna[29]. The exemption must be unmistakable. Erie Ry. Co. v. State of Pennsylvania[30] at page 498; 1 Cooley on Taxation (3 ed.) pp. 343, 356-361.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The appellants claimed exemption from taxation by the Town of Woodstock for a period of ten years under a resolution passed by the Town Council of that town in the year 1892, as follows:\nThat any company establishing a woollen mill in the Town of Woodstock be exempted from taxation for a period of ten years.\nThe authority under which the council assumed to act was a proviso added to sec. 1 of 36 Vict. ch. 81 [N.B.] (1873). This section which relates to the method of assessment within the town, contained the following: Provided also that the council may from time to time at their discretion give encouragement to manufacturing enterprises within said town by exempting the property thereof from taxation for a period of not more than ten years by a resolution declaring such exemption.\nThe trial judge held on a demurrer to the plaintiff's bill that the resolution under which the plaintiffs claimed exemption was bad because it violated the fundamental principle that municipalities in levying taxation or exempting property therefrom cannot discriminate between the same classes of tax payers within the municipality unless the legislative authority to do so is clear and explicit.\nWe had occasion very recently to consider this question in the cases of The City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co. and The Hamilton Brewery Association[31], and reached the same conclusion on reasoning which we need not now repeat.\nI agree that the principle prohibiting discrimination of the character referred to has been violated in the resolution under which the plaintiffs claim exemption and for that reason the resolution cannot be invoked to support plaintiff's contention.\nIt might be possible under legislation and resolution as crude and hard to construe as those under consideration for persons or companies to claim exemption from taxation, but I think the difficulties are very great and amending legislation is required to render the object in view effective.\nThe resolution professes to exempt \"companies\" establishing woollen mills in Woodstock from taxation. It does not extend to or include persons or individuals establishing such mills as distinct from companies. I do not know whether it means that the \"companies\" exempted were to be exempt from all taxation of every kind for the ten years whether on real estate, personal property, or income, and irrespective of the purposes for which the property was held or used. I suppose the idea may have been to exempt real estate actually used for manufacturing purposes only and not to include other real estate which might be owned by the company but used for workmen's houses or purposes of speculation. As a fact the resolution does not exempt any property per se but the company itself, and under that resolution, if held to be good and effective, a court has not the means of defining or deciding what particular property the company owned was exempt from taxation or what particular property remained liable. The statute under which the council professed to act did not authorize them to exempt any special class of citizens from taxation. What it did authorize was the exemption of the property (real and personal, I assume) of manufacturing enterprises by whomsoever carried on for a limited period. It was the property not the person or the company that was authorized to be exempted and the resolution to be effective under that statute or proviso must in some way have defined or described or identified the property intended to be exempted. It could not be successfully contended that the exempted property whatever it was could be ascertained or determined on by the assessors. They had no discretion in the matter and no means of determining on the property exempted. The only body in whom a discretion was vested and on the proper exercise of which alone the exemption could be created was the Town Council. That discretion was bound to be exercised in such a way as to avoid unfair discrimination between manufacturers at least of the same class, and I think also with sufficient certainty to enable the property exempted to be ascertained by the assessors and others upon whom the duty of levying and collecting the assessments fell.\nIn my judgment the resolution is quite inoperative and ineffective on these essential points, and is too indefinite and uncertain to found an exemption upon.\nIt is not necessary for me to express any opinion on the other questions argued as to whether this company did as a fact establish a woolen mill within the meaning of the proviso relating to exemptions.\nI think for the reasons given the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick unanimously upholding the judgment of Mr. Justice Barker in finding that the alleged resolution of respondents' council improperly discriminates and is therefore void and gives no such exemption from taxation as appellants claim.\nI agree in that finding and therefore think the appeal must fail.\nTo prevent misapprehension, I may observe that the statute empowering the respondents to exempt from taxation in certain cases expressly authorizes the exercise of the power in question here by resolution of respondents' council, instead of, as usually is the case, by way of by-law.\nI consider, however, that the same rule against improper discrimination is applicable to either by-law or resolution of a municipal council.\nThe rules of interpretation, that the pleading must be read most strongly against the pleader and that statutes conferring powers are to be strictly and literally carried into effect, applied to this case should also lead, I think, to a conclusion in favour of the dismissal of the appeal.\nA special privilege such as the appellants claim must be legislatively expressed in language clear beyond reasonable doubt and made so to appear on the pleading setting it up before it can be held entitled to prevail.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nWhatever may be said of the want of precision and certainty in the statute, I am clearly of opinion that the resolution is invalid as an unlawful discrimination. What the council was authorized by the statute to do was to encourage manufacturing enterprises by exempting the property thereof, etc. Such an enterprise might be by an individual or a partnership, or an incorporated company, but the resolution is confined to companies. An individual could get no benefit from it, no matter how meritorious his enterprise might be. See recent decision in the Hamilton Brewery and Distilling Oases[32].\nOn this simple ground I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant's bill does not, in my opinion, sufficiently allege a compliance with the condition prescribed by the resolution upon which the suit is based. The resolution provides: \"That any company establishing a woollen mill in the Town of Woodstock be exempted from taxation for a period of ten years.\" This resolution must, on well-known principles, as against any claim to obtain the benefit of the exemption provided for, be construed strictly; that is to say, of two alternative constructions that which is the less favourable to the claim must be adopted.\nNow, I think it would be a very liberal reading of this language which would support a claim to an exemption by one company in respect of a woollen mill which as a woollen mill had been established by another company, and in respect of which that other company had already had the benefit of the resolution.\nEx hypothesi the mill was already established; and although it may be that the language will bear a construction under which the putting into operation of a mill\u2014which, having enjoyed the benefit of the exemption has ceased to operate\u2014could be treated as a compliance with the condition, that I think is not the result of a strict reading of the words. In such a case I think the claimant must under the terms of the resolution strictly construed make out that the mill (in respect of which the exemption had been enjoyed) had, when acquired, ceased to exist as a woolen mill; not merely that its owners had ceased to operate it.\nUpon the other questions discussed in the judgments below, I express no opinion.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: F.

Ry. Co. with an agreement in writing which contained a clause stipulating as a condition that the vendees might declare the option of paying a further sum of $30,000, in addition to the price of sale, in consideration of which the vendors agreed to pay all the debts of the P. & I. Ry. Co. except certain specially mentioned claims, some of which were in respect of settlement for the right of way. The final clause of the agreement was as follows:\u2014\"After two years from the date hereof the Montreal Street Railway Company will assume the obligation of settling any right of way claims which the vendors may not previously have been called upon to settle and will contribute $5,000 towards the settlement of any such claims which the vendors may be called upon to settle within the said two years. Any part of the said sum not so expended in said two years or required by the purchasers so to be, shall be paid over to the vendors at the end of the said period, it being understood that the purchasers will not stir up or suggest claims being made.\" The vendees exercised the option and paid the $30,000 to the vendors who reserved their right to any portion of the $5,000 to be contributed towards settlement of the right of way claims which might not be expended during the two years. An unsettled claim for right of way, in dispute at the time of the agreement, was, subsequently, settled by the vendors within the two years. The question arose as to whether or not this claim, then known to exist, and legal expenses connected therewith was a debt which the vendors were obliged to discharge in consideration of the extra $30,000 so paid to them, and whether or not the $5,000 was to be contributed only in respect of right of way claims arising after the date of the agreement.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that the agreement must be construed as being controlled by the provisions of the last clause thereof; that said last clause was not inconsistent with the previous clauses of the agreement and that the vendees were bound to contribute to the payment of such claims and legal expenses in respect of the right of way to the extent of the $5,000 mentioned in the last clause.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, in favour of the plaintiffs for the sum of $2,164.14 with interest and costs, Sir Alexander Lacoste C.J. and Blanchet J. dissenting.\nThe case is stated, as follows, by His Lordship Mr. Justice Trenholme, in the court appealed from:\n\"TRENHOLME J.\u2014The question to be determined is whether the respondents (plaintiffs) are entitled to recover this sum ($2,164.14) from appellants (defendants) in virtue of the agreement formed by correspondence between the parties of 20th June, 1901, invoked in the case.\n\"On that date, the respondents, acting by Mr. H. S. Holt, by letter addressed to appellants offered to sell to appellants for one million odd dollars almost the entire stock and bonds of the Park and Island Bail-way Co., and added:\n'A further condition of these presents is that in accepting the present offer of sale you may declare your option of paying a further sum of $30,000 to the vendors, in consideration whereof the vendors will undertake to liquidate and pay all the debts of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Co., except the following:\n'1. A sum of $500, on which the interest is payable in perpetuity to the Maison St. Joseph du Sault, for the right of way.\n'2. A mortgage on the Shamrock property, $1,455.00, part of the lots only being used for the right of way.\n'3. A mortgage on the car-barn property and adjoining lots for $9,179.54.\n'4. The balance remaining due on the lot, corner Mount Royal Avenue and Park Avenue, $2,666.67.\n'5. A mortgage in favour of T. A. Dawes, Jr., for $3,128.13 for right of way at Lachine, with the current interest accrued on the said several sums.\n'6. The debt and costs (if any) which may be due to the plaintiffs or their attorneys, in the suits of the Royal Electric Co. against the Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. and the Montreal Construction Company, which suits are contested.\n'7. Any\" arrears of interest due on the 58 bonds not held by the Syndicate.\n'8. Any amount which may be payable to the Town of St. Louis as the price of the road of the Turnpike Trust, which amount (by reason of the judgment annulling the franchise and the contract) is not considered payable.\n'9. All amounts payable for coal under contract for future delivery or. in stock.\n'10. Amounts payable on current and future newspaper advertisements, $490. '11. The current monthly account for supplies; on 27th April last it amounted to $3,363.78.'\n\"The offer closed with the following clause:\n'After two years from the date hereof, the Montreal Street Railway Co. will assume the obligation of settling any right of way claims which the vendors may not previously have been called upon to settle, and will contribute $5,000 towards the settlement of any such claims which the vendors may be called upon to settle within the said two years. Any part of the said sum not so expended in said two years or required by the purchasers so to be shall be paid over to the vendors at the end of said period, it being understood that the purchasers will not stir up or suggest claims being made.'\n\"On the same day the offer was accepted by appellants as follows:\n'Montreal, June 20th, 1901.\n'H. S. Holt, Esq.,\nCity.\nDear Sir,\u2014\n'On behalf of the Montreal Street Railway Company, I hereby accept the proposal contained in your letter of June 20th, to sell to this company nine hundred and sixty-seven bonds, three thousand one hundred and fifty preferred shares, and four thousand two hundred and eighty-nine ordinary shares of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company, on the terms and conditions set out in your letter. On behalf of the company I also declare this company's option of paying the sum of $30,000 to the vendors, in consideration of the vendors undertaking to liquidate and pay all the debts of the Montreal Park and Island Railway, except those mentioned in your letter.\nYours truly,\nF. C. Henshaw,\nActing President.'\n\"On the 30th July, 1901, the respondents granted a receipt to appellants for the consideration price and the $30,000 payable under the option accepted by them, and in the receipt respondents expressly reserved their right to claim from appellants under the contract any part of the $5,000 which the appellants agreed to contribute towards the settlement of right of way claims and which might not be so expended during the two years from date of the contract, 20th June, 1901.\n\"As this reserve shews, as do also the contributions of the appellants to the settlement of two other right of way claims, the Lindsay and Larue right of way claims, out of the $5,000, both parties evidently understood and acted in the view that the acceptance of the option by appellants did not relieve appellants from contributing the $5,000 over and above the $30,000 and the other consideration payable by them under the contract.\n\"The appellants in fact in their pleas and factum do not deny, but admit that they contracted to pay the $5,000 towards settlement of right of way claims in addition to the other considerations of the contract. But they contend that the $2,164.14 which they have been condemned to pay, which was incurred for right of way over the Grand Trunk Railway property, was not a right of way claim mentioned in the last clause of the contract towards payment of which they agreed to contribute, but was properly a debt which respondents were bound to pay in discharge of their obligation to liquidate and pay all the debts of the Park and Island Railway Co. in consideration of the $30,000 paid them under the option to that effect accepted by appellants.\n\"The question thus is: Was the claim for right of way over the Grand Trunk Railway property a right of way claim within the meaning of the last or $5,000 clause of the contract, to payment of which appellants must contribute out of the $5,000, or is it a debt which respondents must pay under the option accepted by appellants?\n\"A reference to the $5,000 clause shews that the right of way claims therein meant were claims to be settled and, therefore, unsettled claims and were not restricted, as appellants pretend, to right of way claims that only came to light for the first time after the date of the contract. It may be questioned if there were any such unknown claims at the time of the contract, as the road had been built and in operation for several years. Claims that at the time of the contract had been settled by being reduced to a definite obligation were debts and were payable by respondents under the option, but claims that were not then settled and reduced to a definite obligation were not debts within the meaning of the option. Any unsettled claims for right of way that respondents were called on to settle within two years from date of contract, were to be settled by respondents, and the appellants were to contribute $5,000 towards the settlement of such claims, or so much thereof as was required therefor, and to pay to respondents at the end of two years any balance of the $5,000 not so required. All unsettled claims for right of way which respondents were not called on within the two years to settle were to be settled by appellants.\n\"The appellants say that the right of way claim for crossing the Grand Trunk Railway in question herein was not only known at the time of the contract, but had been reduced to a definite debt or obligation long before the date of the contract.\n\"It is a fact that an arrangement had been agreed upon for right of way between the Grand Trunk Railway Co. and the Park and Island Railway Co. in 1897, but at the time of the contract in question, the 20th June, 1901, the Grand Trunk Railway Company had consented to depart from that arrangement which had never been carried out, and at the time of the contract the two. companies, Grand Trunk Railway Company and Montreal Park and Island Railway Co. were engaged in effecting a new and different settlement which was completed between the parties within the two years. The record shews that respondents were called on to settle and did settle this right of way claim of the Grand Trunk Railway within the two years from date of contract and it is the only settlement of that claim that was ever carried out.\n\"The majority of the court think therefore that this right of way claim of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. is one appellants are bound to contribute to the settlement of, and that the judgment a quo is correct and should be confirmed, and it is accordingly confirmed with costs.\n\"The item for legal expenses in effecting the settlement of the claim is a part of the cost of securing the right of way, and is. properly included herein as are the notarial charges.\" Hague, for the appellants, referred to Arts. 1018, 1019 C.C.; Fair v. Dolan[1]; Watson v. Sparrow[2]; Larombi\u00e8re, art 1162 C.N. No. 6, and the maxim, \"exceptio probat regulam de rebus non exceptis.\"\nWe therefore respectfully submit that: (1) There are two alternative constructions of the contract, and if either be adopted respondents' action must fail; (2) According to the first, respondents having paid $30,000 can ask nothing further in any event; (3) According to second, respondents may ask a contribution of $5,000 from appellants for the purpose of settling certain claims, but the claims in question are not of the class entitled to such contribution.\nDandurand K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. It seems to me that the last paragraph of the agreement of the 20th June, 1901, controls the whole instrument, and I must say that I cannot see any inconsistency between that paragraph and the former one, relied upon by the appellants. The first provides for a general case, that is, the payment of the debts of the respondent company, and the last for a special one, namely, the settlement of the right of way claims. The respondents agreed to settle all these claims which might be presented within two years from the date of the agreement whether existing and determined before that date or after, and towards this settlement the appellants agreed to contribute $5,000 by way of compromise. They contend that the so-called Grand Trunk claim for right of way was a debt assumed by respondents under the first clause of the agreement. We do not understand the latter in this way. The letter of Mr. Ross, secretary-treasurer of the company, appellants, shews that the right of way claims did exist and were enforceable as such, although the company, respondent, in the first clause had assumed all the liabilities and debts, less some specified. The right of way claims therefore form an independent and special provision in the deed which the appellants had to satisfy to the extent of $5,000. The sum of money which they were condemned to pay in this case by the two courts below forms part of the said sum.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed for the above reasons which are more fully set up by the said courts, the whole with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dandurand, Brodeur & Boyer.\n[1] 2 Legal News 395.\n[2] Q.R. 16 S.C. 459.\n"}

The schooner \"Helen M.\" was at anchor in the channel and the tug directed its course so as to pass her on the port side when another vessel was seen coming out from a slip on that side. The tug then, when near the \"Helen M.\" changed her course, without giving any signal and tried to cross her bow to pass down on the starboard side and in doing so the \"Wandrian\" struck her, inflicting serious injury. In an action against the \"Wandrian\" by the owners of the \"Helen M.\" the captain of the former insisted that the schooner was in the middle of the channel, which was about 400 feet wide, but the local judge found as a fact that she was on the eastern side.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the local judge (11 Ex. C.R. 1) that the navigation of the tug was faulty and shewed negligence; that if the \"Helen M.\" was on the eastern side of the channel as found by the judge there was plenty of room to pass on her port side, and if, as contended, she was in the middle of the channel she could easily have been passed to starboard; and that in attempting to cross over and pass to starboard when she was so near the \"Helen M.\" as to render a collision almost inevitable was negligence on the tug's part; and that the \"Helen M.\" exercised proper vigilance and was not negligent in failing to slacken her anchor chain as the \"Wandrian\" was too close and had not signalled.\nHeld, also, that the tow was liable for such negligence in the navigation of the tug. Appeal from the judgment of the local judge for the New Brunswick Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding the \"Wandrian\" to blame for collision with the respondent's schooner \"Helen M.\"\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note and are fully stated in the opinions published herewith.\nHugh H. McLean K.C. for the appellant. This case was tried on the preliminary acts without pleadings; see Williams & Bruce's Admiralty Practice, (1886), p. 368. The court will never allow a party to contradict his own preliminary act at the hearing and an application to amend a mistake in his preliminary act will not be entertained. The \"Miranda,\"[2]; The \"Frankland\"[3]; The \"Marpesia\"[4].\nThe fault attributed to the \"Wandrian\" was in not keeping in the centre of the channel. Had she done so she would have passed the \"Helen M.\" to port and to the westward. It was the duty of the \"Wandrian\" to keep clear of the \"Helen M.\"\nThe faults attributed to the \"Helen M.\" were:\n\"(a) She was at anchor in the channel of the river.\n\"(b) No lookout.\n\"(c) Collision could have been avoided if \"Helen M.\" had slackened her anchor chains.\"\nThe plaintiff by his preliminary act asked the court to determine that the \"Wandrian\" was in fault in not keeping in the centre of the channel. Our answer as stated, in our preliminary act, was that the \"Helen M.\" was at anchor in the channel, about the centre of the channel, and it was impossible for us, the channel being blocked by the \"Helen M.\" and the \"Roberts,\" to have gone down on the western side of the channel. The fault of the \"Helen M.\" anchoring where she did prevented us taking the proper course down the river.\nThere was \"No Lookout\" on the \"Helen M.\" and she made no attempt to get out of the way even upon the order, given several times from the tug, to slacken out the chains. Nor did she attempt to put the jib up so as to assist in preventing the collision. There was plenty of time to slacken out chain or to put up the jib.\nIf the \"Helen M.\" had dropped down the river a few feet the collision would have been avoided.\nThe collision was an inevitable accident, as laid down in the case of The \"Europa\"[5]; The \"Marpesia\"[6]; The \"Virgil\"[7]; The \"Volcano\"[8].\nWe also rely upon The \"Shannon\"[9]; The \"William Lindsay\"[10]; The \"Sisters\"[11]; The \"Industrie\"[12]; The \"Telegraph\"[13]; The \"Ogemaw\"'[14]; The \"Sapphire\"[15]; The \"S. Shaw\"[16].\nThere is error in the judgment below holding that the tug was merely the servant of the tow and that, therefore, the tow was liable. No general rule of that kind can be laid down, The \"Quickstep\"[17] per Brett J. at page 200; The \"Devonian\"[18], at pages 229-230; The \"Niobe\"[19], at page 60; The \"American\" and The \"Syria\"[20].\nWe refer also to Jones v. Corporation of Liverpool[21]; Mabey v. Cooper[22]; The \"Niobe\"[23], on appeal.\nCoster K.C. for the respondent. The application for amendment of the preliminary act was refused in this case; it would have defeated the object of preliminary acts. The \"Frankland\"[24].\nIn reply to the contention that the \"Helen M.\" was improperly anchored in the channel, we submit that in the absence of local regulations there was no particular place in the river where the \"Helen M.\" should have been anchored. The preponderance of evidence is that she was anchored near the eastern bank of the channel. Even if she was anchored in the middle of the channel, there was no possible excuse for the \"Wandrian\" colliding with her in broad daylight, as there would have been ample room to pass on either side in the channel, which is four hundred feet wide at the place of the collision. The \"Lancashire\"[25]; The \"Meanatchy\"[26]; The City of Peking\"[27]; The \"Batavier\"[28].\nThere was a lookout on board the \"Helen M.\" who saw the \"Wandrian\" leave Huntley's Wharf and watched her until the time of the collision. Every possible effort was made on board the \"Helen M.\" to avoid the collision.\nAs to whether or not the collision could have been avoided if the \"Helen M.\" had slackened her anchor chains;\u2014\nNo signal was given by the tug or tow (Art. 28, \"Merchant's Shipping Act, 1897\"), that they were changing their course, and as the \"Wandrian\" had some of her head sails hoisted, which would have the effect of keeping her head over to the western bank of the channel, the \"Helen M.\" would not have been justified in slackening the anchor chains until the collision was so imminent that it could not have been averted by so doing.\nThe contention that the tug alone was liable was not set up in the preliminary act, but it is absolutely answered by the judgment in the court below and cannot be maintained. The master of the \"Wandrian,\" hired the tug to tow his vessel to sea. The tug was, therefore, the servant of the \"Wandrian,\" and the \"Wandrian\" was liable. In matters of collision, the tug and the tow are one vessel. Towed as the \"Wandrian\" was, the motive power is in the tug, and the governing power in the ship. The \"Cleadon\"[29]; The \"American\" v. The \"Syria\"[30]; The Devonian\"[31]; The \"Niobe\"[32].\nUnder these circumstances, the \"Wandrian\" has not relieved herself of the responsibility placed upon her, or shewn that this accident was inevitable and she must be held to be entirely in fault.\nWe would also refer to The \"Mary\"[33]; The \"Sinquasi\"[34], and The \"American\" and The \"Syria\"[35], at page 133.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014As explained by my brother Davies who has made a detailed statement of the evidence there is little, if any, difference between the parties to this appeal as to the facts connected with the collision except possibly with reference to the exact location of the respondent's schooner in the channel.\nBy consent of parties the evidence was taken under the rule on the preliminary acts and no pleadings were filed. The defence of inevitable accident which was urged most strenuously here does not appear to have been averred. The \"E. Z\"[36].\nThe collision occurred at three o'clock on the afternoon of the 28th November, 1904. The schooner \"Helen M.\" of 62.25 tons burden was lying at anchor, somewhat above the most frequented part, in the Parrsboro River about the middle of the channel as alleged by the appellant, and on the eastern side of the channel as found by the trial judge. In my view of the case the exact location is not material. The channel at this point is about 400 feet wide. The tide was within half an hour of flood; the current flowing up the river at the rate of about half a mile an hour; the wind was N.N.E. blowing a good breeze, about four miles an hour, down the river.\nThe steam tug \"Flushing\" with the \"Wandrian\" in tow started from a place called Huntley's Wharf about two thousand feet distant up the river from the \"Helen M.\" to go down the river and out to sea. To do this it was necessary to pass the \"Helen M.\" which lay in full view of both tug and tow from the time they started on their voyage. It is to be noted that the head sails of the \"Wandrian\" were set and she was drawing about 17 feet of water. The total length of tug, tow line and tow was 420 feet (tug 125, hawser 150 and tow 145).\nThe theory of the appellant is that the \"Helen M.\" was anchored about the centre of the channel and the course the tug was bound to follow with her tow after passing the small island called \"The Middle Ground\" was to the west over towards the Newville wharf and then down the starboard side of the river; that in attempting to do so the tug saw the channel was blocked by reason of the fact that a schooner called the \"Roberts\" was hauled out from the beach on the west side into the starboard channel 160 feet and lay in this position at a distance of about 160 feet to 200 feet below the \"Helen M.\" and if the tug with her tow had passed the schooner at anchor on her port side she could not get between her and the \"Roberts\" without risk of collision and because of these conditions the tug was obliged to cross over with her tow to the eastern side of the channel under the bow of the schooner at anchor and in attempting to carry out this manoeuvre the collision occurred.\nThe captain of the \"Wandrian\" at page 116 of the case says that the only chance of avoiding a collision on that day was to pass down on the eastern side, and in his opinion that was the proper course to take. Why this course was not taken at an earlier stage does not appear and no satisfactory explanation of the delay has been offered. If, as found by the judge, the schooner was at anchor upon the eastern side of the channel then there was ample room to pass on her port side without danger. If, on the contrary, she was, as alleged by the appellant, anchored in the centre of the channel there was ample room to go down passing starboard to starboard and the fault on the part of the tug and tow consists on their own theory in not having attempted this sooner and having delayed too long the collision happened.\nAdmitting as contended by the appellant that under ordinary circumstances the starboard side after leaving the island was the proper side to take and that channel being blocked by the \"Roberts\" the tug and tow were forced to go over to the eastward or port side, and to do so were obliged to cross under the bows of the \"Helen M.\" was this not an extremely hazardous undertaking? In view of the condition of the tide, the direction and strength of the wind, the head sails carried by the \"Wandrian,\" the fact that she drew 17 feet of water, the attempt of the tug with a long mass behind her to cross the bows of the schooner was not only hazardous but under the circumstances quite unnecessary and the result was inevitable. The people on board the tug and tow should have realized the position sooner and directed their course at an earlier time to the eastern side of the channel. Of course this assumes the accuracy of appellant's statement of conditions which is at variance with the facts as found by the trial judge, and a careful examination of the evidence has confirmed the conviction left with us when the argument closed that the findings of fact by the trial judge were justified by the evidence, and as he tells us he had the great advantage, which is in such a case as the present unappreciable, of hearing all the witnesses and observing their demeanor. There are really but two questions to be considered: First, did the schooner \"Helen M.\" keep a vigilant lookout and take all the precautions to avoid the collision which the circumstances of the anchorage required?\nThe trial judge found: First, that proper vigilance was exercised by those on the schooner to avoid the collision: Secondly, that the tug gave no signal to indicate her intention to alter her course and cross over from the western to the eastern side of the channel: Thirdly, that when the two men on the \"Helen M.\" became first aware of the change in the direction of the tug they went forward to let out the chain but the \"Wandrian\" was too close to do anything and that their explanation of the failure to let out the chain was adequate. If in consequence of the change in the course of the tug the schooner at anchor was expected to take action to avoid the collision, such change in her course should have been indicated by proper sound signals.\nIn the \"Batavier\" Case[37], Lushington J. says:\nThe principle of law where a vessel is run down by another I take it to be this: That the vessel running down the other must shew that the accident did not arise from any fault or negligence on her own part * * * and it is the duty of every vessel seeing another at anchor whether in a proper or improper place and whether properly or improperly anchored to avoid, if it be practicable and consistent with her own safety, any collision.\nThe second question: Is the tow responsible for the consequences of the collision in the circumstances? It was laid down in The \"Energy\"[38], that the master and crew of the tug are the agents of the owners of the ship and for damage done to a stranger solely through the fault or incapacity of the crew of the tug both parties are answerable.\nIn the case of The \"Niobe,\"[39] Sir James Hannem suggests that possibly if the collision had been brought about by sudden manoeuvring on the part of the tug which the tow could not control that the tow might be held blameless, but for the purposes of this case it is sufficient to adopt the language of the Privy Council in The \"American\" and The \"Syria\"[40]:\nThe tug is in the service of the tow, the tow is answerable for the negligence of her servants, and is for some purposes identified with her.\nAnd there is no evidence to shew that the manoeuvre which resulted in the collision was adopted without the concurrence of the tow. The contrary would appear to be the case. Those in command of the tow might have refused to execute the orders of the tug as they would in case of gross negligence by a pilot. The \"Duke of Manchester\"[41].\nIn the appellants' factum the circumstances out of which the collision arose are thus given:\nThe tug finding the starboard channel blocked changed her course to the eastward and on her starboard helm so as to take the \"Wandrian\" across the channel in front of the \"Helen M.\" and go down on the port side of the channel or to the eastward of the \"Helen M.\" The captain of the \"Wandrian\" was at the wheel and as soon as the tug changed her course he put his helm hard a-starboard and put it in the becket. The tug was drawing about nine feet of water and the \"Wandrian\" drawing sixteen feet ten inches. The \"Wandrian\" being loaded could not, of course, answer her helm as quickly as the tug. The tug put her helm hard a-starboard so as to assist the \"Wandrian\" to swing to the eastward. In the case of The \"Energy\"[42], Sir Robert Phillimore says:\nSo long ago as the 23rd of November, 1867, this court decided that a vessel called the \"Lizzie Aisbitt,\" in tow of a tug called the \"Energy\" was alone to blame for a collision with a vessel called the \"Mary.\" The case was argued before me by the present Mr. Baron Cleasby and Mr. Justice Brett; and I was assisted by Trinity Masters. The collision took place in St. Clement's Reach, in the River Thames, between 9 and 10 a.m. of the 1st of April, 1867. In that suit the pilot on board the \"Lizzie Aisbitt\" and the master of the tug \"Energy\" were both examined on behalf of the \"Lizzie Aisbitt,\" but the evidence of the pilot was that the collision was caused by the misconduct of the tug, for which, of course, so far as concerned the \"Mary,\" the \"Lizzie Aisbitt\" was responsible.\nI have not been able to find that the law as stated by Sir R. Phillimore has ever been doubted.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUAED J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of Mr. Justice McLeod, the local judge in Admiralty for the District of New Brunswick, condemning the ship \"Wandrian\" for damages to the schooner \"Helen M.\" caused by a collision between the two ships in the Parrsboro river on the 28th November, 1904, about three o'clock in the afternoon and about half an hour before high water.\nThe \"Wandrain\" was at the time being towed from Huntley's wharf where she had loaded, down the river to the sea.\nThe main questions in dispute were: First, whether the collision was caused by the negligence and want of care and skill on the part of the tug or was due, as contended by the \"Wandrian,\" to inevitable accident; Secondly, if due to the want of care, judgment and skill on the part of the tug, was the \"Wandrian\" responsible?\nAfter hearing the argument of Mr. McLean on behalf of the \"Wandrian\" we were all of the opinion that the collision was not the result of inevitable accident but of the unskilful and improper management and manoeuvring of the tug. A careful examination of the evidence since the argument has convinced me that we were right and that the findings of the trial judge were proper.\nThe evidence has been carefully analysed and reviewed by the trial judge and agreeing as I do with him generally I do not see that any good purpose would follow a repetition of the reasoning he has adopted.\nThe collision took place in broad daylight in fine weather with hardly any tide running and only a few hundred yards from the wharf from which the tug had taken the \"Wandrian\" in tow.\nThe schooner \"Helen M.\" was lying at anchor in the channel of the river which at that place was about 400 feet wide, and some distance below the \"Helen M.,\" a vessel called the \"Roberts\" was being kedged or hauled from the flats on the western side into the channel and was lying almost her entire length in the channel.\nBoth the \"Helen M.\" and the \"Roberts\" were in full view of the \"Wandrian\" and her tug while starting from Huntley's wharf on the river and there was nothing to obscure or prevent the lookouts on both tug and tow from seeing the relative positions of both these vessels from the time the \"Wandrian\" started until the collision occurred a few hundred yards down the river.\nA copy of an official plan or chart shewing the river with its channel and the flats on either side and the depth of water on the flats and in the channel at \"average high water ordinary spring tides\" was in evidence.\nFrom the plan or chart it appears that the depth of water in and across the channel at about 300 feet south of the collision was almost uniform and was between 23 and 24 feet, while on the flats it was somewhat less.\nNo evidence was given shewing that there was any difference between the depth at the actual spot where the collision occurred and the line a few hundred feet further down where the soundings were marked on the plan.\nThe weight to be attached to the argument of Mr. Maclean that the tug and tow were obliged owing to the alleged shallowness of water on the eastern side of the channel after passing the shoal or island called the Middle Ground marked on the plan to hug the western side of the channel obviously depended upon the existence of evidence shewing this shallowing of the channel at that particular spot, and that it would consequently have been unsafe for the tug to have towed the \"Wandrian\" down the centre of the channel or along the eastern side of the channel which from his contention barring shallowness was perfectly clear and open.\nTime and again during the argument we asked for the evidence or proof of this fact so essential for the defendant's case, but no evidence was or could be produced, the only evidence to which our attention was called being that of witnesses who spoke of the necessity of vessels after passing the Middle Ground keeping towards the eastern shore because the flats ran out a little and formed a small point there and there was somewhat of a bend in the channel. Not a single witness however stated or proved that so far as the channel itself was concerned its depth was not the uniform depth marked on the chart a few hundred feet lower down.\nThe theory of the counsel for the \"Wandrian\" was that the \"Helen M.\" was anchored on the western side of the channel and that the tug proceeded with her tow down the river and after passing the Middle Ground kept to the western side of the channel intending to pass between the \"Helen M.\" and the western edge. That the tug had almost reached the \"Helen M.\" when the captain suddenly discovered he could not safely pass down on the port side of the \"Helen M.\" and determined to pass on the starboard side, starboard to starboard.\nThat to effect this he put his helm a-starboard, crossed the bows of the \"Helen M.\" and fearing that his tow might not successfully do so pressed his helm hard-a-starboard so as to pull her up the river and escape collision.\nHe was not successful, however, in executing this manoeuvre and his tow with her head sails up came into collision with the anchored vessel and caused the damage complained of.\nThe initial mistake in the navigation of the tug and tow was in proceeding as far as the spot where a sudden change of course was determined upon and the mistake was duplicated in then attempting to cross as was attempted the bows of the \"Helen M.\" there lying at anchor. As it was evident from the evidence of the captain of the tug that this manoeuvre was a somewhat hazardous one the keeping of the head sails on the \"Wandrian\" with the wind blowing down the river and the chances of collision so strong, seems to indicate carelessness and want of judgment on the part of those in command of that ship.\nWhen the captain of the tug had reached the position when he concluded he could not safely continue his course between the \"Helen M.\" and the western bank of the river, it might have been better for him to have made the best of a situation created by his want of judgment, and to have taken her to the Newville wharf, abreast of which he was, as suggested by the trial judge. In our opinion, however, if the \"Helen M.\" was anchored where the defendant contends she was, on the western side of the channel, the tug and tow should have passed down on the eastern side and not have crossed over to the western at all. Why, granting the position of the \"Helen M.\" in the river to have been where defendant contends, this was not done we cannot understand. The road was open, everything clear, and the depth of water ample with the risk of collision nil. If, on the contrary, the position the \"Helen M.\" was anchored at was on the eastern side of the channel as found by the learned trial judge then the sudden change of course on the part of the tug and tow across the bows of the anchored vessel in order to pass her on her starboard side was at the moment it was taken, altogether too late and indefensible. They should, in that case, have passed down on the western side of the \"Helen M.\" as the trial judge has found and granting he has correctly found the anchored location of the schooner his conclusion seems irresistible.\nI am utterly unable to accept the theory of inevitable accident. On the contrary I am of opinion that the collision was caused by the want of skill and judgment of those in charge of the tug and tow.\nOn the second question as to the liability of the tow for a collision between it and the anchored ship caused by the unskilful navigation of the tug, I have reached the conclusion that in the circumstances of this case the tow is liable.\nThere may be a difference in the application of the legal rules and principles governing such cases between the English and American courts, and it does seem difficult if not impossible to reconcile all the authorities. But we are bound to follow the English decisions and we think they clearly indicate liability on the part of the tow for such a collision as this. Of course we have nothing to do with the rights and liabilities of the tug and tow inter se.\nThe question is confined to the liability of the tow for damages caused by a collision between her and a third ship even if brought about by the faulty navigation of the tug.\nHere there were no exceptional circumstances to take the contract of towage out of the ordinary rule. That rule I deduce from the authorities to be that under an ordinary contract of towage the tow has control over the tug and the latter is bound to accept the directions and orders of the former. There are exceptions to this rule notably in the cases of dumb barges and canal boats having little or no control over their own movements and where, by custom, contract or necessity, the control of the tow is in the tug. But in the absence of any such factors I take it to be clear under the English authorities that the control is in the tow.\nMr. Marsden in his work on Collisions (5th ed.) after a review of the English Admiralty Cases has reached that conclusion; see pp. 169 and 173.\nIn the case of the Union Steamship Company and The \"Aracan,\" The \"American\" and The \"Syria\"[43], the Judicial Committee reversing the decision of the High Court of Admiralty held that having regard to the exceptional circumstances under which the towing in that case was undertaken the governing as well as the motive power being wholly with the tug the tow was not liable to be condemned in damages occasioned by the collision. At page 132 their Lordships say:\nThe question remains whether the \"Syria,\" though free from blame in fact, must nevertheless be held to blame by intendment of law. The decision of the learned judge upon this point appears to be based upon the principle shortly stated by Lord Kingsdown in the passage which has been before cited as that on which The \"Cleadon\"[44], was decided, viz., that the motive power was in the tug, the governing power in the ship towed. The. judge of the Admiralty Court applying this principle to the present case, held that the \"American\" and the \"Syrian\" constituted one vessel in intendment of law. This is no doubt an accurate representation of the relations usually subsisting in this country between the tug and the tow. The tug is in the service of the tow, the tow is answerable for the negligence of her servant, and is for some purposes identified with her. Some American cases have been cited which, though differently decided, illustrate this principle.\nThe case of The \"Niobe\"[45], is also in point. There it was held by the President, Sir James Hannen, that where a tug with a vessel in tow came into collision with another vessel which was seriously injured by the tug but not by the vessel in tow, and where the collision might have been avoided had there been a good lookout on the vessel in tow and had she warned the tug that the latter was in danger of collision by continuing on her course, the owners of the tow were liable.\nIn the case before us the scope of hawser was about 25 fathoms only and there are no circumstances whatever to indicate any difficulty on the part of the tow in directing the control of the tug's movements. The evidence of the captain of the tow makes it plain that he took no pains in the matter at all, but left the tug to manoeuvre as it pleased. This, however, cannot absolve his vessel from liability if the control was in him. His duty was to exercise that control and his failure to exercise that duty cannot enable him to escape liability where a collision occurred through the tug's fault.\nIn the later case of The \"Devonian\"[46], where the tow was held liable for the fault of the tug in exhibiting misleading lights the relative liabilities of tug and tow are discussed.\nSir F. H. Jeune P. who heard the case, in his judgment, at page 230, says:\nIt appears to me the tow is responsible for the conduct of the tug so far, at least, as she can practically and reasonably exercise the control.\nOn appeal Lord Chief Justice Alverstone delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal holding the tow liable, says: With regard to her responsibility, (that is the tow's), apart from the statute, I do not think there is any doubt about the law, though there was difficulty about its application until the case of The 'Cleadon\"[47] (in 1860), when it was recognized that where one ship is in tow of another the two ships are by intendment of law for some purposes to be regarded as one, the commanding or governing power being with the tow, and the motive power with the tug.\nThe contract of towage in this case before us being a general one, there being no special circumstances shewing the control to have been in the tug the action of the master of the tow in hoisting and keeping up his head sails and the short distance between the two ships shewing the exercise of control by the tow to have been both practical and possible and to some extent at least to have been exercised all combine to remove this case from the exceptions which appear to exist in the towage of dumb barges and canal boats or such cases as The \"American\" and The \"Syria\"[48], from the judgment of the Judicial Committee which I have quoted above and where it was held that the motive power and the control were alike in the tug.\nI think we are bound to apply in this case the general rule laid down by the Privy Council in the cases of The \"Cleadon\" (1), approved of by the Court of Appeal in 1901; in The \"Devonian\" Case[49] and in the case of The Union Steamship Co. and The \"Aracan\"(2) quoted above.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred with Davies J.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice.

Paquette (1907) 38 SCR 451\nDate: 1907-04-02\nThe Copeland-Chatterson Company (Plaintiffs)\nAppellants\nAnd\nJean Paquette and Others\n(Defendants)\nRespondents\n1907: Feb. 28; 1907: April 2.\nPresent:\u2014Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Maclennan JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPatent of invention \u2014 Infringement \u2014 Want of novelty\u2014New and beneficial results \u2014 Subject matter of invention \u2014 Purchase of patented device\u2014Estoppel.\nThe plaintiffs were patentees of a device intended to cheapen and simplify former methods of keeping and rendering statements of accounts by merchants and others, as was claimed, by providing for making entries and invoices by one and the same act on manifolding sheets so folded as to occupy the entire platen of standard typewriters and, at the same time, without waste, to provide a binding margin for the leaf with the book-keeping entry to utilize it as a page in a permanently bound book. The sheets manufactured and sold by the plaintiffs accomplished these ends through being folded so as to form two or three leaves, as required; with two-leaf sheets the upper leaf forming an original or invoice and the lower leaf the duplicate and bookkeeping entry; with three-leaf sheets, the third leaf serving either as a duplicate or to be used as an original duplicated on the reverse side of the centre leaf. In each case the leaves are connected together so as to form one integral sheet with vertical and transverse score lines enabling the invoices, etc., to be easily detached, leaving the permanently retained page and folded margin with perforations to fit binders. The specifications of the patented device succinctly described and illustrated various forms of folding the sheet to secure these advantages. An action for infringement by the defendants using, manufacturing and selling sheets similar to the above described device was dismissed in the Exchequer Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (10 Ex. C.R. 410) that there was neither subject matter nor novelty in the above device claimed as an invention and, consequently, that it was not patentable. Appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action was brought against Parquette, trading under the name of \"The Montreal Plumbers' Supplies\" and Victor Guertin and Henri Guertin, trading as \"The Guertin Printing Co.,\". to recover damages for infringement of the patent referred to in the head-note and for an injunction against their making, selling or using fold-over bill and charge blanks made on the principle of, or on any principle colourably only differing from, the plaintiffs' alleged inventions, unless the same were manufactured by the plaintiffs or by some person duly licensed by them. It was alleged that Paquette had purchased a quantity of the blanks and afterwards procured the other defendants to manufacture and supply him with blanks. manufactured according to said inventions or upon principles only colourably differing therefrom, at less cost than they could have been purchased from the plaintiffs and had used such infringements in his business to the prejudice and damage of the plaintiffs, although warned against doing so and with full knowledge of the existence of said patents; and that the other defendants had likewise infringed the patents and caused damages to the plaintiffs by so manufacturing and making sales of similar sheets for like purposes. On the issues joined, the judge of the Exchequer Court, by the judgment appealed from (1), dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nRaney for the appellants. The judgment appealed from is erroneous in holding that there was lack of subject matter and lack of invention and utility. The patent itself is prima facie proof of utility; Ehrlich v. Ihlee[2] at page 449, per Cotton L.J. And there is cogent evidence of substantive utility in the case. There is also novelty as the prior acts referred to do not cover the special matters constituting our inventions. Walker on Patents (4 ed.) pars. 56, 57, 64, 65, 66, 75, 76; Topliff v. Topliff[3]; Fawcett v Homan[4], per Rigby L.J. at page 410; Terrell on Patents (4 ed.) page 99; Hoe v. Cottrell[5], at page 603; Potts v. Creager[6]; Marvin v Cotshall[7]. There is a presumption in favour of novelty which should not be disregarded in the absence of clear proof.\nThere is no evidence to support the defence of want of novelty and want of subject matter of invention. The court should not, therefore, presume what are matters of fact requiring proof as such. Lancashire Explosives Co. v. Roburite Explosives Co.[8]; Longbottom v. Shaw[9]; Lyon v. Goddard[10]; Reiter v. Jones[11]; Simplicity is no objection; Vickers, Sons & Co. v. Siddell[12]; Hinks v. Safety Lighting Co.[13]; Perry v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Lunetiers[14]; Williams v. American String-Wrapper Co.[15]. The courts uphold patents where there is an appreciable germ of invention; Fulton on Patents, (3 ed.) p. 59. The merit is in conceiving the idea; per Rigby L.J. in Fawcett v. Homan[16], at p. 410; See also Taylor & Scott v. Armand[17], per Romer L.J. at p. 136. We have a new device with a new mechanical operation involving the exercise of original thought, although the separate parts or elements may be old; Wilkins Shoe-Button Fastener Co. v. Webb[18]; McMichael & Wildman Mfg. Co. v. Staf-ford[19]; Rubber Tire Wheel Co. v. Columbia Pneumatic Wagon Wheel Co.[20]; The Grip Printing and Publishing Co. v. Butterfield[21]; Carter Crume Co. v. American Sales Book Co.[22].\nThe defendant Paquette purchased from the appellants sheets made according to the specification of the patent in suit and was still using those sheets when the action was brought, and when he was examined for discovery in the action. When he purchased those sheets he became the licensee of the appellants, and he remains their licensee as long as he continues to use the sheets. As a consequence, it is not open to him to dispute the validity of the patent; Crossley v. Dixon[23]; Clark v. Adie[24]. So long as he remains a licensee, that is to say so long as he continues to use articles of the appellants' manufacture, and does not repudiate their license, he cannot avail himself of the defence of his co-defendants. Terrell on Patents, (4th ed.), p. 217 et seq.; Fulton on Patents, (3rd ed.), p. 201 et seq.\nWe also refer to Trudeau (4th ed.), p. 107; Lucas v. Miller[25]; Reynolds v. Herbert Smith & Co.[26]; Smith v. Goldie[27], per Gwynne J. at pages 69, 71; Dansereau v. Bellemare[28]; Thomson v. American Braided Wire Co.[29]; Anti-vibration Electric Co. v. Crossley[30]; Ashworth v. The English Clothing Co.[31]; Taylor & Scott v. Annand[32]; Heugh v. Chamberlain[33], per Jessel M.R.\nMignault K.C. and Perron K.C. for the respondents. We contend that the invention claimed lacks novelty and patentability and is merely a result of mechanical skill, a substitution of known equivalents for parts of existing devices and a mere duplication of old elements without change of function and a mere change in form or size without the result of any new mode of operation. The industrial design was not susceptible of being patented. The letters-patent, by a needless multiplicity of claims, embarrass and deceive the public, and the specifications and drawings contain more than is necessary for obtaining the end for which they purport to be made. See Case v. Cressy[34].\nOn the question of combination or no combination, we refer to Terrell on Patents (4th ed.), p. 151, and Frost on Patents (2nd ed.), p. 61. See also Kynoch & Co. v. Webb[35].\nAs to subject matter of invention, the cases referred to by the appellants are based upon the peculiar circumstances of each case and do not decide more. They really condemn the patent which is nothing more than a sheet of paper with a score line placed half an inch from the line of fold. The fallacy of the claim as to saving paper and fitting the ordinary typewriter is shewn by merely folding the margin (which of course it is open to any one to do) of the sheet made according to claim 1, or figures 2 and 9, when such sheet becomes of the same width as the other sheets filed. See remarks of Buckley J. in McNaught v. Dawson[36].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appeal is dismissed with costs. I concur for the reasons stated in the court below.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I quite agree with the court below that there was nothing to patent. The appellant contended for the first time before this court that it was a patent of combinations. This alleged combination is not to be found in his application for the patent, nor in the patent itself, nor in the statement of claim. Their contention is clearly unfounded. I think there is no error in the judgment appealed from.\nDAVIES J. also concurred.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I agree with the learned trial judge that there is nothing new in folding a sheet of paper from right to left or left to right or in having score lines in one or some of such leaves or placing such score lines so as to produce when separation takes place at the score line, one leaf larger than the other or in utilizing the margin of a sheet of paper to bind it in a book if desired.\nI may add that I am unable to find anything new in the folding of a margin of a sheet of paper to be used in the process of typewriting. Typewriters have been doing that ever since the typewriting machine was invented. And I suspect many have done so with sheets of letter paper, of which copies would be mailed, and one copy would be put away in a portfolio for preservation, and even in the way of filing upon posts. I cannot see what, if one desired to put away such preserved copies gathered together in a more permanent form, is to be invented, that would not occur to any ordinary mind accustomed to do such work, or needing it to be done. It was urged that the wide spread use of such goods, as made after the patent in question, was proof of their utility, and being so useful, it is said, we must infer from this utility that something has been invented. The business push and energy that may present to business men the utility of such things and bring them into use must not be so confused with the question of utility as to be the sole test of that utility, which must be inherent in a patentable invention.\nThe appellant's counsel urged before us that their patent consisted of a combination and the application of it to book-keeping all of which was new and hence a subject matter for a patent.\nIt was stoutly maintained by respondent's counsel that this was not set up before the learned trial judge and I incline to doubt if it was strongly pressed upon his attention though evidently present to the mind of counsel during the trial.\nThere seem, however, to be two answers to this claim, assuming it now open to appellants before us, when and if discarded by appellant below.\nThe claims set forth in appellant's specification do not specificially claim any such combination, nor as it appears to me, do the specifications substantially claim to rest the alleged invention on the ground of a combination, either of old things or old combined with a something new.\nIt also was plausibly urged that there was such a combination which was applied to a new purpose.\nThis of itself would not be patentable. It would leave the appellant's case within the line of cases of which Harwood v. Great Northern Railway Co.[37], is a leading one. And to escape such result the appellant's counsel sought to claim the feature of folding, so as to leave a margin of suitable width to bind in a book, with least waste of paper, as a something that would not be obvious or so obvious to anyone in relation to keeping of accounts as to remove it beyond the field of patentable invention.\nI cannot assent to this. The manifolding of anything by means of typewriting and the preservation of a copy in case, or book, or file, with posts to bind or without, has so long been the common property of mankind that I cannot find anything needed to be done that was not obvious to any one of ordinary intelligence.\nIndeed the enterprise that undertakes to sell paper ready prepared for use in any such way is worthy of praise, but I hardly think that enterprise is yet patentable.\nSome things within the sphere of human intelligence are yet left free from such restraints. I cannot find that Paquette by his purchase from appellants of paper duly prepared by methods they have adopted bound himself (as a licensee is in some actions bound) not to deny the validity of this patent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree in the result of the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mills, Raney, Hales and Colquhoun.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Archer, Perron and Taschereau.\n[1] 10 Ex C.R. 410.\n[2] 5 Cutler 198, 437.\n[3] 145 U.S.R. 156.\n[4] 13 Cutler 268, 398.\n[5] 1 Fed.

The testator and his wife had lived together in harmony for a number of years and, shortly after their marriage, had made wills by which each of them, respectively, had constituted the other universal residuary legatee and the testator's former will, so made, was revoked by the will propounded by the defendant.\nHeld, that, as the promoter of the will, by which he took a bounty, had failed to discharge the onus of proof cast upon him to shew that the testator had acted freely and without undue influence in the revocation of the former will, the second will was invalid and should be set aside.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed, on the ground of captation and undue influence, but the Supreme Court of Canada refused to interfere with the concurrent findings of both courts below against the contention as to the testator's unsoundness of mind. Appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at the City of Montreal, which affirmed the judgment of His Lordship, Mr. Justice Doherty, in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe late Joseph Dussault, of Maisonneuve, District of Montreal, married the appellant, plaintiff in the case, on the 3rd of March. 1897, with ante-nuptial contract stipulating that the consorts should be separate as to property, and with donation of all the husband's personalty to the wife. Three days later he made a will whereby he instituted his wife universal legatee; his wife making, at the same time, a will in his favour in similar terms. Joseph Dussault died without issue, on the 9th of April, 1904, after having, on the 5th of March, 1904, made another will, under the circumstances mentioned in the head-note, devising the bulk of his estate to other legatees and constituting the respondent, his brother, universal residuary legatee. The widow brought the action to set aside the second will on the grounds that, at the time it was executed, deceased was suffering from physical weakness, mental aberration and delusions, and that he was under duress and incapable of making a valid will. Both courts below decided against the plaintiff's contentions and maintained the second will.\nThe questions at issue upon the appeal are stated in the judgment of His Lordship, Mr. Justice Girouard, now reported.\nBisaillon K.C. and H. R. Bisaillon for the appellant.\nMignault K.C. and Bonin K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After having carefully read all the depositions I have, as a matter of inference from the facts in evidence, come to the conclusion that the natural affection of the deceased for his wife, the appellant, had been poisoned and his sense of right perverted by the fraudulent artifices practiced upon him by the respondent. We all concur in the opinion of my brother, Girouard.\nThe testator would not, in my opinion, have disposed of his estate as he did were it not for the improper influence exercised by the respondent, at the time the will was made, over his mind weakened by the wasting disease which eventually caused his death. The suggestion repeated day after day for weeks and months that his malady was caused or aggravated by the negligence or want of skill in the preparation of his food by his wife was, under the circumstances, the most insidiously effective method that could be used to improperly influence the testator who should, at the time, have had a reasonable expectation of a prolonged life during which to enjoy the reward of his industry and business capacity. Convinced that his death was caused or hastened by the poor food which his wife prepared, his natural impulse would be to deprive her of the benefits accruing to her under his previous will, and the respondent seems to have directed his efforts to the fostering of this false impression.\nUnder the circumstances I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment appealed from set aside and the action maintained with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une demande en nullit\u00e9 de testament form\u00e9e par la veuve du testateur pour deux motifs: 1\u00b0 pour cause d'insanit\u00e9 du testateur, et 2\u00b0 pour cause de suggestion et de captation, pour me servir des expressions du droit fran\u00e7ais, ou d'influence indue, d'apr\u00e8s le droit anglais, d'o\u00f9 nous vient la facult\u00e9 illimit\u00e9e de tester. D'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles de droit des deux pays, c'est toujours la fraude qui caract\u00e9rise la suggestion et la captation ou l'influence indue.\nCette cause soul\u00e8ve donc deux questions de fait.\nSur les deux questions, nous avons apparemment le sentiment unanime de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, Doherty J., et de la cour de revision si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Taschereau, Pagnuelo et Charbonneau JJ.\nLe savant juge de la cour sup\u00e9rieure n'a pas laiss\u00e9 de notes, et en dehors du jugement formel o\u00f9 il se contente de nier les all\u00e9gations de la demande, il est impossible de conna\u00eetre son appr\u00e9ciation raisonn\u00e9e des faits assez nombreux et souvent contredits qu'une longue enqu\u00eate, couvrant 325 pages imprim\u00e9es, a d\u00e9roul\u00e9s devant lui. Nous savons, cependant, qu'il n'a jett\u00e9 aucun soup\u00e7on sur le caract\u00e8re ou la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 d'aucun t\u00e9moin, et pour cette raison, son jugement, ou plut\u00f4t la conclusion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 laquelle il est arriv\u00e9, nous laisse autant de latitude que la cour de revision en avait.\nLa cour de revision a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement sur les deux moyens; mais le juge Pagnuelo, qui seul nous a transmis des notes, constate que le motif tir\u00e9 de l'insanit\u00e9 est le seul qui f\u00fbt consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par les savants juges. Il observe m\u00eame que le moyen de la suggestion et de la captation a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9, faute de preuve. Les. avocats des deux parties s'accordent \u00e0 dire que le savant juge voulait dire par l\u00e0 que l'appelante n'avait pas insist\u00e9 sur ce moyen. Elle avait \u00e9videmment plus de confiance dans le moyen tir\u00e9 de l'insanit\u00e9. Devant cette cour, sa position n'est plus la m\u00eame au sujet de la d\u00e9mence. Il y a concours de deux cours sur un m\u00eame fait. Elle insista donc sur le second moyen comme sur le premier, et dans son factum et \u00e0 la plaidoirie orale. L'intim\u00e9, de son cot\u00e9, le discute dans son factum au lieu de le consid\u00e9rer comme abandonn\u00e9.\nLa preuve de d\u00e9mence faite par l'appelante est forte. Il n'y a pas de doute que de temps \u00e0 autre durant sa maladie depuis juin, 1903, jusqu' \u00e0 sa mort, le 9 avril, 1904, le d\u00e9funt a d\u00e9lir\u00e9. Le Dr. Rottot qui l'a vu en janvier ou f\u00e9vrier, 1904, affirme que c'\u00e9tait un ramolli. Le 2 mars, 1904, le Dr. Damien Masson, un sp\u00e9cialiste de grande r\u00e9putation de Montr\u00e9al, le trouva en plein d\u00e9lire \u00e0 son bureau o\u00f9 il s'\u00e9tait cependant rendu seul, et pr\u00e9dit son d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 courte \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Il d\u00e9lira aussi \u00e0 Deschambault o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait en visite en mars et avril, 1904, sous les soins du Dr. Lord. Cependant on ne peut nier qu'il e\u00fbt des intervalles lucides.\nMr. Bisaillon, C. R., n'a pas pu s'emp\u00eacher d'admettre que le testament n'\u00e9tait pas sans preuve. Les pr\u00eatres qui ont vu le testateur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il le fit, n'ont aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 le d\u00e9clarer sain d'esprit. Les notaires qui ont re\u00e7u le testament sont du m\u00eame avis. Plusieurs personnes avec qui le testateur \u00e9tait en contact assez fr\u00e9quent partagent la m\u00eame opinion. Comme toujours, les medecins sont divis\u00e9s. Mais m\u00eame le plus fort t\u00e9moin de l'appelante, le Dr. Masson, n'est pas certain que le 5 mars, 1904, il ne pouvait pas faire un testament.\nLe 2 mars, jour de l'examen (dit il), il ne pouvait faire son testament avec toute son intelligence.\nCeci n'est pas requis par la loi. Q. Vous ne jurez pas que le 5 mars, il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de faire son testament?\nR. Je crois que sa maladie, comme je l'ai dit tant\u00f4t, a d\u00fb s'aggraver jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort et que son \u00e9tat d'intelligence n'a pas d\u00fb s'am\u00e9liorer.\nCette r\u00e9ponse, et celles qui la pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et la suivent et le t\u00e9moignage du Dr. Rottot, laissent bien quelques doutes sur l'\u00e9tat mental du testateur; mais \u00e7a n'est pas sur des doutes que nous pouvons d\u00e9cider. Ces doutes disparaissent devant les t\u00e9moignages positifs des t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9, des Dr. Quintal, Dr. Bruneau, Dr. Lord, des pr\u00eatres, notaires et autres personnes mentionn\u00e9es plus haut. Voil\u00e0 pourquoi nous avons annonc\u00e9 durant la plaidoirie que le moyen tir\u00e9 de la folie n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 et que de ce chef l'appel \u00e9tait renvoy\u00e9. Nous avons d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans maintes occasions que nous ne devons pas renverser deux cours sur de simples questions de fait, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre parfaitement satisfaits qu'il y a eu erreur \u00e9vidente ou incontestable de la part des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. S\u00e9n\u00e9sac v. Vermont Central Railway Co.[1]; Paradis v. Municipality of Limoilou[2]; Granby v. M\u00e9nard[3]; D'Avignon v. Jones[4]. Dans cette derni\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce, cette cour a pos\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle an ces termes:\nThis appeal involves findings of fact by two courts. Both parties charge fraud, forgery and perjury. The two courts below have unanimously found in favour of the respondents. It is conceded that the evidence is contradictory. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSi nous ne pouvons renverser pour cause de d\u00e9mence, un fait saillant qui r\u00e9sulte de toute la preuve de part de d'autre, c'est qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du testament, le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement faible et de corps et d'esprit, souffrant depuis quelques mois de la tuberculose pulmonaire et c\u00e9r\u00e9brale aigu\u00eb, qui affectait s\u00e9rieusement ses facult\u00e9s mentales et qui devait l'emporter \u00e0 br\u00e8ve \u00e9ch\u00e9ance et de fait l'emporta un mois apr\u00e8s. On con\u00e7oit que cette circonstance est toujours un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important pour d\u00e9couvrir l'influence indue. Cette r\u00e9gie est ainsi pos\u00e9e dans l'American and English Encyclop\u0153dia of Law (2 ed.), vol. 29, page 111, o\u00f9 tous les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents sont cit\u00e9s, et ils sont nombreux:\nWeakness of mind not amounting to absolute disqualification, though not alone sufficient evidence of undue influence, is nevertheless, an important circumstance as going to shew a subject susceptible to undue influence.\nEnfin, il est en preuve que, m\u00eame en sant\u00e9, le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait d'un temp\u00e9rament tr\u00e8s faible et facile \u00e0 influencer. Mr. Lesage, qui fut son notaire pendant plusieures ann\u00e9es, dit qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s timide et qu'en dehors de ses affaires personnelles, il ne connaissait absolument rien.\nJ'\u00e9tais oblig\u00e9 (ajoute-t-il), de le guider, de le conduire comme un enfant.\nOn. con\u00e7oit maintenant que l'intim\u00e9 qui, s'il faut croire les all\u00e9gations du plaidoyer de l'intim\u00e9, \u00e9tait son associ\u00e9 et son confident, \u00e0 la date de son mariage et jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort, ait con\u00e7u l'id\u00e9e, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de sa maladie, de s'emparer de son esprit et de le tourner contre sa femme.\nNous touchons au second moyen de l'action en nullit\u00e9, qui, selon moi, doit triompher.\nEn effet, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du moyen tir\u00e9 de la fraude et de l'influence indue, nous sommes en face d'une autre situation. Nous n'avons que le jug\u00e9 pur et simple du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et c'est notre devoir de le renverser si nous le croyons contraire \u00e0 la preuve qui est devant nous, m\u00eame si elle est contradictoire. Nous devons le peser comme aurait pu faire la cour de revision, et d\u00e9cider si elle justifie le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance. Nous ne sommes plus g\u00ean\u00e9s par l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e par deux cours sur une simple question de fait.\nLa suggestion et la captation ou l'influence indue, c'est-\u00e0-dire la fraude, doivent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es comme dans les cas ordinaires, c'est-\u00e0-dire, par preuve directe verbale ou \u00e9crite, ou par des pr\u00e9somptions. (Fuzier-Herman, codes annot\u00e9s, art. 901, t. 2, n. 108, 109.) C'est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement par ce dernier mode de preuve que l'on proc\u00e8de pour d\u00e9couvrir les men\u00e9es frauduleuses toujours conduites dans le secret. (C.C. art. 839, 993.) Les auteurs et les tribunaux ont pos\u00e9 certaines r\u00e8gles qui servent de guide. Baudry-La-cantinerie, Pr\u00e9cis, t. 2, n. 774, nous dit que le dol existera et la captation ou la suggestion deviendra une cause de nullit\u00e9 si, par exemple, le donataire a calomni\u00e9 les h\u00e9ritiers pr\u00e9somptifs du donateur, ou si, par de d\u00e9testables artifices, il a irrit\u00e9 le donateur contre ses parents, dans le but de se faire donner ce qui aurait d\u00fb l\u00e9gitimement leur revenir. Laurent, vol. 11, n. 132, ajoute que la suggestion suppose que celui qui sugg\u00e8re le fait dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat et en abusant de l'influence qu'il a sur l'esprit et la volont\u00e9 du testateur. Puis, au n: 134, il cite avec approbation un arr\u00eat de la cour d'Aix o\u00f9 les moyens de captation sont analys\u00e9s. Ils varient peu, d'apr\u00e8s cet arr\u00eat; ils sont pour ainsi dire st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9s. Le l\u00e9gataire a, recours \u00e0 la ruse, au mensonge, aux plus odieuses calomnies contre l'h\u00e9ritier pr\u00e9somptif du testateur, cherchant \u00e0 lui enlever son affection pour lui ravir plus s\u00fbrement son h\u00e9ritage. On d\u00e9nonce, ajoute Laurent, citant d'autres arr\u00eats, les h\u00e9ritiers pr\u00e9somptifs comme ingrats et m\u00e9chants, impatients de saisir une fortune qui tarde trop \u00e0 leur \u00e9choir. Enfin Laurent, n. 135, conclut:\nUn fait dont les tribunaux doivent tenir compte, c'est le poison de la calomnie que des mains perfides versent goutte \u00e0 goutte dans l'esprit du vieillard.\nMarcad\u00e9, t. 3, art. 901, page 407:\nMais si la captation ou la suggestion sont frauduleuses; si l'on n'a fait adopter que par le mensonge et l'astuce la r\u00e9solution qui d\u00e9pouille les h\u00e9ritiers; si c'est par de coupables man\u0153uvres, par d'indignes inventions, par de fausses apparences qu'on est parvenu \u00e0 perdre les h\u00e9ritiers dans l'espirit de leur parent et \u00e0 y prendre leur place, alors on peut dire que l'acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 n'est pas l'expression exacte de la volont\u00e9 libre et vraie du disposant, mais bien plut\u00f4t l'expression de la volont\u00e9 de celui qui l'a fait faire.\nLe droit anglais a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s jaloux de la libert\u00e9 enti\u00e8re et \u00e9clair\u00e9e requise pour tester. En 1838, dans Barry v. Butlin[5], le conseil priv\u00e9 a rendu une d\u00e9cision dont l'autorit\u00e9 n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 souvent invoqu\u00e9e depuis comme faisant loi, particuli\u00e8rement dans Fulton v. Andrew (1875)[6]; Brown v. Fisher (1890)[7].\nLord Hatherly disait dans Barry v. Butlin(1):\nA matter which appears to me deserving of some remark and upon which the Lord Chancellor has already fully commented is the supposed existence of a rigid rule by which when you are once satisfied that a testator of a competent mind has had his will read over to him and has thereupon executed it, all further inquiry is shut out. No doubt these circumstances afford very grave and strong presumption that the will has been duly and properly executed by the testator. Still circumstances may exist which may require that something further shall be done in the matter than the mere establishment of the fact of the testator having been a person of sound mind and memory and also having read over to him that which had been prepared for him and which he executed as his will. It is impossible, as it appears to me, in the cases where the ingredient of fraud enters to lay down any clear and unyielding rule like this.\nEt plus loin, Lord Hatherly conclut:\nThere is one rule which has always been laid down by the courts having to deal with wills and that is that a person who is instrumental in the framing of a will and who obtains a bounty by that will is placed in a different position from other ordinary legatees who are not called upon to substantiate the truth and honesty of the transaction as regards their legacies. It is enough in their case that the will was read over to the testator and that he was of sound mind and memory and capable of comprehending it. But there is a farther onus upon those who take for their own benefit after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown upon them the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\nVoyons si ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments se trouvent dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe.\nLes faits transcendants de la cause sont deux testaments faits par le testateur et les circonstances qui en ont amen\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution. Le d\u00e9funt, Joseph Dussault, et son \u00e9pouse, l'appelante, \u00e9taient tous deux natifs de la paroisse de Deschambault, en haut de Qu\u00e9bec, de parents cultivateurs et poss\u00e9dant, para\u00eet-il, une \u00e9ducation \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, car tous, parents et enfants, savaient lire et \u00e9crire, et ont sign\u00e9 au contrat de mariage de Joseph. Ils se connaissaient depuis leur plus tendre jeunesse, et comme tout le monde se connait dans nos paroisses de campagne, Joseph devait savoir si l'appelante lui ferait une bonne femme et une bonne m\u00e9nag\u00e8re; ils \u00e9taient m\u00eame apparent\u00e9s, car l'acte de c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du mariage constate qu'il y a eu dispense de parent\u00e9 au 4e d\u00e9gr\u00e9, ainsi que de la publication de deux bans. La famille Dussault comptait pas moins de sept fils, et Joseph et son fr\u00e8re Ars\u00e8ne se d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent \u00e0 apprendre un m\u00e9tier, celui de tailleur de pierres, et d'aller tenter fortune \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. En 1896, ils se firent bouchers en soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Maisonneuve de Montr\u00e9al. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se livra aussi aux achats et ventes de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s fonci\u00e8res. Ils eurent du succ\u00e8s, et bient\u00f4t Joseph se trouva valoir une couple de mille piastres. C'est alors, \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 29 ans, qu'il songea \u00e0 prendre femme et \u00e0 cette fin tourna ses regards vers la paroisse natale, o\u00f9 le 2 mars, 1897, de l'agr\u00e9ment des parents de part et d'autre, il \u00e9pousa l'appelante, ag\u00e9e de 24 ans, aussi fille d'un cultivateur, intelligente, laborieuse et poss\u00e9dant une certaine \u00e9ducation \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Le mariage fut pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un contrat de mariage pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Deschambault o\u00f9, contrairement \u00e0 la coutume g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suivie dans nos campagnes, la communaut\u00e9 de biens fut excluse et la s\u00e9paration de biens stipul\u00e9e, la future \u00e9pouse renon\u00e7ant au douaire et ne recevant d'autre avantage que la donation, \u00e0 condition de survie, du petit m\u00e9nage au domicile conjugal \u00e0 Maisonneuve. C'est son notaire de Montr\u00e9al, Mr. Lesage, qui lui avait conseill\u00e9 la s\u00e9paration de biens. C'est ce que le notaire d\u00e9clare. L'appelante, qui fut examin\u00e9e deux jours avant lui, donne plus de d\u00e9tails sur cet incident.\nMon mari (dit-elle) m'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour lui que nous nous mariions sous l'acte de la s\u00e9paration de biens, car, advenant une mauvaise affaire, il pourrait se servir de mon nom; j'ai accept\u00e9 cela \u00e0 condition qu'il me ferait un testament me donnant tous ses biens.\nLe 5 mars, 1897, devant le notaire m\u00eame qui avait re\u00e7u le contrat de mariage, les deux \u00e9poux firent un testament mutuel et r\u00e9ciproque instituant le survivant le l\u00e9gataire universel du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.; Au dernier vivant les biens, telle fut donc la r\u00e8gle de succession arr\u00eat\u00e9e entr'eux, qu'il\/?\/y eut des enfants ou non. Les deux testaments, il est vrai, ne lient personne; chacun pouvait l\u00e9galement le r\u00e9voquer en aucun temps; mais il me semble qu'ils cr\u00e9ent une obligation morale qui doit avoir quelque valeur dans une cause comme celle-ci. Il me faudrait une preuve bien claire de la volont\u00e9 contraire du testateur pour pouvoir ignorer une semblable obligation et en sanctionner la violation.\nAyant ainsi pourvu \u00e0 l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de la mort, les \u00e9poux all\u00e8rent r\u00e9sider \u00e0 Maisonneuve o\u00f9, dit sa veuve, \"nous avons vecu heureux jusqu'en juin, 1903.\" C'est aussi ce qu'observe la tante Marie Louise Morissette qui passa quelques jours avec les Dussault en juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Une de ses voisines, Mme. Fausse, qui habita pendant cinq mois au premier \u00e9tage de la m\u00eame maison jusqu'au 1er. mai, 1903, et qui voyait les Dussault presque tous les jours, constate le m\u00eame fait. \"J'ai toujours trouv\u00e9,\" dit-elle, \"qu'ils \u00e9taient bien heureux.\"\nEt comment pouvait-il en \u00eatre autrement. L'appelante \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9vou\u00e9e \u00e0 son mari et \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Jamais le moindre soup\u00e7on d'infid\u00e9lit\u00e9 de paresse ou de frivolit\u00e9, n'a plan\u00e9 sur sa t\u00eate. Elle s'occupait des d\u00e9tails du m\u00e9nage, faisant la cuisine, le lavage et tous les travaux domestiques sans \u00eatre aid\u00e9e d'une servante. Elle n'eut pas d'enfants, et lorsque ses occupations ordinaires le lui permettaient, surtout le samedi soir lorsque l'achalandage se faisait le plus sentir, elle aidait \u00e0 la shop ou boutique des deux fr\u00e8res, soit \u00e0 la caisse ou aux ventes, et cela sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration aucune. Elle trouva m\u00eame le temps de pensionner son beau-fr\u00e8re Ars\u00e8ne, l'intim\u00e9, depuis les premiers jours de leur mariage, et de verser par l\u00e0 durant sept ann\u00e9es dans la caisse de son mari au moins $2 par semaine ou $100 par ann\u00e9e, car bien que le prix de sa pension ne para\u00eesse pas au dossier, il ne devait pas payer moins que son fr\u00e8re Laurent, qui pensionna avec eux pendant un mois du 15 f\u00e9vrier au 15 mars, 1904, \u00e0 $2 par semaine. Elle trouva m\u00eame le moyen de faire de petites \u00e9conomies en fabriquant au temps de No\u00ebl et de P\u00e2ques, des rosettes et autres d\u00e9corations dont les boucliers ornent leurs boutiques et voitures \u00e0 l'occasion de ces grandes f\u00eates, \u00e9conomies qu'elle d\u00e9posait toujours en banque, pour plus tard les placer entre mains s\u00fbres \u00e0 un taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui des banques d'\u00e9pargnes. Au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari elle valait $303, $58 en banque, et le reste en bons billets.\nEn 1903, Joseph Dussault valait $6,000 si nous prenons l'estimation d'Ars\u00e8ne, $8,000 d'apr\u00e8s celle de l'appelante. Je suis surpris que l'inventaire qui fut fait apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Joseph, par le notaire Lesage, n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit ou consult\u00e9, car en le parcourant, on aurait probablement pu s'assurer de la valeur exacte de la succession du d\u00e9funt. A d\u00e9faut de cette preuve, il r\u00e9sulte des documents produits que Joseph et Ars\u00e8ne poss\u00e9daient alors des immeubles, clairs de toutes dettes, d'une valeur de $12,100, dont $6,050 appartenant \u00e0 chaque, ce qui ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 $1,400 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Joseph en banque, et $450 pour sa part dans le commerce, forme les $8,000, ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s.\nLa vie heureuse et prosp\u00e8re des \u00e9poux Dussault fut soudainement bris\u00e9e en juin, 1903. e mari commen\u00e7a alors \u00e0 se plaindre qu'il \u00e9tait souffrant d'indigestions, insomnies, manques d'app\u00e9tit, \u00e9puisements, etc. Lorsqu'il alla consulter le m\u00e9decin pour la premi\u00e8re fois le 15 ao\u00fbt, 1903, le Dr. Quintal, c'\u00e9tait encore ses sujets de plainte.\nLa malade (dit le docteur) est venu chez moi et il se plaignait d'abord de dyspepsie et de faiblesse.\nArs\u00e9ne, comme tout le monde d'ailleurs, ne manqua pas de s'aper\u00e7evoir que son fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieusement malade. Voici ce qu'il dit lui m\u00eame \u00e0 ce sujet:\nQ. Pendant combien de temps, votre fr\u00e8re Joseph a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de travailler avant de mourir?\nR. Dans les 6 ou 7 mois.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il disait pour ne pas travailler?\nR. Il se plaignait qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas capable parce qu'il \u00e9tait malade.\nPas plus que Joseph, Ars\u00e8ne ne connaissait d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but le caract\u00e8re de la maladie, mais il pouvait en mourir et il savait \u00e0 tout \u00e9venement qu'il avait une femme sans enfants en faveur de laquelle il pouvait tester, s'il ne connaissait pas l'existence du premier testament. Il voit de suite une belle chance de doubler ou au moins d'augmenter consid\u00e9rablement sa fortune et il la saisit sans retard. Il faut irriter le mari contre la femme, lui inspirer la haine contre elle, et comme dans tous les cas de captation, il eut secours \u00e0 la calomnie; il fallait le convaincre qu'elle est la cause de sa maladie. Son fr\u00e8re souffre d'indigestions, il le convaincra \u00e0 force de le lui dire et de le r\u00e9peter, qu'elles sont d\u00fbes \u00e0 la mauvaise nourriture pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par sa femme.\nArs\u00e8ne affirme que Joseph s'est plaint de la mauvaise cuisine d\u00e8s les premiers jours de son m\u00e9nage, et qu'elle fut toujours mauvaise. Il est le seul t\u00e9moin qui parle de cette fa\u00e7on et son t\u00e9moignage n'est pas m\u00eame vraisemblable. Autrement, comment expliquer le fait qu'Ars\u00e8ne, qui \u00e9tait simple pensionnaire, soit reste \u00e0 manger \u00e0 cette mauvaise table pendant sept ans, \u00e0 part un intervalle de 4 mois, lui qui, c\u00e9libataire et en moyens, n'y \u00e9tait retenu par aucun lien. Et lorsqu'il alla pensionner ailleurs, vers 1900, pendant ces quatre mois, ce ne fut pas \u00e0 cause de la nourriture, mais parce que la shop de boucher \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9e. Puis, pourquoi n'est-il pas parti lorsque Joseph alla passer deux mois \u00e0 la campagne en 1903? Il all\u00e8gue dans son plaidoyer que le d\u00e9faut de soins de la part de sa femme lui fut signal\u00e9 par des parents de cette derni\u00e8re. C'est une assertion toute gratuite. Ars\u00e8ne est contredit par plusieurs temoins, d'abord par l'appelante et puis par sa s\u0153ur H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, institutrice, qui passa avec elle sa vacance de juillet et ao\u00fbt, 1903.\nLe t\u00e9moignage de l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sans h\u00e9sitation, ni contradiction, et avec la plus grande franchise. Elle n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 relater la premi\u00e8re des choses d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, par exemple que, durant sa maladie, son mari s'est plaint en sa pr\u00e9sence de sa cuisine \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Ars\u00e8ne, au Dr. Rottot et \u00e0 d'autres. Mais ce qui est plus important, ce qui me fait adopter son t\u00e9moignage de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 celui de l'intim\u00e9, c'est que non seulement il n'est pas contredit, mais il est corrobor\u00e9 sur le point le plus saillant de la cause, la calomnie, tandis que c'est tout le contraire \u00e0 propos du t\u00e9moignage de l'intim\u00e9.\nVoyons ce qu'elle dit au sujet de la date des plaintes contre la nourriture et de celui des deux fr\u00e8res qui les porta le premier. Q. Qui le premier a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se plaindre de la nourriture?\nR. C'est Ars\u00e8ne Dussault le d\u00e9fendeur.\nEt avant:\nQ. Monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault, s'est-il plaint \u00e0 votre mari durant le mois de janvier, 1904?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. S'est-il plaint avant?\nR. Depuis le mois de juin, 1903.\nTransquestionn\u00e9e par M. Bonin C.R.:\nQ. Vous nous avez dit que votre mari \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 malade le 3 juin, 1903?\nR. Je n'ai pas cit\u00e9 le 3 juin, j'ai dit aux environs du mois de juin, Je n'ai pas cit\u00e9 de quanti\u00e8me.\nQ. Vous n'avez pas cit\u00e9 de quanti\u00e9me, c'est aux environs du mois de juin?\nR. C'est dans le cours du mois de juin.\nQ. Et puis, du moment qu'il est tomb\u00e9 malade, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se plaindre de la nourriture?\nR. Ce n'est pas lui-m\u00eame qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se plaindre.\nQ. C'est Ars\u00e8ne?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Aussit\u00f4t que votre mari est tomb\u00e9 malade?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mayrand, institutrice, la s\u0153ur de l'appelante sans int\u00e9r\u00eat dans la cause, qui passa avec elle la vacance de juillet et ao\u00fbt, 1903:\nQ. Est-ce que monsieur Joseph Dussault se plaignait d'\u00eatre malade?\nR. Monsieur Dussault commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 \u00eatre malade.\nQ. Est-ce que monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault se plaignait de la nourriture?\nR. Oui, tr\u00e8s souvent, 3 ou 4 fois par semaine.\nQ. A qui?\nR. Il se plaignait de la nourriture \u00e0 monsieur Joseph Dussault,\nQ. A son fr\u00e8re?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Combien de fois par semaine?\nR. 3 ou 4 fois par semaine.\nQ. Pendant tout le temps que vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0?\nR. Oui, monsieur. Q. Qu'est-ce que monsieur Dussault disait?\nR. Monsieur Joseph Dussault ne disait pas grand'chose, \u00e7a le portait \u00e0 se plaindre lui aussi.\nQ. Qu'est-ce que disait monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault \u00e0 son fr\u00e9re?\nR. Un jour, au mois d'ao\u00fbt, il a dit que, s'il continuait \u00e0 rester chez lui, il allait mourir, que sa femme ne faisait pas de la nourriture assez bonne.\nD'apr\u00e8s la propre version de l'intim\u00e9, il ne cessa de parler de la mauvaise cuisine durant tout le temps de la maladie.\nQ. Est-ce que votre fr\u00e8re vous en parlait que la nourriture n'\u00e9tait pas bonne?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous en parliez vous aussi?\nR. Je disais que je ne pouvais pas manager la nourriture qu'elle nous donnait.\nQ. Vous avez dit que vous \u00e9tiez pour partir?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nNon, il n'est pas parti, bien qu'invit\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire par l'appelante, d'apr\u00e8s ce qu'il dit; il ne pouvait l\u00e2cher sa victime; il aurait peut-\u00eatre manqu\u00e9 son coup.\nEt dire que toutes ces j\u00e9r\u00e9miades \u00e9taient absolument sans fondement. Un pensionnaire, \u00e0 $2 par semaine, ne pouvait gu\u00e8re s'attendre \u00e0 une fine cuisine. Tous les t\u00e9moins, qui ont go\u00fbt\u00e9 les mets pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par l'appelante, lui rendent le t\u00e9moignage qu'ils \u00e9taient bons et quiconque connait les femmes et les filles de nos cultivateurs sait qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral elles savent faire \u00e0 manger. Si la nourriture \u00e9tait si mauvaise, comment expliquer qu'apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part de Joseph pour Deschambault durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et l'automne de 1903, et en mars, 1904, Ars\u00e8ne soit rest\u00e9 avec sa femme jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 elle alla le rejoindre vers le 15 mars. Laurent, qui arriva le 15 f\u00e9vrier, 1904, pour remplacer son fr\u00e8re Joseph, ne dit pas un mot de la nourriture. Joseph et Ars\u00e8ne d\u00e9siraient beaucoup le garder avec eux; mais ils craignaient l'opposition de la femme; elle consentit cependant et Laurent pensionna chez elle pendant un mois, jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9part pour Deschambault, le 15 mars, bien que son fr\u00e8re lui dit qu'il paierait sa pension l\u00e0 o\u00f9 \u00e7a lui plairait de l'avoir.\nAvant la maladie de Joseph, pendant cinq mois cons\u00e9cutifs, Mme. Fausse, une voisine, \u00e9tait dans l'habitude de visiter le foyer des \u00e9poux Dussault presque tous les jours; elle y a vu souvent le mari, qui ne para\u00eet pas s'\u00eatre plaint des repas. Et comment cela pouvait-il arriver? Voici son appr\u00e9ciation de la table:\nQ. Est-ce que vous avez remarqu\u00e9 la nourriture et les repas que pr\u00e9parait madame Dussault?\nR. J'y suis all\u00e9e quelquefois \u00e0 l'heure des repas et j'ai trouv\u00e9 que la table \u00e9tait une table ordinaire dans les familles.\nQ. Est-ce que la cuisine \u00e9tait bien faite?\nR. Oui, j'ai mang\u00e9 une fois l\u00e0, et madame Dussault m'a servie d'un morceau de p\u00e2t\u00e9 et je l'ai trouv\u00e9 bien bon.\nMarie Louise Morrissette, la tante de l'appelante, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 60 ans, celle-l\u00e0 m\u00eame dont l'intim\u00e9 invoque le t\u00e9moignage, a pass\u00e9 quelques jours avec les Dussault en juin, 1903, et voici ce qu'elle dit sur le sujet:\nQ. Est-ce que sa nourriture \u00e9tait bonne?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Est-ce qu'elle faisait une bonne cuisine?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nElle ajoute que le mari avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 ses plaintes au sujet de la nourriture. Il se plaignait aussi qu'il avait le rhume. C'\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment le commencement de la maladie.\nD\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, ces plaintes ennuy\u00e8rent profond\u00e9ment l'appelante, qui ne comprenait rien \u00e0 ce nouveau langage. Elle invita sa s\u0153ur H\u00e9l\u00e8ne \u00e0 venir passer ses vacances avec elle. L'\u00e9nigme fut bient\u00f4t expliqu\u00e9e, car la maladie augmentait et les plaintes aussi. Voici d'abord ce que raconte la demandresse, et elle r\u00e9p\u00e8te les m\u00eames faits \u00e0 plusieurs reprises:\nR. J'ai eu tr\u00e8s bien soin de mon mari; la nourriture que je pr\u00e9parais \u00e9tait bonne \u00e0 sa maladie, m\u00eame pour le satisfaire, j'ai fait venir une de mes s\u0153urs.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il \u00e9tait satisfait de sa nourriture?\nR. Aux mois d'ao\u00fbt et juillet, 1903, monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault pourvu que l'ordinaire fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par ma s\u0153ur, il se trouvait satisfait.\nQ. Tous les deux?\nR. Tous les deux, quand c'\u00e9tait moi, les reproches commencaient.\nVoici maintenant le t\u00e9moignage de la s\u0153ur;\u2014\nQ. Est-ce que votre s\u0153ur faisait une bonne nourriture, quelle nourriture faisait-elle votre s\u0153ur?\nR. Elle faisait une bonne nourriture, une nourriture bien ordinaire.\nQ. Faisiez-vous la nourriture aussi?\nR. Oui, il est arriv\u00e9 quelquefois que j'ai pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les repas et quand monsieur Joseph Dussault et monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault savaient que c'\u00e9tait une autre que madame Dussault, qui avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les repas, ils \u00e9taient contents, ils ne se plaignaient pas; quand ils savaient que c'\u00e9tait madame Dussault, ils disaient que la nourriture n'\u00e9tait pas bonne.\nPar le juge:\nQ. Tous les deux?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nCe t\u00e9moignage, r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 plusieurs fois, peint la situation, savoir qu'Ars\u00e8ne n'avait qu'un but lorsqu'il souleva le cri de mauvaise nourriture; c'\u00e9tait d'influencer ind\u00fbment Joseph; d\u00e8s juillet et ao\u00fbt, 1903, il avait enti\u00e8rement r\u00e9ussi. La captation augmentera avec le temps. La suggestion viendra plus tard n\u00e9cessairement.\nNous avons signal\u00e9 assez de la preuve pour constater que la plainte de la mauvaise nourriture, imagin\u00e9e et lanc\u00e9e par Ars\u00e8ne, eut un effet terrible sur l'esprit faible et malade de Joseph. Il para\u00eet plus calme apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la campagne pendant une couple de mois chez ses parents \u00e0 Deschambault, \u00e9loign\u00e9 d'Ars\u00e8ne. Il en revint en novembre, 1903, se sentant un peu mieux. \"Il n'y avait pas beaucoup de diff\u00e9rence,\" observe son medecin d'alors, le Dr. Quintal. Il cessa, cependant, de voir les medecins. Mais la maladie que le Dr. Quintal appelle \"Duplicas pulmonaire aigu,\" faisait son \u0153uvre sourdement, mais s\u00fbrement; elle devient formidable en janvier et f\u00e9vrier, 1904. Il va consulter le Dr. Rottot, un ancien praticien tr\u00e8s en vue \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et plus tard d'autres sp\u00e9cialistes. Il leur dit \u00e0 tous que c'est la cuisine de sa femme qui le tue, d'abord au Dr. Rottot en janvier ou f\u00e9vrier, 1904, au Dr. Masson le 2 mars, 1904, au Dr. Bruneau le lendemain ou le surlendemain, aux pr\u00eatres de sa paroisse et enfin \u00e0 tous ceux qui venaient en contact avec lui. Qu'il me suffise de citer quelques t\u00e9moins.\nLe Dr. Masson, qui fit un examen du malade \u00e0 son bureau le 2 mars, 1904, dit, notes \u00e9crites en mains:\nJ'ai dit tant\u00f4t que la maladie dont souffrait monsieur Dussault \u00e9tait le d\u00e9lire; il d\u00e9lirait quand il est venu me voir, c'est dire qu'il souffrait d'un affaiblissement intellectuel consid\u00e9rable, il \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat de stupeur et puis en m\u00eame temps suivait une crise de larmes et il devenait excit\u00e9 pas mal, il fallait aller jusqu'\u00e0 le secouer un peu pour l'amener \u00e0 donner quelques r\u00e9ponses. Je lui ai demande ce qu'il avait, il revenait toujours au m\u00eame sujet, le sujet de sa femme. Il se plaignait am\u00e8rement de sa femme, il disait.\u2014j'ai tr\u00e8s bonne m\u00e9moire de ces faits, \u00e7a m'avait frapp\u00e9, c'est l\u00e0-dessus que je base le fait du d\u00e9lire chez lui,\u2014il disait que sa femme ne lui donnait pas une nourriture suffisante, qu'elle l'avait abandonn\u00e9 pour travailler dans une fabrique et bien des choses; c'\u00e9tait toujours le sujet de sa femme qui venait dans ses paroles.\nIl n'y a pas l'ombre de preuve qu'elle l'abandonna ou parl\u00e2t de le faire. Ars\u00e8ne l'admet lui m\u00eame. Seule ment, comme son mari lui reprochait toujours de le nourrir mal, elle lui proposa d'aller tous les deux se mettre dans une bonne pension; mais il trouvait que \u00e7a co\u00fbterait trop cher, et dans son bon c\u0153ur elle lui offrit d'aller travailler dans une manufacture pour l'aider \u00e0 payer la pension. Ils n'all\u00e8rent pas \u00e0 une pension et les \u00e9poux continu\u00e8rent de tenir maison au domicile ordinaire \u00e0 Maisonneuve.\nLe Dr. Bruneau, le medecin d'Ars\u00e8ne \u00e0 qui il l'envoya le 3 ou 4 mars, dit:\nQ. Pouvez-vous nous dire * * * vous souvenez-vous ce que Joseph Dussault vous a dit? ne s'est-il pas plaint de sa femme \u00e0 vous?\nR. Certainement.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit?\nR. Eh, bien, l'impression qui me reste, c'est qu'il avait des troubles de famille.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il ne vous a pas dit que sa femme ne lui donnait pas la nourriture dont il avait besoin? Ne s'est-il pas plaint devant vous?\nR. Il s'est plaint devant moi de la nourriture.\nLe jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 il fit son testament ou le lendemain, avant son d\u00e9part pour Deschambault, le 6 mars, il va dire bonjour \u00e0 son cur\u00e9, Mr. Dugas, et dans le cours de la conversation lui fait la d\u00e9claration suivante:\nR. Il m'a dit que s'il mourrait, c'\u00e9tait par manque de soins, que son \u00e9pouse avait refus\u00e9 de l'a traiter convenablement.\nQ. A-t-il parl\u00e9 de la nourriture que son \u00e9pouse lui donnait?\nR. Oui, qu'elle ne voulait pas lui faire la nourriture qu'il lui demandait; il m'a dit qu'il lui avait m\u00eame offert d'avoir une cuisini\u00e8re, et qu'elle avait refus\u00e9, qu'elle n'avait pas voulu en prendre, que c'\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle il avait souffert.\nTous ces avanc\u00e9s \u00e9taient faux; non, elle n'a pas refus\u00e9 une cuisini\u00e8re, en f\u00e9vrier elle en fit venir une Mme. L'Heureux. Enfin, le 13 mars, lorsque Joseph \u00e9tait avec ses parents \u00e0 Deschambault, voici le langage qu'il tint au Dr. Lord:\nIl m'a dit que s'il \u00e9tait comme cela, s'il \u00e9tait dans cet \u00e9tat-l\u00e0, cela d\u00e9pendait qu'il avait manqu\u00e9 de bonne nourriture, que sa femme ne savait pas faire la nourriture, qu'il avait souffert, depuis qu'il \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance compl\u00e8te qui l'avait conduit \u00e0 ce point-l\u00e0.\nQ. Vous a-t-il dit autre chose?\nR. Il m'a dit qu'il avait consult\u00e9 les m\u00e9decins \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et qu'ils lui avaient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette insuffisance de nourriture l\u00e0 pouvait \u00eatre la cause de son \u00e9tat.\nIl se fait encore illusion. Pas un medecin n'est venu jurer cela. M\u00eame si c'\u00e9tait vrai, l'opinion ne vaudrait rien, \u00e9tant appuy\u00e9e sur des faits imaginaires qui n'exist\u00e8rent pas en dehors de l'imagination d'Ars\u00e8ne et de Joseph.\nOn comprend qu'un esprit fauss\u00e9 et mont\u00e9, comme \u00e9tait celui de Joseph Dussault, ne pouvait librement disposer de ses biens et r\u00e9voquer un testament, particuli\u00e8rement si l'on consid\u00e8re son \u00e9tat de faiblesse de corps et d'esprit. Nous pourrions laisser la preuve ici et conclure que l'intim\u00e9 a obtenu le testament du 5 mars, 1904, par fraude, captation et influence indue. Mais l'histoire de la suggestion n'est pas moins instructive, car elle nous fait conna\u00eetre le motif de ces men\u00e9es frauduleuses, l'objet qu'Ars\u00e8ne poursuivait.\nSon but \u00e9tait d'obtenir la r\u00e9vocation du premier testament et l'ex\u00e9cution d'un autre en faveur des siens, et de lui m\u00eame avant tout. Il ne para\u00eet pas avoir abord\u00e9 ce sujet au commencement de la maladie durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 ou l'automne de 1903. Ars\u00e8ne craignait peut-\u00eatre que Joseph soup\u00e7onnerait son jeu, s'il montrait son int\u00e9r\u00e8t. Il attendit donc que la captation fut bien compl\u00e8te. Ce fut l'\u0153uvre de quelques mois. Ars\u00e8ne jure qu'il n'a jamais connu l'existence d'un testament ant\u00e9rieur avant l'occasion o\u00f9 il fut question de faire le testament dont la nullit\u00e9 est demand\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire, vers le 4 mars, 1904, mais il ajoute que, m\u00eame \u00e0 cette date, il ne savait pas comment il \u00e9tait fait. Joseph lui a dit qu'il \u00e9tait s\u00e9par\u00e9 de biens, mais rien de plus:\nQ. Vous jurez qu'il ne vous a pas dit qu'il avait donn\u00e9 ses biens \u00e0 sa femme le lendemain de son mariage?\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Vous, jurez cela?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nComment croire en la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de ces r\u00e9ponses. L'intim\u00e9 habite constamment pendant sept ans avec son fr\u00e8re \u00e0 leur place d'affaires et au domicile priv\u00e9; ils se voyaient le jour et la nuit; ils sont non seulement fr\u00e8res mais associ\u00e9s en toutes choses; il est m\u00eame son confident, s'il faut croire ce qu'il all\u00e8gue dans son plaidoyer, mais il ne lui a jamais parl\u00e9 du testament fait \u00e0 sa femme. Cette histoire est bien invraisemblable, et il ne faut pas s'\u00e9tonner si elle est contredite. Voici d'abord ce que dit l'appelante:\nQ. Est-il \u00e0 votre connaissance que monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault savait qu'il y avait un testament de votre d\u00e9funt mari en votre faveur?\nR. Oui, il le savait au commencement d'ao\u00fbt.\nQ. De quelle ann\u00e9e?\nR. Au commencement d'ao\u00fbt, 1903, mon mari a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 devant Ars\u00e8ne Dussault et devant ma s\u0153ur H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mayrand qu'il m'avait tout donn\u00e9 ses biens et que je pouvais \u00eatre tranquille, que j'\u00e9tais certaine qu'apr\u00e8s sa mort tous ses biens me reviendraient; quelque temps apr\u00e8s, il a dit encore devant les m\u00eames personnes qu'apr\u00e8s la mort de la femme les biens devaient retourner au mari, et que les biens du mari devaient retourner \u00e0 la femme.\nPuis vient le t\u00e9moignage d'H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mayrand: Q. Est-il \u00e0 votre connaissance que monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault savait qu'il y avait un testament en faveur de madame Dussault?\nR. Ils ont parle du testament un jour, au commencement d'ao\u00fbt, 1903, monsieur Joseph Dussault a dit \u00e0 sa femme devant monsieur Ars\u00e8ne Dussault que sa femme pouvait \u00eatre tranquille, que les papiers \u00e9taient pass\u00e9s entre les deux, qu'elle pouvait \u00eatre certaine que tous les biens qu'il poss\u00e9dait lui retourneraient \u00e0 sa mort; dans une autre occasion que les biens du mari devaient retourner \u00e0 la femme et que les biens de la femme devaient retourner \u00e0 son mari.\nQ. C'\u00e9tait dans le mois d'ao\u00fbt?\nR. Oui, au commencement d'ao\u00fbt.\nQ. 1903?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nTransquestionn\u00e9e par M. Bonin C.R.:\nQ. Maintenant, recontez donc madame ce qu'a dit monsieur Joseph Dussault, de quelles expressions il s'est servi quand il a dit que la femme devait laisser les biens au mari et que le mari devait laisser les biens \u00e0 la femme, vous rappelez-vous \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s comment est venue cette conversation?\nR. C'est venu sur une question insignifiante.\nQ. Dites-le toujours?\nR. Il s'agissait des biens, il y avait une autre personne de morte et ses biens retournait \u00e0 d'autres personnes et c'est sur cette question-l\u00e0 qu'il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que les biens du mari devaient retourner \u00e0 la femme. Monsieur Joseph Dussault trouvait la chose bien injuste de ne pas laisser les biens \u00e0 sa femme et de les donner \u00e0 un autre, alors il a dit, ce qui appartenait \u00e0 la femme devait retourner au mari, et ce qui appartenait au mari devait retourner \u00e0 le femme, qu'il devaient se donner cela l'un \u00e0 l'autre.\nArs\u00e8ne a d\u00fb comprendre par l\u00e0 qu'en ao\u00fbt, 1903, le moment n'\u00e9tait pas encore arriv\u00e9 de parler de la r\u00e9vocation du premier testament. Joseph avait des id\u00e9es trop arr\u00eat\u00e9es sur le sujet, puis que dans son testament \u00e0 sa femme il ne fait aucune r\u00e9serve au cas o\u00f9 ils auraient des enfants. Ars\u00e8ne n'avait pas d'autre chose \u00e0 faire qu'\u00e0 attendre et il attendit, continuant toujours ses lamentations sur la nourriture.\nEn janvier et f\u00e9vrier, 1904, la maladie avait pris une nouvelle phase, elle marchait rapidement. Joseph, accompagn\u00e9 de sa femme, va voir le Dr. Rottot trois ou quatre fois. Le Dr. le trouve ramolli, que \u00e7a fut caus\u00e9 par la tuberculose ou par d'autre chose, il ne peut pas se rappeler, n'ayant pas pris de notes. Il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s malade et toussait beaucoup. L'abb\u00e9 Chauss\u00e9 le rencontre dans la rue et lui recommande d'aller voir le Dr. Masson. Il s'y rend seul le 2 mars. Le patient \u00e9tait dans le d\u00e9lire. Le docteur t\u00e9lephone de suite \u00e0 Mr. Chauss\u00e9 que Joseph Dussault avait perdu la t\u00eate et qu'il serait mort dans trois semaines. Le m\u00eame jour, le 2 mars, Mr. Chauss\u00e9 communique cette r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 Ars\u00e8ne, qui \u00e9videmment ne pensait comme le docteur, surtout qu'il f\u00fbt fou. Il l'envoie de suite, le 3 mars, chez son propre m\u00e9decin, le Dr. Bruneau, qui le trouve sain d'esprit, capable de faire un testament, mais il ajoute qu'il \u00e9tait gravement malade, souffrant de tuberculose pulmonaire aigu\u00eb, avec des signes d'\u00e9puisements nerveux et une fi\u00e8vre de 103 d\u00e9gr\u00e9s, et qu'il n'irait pas loin. Enfin, le lendemain, le Dr. Bruneau donne communication \u00e0 Ars\u00e8ne du r\u00e9sultat de sa consultation par l'entremise de son fr\u00e8re Laurent. De suite il comprend qu'il n'y a pas de temps \u00e0 perdre. Il ne dit rien \u00e0 l'appelante de ce qu'il venait d'apprendre. Il ne songe pas \u00e0 l'envoyer \u00e0 confesse. Il y \u00e9tait all\u00e9 il est vrai deux fois \u00e0 la fin de f\u00e9vrier ou dans les premiers jours de mars. D'ailleurs Joseph \u00e9tait un bon chr\u00e9tien qui communiait tous les mois. Non, ce n'\u00e9tait pas le pr\u00eatre qu'Ars\u00e8ne d\u00e9sirait. C'\u00e9tait un notaire, non pas un du voisinage, mais son propre notaire, Mr. Lesage, qui avait son bureau \u00e0 trois ou quatre milles et qui avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi le notaire de Joseph. Ars\u00e8ne saisit l'occasion o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait dans le bureau de la boutique, le 4 mars. A cette entrevue, on parle de faire un testament. Impossible de dire ce qui se passa et ce qui fut dit, \u00e0 moins de croire Ars\u00e8ne et son fr\u00e8re Laurent, un autre b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, pr\u00e9sent une partie du temps, qui ne se rappelle de rien, si ce n'est que Joseph voulait donner ses biens \u00e0 sa famille, faire une plus large part \u00e0 Ars\u00e8ne et laisser \u00e0 sa femme une rente viag\u00e8re de $75. C'\u00e9tait tout naturel apr\u00e8s le travail qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Ars\u00e8ne dit tout na\u00efvement:\nIl (Joseph) m'a dit: \"De quelle mani\u00e8re vais-je faire mon testament?\" Je lui ai dit: \"Fais ton testament de la mani\u00e8re que tu voudras et ce que tu feras sera bien fait, ne te trouble pas, ne t'inqui\u00e8te pas de cela.\"\nMais il vaut mieux laisser parler les faits. Ils sont plus \u00e9loquents que les paroles. Le jour m\u00eame o\u00f9 Ars\u00e8ne re\u00e7oit le rapport du Dr. Bruneau, il parle de testament avec Joseph. Il va de suite pr\u00e9venir son propre notaire, Lesage, qui connait bien les affaires de Joseph. Il lui recommande de garder le secret de ses mouvements, car Joseph ne veut pas que sa femme sache ce qui se passe. Il va louer une chambre dans le restaurant \"La Boule D'or,\" situ\u00e9 dans le voisinage, et il offre d'en payer le loyer lui m\u00eame. Le 5 mars au matin, vers les dix heures, il attend le notaire qu'il dirige vers le restaurant. Puis il rentre pr\u00e9venir son fr\u00e8re Joseph et l'invite \u00e0 sortir pour prendre l'air. Il le dirige aussi vers le restaurant, le suivant de pr\u00e9s. Tous trois montent le premier escalier, Joseph avec beaucomp de peine, tant il \u00e9tait faible. Joseph passe ses papiers au notaire. On fait l'estimation des biens. Joseph dit au notaire comment les distribuer, puis il se couche sur un sofa en attendant que le notaire \u00e9crive son acte. Tout le temps, Ars\u00e8ne est l\u00e0 qui ne le l\u00e2che pas de vue, except\u00e8 le temps qu'il fallait pour t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au second notaire Paquin, l'associ\u00e9 de Lesage, pratiquant dans le m\u00eame bureau, de venir servir de second notaire. Bar une \u00e9trange dis position, arts. 843, 844, le code civil permet \u00e0 un associ\u00e9 d'agir ainsi comme t\u00e9moin et seul t\u00e9moin en sa qualit\u00e9 de second notaire, tandis que les clercs et les serviteurs du notaire instrumentant ne le peuvent.\nPaquin fut longtemps \u00e0 venir. Ars\u00e8ne, impatient, sort de nouveau et l'attend \u00e0 la porte. Il le voit venir du cot\u00e9 de la maison de Joseph. Le notaire lui expliqua qu'il n'avait pas bien compris son rendez-vous et qu'il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 chez Joseph pour se renseigner. Ars\u00e8ne s'alarme \u00e0 cette nouvelle. Le secret allait-il s'\u00e9venter? Ars\u00e8ne, revenu aupr\u00e8s du notaire et de son fr\u00e8re avec Paquin, mentionne le fait et tous conviennent, \u00e0 la suggestion de Joseph, dit-on, de dire que les notaires \u00e9taient venus pour signer des papiers concernant une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la rue de Montigny que les deux fr\u00e8res venaient de vendre. Le testament fut de suite lu et sign\u00e9. Le testateur pleura et remarqua \u00e0 Ars\u00e8ne qu'il regrettait de ne pas lui laisser plus. Il avait r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 formellement son premier testament et institu\u00e9 Ars\u00e8ne son l\u00e9gataire universel, \u00e0 la charge de quelques legs particuliers \u00e0 ses p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs. Sa femme \u00e9tait d\u00e9sh\u00e9rit\u00e9e. Il ne lui donna m\u00eame pas la rente de $75. A sa place, le notaire le persuada de lui donner une police d'assurance de $1,000 dont elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 la propri\u00e9taire et b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiare. Il pousse le farce encore plus loin. Il confirme le don du m\u00e9nage qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 la femme par le contrat de mariage. Pourquoi cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la femme? Un rayon de lumi\u00e8re \u00e9tait-il venu frapper le c\u0153ur et l'esprit de Joseph? Fallait-il satisfaire sa conscience d'honn\u00eate homme tout en ne donnant rien? Je suis convaincu que le testateur n'a pas compris que par ses ratifications, il faisait des lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s \u00e0 sa femme. Il \u00e9tait tellement irrit\u00e9 contre elle qu'il lui aurait enlev\u00e9 tout, police et m\u00e9nage, si la chose avait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible. Le notaire ne lui a rien expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Le tour avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 merveille. Joseph \u00e9tait consentant \u00e0 signer le testament tel que pr\u00e9par\u00e9, et cela suffisait.\nLe notaire Lesage lorsqu'il fut examin\u00e9, d\u00e9clare que Joseph \u00e9tait trop faible pour signer; mais en regardant \u00e0 sa minute, il constata le contraire. Ars\u00e8ne resta pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du testament du commencement \u00e0 la fin et jura d'abord qu'il l'avait sign\u00e9. Il n'est pas moins certain qu'il fut t\u00e9moin de ce testament comme le notaire Lesage et bien plus que le notaire Paquin. La loi annulle les legs faits aux t\u00e9moins comme pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s faits en fraude[8]. Ici la fraude et le dol sont prouv\u00e9s et c'est tout le testament qui est frapp\u00e9[9].\nLe testament termin\u00e9, chacun se rendit chez soi. Tout fut gard\u00e9 dans le plus profond secret. Le lendemain apr\u00eas midi, Joseph partait pour Deschambault accompagn\u00e9 de ses deux fr\u00e8res jusqu'\u00e0 la gare et de Laurent seulement durant le voyage par le chemin de fer jusqu'\u00e0 Deschambault. La femme for\u00e7ait pour descendre avec lui, pour me servir de son expression, mais son mari ne voulut pas. Vers le 15 mars, son beau-p\u00e8re la fit mander, et \u00e0 compter de ce jour elle ne cessa de lui prodiguer ses soins les plus assidus, jour et nuit, soins qu'il n'a pu appr\u00e9cier, car il d\u00e9lirait presque tout le temps. Il est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 9 avril, 1904, \u00e0 Deschambault, o\u00f9 il fut inhum\u00e9 deux jours apr\u00e8s. Ars\u00e8ne n'assista pas \u00e0 ses fun\u00e9railles; il ne le vit plus apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9part de Maisonneuve le 6 mars. La vue de ses deux victimes aurait probablement augment\u00e9 ses remords. Ce n'est que quelques jours apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Maisonneuve, vers le 15 avril, que l'appelante fut inform\u00e9e de l'ex\u00e9cution du deuxi\u00e8me testament. De l\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action que nous croyons devoir maintenir pour cause de suggestion et de captation ou d'influence indue.\nNon seulement l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption de fraude du droit anglais, consacr\u00e9e par les d\u00e9cisions des plus hautes cours du Royaume-Uni, que nous avons signal\u00e9es en commen\u00e7ant, pr\u00e9somption de fait que je serais dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre dans notre droit comme affectant la libert\u00e9 de tester qui nous vient des lois anglaises (Renaud v. Lamothe[10]; art. 1238 C.C.) Qu'elle existe ou non dans notre droit, la preuve, que nous venons d'analyser, \u00e9tablit une cha\u00eene de circonstances graves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes qui ne laissent aucun doute qu'il a obtenu ce testament par le dol et la fraude et par cons\u00e9quent ne justifient pas d'autre alternative que celle de renverser le judgment dont est appel, m\u00eame s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par deux cours apr\u00e8s d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations; car comme cette cour l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en maintes occasions, nous sommes les juges des faits comme du droit et c'est notre devoir de renverser deux ou m\u00eame trois cours, lorsque nous voyons clairment qu'il y a eu erreur.

Scott & Son (Defendants) Respondents.\n1907: March 12; 1907: April 2.\nPresent: Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Amount in controversy\u2014Creditor\u2019s action\u2014Transfer of cheque\u2014Preference.\nAn action was brought by creditors, on behalf of themselves and all other creditors, of an insolvent to set aside the transfer of a cheque for $1,172.27 made by the insolvent to S. & Son as being a preference and therefore void. At the trial the action was dismissed and this judgment was affirmed by the Divisional Court (12 Ont. L.R. 91) and by the Court of Appeal (13 Ont. L.R. 232). On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, Girouard J. dissenting, that the only matter in controversy was the property in the sum represented by the cheque and such sum being more than $1,000 the appeal would lie.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of a divisional court[2] which maintained the judgment at the trial dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action. The plaintiffs had judgment against the insolvent McGillivray for over $1,000 which had, however, been reduced by payment to less than that amount. They sued on behalf of all creditors for a declaration that a transfer by McGillivray to the respondents Scott & Son of a cheque for $1,172.27, as being preferential and void and to recover the proceeds thereof for distribution among all the creditors. The action having been dismissed, plaintiffs took an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nShepley K.C. for the respondents moved to quash. We move to quash on the grounds that, in this case, there can be no right of appeal without special leave and such leave was refused by the court appealed from, and there being no pecuniary demand involved. If, however, there can be said to be some pecuniary amount involved, then the appellants\u2019 interest is below $1,000 and there can be no appeal de plano. The appellants\u2019 suit could be put an end to by paying less than $1,000, the limitation in cases of appeals from Ontario. In any case, the respondents, (defendants) are likewise creditors of the estate in question and thus would be entitled to about one-half of any amount that might be involved in the subject matter in controversy, the amount of the cheque sought to be brought back into the estate, consequently, any issue on this appeal must involve less than the appealable amount. It does not fall within section 48(c) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d We rely upon Talbot v. Guilmartin[3]; Donohue v. Donohue[4]; Clement v. La Banque Nationale[5]; Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements[6]; The Canadian Breweries Co. v. Gari\u00e9py[7]; Driffill v. Ough[8]; Commercial Bank v. Wilson[9]. The case of Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[10] must be distinguished from this case, because there was in that case a third party claiming all the property in dispute which exceeds $3,000 in value. The case of The City of Ottawa v. Hunter[11] is similar to the present.\nChrysler K.C. contra. The original amount of the appellants\u2019 claim was over $1,000, although it has been reduced since the action was instituted by payment of $100 on account, and the amount in controversy upon the appeal must govern jurisdiction. The balance of the debt claimed carried interest, and, this interest being added, would bring the amount to a sum in excess of $1,000 at the time of the appeal in the court below. The suit is on behalf of all creditors and all claims, exclusive of that of the defendants, being added would considerably increase the amount. The City of Ottawa v. Hunter11 is not incompatible with our position and Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements6 was a case from the Province of Quebec where the appellant sued only for his personal claim and where the conditions governing appeals to this court are regulated by the amount of the demand and not by the sum in controversy on the appeal. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant, a creditor) of the defendant McGillivray for the sum of $900, brought a suit on behalf of himself and all other creditors against the respondents to have it declared that a transfer of a cheque for the sum of $1,172.27, made by McGillivray to Scott, was preferential and void and to recover for purposes of distribution among all the creditors the proceeds of such cheque.\nThe action was dismissed by the High Court and this appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which confirmed the judgment of the High Court.\nA preliminary question of jurisdiction is raised.\nWhat is the matter in controversy between the parties upon which the right to appeal depends? (Section 48, sub-section c, \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d). Undoubtedly the cheque the proceeds of which it is sought by the action to bring into the estate for distribution. In this proceeding that is the only issue. If the appellant succeeds here, the result will be in so far as the judgment of this court is concerned to set aside the transfer as fraudulent and void, and condemn the defendants to pay over the proceeds of the cheque for distribution among all the creditors in whose interest the suit is brought. There is no controversy as to the amount of plaintiff\u2019s claim, he sues as one of a class. In Canadian Breweries Co. v. Gari\u00e9py[12], to which reference was made at the argument, there was no pecuniary amount in controversy. All that the tierce-opposant asked for and that which he was denied by the judgment appealed from was the permission of the court to come in and by a subsequent proceeding contest a judgment previously rendered. The only question in issue was his right to institute a proceeding which was denied him by the judgment appealed from. There was no matter in controversy which could be appreciated in money and if that appeal had been allowed the result of our judgment would have been not a condemnation to pay a sum of money but a mere declaration that in the circumstances the opposant had an interest sufficient in that proceeding to justify the filing by him of \u201can opposition to judgment\u201d\nMy brother Idington deals in his notes with the case of Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[13]\nMotion to quash dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the motion to quash should be granted. I cannot distinguish this case from The Canadian Breweries Co. v. Gari\u00e9py[14], decided this term. Relying upon that case, and also upon the decisions of this court quoted in my dissenting judgment in the case of Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[15], I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the majority.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is a motion by the respondents for an order quashing the appeal herein.\nThe action was brought by the appellant on behalf of themselves and all other creditors of defendant McGillivray to have it declared that the transfer by McGillivray to the respondent Scott of a certain cheque was as against the creditors of McGillivray preferential and void and to recover for purposes of distribution amongst the creditors of defendant McGillivray the proceeds of the said cheque.\nThe action was tried before the Hon. Chief Justice Falconbridge on the 7th November, 1905, and dismissed. An appeal was taken to the Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice for Ontario and by that court dismissed. The later appeal from such dismissal was taken to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and also dismissed. It is from this dismissal by the Court of Appeal that the plaintiff, now appellant here, proposes an appeal to this court. The questions raised on this motion are whether or not such an appeal will lie as of right. It is said and not denied that the judgment got by the appellant against the debtor McGillivray was for a sum exceeding $1,000, but since the recovery of that judgment, $100 has been paid thereon reducing the amount now due below the sum $1,000. It is shewn that the cheque in question was for an amount exceeding $1,000. It appears that McGillivray\u2019s total liabilities are much in excess of the sum of $1,000.\nThe question raised is shortly, whether or not the amount of the judgment against the debtor or the amount of the security sought to be recovered and made applicable to pay said judgment debt, and all other debts of the said McGillivray, is to be looked at as the test of the amount of the matter in controversy in appeal within the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d R.S.C. [1906] ch. 139, section 48, sub-section (c).\nIt seems difficult if not impossible to reconcile all the decisions upon the jurisdiction of this court.\nIt is exceedingly desirable that any decision in regard thereto should proceed upon the broad ground of whether or not the particular case for sonsideration comes within the purview of the Act conferring jurisdiction rather than by refining upon the possible meanings that may be attributable to a few words in the Act to be considered.\nThe words, when isolated, may be susceptible of many diverse meanings. Some of these meanings may be found quite inapt when viewed in light of the general scope and purpose of the Act in which they are found.\nIn the judgment of this court in the case of Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.15, at p. 49, the following language was used:\nIt is not necessary that the amount in controversy should be a sum of money. The statute was intended to cover also the value of the thing demanded, the object being to give this court jurisdiction to hear and decide appeals in cases where the issues involved a consideration of sufficient value to justify the appeal.\nIf we apply this broad ground of the purview of the Act and this language to the consideration of the questions raised by this motion, can there be any doubt that the principles upon which the decision in Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.15 proceeded and that decision, must lead to holding that the Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal now presented.\nIn substance Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.15 was only what in Ontario would be called an interpleader.\nThe creditor there, if successful ultimately, would have had to share the fruits of his victory with other creditors. The claimant of the goods in that case had succeeded in the court below.\nThe creditor, contesting that, came here with a judgment insufficient in amount, if that amount were to govern the right of appeal, so as to give it as of right.\nWe held the value of the goods attached, which all hung upon the same title, must decide the matter in controversy.\nIt was more difficult to reach that conclusion in a case like that coming from Quebec, than it would have been in an interpleader case coming from Ontario.\nThe provisions of the Act relative to the appeals from Quebec rendered it so, and the many decisions (hard to reconcile) upon those provisions, rendered it still more so.\nWhat we have here in question is the title of the respondent as against creditors to a cheque which was liable to seizure to satisfy the claims of creditors of the payee, if respondent\u2019s title was void as against them.\nHad the cheque been seized by the sheriff, as the wood in Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[16] by the bailiff, the cases could not have been by any possibility distinguished, so as to enable us to refuse to hear the appeal of the creditor.\nThe procedure by which the attack on the title is made certainly cannot in reason and justice make any difference.\nBut when we consider what the nature of the action here in question is, and the judgment we would be bound to render if the appeal should succeed, can there be any doubt in the matter?\nThe appellant sues on behalf of himself and all other creditors, and if he succeed in his proposed appeal, the judgment here must be that the respondent account for the full amount of the cheque to answer the claims of the creditors.\nThese claims it appears as stated above exceed in the aggregate the amount in controversy necessary to give jurisdiction.\nIt is no answer to this to say that the appellant may as dominus litis drop his appeal for any reason he see fit, as he could have dropped his action for any reason he might have seen fit.\nEven in this light of the amount involved the appellant suing so as to represent an aggregate sum, over $1,000, has much to support him.\nI would prefer, however, to test and to rest the right of appeal upon the value of the property in question.\nIt will, if adhered to, work out much more satisfactorily than the test suggested by respondent as a test of jurisdiction in a large class of cases possible to arise in Ontario and those provinces and territories which have the same system of law and have adopted the same sort of legislation as Ontario, for the realization of the rights of creditors in many ways as against those seeking to defeat creditors or the majority of creditors.\nIt would seem anomalous to have appellant deprived of right of appeal in this case and right of appeal allowed an assignee representing all creditors though the security in question were the same.\nIn this connection the Act respecting assignments and preferences by insolvent persons R.S.O., 1897, ch. 147, must be borne in mind.\nThe mode of attacking an alleged fraudulent assignment adopted in this case is not perhaps so usual as that of a creditor who cannot after an assignment under said Act, persuade his fellow creditors to venture to make the attack, but is given, no matter how small his claim, the right under conditions to attack in the name of the assignee what may be fraudulent on a large scale when that is tested by the value of the property in question.\nIt seems to me that the decision in Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[17] should not be lightly frittered away.\nThe case of The Canadian Breweries Co. v. Gari\u00e9py[18] was clearly distinguished and though in view of the ultimate results which the appellant sought there to reach might seem in reason and justice a proper case to be placed on the same footing as Cot\u00e9 v. The James Richardson Co.[19] it would have been legislating rather than adjudicating to have so applied the latter.\nThe status of an appellant in relation to any possible right to be acquired over a thing by pursuing it in litigation as a means of testing the amount in controversy, is not only in principle distinguishable but by a long line of authorities in this court, distinguished from the test afforded by the possible fruits he may hope to reach by such pursuit.\nThe motion should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. concurred with the Chief Justice. Motion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gibbons, Harper & Gibbons.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Blewett & Bray.\n[1] 13 Ont. L.R. 232; Sub nom. Robinson v.

In order to afford relief, an order in council was passed waiving certain conditions, provisoes and stipulations contained in the contract. By the judgment appealed from, the judge of the Exchequer Court held (10 Ex. C.R. 248) that there had been no such changes as would entitle the contractors to recover on the quantum meruit, as in the case of Bush v. The Trustees of the Town and Harbour of Whitehaven (52 J.P. 392; 2 Hudson on Building Contracts (2 ed.) 121); that the words \"shall decide in accordance with the stipulations in such contract\" in the thirty-third section of \"The Exchequer Court Act\" might be treated as directory only and effect given to the waiver in respect to the absence of written directions or certificates by the engineer in regard to works done, but that the remaining clauses of the section were imperative and there could be no valid waiver whereby a larger sum than the amount stipulated in the contract could be recovered, e.g., on prices for the classes of work, so as to give the contractors a legal claim for higher rates of compensation without a new agreement under proper authority and for good consideration. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, per Girouard, Davies and Maclennan JJ., that the decision of the judge of the Exchequer Court was correct.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ.\u2014That the word \"stipulations\" in the first part of the section referred to, should be construed as having relation entirely to the second part of the section and as applying to the rates of compensation fixed by the contract; that, on either construction, the result would be the same in so far as the circumstances of the case were concerned; that it did not warrant an implication that the executive could without proper authority, exceed its powers in relation to a fully executed contract or confer the power to dispense with the requirements of the statute, and that, consequently, there could not be a recovery upon quantum meruit.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], by which the petition of right of the suppliants was in part allowed and certain items of the claim made by them were dismissed, the question of costs being reserved.\nThe suppliants claim was for works executed in widening and deepening a portion of the Grenville Canal, a public work of Canada, under a contract with the Crown, acting through the Minister of Railways and Canals for Canada, which referred to certain plans and specifications describing the works to be done. The claim was for $154,244.93, with interest, for construction works, including dry masonry walling, most of which had been disallowed by the engineer in charge of the works, and was classified as follows according to the grounds upon which the items were based, namely:\n(1) The contract and specifications contemplated that the work should be done in open season and unwatered and required performance in such a way as could be done only during the summer season and could not properly be done during the season of frost. The contractors were nevertheless required to carry out the work in the winter season and claimed for the increased cost of its execution. (2) The contractors claimed that there was mutual error and misunderstanding in respect of a part of the material to be excavated, much of which was \"hard pan,\" and a special price ought to have been and, if it had been known, would have been fixed for excavation of this material. The contract ought to be reformed in this respect or other relief granted so as to allow for such price. (3) The specifications provided for a higher price and quality of stone and masonry in the walls of the weir than for the side-walls. The engineer required them to furnish the higher quality of stone for the side-walls and to execute that work in the same manner as the weir-walls and they were allowed for this work at the lower rate instead of the higher prices. (4) They claimed for delays and damages caused by reason of the fact that the work had to be done during the season of frost and during winter and by reason of mistakes, alterations and erroneous directions of the resident engineer.\nThese claims were represented to the Minister of Railways and Canals, who, thereupon, reported to the Governor-General in Council and, upon his recommendation, there was passed an order in council which recited the four grounds of claim and directed that, in the event of a petition of right being preferred, the provisions of the contract and specifications which would or might bar any of the claims in so far and in so far only as they would prevent a consideration of any such claims on its merits aside from such provisions should be waived; and particularly also all provisions and conditions in respect to the fixing of prices by the engineer the requirements and the directions in writing and certificates from him and the finality of his decisions referred to in certain clauses and all similar provisions and conditions in other clauses of the contract.\nThe judgment appealed from allowed part of the amount claimed and dismissed the petition as to the remainder, holding, in effect, as stated in the head-note of the report.\nWatson K.C. and Neil Sinclair for the appellants. The suppliants contend that the circumstances under which the works were executed were so changed from those contemplated that the special conditions of the contract were inapplicable and that the contractors were therefore entitled to recover upon a quantum meruit; that it was contemplated that the works should be done in open season and with the canal unwatered, whereas, with the exception of short periods in the spring after the frost was out of the ground and before the canal was open to navigation and shorter periods in the autumn after navigation closed and before winter set in, the work was done either in winter or with the water in the canal; that the work of unwatering was a part of the work, which could not be done without unwatering, and a condition precedent to the proper performance of the work.\nIn accordance with the order in council, the claims stood for consideration upon a quantum meruit, and so the trial judge states, but, through error he further states that the appellants contended that they were entitled on two grounds\u2014one of which existed at the time the final estimate was made, while the other had arisen since. Here the learned trial judge misconceived the position of the appellants and their rights under the order in council. He was not asked to review or consider the circumstances and conditions which led to the granting or passing of the order in council. Those circumstances and conditions had been fully considered, passed upon and approved by His Excellency in Council and the order formed the basis of the claim and the foundation of the petition.\nIt was not for the judge at the trial to consider and determine whether the appellants were entitled to claim upon the quantum meruit; that had been previously considered and passed upon by the Crown and the petition came before the court to be determined upon the quantum meruit.\nThe judgment below considers the circumstances and conditions and passes upon the question as to whether the appellants were entitled to recover upon a quantum meruit, refers to provisions and clauses of the contract and paragraphs of the specifications and concludes that the case is not one in which the contractors are entitled to treat the contract as at an end and to recover upon a quantum meruit, which conclusion was not warranted. It is wholly inconsistent with the position of the appellants and of the respondent and at variance with the whole basis and foundation of the petition of right.\nThe judgment decides that it is not possible for it to give effect to the contention of the appellants based upon the order in council, even if it were thought to be well founded, because the provisions of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" section 33, would stand in the way of that being done and that the waiver of the clauses of the contract may not, therefore, be properly regarded by the court. We submit that the court should have proceeded in accordance with the order in council having regard to the fact that provisions of the contract and specifications had been waived and were not then being set up in answer to the claim, and, on the other hand, that such claim was to be disposed of without regard thereto and therefore upon a quantum meruit.\nIt was quite competent for the Crown to make this contract, to vary the same, to modify or waive provisions and conditions and so to fix a basis of determination of the rights as they existed between the Crown and the subject in litigation, and it is erroneous to hold that the relation of the parties should be based solely upon the original contract without regard to modifications therein intended to have full force and effect and to govern in the adjudication of the claim which was founded upon the highest legal consideration. Work and services had been done and material supplied to the Crown, the benefit of which had been obtained and received by the Crown, the value of which had not been paid.\nThe rulings of the learned trial judge throughout were quite consistent, and the result substantially a dismissal of the claim. With regard to almost every item the conclusion was that there was no ground in law for allowing the claim; that the terms of the original contract must prevail and that the order in council should be disregarded as illegal and not binding. In this respect the judge should not have taken any higher or different ground in considering the claim upon its merits than was presented to him or urged and taken by the respondent.\nWe submit that, in so far as the claims have been dismissed, disallowed or only partially allowed, such dismissal and disallowance or partial allowance are contrary to law and the weight of evidence and that the judgment in respect thereto should be set aside and reversed and judgment pronounced upon the merits of the claim; that all items of claim should be considered and determined as upon the quantum meruit for the amount as claimed in accordance with the evidence or, in the alternative, that a new trial should be directed or provision made by reference for the ascertainment and determination of the amount proper to be allowed as upon the quantum meruit.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent upheld the judgment appealed from upon the terms and conditions of the contract and for the reason stated by the Exchequer Court judge. It was also urged that the order in council was not intended to have the effect of altering the terms of the contract and, in fact, did not do so. Section 33 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" was relied on.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I agree in the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Burbidge in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court upon a petition presented therein by the appellants to recover from the respondent for certain work alleged to have been done on a public work and damages sustained by the suppliants (now appellants) in doing that work.\nI agree in the results arrived at by the learned trial judge and in the general reasoning by which he reached such results in a careful and exhaustive judgment.\nThis appeal turns upon the construction of section 33 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" which is as follows:\n33. In adjudicating upon any claim arising out of any contract in writing, the court shall decide in accordance with the stipulations in such contract, and shall not allow compensation to any claimant on the ground that he expended a larger sum of money in the performance of his contract than the amount stipulated for therein,\nI am not quite sure that the learned trial judge's interpretation or mode of interpreting this section is absolutely correct.\nAt first I was disposed to think the first part severable from the latter as the learned judge seems to hold; that is, the one directory and the other imperative.\nI am, however, disposed now, upon full consideration, to think that the word \"stipulations\" in the first part is to be read as relating entirely to the second part.\nReading the section as a whole and considering the obvious purpose and scope of it, are not the \"stipulations\" referred to those which refer to the compensation fixed by the contract?\nThe result of either interpretation is the same so far as it concerns this case; and possibly in almost all cases may be the same.\nI can, however, conceive of cases arising wherein the interpretation I suggest might lead to other re suits than the interpretation of the learned trial judge.\nI cannot add beyond this anything useful regarding his judgment.\nThe argument of the appellant's counsel here, I think, possibly calls for one or two observations.\nHe pressed upon us the view that his client was entitled to compensation as upon a quantum meruit, for the whole work done. He put this on alternative grounds. He claimed that the case comes within Bush v. The Trustees of The Town and Harbour of Whitehaven[2], and such cases, or that the order in council, in effect, so directed the case to be treated at trial that the basis of a quantum meruit must be adopted as to all the appellants' claims, else the order would have no effect; or that it should be read as if amending the contract and forming one that would be deleted of everything statutory or otherwise affecting appellants' claims to their right to have these allowed upon the quantum meruit basis.\nI cannot see how on the facts the Bush and Whitehaven Case(1) can apply. Nor can I read the order in council as capable of either of these several interpretations.\nIt has been given by the learned trial judge all the effect it expresses. I do not think we should seek in it an implication that might exceed the powers of the executive in relation to a contract fully executed, or an assertion, without parliamentary sanction, of a dispensing power over the imperative requirements of a statute.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.

VII. ch. 58 amending the Railway Act, 1903, (R.S.C. (1906) ch. 37, sec. 209) if an award by arbitrators on expropriation of land by a railway company exceeds $600 any dissatisfied party may appeal therefrom to a Superior Court which in Ontario means the High Court or the Court of Appeal (Interpretation Act R.S. [1906] ch. 1, sec. 34, sub-sec. 26).\nHeld, that if an appeal from an award is taken to the High Court there can be no further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada which cannot even give special leave.\nAPPEAL from a decision of Meredith C.J. of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario[1], increasing the award of arbitrators in proceedings for expropriation of plaintiff's land by the defendants.\nThe arbitrators awarded the plaintiff $1,170 which he considered insufficient, and appealed to the High Court where it was increased to $2,250. The Railway Co. then took an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada asking to have the original award of $1,170 restored. The plaintiff by cross-appeal claimed that the increase allowed by the High Court was insufficient and that he was entitled to a much larger sum.\nArmour K.C. and R.B. Henderson for the appellants after arguing the case for a time on the merits were called upon to support the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal.\nFor purposes of an appeal from an award under the Railway Act the High Court and Court of Appeal are on an equal footing. See Railway Act Amendment 3 Ed. VII. ch. 58, sec. 168 and Interpretation Act R.S. [1906] ch. 1, sec. 34(26). If an appeal is taken to the High Court there is no further appeal to the Court of Appeal, Birely v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Co.[2], and the High Court becomes the highest court of last resort in the province for these cases. Farquharson v. Imperial Oil Co.[3].\nDuVernet and Kyles for the respondent referred to Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. v. Judah[4], The Province of Ontario v. The Province of Quebec; In re Common School Fund and Lands[5].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014This is an appeal by a railway company and a cross-appeal by a landowner, in respect to the compensation to be allowed to the latter for land taken by the railway company for its track, and also for severance. Arbitrators were appointed in the usual manner, and a majority award was made on the 29th December, 1905, in favour of the respondent for the sum of $1,170.\nFrom this award an appeal was taken by the respondent, in pursuance of sec. 168 of the Railway Act, 3 Ed. VII. ch. 58.\nThat section provides that whenever such an award exceeds $600 any party\nmay appeal therefrom upon any question of law or fact to a superior court; and upon the hearing of the appeal, the court shall, if the same is a question of fact, decide the same upon the evidence taken before the arbitrators, as in a case of original jurisdiction.\nSubsection 2 provides that:\nUpon such appeal the practice and proceedings shall be, as nearly as may be, the same as upon an appeal from the decision of an inferior court to the said court, subject to any general rules or orders from time to time made by the said last-mentioned court, in respect to such appeals, which orders may amongst other things provide that any such appeal may be heard and determined by a single judge.\nBy sec. 2(f) of the Railway Act, the expression \"Court\" means a superior court of the province or district, and by the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. [1906] ch. 1, sec. 34(26), \"Superior Court\" means, in the Province of Ontario, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the High Court of Justice for Ontario.\nBy sec. 65 of the Judicature Act of Ontario, it is provided that every action and proceeding in the High Court, and all business arising out of the same, except as hereinafter provided, shall, so far as is practicable and convenient, be heard, determined and disposed of before a single judge.\nIn pursuance of these enactments, the landowner, who had the option of taking an appeal from the award, either to the High Court of Justice, or to the Court of Appeal in Ontario, took it to the High Court, and it was heard before a single judge, viz., before Meredith C.J., who increased the compensation due from the company to the sum of $2,250.\nFrom that judgment the present appeal was brought by the company, whereupon the landowner, by way of cross-appeal, claimed in his factum, that the sum awarded to him by the Chief Justice, was insufficient and should be largely increased.\nUpon the opening of the appeal, a question was raised by the court with respect to its jurisdiction, and an opportunity was given to counsel to argue that question, as well as the merits.\nHaving heard the argument and also an application for leave to appeal, we are all of opinion that there is no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, either with or without leave, and that the appeal should be quashed.\nPrecisely the same question arose in this court in 1901, on a motion for leave to appeal to this court from a judgment of a judge of the High Court of Ontario, increasing the sum awarded by arbitrators to a landowner against a Railway Company, and the application was refused. That was the case of the Ottawa Electric Co. v. Brennan[6].\nThe case of Birely v. The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Ry. Co.[7], was there referred to with approval in which it was held that no appeal lay from the judge of the High Court to the Court of Appeal in such a case, both those courts being designated by the statute as special tribunals, to either of which the appellant might resort. The appeal and cross appeal, and also the motion for leave will therefore be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Boyce and Henderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bull and Kyles.\n[1] 12 Ont.

Quoere. Does the English rule governing the assessment of damages in respect of trespasses in coal mines supply a method of assessment applicable in its entirety to placer mining locations?\nAPPEAL from the judgment, of the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory affirming the judgment of Dugas J., at the trial, by which the action of the plaintiffs was maintained with costs.\nThe action was brought, under the circumstances stated in the judgments now reported, to recover damages for the invasion of the plaintiffs' placer mining location by the defendants and the value of a quantity of gold which the defendants had removed therefrom and converted to their own use.\nAt the trial His Lordship, Mr. Justice Dugas, decided against the defendants, on the grounds that the trespass had been wilful and that there had been no account kept of the gold taken or the cost of getting it, and awarded the plaintiffs, as damages in pcenam, the value of all the gold shewn to have been taken from the plaintiffs' location and declined to make any deductions for the necessary cost of the workings and winning the gold from the material taken. Upon appeal to the court in banc, His Lordship Mr. Justice Craig agreed with the trial judge, while His Lordship Mr. Justice Macauley considered that the damages should have been assessed according to the milder rule applicable to trespasses committed under bona fide belief in validity of title. The trial court judgment, therefore, stood affirmed and the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants. The element of a wilful taking with sinister intention is entirely absent in this case. Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co. ([1]); McArthur v. Cornwall ([2]); Bulli Coal Mining Co. v. Osborne ([3]), at page 364.\nHilton v. Woods ([4]); Jegon v. Vivian ([5]) ; Ashton v. Stock ([6]); Kirkpatrick v. McNamee ([7]); Mayne on Damages, (7 ed.) pages 46, 47, 418-419.\nThe word \"wilful,\" as applied to trespass to land, has been explained, in a recent case, by Wetmore J. as meaning a trespass committed deliberately and intentionally, with a knowledge that there was no right whatever to do the act; Fleming v. H. W. McNiell Co. ([8]), at pages 314 and 315. The onus of proving that a trespass is fraudulent or unscrupulous is in each case upon the plaintiff. Trotter v. Maclean ([9]) at pages 586, 587. There is no obligation to refrain from dealing with property which one believes to be his own merely because somebody else claims it, and it cannot be asserted that there is a duty of abstention when a judge has decided in his favour merely because the claim continues to be asserted on appeal. In this case, abstention would have been detrimental to the defendants and would have entailed inconvenience and expense.\nThe plaintiffs did not ask for an injunction against the proposed operations, but stood by, allowed the defendants to proceed without protest, and now claim that the defendants were \"wilful trespassers.\" It cannot be contended that, during the thirteen months between the judgments, the defendants should have abstained from using the disputed property in con-junction with their workings in that which it adjoined. If the courts below had decided the first point in the defendants' favour, they would not have awarded exemplary damages merely for absence of an account of takings and expenses. Aggravation is immaterial. Whether an account is or is not kept an unscrupulous trespasser receives no consideration, but the fact that an honest trespasser does not keep separate that which he firmly believes to be his own from his other property does not make him an unscrupulous trespasser.\nHolman K.C. and Gwillim, for the respondents. The evidence justifies the findings of the trial judge and the damages are not excessive and should not be disturbed by this court. Montreal Gas Co. v. St. Laurent ([10]); Senesac v. Central Vermont Ry. Co. ([11]).\nThe contention that the trespass was \"innocent\" or \"inadvertent\" is completely negatived and all presumptions must go against the defendants who deliberately omitted to keep accounts necessary to establish what quantities might come from the disputed area and the costs of getting out the dirt and separating the gold. Attorney-General v. Boyd ([12]). The doctrine of per confusionem applies; Lupton v. White ([13]) ; Attorney-General v. Lansell ([14]); Band of Hope and Albion Consols v. Young Band Extended Quartz Mining Co. ([15]); Morrison on Mining Rights, pages 280, 292. The trespasser prevents the owner working his own mine in his own way; Munro v. Sutherland ([16]).\nThe English rule as to cases of trespass in coal mines cannot be applied to placer mining claims; the former are uniform in production while the latter are variable and the whole methods and systems complicated both as to cost, quantity and value of the gold recovered. This is pointed out in Attorney-General v. Lansell ([17]).\nWe also refer to Wild v. Holt ([18]) per Parke B.; and Armstrong on Gold Mining (7 ed.), page 88.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Duff.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014The question we have to decide is as to the measure of damages to be applied to the trespasses committed by the appellants on the plaintiffs' mining area, and for which they were sued.\nAre these damages to be assessed according to the severe rule, the rule in pcenam, whereby the trespasser is to be held liable for the full value of the gold taken by him out of the property trespassed upon without making any allowance whatever for the cost either of taking out the pay dirt or afterwards of washing and mining the gold from this pay dirt, or are they to be assessed according to the milder rule by which the necessary expense which it would have cost plaintiff to obtain the gold had he mined and obtained it himself, would be allowed to the trespasser?\nThe trial judge declined to make any allowance to defendants for these necessary expenses and upon appeal the court was equally divided, Craig J, holding with the trial judge, and Macauley J. deciding in favour of the application of the milder rule and allowing these necessary expenses.\nThe grounds upon which Craig J. supports his judgment are that the trespass was a wilful and deliberate invasion of the plaintiff's property. He proceeds upon the assumption that plaintiff was a wilful trespasser and incorporates, from Armstrong on the Law of Gold Mining, a definition of wilful trespasser as one\nnot in possession under any colour of title and not under any mistake as to facts though misapprehending the law.\nIn another place he says that\nafter reading Lamb's (defendant's) evidence carefully he had reached the conclusion that * * * he deliberately made up his mind to have this ground in spite of any body and that with wilful intent to obtain an unfair advantage, he entered upon this ground, took out the pay dirt, and deliberately confused it with his own.\nHaving reached such a conclusion that the trespass was simply a deliberate fraud, of course there could not be any doubts as to the proper rule to apply in measuring the damages. I have, bearing in mind the very strong language of Craig J., read carefully over Lamb\u2019s evidence, but I have not been able to reach any such conclusions from it as the judge seems to have done. On the contrary, I think his evidence, read with all the other evidence in the case, shews that so far from being a willful trespasser without any colour of title, the defendants entered upon the disputed claim only after it had been judicially determined by the Gold Commissioner, after a trial, to have been their property and within the bonds of their mining lease; that they carried on their operations of taking out the pay dirt from the disputed territory during the winter and spring after judgment had been given in their favour, tunnelling into the territory across a tunnel of plaintiffs, and that these operations must have been known to the plaintiffs who stood by and saw the property being worked by defendants and contented themselves simply with appealing from the judgment of the Gold Commissioner, without applying for an injunction restraining the defendants from working the disputed territory.\nIt is true the judgment of the Gold. Commissioner was more than a year afterwards reversed by the court of appeal, Craig J. stating on that appeal that it was \"merely a question of boundaries and consideration of the weight of evidence.\" Before this appeal was determined all that is complained of by the plaintiffs was done. It does not, therefore, seem to me pro-per to speak of the plaintiff as a wilful trespasser, or deal with him as one in possession \"not under any colour of right.\"\nHe was in possession under the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction which declared the disputed territory to form part of his mining claim, and I cannot see that he ought to be treated as acting fraudulently or dishonestly, simply because he went on exercising rights declared to be his without any attempt to restrain him from doing so by his opponent who had appealed from the judgment simply. In the absence of any positive evidence to the contrary, and drawing reasonable inferences from the facts proved, I would conclude that what defendants did was done openly under a claim of right and bon\u00e2 fide, though in the ultimate result proved to be wrongful.\nIn his judgment in the case of Trotter v. MacLean ([19]), Fry J., at p. 587, after reviewing the different classes of cases in which the milder rule or the punitive rule was applied, cited with approval from the observations of Lord Hatherley in Jegon v. Vivian ([20]) the following:\nI think that the milder rule of law is certainly that which ought to guide this court subject to any case made of a special character which would induce the court to swerve from it; otherwise on the one hand a trespass might be committed with impunity if the rule in poenam were not insisted upon; so on the other hand persons might stand by and see their coal worked, being spared the expense of mining and getting it.\nFry J then goes on to say:\nThese observations are material in two ways. In the first place they express the view of the Lord Chancellor that the milder rule is to be assumed when the propriety of applying the contrary rule is not shewn, and they throw the burden on him who asserts that the severer rule ought to be applied; and so his language has been interpreted by V.-C. Bacon, in, I think, more than one case. In the next place, Lord Hatherley points out that the milder rule should be applied where persons stand by and see their coal worked.\nI think the plaintiffs here have failed to discharge the burden cast on them and that they should, under the circumstances, be classed with those who stand by and see their property worked.\nIn the case of Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co. ([21]), in the House of Lords, Lord Blackburn stated the general rule where an injury is to be compensated by damages to be that\nyou should as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation. That must be qualified by a great many things which may arise, such for instance as by the consideration whether the damage has been maliciously done or whether it has been done with full knowledge that the person doing it was doing wrong. I can see no evidence whatever of malicious action on defendants' part and cannot, as before stated, reach the conclusion that the defendants, with the judgment of the court of first instance in their favour, and with the plaintiffs in the position of persons looking on at defendants' operations and contenting themselves with a simple appeal, must necessarily be held to have had \"full knowledge\" that they were doing wrong at the time the only court that had passed upon the question had determined they could legally do what they were doing. Until evidence is given forcing the court to that conclusion of wilful wrongdoing the plaintiffs have not discharged the onus which Lord Hatherley thought lay upon them.\nMy attention has been called by my brother Duff to the case of Peruvian Guano Co. v. Dreyfus Brothers & Co. ([22]), at p. 167, decided in the House of Lords. In that case it was held by Lords Watson and MacNaghten, after an elaborate and instructive review by Lord MacNaghten\" of many of the cases alike at common law and equity bearing upon the question now under discussion, that on general principles the defendants, though they had illegally detained the plaintiffs' property, were entitled to repayment of the expenses properly incurred by them on account of freight and landing charges.\nWhatever strength there might have been in the argument denying the right of the defendants to have any expenses allowed them for taking the pay dirt out of the disputed territory into the dump heap, I can see no just rule or reason which should preclude them from the reasonable expense of washing the gold out of the dump heap. In any event that would have had to be incurred by plaintiffs, if they themselves had taken out the pay dirt, and the cost can easily be estimated. To confirm the judgment appealed from would deny even that to the defendants.\nI do not think the explanation of the reasons why they did not keep a separate account of the working of the portion of the mining area under dispute, or why they mixed the pay dirt from that area with that from their undisputed area, unreasonable as was contended. It would no doubt have been better, and pro-per, had it been possible, to keep these accounts and not to have mixed the pay dirt with other. But on the statement, uncontradicted so far as I can see of the extremely limited extent of dumping ground which defendants had, and the great expense of separating the pay dirt from the disputed area with that from the undisputed area, I am unable to draw the conclusion that this mixing of the two was necessarily a wilful mixing which ought to be punished by the application of the punitive rule of damages. There might have been some difficulty in reaching a proper estimate of the whole expenses to be properly allowed defendants from the evidence already in, and without a further reference. But, as counsel for the plaintiffs, respondents, pressed us, if we reached the opinion that the defendants were entitled to be allowed such expenditure as it would undoubtedly have cost the plaintiffs if they had mined and won the gold from the disputed area, not to refer the case back for further evidence but to make such estimate from the evidence already in, I think we may under that consent adopt the conclusion of Macauley J. and allow them 40 per cent, of the gross proceeds, as and for such necessary expenditure, and as being under the evidence a fair, just and reasonable allowance. I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs to that extent.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nDuff J.\u2014The appellants and one Randall were, in 1901 and 1902, the owners of a placer claim known as the \"Miller\" on Bonanza Creek in the Yukon Territory adjoining a claim known as the \"Krober\" owned by the respondents.\nA dispute as to the boundary between the claims was determined in February, 1903, by a judgment given in favour of the respondent by the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory reversing the judgment of the Gold Commissioner which had been delivered 11th January, 1902. Between the last mentioned date and the date of the delivery of the judgment of the Territorial Court, the appellants entered upon the area in dispute and abstracted large quantities of auriferous material, from which, after intermixing it with similar material taken from the \"Miller,\" they extracted the gold which it contained. The respondents brought this action to recover damages for the invasion of their claim by the appellants and the trial judge awarded them $7,306.56, which the learned judge found to be the value of the gold recovered by the appellants from the respondents' claim.\nOn appeal, Craig J. agreed with the trial judge, while Macauley J. took the view that this sum should be reduced by a deduction equivalent to the expenses incurred by them as well in separating the gold bearing material from its natural bed as in removing it from the mine and in recovering the mineral it contained. Before us, the appellants' principal contention was that, not having entered upon the disputed area until they had first obtained the decision of the Gold Commissioner in their favour, they are entitled to the benefit of an allowance in accordance with the view of Macauley J.\nIt has for some years been the settled law applicable to cases of coal mining trespass, where the trespass is not wilful, that in estimating\u2014when that forms an element in the damages to which the plain-tiffs is entitled\u2014the value of the coal abstracted, the coal is to be treated as in situ and from its value at the mouth of the pit is to be deducted the cost of severing it from its natural bed and of bringing it to bank; where the trespass is wilful, the cost of severance is not allowed although as a general rule the cost of bringing it to bank is.\nIt was not argued and, I think, cannot be maintained, that a trespasser upon a placer mining claim held under the mining regulations of the Yukon Territory is in a position more favourable than a coal trespasser under this rule. Whether he is in a less favourable position, it is, in the view I take of the facts, unnecessary to consider. I have come to the conclusion that, assuming the rule to apply in its entirety, the appellants are within that branch of it which governs cases of wilful trespass and are, consequently, not entitled to the benefit of the allowance claimed.\nNo attempt, so far as I can find, has yet been made to define with precision the circumstances in which the court will treat a trespass as wilful within the meaning of the rule; but this much is sufficiently clear upon any examination of the cases\u2014that, upon that point, the existence or non-existence in the mind of a trespasser of a belief in his title to the locus is not necessarily conclusive.\nIn the leading case Wood v. Morewood ([23]), for example, the test which Baron Parke instructed the jury to apply was: Did the defendant act\nfairly and honestly (not honestly only) in the bon\u00e2 fide belief that he had a right to do what he did?\n(not merely that he owned the coal taken). If the title is in dispute and the dispute is in course of active litigation an abstraction of mineral may be innocent or non-innocent, according to the circumstances; according, for example, to its effect upon the trespasser's adversary in respect of his position in the dispute, or upon the adversary's rights, in the event of his success in litigation. If, in that event\u2014the adversary's success\u2014the trespasser can compensate him fully in money and if the trespass places him at no disadvantage either in the dispute itself or in the ascertainment of compensation or otherwise, then the trespass may be perfectly innocent in all but a legal sense. Apparently such a case, in the opinion of Lord Hatherly, was disclosed by the circumstances of Jegon v. Vivian ([24]), although I venture to think there will be few cases in which the appropriation by one party to a litigated dispute of the subject matter of the litigation, will not place upon that party a heavy burden of explanation.\nIf on the other hand the act is an adverse act, designed to put the adversary at a disadvantage in the dispute, the mere fact that the trespasser believes he is acting within his legal rights will not, I think, bring him within the category of the innocent. Peruvian Guano Co. v. Dreyfus Bros. & Co.([25]), per Lord Watson at page 171. At least as effectively, would it appear to me, is he excluded from that category, if his act of trespass is designed, in the event of his own defeat, to deprive his adversary of, or to embarrass him in obtaining the whole or part of that to which he shall prove to have been entitled. In such a case he cannot be said to act \"fairly and honestly,\" to use the language already quoted from the charge of Parke B. in Wood v. Morewood ([26]); or \"wholly ignorantly and innocently,\" in the language of Lord Blackburn in Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co. ([27]) at page 40; or without any \"sinister intention\" in the language of Lord Cairns, in the same case at page 31. He is in a word, a wrong-doer in foro conscientiae\u2014not in the eye of the law merely.\nThat the design of the defendants in committing the trespass complained of was to frustrate the plaintiffs' appeal by depriving them, in the event of their success, of the fruits of success, is in my opinion the only view fairly consistent with the whole of the facts in evidence.\nA glance at the salient facts in the history of the controversy respecting the boundaries of the \"Miller\" and the \"Krober\" is necessary to enable us fully to appreciate the bearing of the evidence on this question.\nThe controversy began in the year 1900. The \"Miller\" had been located by one J. A. Miller on the 11th June, 1898, and the \"Krober\" on the 21st of the same month.\nThe \"Miller\" being the senior location, and the whole of the disputed territory being admittedly with- in the lines of the \"Krober,\" the question of title to that territory necessarily rested upon the determination of the boundaries of the \"Miller\" as originally located.\nIn October, 1899, the owners of the \"Miller\" (of whom the defendant H.I. Miller was then one) had a survey and plan of it made by one T. D. Green. The plan, which so placed the boundaries of the claim as to embrace only a part of the area in question, was signed by J. A. Miller, the locator, and filed in the office of the Gold Commissioner. In May, 1900, J. A. Miller, the locator, the present defendant H. I. Miller, and one Bowhay, who were then the owners of the \"Miller,\" commenced in the Gold Commissioner's Court a proceeding against the present plain-tiff Krober, as owner of the \"Krober,\" claiming to have the boundaries of the \"Miller\" established in accordance with the survey. A date was fixed for the hearing, which, however, never took place, and the proceeding was afterwards discontinued. In the same year\u2014the precise date is not disclosed by the evidence\u2014the same persons made an attempt to establish the same boundaries through the procedure provided by a regulation promulgated in March of that year; under this regulation, if, after public notice of a survey of a placer claim for the period and in the manner prescribed by the regulation, there should be no protest against it lodged with the Gold Commissioner, the boundaries of the claim became defined for all purposes in accordance with the survey. Green's plan and survey were advertised, but a protest being lodged the plan and survey were withdrawn.\nAffact of cardinal importance in connection with this survey is that it was based upon the theory that the initial post of the \"Miller\" as located by J. A. Miller, was a post (described in the subsequent proceedings before the Gold Commissioner as post B.) which had already been placed, in locating the \"Newman,\" an adjoining claim; on the same theory another survey of the \"Miller,\" made by one Barwell, apparently in 1900, at the instance of the same persons, seems to have proceeded.\nOn the 15th June, 1901, a third survey was made at the instance of the present defendants\u2014then the owners of the claim\u2014by Barwell. This survey proceeded on a new theory. Barwell took as his starting point a place pointed out to him on the ground by J. A. Miller, the locator of the claim, as the situation of the initial post; and the claim as surveyed from that starting point embraced an area within the limits of the \"Krober\" (the area in dispute, that is to say) very much larger than that falling within the lines of Green's survey.\nOn the day following the completion of this survey the action was commenced in the Gold Commissioner's Court by the present defendants against the present plaintiffs which resulted in the judgment of the Gold Commissioner of the 11th January, 1902, al-ready referred to.\nThe plaintiffs on the same day gave notice of appeal to the Territorial Court. The defendants having in the preceding November begun mining on the \"Miller\"\u2014which had up to that time remained unworked\u2014 extended their operations after the Gold Commissioner's decision into the disputed territory, and before the hearing of the plaintiffs' appeal (on the 17th September, 1902) had removed from it the mineral bearing material it contained. The defendants kept no ac-count of this material (as to either its quantity or its value), or of the cost of mining, removing or washing' it. On the contrary, they\u2014as I have already mentioned\u2014intermixed it with similar material taken from parts of the \"Miller\" not in dispute and appropriated the gold recovered from the whole mass. On the 28th September, 1902, the day after the hearing of the appeal, the defendants having completed the washing of this material, discontinued operations and afterwards sold the unworked part of their claim for $10,000.00.\nQuo animo then did the defendants commit these trespasses? We have here no question of inadvertence or negligence. That the defendants deliberately invaded the territory in litigation is now conceded. One of two things must therefore be clear. The defendants either rested on the decision of the Gold Commissioner as conferring on them a title of absolutely assured validity and proceeded with no misgiving as to the result of the appeal; or they disposed of the product of the property with a clear perception that, if the plaintiffs should succeed, that would happen which has happened, namely, that the plaintiffs in spite of their success would find that the subject matter of the litigation had disappeared and with it all reliable evidence of its extent and value.\nThe first of these alternative propositions, Mr. Ewart, if I understood him, asked us to adopt. The facts, I think, make it clear that it should be rejected.\nThis view of the state of mind of the defendants seems hard to reconcile with the nature of the case presented before the Gold Commissioner. The case turned in substance upon the point whether J. A. Miller in locating the \"Miller\" had taken as his initial post the post \"B.\" to which I have referred, or had placed an initial post in the situation pointed out by him to Barwell for the purposes of the third survey, in June, 1901. The plaintiffs' success depended upon their ability to maintain the latter proposition. The Gold Commissioner had accepted that view; but considering the evidence as disclosed by the materials Before us in the light of the previous history of the dispute, one finds little pointing to bona fides on the part of the defendants; on the contrary, I regret to say there is much to suggest a case inherently unworthy of credit. The record of the trial is not in evidence; but we have the reasons given by Craig J. for his judgment on appeal, in which Macauley J. concurred; and from some observations made in the course of the judgment of Craig J. in this action, I assume that the view expressed by him had also the concurrence of Dugas J., although it appears that the last mentioned judge proceeded also on the ground that the defendants, by their course of action respecting the Green survey, were estopped from disputing the plaintiffs' contention respecting the position of the initial post. The learned judges in appeal did not of course see the witnesses; but subject to that, we may, I think, assume\u2014otherwise doubtless the record would have been put in evidence\u2014that, so far as it could be got from the record, the effect of the evidence is fairly stated by Craig J. The learned judge says:\nI have read the evidence in this case most carefully, and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot follow the learned Gold Commissioner on his finding on the facts. Miller, the first witness, is a most unsatisfactory witness, hesitating and uncertain and contradicdictory; he was on the ground once for a short time after he was sick, and the staking was done, and he paid very little attention to what he did. Christie, the important witness against him, was on the ground for a long time prior, knew it intimately, and had gone over it, and marked out the features of the ground. Warren, who confirms to a certain extent, is forced to admit upon examination: that an affidavit made by him is untrue, and that he will not now support it, proving either that he was willing to sign anything laid before him without reading it, or that, having read it, he was willing to swear to it anyhow, in either case being a most unscrupulous witness. Then, again, Warren, in his evidence, swears that he can recognize a stake after it has been cut off by seeing the stem five inches from the ground. Any man who will swear to that state of things is not worthy of belief. Bowhay, who confirms Miller as to the stakes, was willing to have the plan of Green and Barwell adopted, which is not the contention which he now sets up, and it is singular that he should have done that if he knew better at the time. Miller himself signs the Green plan and approved of the Bar-well plan. Against this we have the direct evidence of Hawkins, who made the first survey and found post B. with Miller's name upon it, being the only post which had the name. We have Sinclair's evidence of conversation where Miller draws a plan and shews the claims exactly as Korber now contends they are, with the \"Newman\" claim jutting up into the \"Miller\" claim. We have the evidence of Green who found the post B. We have the evidence of Jephson, who found that post. We have the evidence of Krober who saw the post. We have also the evidence of Kincaid, Ware and Rost, who either saw the post or had conversation with Miller and admitted the evidence is preponderatingly in favour of Kroeber's contention as to what the \"Miller\" survey was.\nWith the transactions of .1899 and 1900 in their minds\u2014the Green plan signed by J. A. Miller, the Barwell plan approved by him, the proceedings (in the Gold Commissioner's office and by public notice) to establish Green's survey\u2014can we assume that Miller and Lamb regarded as inexpugnable the case described by the learned trial judge in the passage I have quoted?\nAt least it would seem that their conduct in disposing of the product of the encroachment as they did calls for some explanation in addition to the suggestion that they acted on a blind faith in an unimpeachable title. Two explanations are offered by counsel. It was impracticable, it is said, first, to distinguish the material removed from the disputed area; and secondly either to deposit it as a separate mass on the dump or separately to sluice it. It is not necessary I think to consider the exculpatory validity of these explanations; they fail because they have no basis of fact. As to the first, the evidence shews clearly that the defendants' workings crossed at three places only the boundary between the territory admittedly within the \"Miller\" and that in dispute. It is obvious that every carload of material excavated from the last mentioned territory must have passed one of these three points. That the points could have been ascertained with exactitude and marked on the ground by any competent surveyor is also obvious. Lamb, hav-ing in his examination in chief sworn that in order to distinguish the cars proceeding from the disputed area the constant attendance of a surveyor under ground would be necessary, in cross examination admits\u2014 what must be very plain\u2014that the marking of the underground boundary would have involved very little expense or trouble. As to the other explanation of-ferred, there is some evidence given by Frank Miller in support of it; but we are relieved from considering in detail the evidence of this witness by the admissions made on cross-examination on this point also by the defendant Lamb himself, who says that the sole ob-stacle in the way of the suggested precaution was a little additional expense.\nIt is to be observed that while these explanations are put forward by counsel to account for the action of the defendants in blending the material, we have no such explanation from the lips of the persons who were directly concerned in it.\nThere are three persons whose bona fides in com- mitting the trespasses under consideration is in question. No one of these offers any explanation of his conduct. The defendant Miller and Randall (who owned a one-fourth interest and acted as foreman in charge of the operations down to 22nd July, 1902), were not called as witnesses; they were both, it seems, absent from the territory during the trial; but why was their evidence not taken in the way usually followed in such cases? Lamb, the only one of these persons who gave evidence at the trial, not only attempts no justification of the trespass, but professes ignorance of the fact of the trespass.\nThe proceedings in the present action indeed seem to me to afford some light upon this question of intention. A scrupulously honest man, having in full belief that he was exercising his rights, taken that which has proved to belong to another, would, speaking generally, evince some desire to make restitution. The defendants\u2014being as they say in that case\u2014first, by their pleadings denied their act of trespass; then, to shew that this was no formality of pleading, by their counsel at the trial, in answer to the court, said that the fact of the trespass was seriously put in issue; and the defendant Lamb in the witness box thus fences with the question:\nQ. What was done with the gravel and other pay material taken from the ground in question?\nA. If we had anything to do with it, it was sluiced with the rest. * * * * *\nQ. The first ground taken out would be the ground nearest the encroachment or the encroachment if you took it? A. Yes, it would, be the first to come out. Q. What was done with the first ground that was taken out? A.\" Sluiced. Q. When?\nA. I think somewhere about June.\nQ. 1902?\nA. Yes. Q. Had you then finished your operations in the vicinity of the ground in dispute or did you continue them on after June?\nA. They worked continuously right along.\nQ. Was the ground included in the disputed ground worked out up to June?\nA. I don't know anything about it.\nThis conduct lends no support to the theory that the defendants acted without any sinister intention. Indeed the course of the defendants throughout the whole controversy, the proceedings in 1900\u2014the volte face of 1901\u2014the nature of the case before the Gold Commissioner\u2014the intermixture of the products\u2014the failure to keep separate accounts\u2014the conduct of the present litigation\u2014would appear not to be reconcilable with the hypothesis that they acted with the intention of taking the benefit of that only which should prove to be rightfully theirs.\nBut it is contended that the plaintiffs are within the principle stated by Lord Hatherly in Jegon v. Vivian ([28]) and by Fry J. in Trotter v. McLean ([29]), which, it is said, precludes the owner from disputing the defendants' right to deduction for the expenses of severance, where he, having a knowledge of the trespass, has taken no steps or has been dilatory in taking steps to stop it. It is said that the failure of the plaintiffs to apply for an injunction brings them within these cases.\nIt is plain that the conduct of the owner in standing by inactive while the trespass proceeds may bear upon the trespasser's right to claim the deduction in one or both of two ways. The owner's inactivity or dilatoriness may, in the circumstances of particular cases, be an element of some importance to be considered in deciding upon the character of the trespasser's intention. On the other hand, independently of any question of the trespasser's intention, the owner may by his laches disentitle himself to the full measure of relief which the court might otherwise award. In Trotter v. McLean ([30]) Fry J. found that the conduct of the owners during a certain period amounted to ac-quiescence in the trespass, but he held that this period of acquiescence came to an end upon a simple notice to the trespasser unaccompanied by legal proceedings.\nIn Jegon v. Vivian ([31]), the trespass was held in the circumstances not to be a wilful trespass; and the actual decision turned upon that, although no doubt the dilatoriness of the owner's proceedings was an element which influenced Lord Hatherly's mind in the consideration of the question of bona fides.\nOn the other hand, Lord Hatherly does lay down or suggest what seems to be a clear principle\u2014viz.: that where the owner has stood by inactive and allowed a trespass to proceed, especially if it is proceeding under a bond fide belief in title, it would be wrong to refuse the trespasser the benefit of the allowance.\nMy difficulty is to apply to the circumstances of this case anything decided or any principle enunciated by Lord Hatherly or by Lord Fry.\nThe plaintiffs did not stand by inactive; on the contrary they promptly launched their appeal and it cannot be suggested, nor is it, that the prosecution of the appeal was dilatory. Such a case is, I think, very remote from anything within the scope of Lord Hatherly's language. Still less can it be maintained that there is any evidence that anything done by the defendants misled the plaintiffs into the belief that the defendants were acquiescing in the course taken. by the plaintiffs. The evidence upon which the fact of the defendants' knowledge of the trespass rests is meagre, and not without ambiguity. But if that evidence proves anything, it proves this, that Randall, a co-owner with the defendants and the foreman in charge of the operations, informed the plaintiff Kincaid that the defendants did not intend to work the disputed territory until after the determination of the appeal. Had it been suggested at the trial that the plaintiffs ought to have proceeded in the manner now suggested, it is impossible to say what might have proved to be the explanation of the fact that the plaintiffs did not so proceed. Many explanations occur to one, but such speculation is profitless; and I do not think the plaintiffs can be called upon properly at this stage to justify their course from the evidence upon the record. A court of appeal, I think, should not give effect to such a point taken for the first time in appeal, unless it be clear that, had the question been raised at the proper time, no further light could have been thrown upon it. Browne v. Dunn ([32]) at p. 76; Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Kavanagh ([33]) at page 480; The Tasmania ([34]) at page 225; Ex parte Firth ([35]) at page 429; Karunaratne v. Ferdinandus ([36]) at page 409; Loosemore v. Tiverton and North Devon Ry. Co. ([37]) at page 46; Page v. Bowdler ([38]); Borrowman Phillips & Co. v. Free and Hollis ([39]) at page 68.\nBut it is contended that the defendants are, at least, entitled to the expenses incurred in removing and washing the product of their trespasses. It is, I think, for the purposes of this appeal, a sufficient answer to this contention to say\u2014in accordance with the view of Macauley J.\u2014that the defendants have, by their own wrongful acts, made it impossible to ascertain these expenses. The court is not called upon to speculate in such a case for the benefit of deliberate wrong-doers; they come within the wholesome rule, that if a man by his deliberately tortious act destroys the evidence necessary to ascertain the extent of the injury he has inflicted, he must suffer all the inconvenience which is the result of his own wrong. Armory v. Delamirie ([40]). In such a case, to quote the language of Sir Lancelot Shadwell, V.C., in. Duke of Leeds v. Amherst ([41]) at page 596:\nIn my opinion this case is to be judged not merely by the simple circumstances of evidence which are found in it, but the reference to those great principles of justice, which, as I apprehend, have always governed mankind, and have been acknowledged from the earliest times. It appears to me that it is a very right thing to hold in one's contemplation, on deciding such a case as this, what has been the uniform opinion of mankind upon such a general case as the one now presented in this cause. I take it, that the general wisdom of mankind has acquiesced in this; that the author of a mischief is not the party who is to complain of the result of it, but that he who has done it must submit to have the effects of it recoil upon himself. * * * \"All those who take the sword shall parish by the sword.\" \"The mischief-maker shall suffer for the mischief he has created.\"\nI do not overlook the method followed by Macauley J. but, having regard to the views I have expressed, it is obviously inapplicable. The allowance of 40 per cent, made by that learned judge must be taken to include the cost not only of removing and treating the deposits but of drifting and digging as well; and further indeed\u2014if the analogy of the terms upon which the laymen worked was consistently pursued\u2014 of all the excavations required to work the ground. There is absolutely nothing before us by which, assuming that in the view taken by the learned judge his method of ascertaining the whole cost of working the deposits is a valid method, one can distinguish the cost of removing or washing from the other expenses.\nThe case calls for a further observation.\nThe learned trial judge seems to have proceeded on the assumption that the burden was upon the plaintiffs to prove the value of the mineral taken from their claim. The burden which by this course was placed upon the defendants was much lighter than, in the circumstances of this case, they had a right to expect. In the view I have taken of their conduct, they were, under the long settled doctrine of the English law, accountable for as much of the mixed pro-ducts of the two claims as they did not strictly prove to have come from their own.\nWarde v.

Shepley K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court maintaining a demurrer to a petition of right in which the petitioner (now appellant) alleges that:\n1st. By indenture made in duplicate 23rd March, 1898, at Ottawa, Her late Majesty did grant, demise and lease unto the petitioner (now appellant) for a period of twenty years, the exclusive right and privilege of taking and extracting by subaqueous mining and dredging all royal and base metals other than coal to be found within a certain defined area on Dominion Creek in the Yukon Territory.\n2ndly. The grant was made subject to the mining regulations of January 18th, 1898, which are incorporated in it; and also provides that if that portion of the creek covered by the lease is subsequently found to have been granted to another then there shall be priority according to the record. There is also exclusion of warranty as to sufficiency of water, and there is to be no claim for compensation if it is found impossible for that or any other reason to carry on operations under the lease which is declared to be taken entirely at the lessee's risk.\nAfter setting out the lease and regulations in full the petitioner alleges:\nThat subsequent to the granting of the said lease, and while the same was in full force, the Crown, through the Gold Commissioner at Dawson, granted to free miners the said area covered by said supyliant's lease as placer mining claims and had placed in possession of the same the said placer miners.\nThe petitioner further alleges that, having paid the stipulated rental, Her Majesty refused his demand to give him possession of the areas granted.\nTo this petition the respondent chose to plead by way of demurrer.\nBy the judgment of the Exchequer Court the demurrer was allowed and the petition dismissed with costs. In effect the judgment appealed from decides that:\nThe mining regulations incorporated in the lease permitted a grant to be made to placer miners of the areas covered by the lease, and if the result of the alleged grant to the placer miners was to prevent the suppliant from carrying on his operations, the petitioner had no right to any compensation under the final paragraph of the lease which provides that:\nHer Majesty does not in any way warrant that there shall be a sufficient quantity of water in the said portion of the said river to admit of operations under this lease, and that the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns shall have no right to compensation should it be found impossible for that or for amy other reason to carry on such operations, it being hereby declared and agreed that this lease is taken by the lessee entirely at his own risk.\nWith this judgment I cannot agree.\nThe demurrer assumes and is predicated upon the assumption that all the facts alleged in the petition are true. It cannot, therefore, be argued in this proceeding that the act of the Gold Commissioner was the unauthorized act of a public servant for the consequences of which the Crown is not responsible. The fact which must for the purposes of this appeal be taken to be as stated by the appellant is, that the Crown, through the Gold Commissioner, granted the areas in question to free miners and maintained them in possession. By the pleading the action of the Gold Commissioner in the premises is not repudiated, it is, on the contrary, adopted by the Crown. In my opinion it is equally impossible to hold, with the judge of the Exchequer Court, that a conflicting subsequent grant would be a reason ejusdem generis with insufficiency of water sufficient to defeat the suppliant's claim under the last paragraph of the lease.\nWhat is the true effect of the document declared upon, whether it be called a lease, a grant or a license? Considered in its entirety it is in my opinion clearly an exclusive grant made for good and valid consideration of all the royal and base metals except coal which the grantee might extract during twenty years by subaqueous mining and dredging from the submerged beds or bars in the river below low water-mark with a license to go upon the premises for that purpose, and also to cut such ungranted timber belonging to the Crown as was necessary to carry on his operations.\nThe complaint is that the Crown in derogation of the right of peaceable enjoyment, during the continuance of the agreement, interfered with rights vested in the suppliant by transferring the areas granted to placer miners who were put in possession of them by the Crown, the grantor, to the detriment of the suppliant, the grantee.\nOn the issues raised by this demurrer, and these are the only issues before us, we are not called upon to consider whether or not it was as a fact possible to carry on dredging operations because of the insufficiency of the water.\nThe suppliant's complaint\u2014that the Crown has disposed of the area embraced within his lease in the manner described\u2014does not, I think, involve an allegation that the area has been granted to free miners under the regulations relating to placer mining or by the Gold Commissioner professing to act under them. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider how far the suppliant's rights under this lease are subject to those of free miners holding placer mining claims under those regulations.\nThe general policy of the Act of Parliament and regulations is to encourage gold mining by giving a certain fixity of tenure to all persons who are willing under a lease to occupy Crown lands for that purpose, and to carry on their operations efficiently and continuously, and this policy would obviously be defeated if the exclusive rights granted to the suppliant for a valuable consideration, payment of rent and royalty, might be revoked or impaired at any time during the continuance of the grant at the will of the minister.\nIn the Windsor & Annapolis Railway Company v. The Queen and the Western Counties Ry. Co.[2], at page 366, Chief Justice Ritchie said:\nI think the true construction of this agreement or grant is, and the clear intention of the parties as indicated thereby was, that the suppliants should have the full, beneficial and continuous enjoyment of the privileges thereby granted for a continuous period of twenty-one years, and that they should not be disturbed by the Crown in such enjoyment, and as a consequence, to enable the agreement to operate according to the intention of the parties, there is an implied undertaking on the part of the Crown not to do anything to derogate from its grant so to enjoy, the Crown, in my opinion, being no more entitled to act in derogation of its grant or to defeat its own act and not to be liable for a breach of its agreement, expressed or implied, than a subject.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. agreed with the Chief Justice. DAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The regulations under which the lease in question in this action was expressly issued provide that it\nwas subject to such regulations and should be deemed to contain all such stipulations, provisoes and conditions on the part of Her Majesty and the lessee and all such exceptions and restrictions as are provided and contemplated by such regulations.\nOne of these stipulations and restrictions provides that the rights granted by the lease extend \"only to the submerged beds or bars below low water-mark\" within the area generally described in the lease.\nThe petition does not allege that there were any such submerged beds or bars within the leased area, or that, if there were, that the placer miners' grants complained of covered them or parts of them. I think, under any circumstances, the absence of such an allegation would be fatal.\nBut, apart from that altogether, I think the appeal must fail and the judgment of the Exchequer Court be confirmed, because of the absence of any allegation of active interference by or on the part of the Crown or with its authority in the doing of the acts complained of by the suppliant.\nHe took the lease expressly, as it says, at his own risk. It covered an area or disconnected areas which might or might not be capable of being operated. In my opinion the Crown would not be liable in damages because some placer miners' licenses granted subsequently to such a lease as that of the suppliant overlapped or impinged upon some or more of the areas which suppliant might be entitled to the exclusive right of dredging in. The suppliant had his remedy against such placer miners if they interfered with his prior rights of exclusive dredging in any such areas leased to him. The Crown did not remove suppliant from or interfere with his possession of the areas demised by the lease. It would be a novel and dangerous doctrine to lay down that the mere giving of a subsequent lease or license to a placer miner under cover of which the subsequent licensee might occasion prejudice to a prior grantee entitled the latter to sue the Crown for all damages he might suffer. The result in all cases of overlapping, if such a doctrine was upheld, would be, I venture to think, without precedent and productive of the greatest and gravest injustice. The lessee would probably conclude that an action for damages against the Crown in any such case for alleged damages would be much more profitable than carrying on the operation of dredging the river.\nThe Crown acts and must necessarily act through its officers. For their personal wrongdoing it is not responsible, and I do not see how we could, consistently with the uniform jurisprudence of this court, hold the Crown responsible in damages if the officials authorized to act within the law and the regulations, by error, inadvertence or sheer negligence in violation of the regulations gave a second lease or license to a miner the boundaries of which overlapped a prior license, without any further act or interference by the Crown.\nThe remedy of the holder of a legal license against a trespasser or wrongdoer or subsequent lessee of the lands leased to him is plain. But his rights do not embrace a right of action for damages against the Crown simply and merely because one of its officials wrongfully or inadvertently granted licenses to miners containing descriptions of areas in whole or in part already granted. Such subsequent licenses to the extent that they infringe upon prior legal ones and as against them are simply inoperative and of no legal force.\nIn this case it is not alleged that the Crown actively or directly interfered with any rights the suppliant had under his grant. It is not alleged that the Crown gave any special or other authority to the Gold Commissioner in the Yukon to give placer mining leases of any part of the area of the river or stream granted to the suppliant. If it had done so a question of its liability would of course have at once arisen, as it did arise in the case of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Co.[3]. But no allegation of the kind is alleged in suppliant's claim demurred to. The Gold Commissioner who is alleged to have granted the placer mining leases complained of must be held to have done so by virtue of his general powers and subject to the regulations by which he was bound. The petition does not contain any statement of any special action, authority given or interference by the Crown in the matter. If the Gold Commissioner acting under his general powers and subject to the regulations inadvertently or negligently violated these regulations and gave placer mining licenses on areas previously granted for subaqueous mining, that would not make the Crown in any way liable. It would simply be the tortious act of the Crown's officer for which the Crown would not be liable.\nIn the Windsor and Annapolis Railway Case(1), which I venture to think has no application at all to this case before us, Lord Watson delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, at page 615, after reciting the facts shewing that the forcible taking of possession of the road was not simply the tortious act of Mr. Brydges alone, as contended for by the Crown, said:\nIt is plain, therefore, that Mr. Brydges acted with the full authority of the Government and merely carried out their instructions which were issued in the belief that it was within their legal right to put an end to their agreement with the appellant company.\nIt is not possible, in my opinion, on the statements made in the suppliant's petition, to make any such contention with regard to the Gold Commissioner in this case, and I, therefore, am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment below confirmed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Exchequer Court against a judgment maintaining a demurrer to a petition of right.\nThe petition set forth at length a lease made by Her late Majesty granting, demising and leasing to the petitioner\nthe exclusive right and privilege of taking and extracting by subaqueous mining and dredging all royal and base metals, other than coal from the land covered by water * * * commencing at a stake planted at the mouth of Sulphur Creek, where it empties into Dominion Creek, thence down stream five miles.\nThis grant and demise was made \"subject to the rents, stipulations, provisos and conditions\" thereinafter \"reserved and contained,\" and was to be held for twenty years from 23rd March, A.D. 1898.\nThe instrument in the very first sentence of it, states that it is made\nunder and by virtue of the regulations of January 18th, 1898, governing the issue of leases to dredge for minerals in the beds of rivers in the provisional district of Yukon.\nAnd immediately following the habendum and reddendum clauses were the following provisos: Provided always that this demise is subject to all and every the provisions of the said regulation of January 18th, 1898, a copy of which is hereinunder appended and shall be deemed to contain all such stipulations, provisos and conditions on the part of Her Majesty and the lessee, and all such exceptions and restrictions as it is provided or contemplated by the last mentioned regulations, that leases issued thereunder shall contain which regulations for this purpose shall be read so that the word \"lessee\" therein shall be taken to include the executors, administrators and assigns of the lessee.\n* * * * * * * * * *\nProvided further that if in consequence of any cause whatsoever a lease is found to comprise a portion of a river included in another lease the lessee whose application was first recorded in the Department of the Interior shall take priority. Provided further that Her Majesty does not in any way warrant that there shall be a sufficient quantity of water in the said portion of the said river to admit of operations under this lease, and that the lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns shall have no right to compensation should it be found impossible for that or for any other reason to carry on such operations, it being hereby declared and agreed that this lease is taken by the lessee entirely at his own risk.\nThe regulations thus above referred to and incorporated into the lease are set out in the petition.\nNos. 3 and 4 of the said regulations have an important bearing on the questions raised herein. They are as follows:\n3. The lessee's right of mining and dredging shall be confined to the submerged beds or bars in the river below low water mark, that boundary to be fixed by its position on the first day of August in the year of the date of the lease.\n4. The lease shall be subject to the rights of all persons who have received or who may receive entries for claims under the placer mining regulations.\nThe second and third paragraphs of the petition contain the suppliant's grievances, and are as follows:\n2. That subsequent to the granting of the said lease, and while the same was in full force, the Crown, through the Gold Commissioner at Dawson, granted to free miners the said area covered by said suppliant's lease as placer mining claims and had placed in possession of same the said placer miners. 3. Although your suppliant paid a yearly rental as mentioned in the said lease, at the dates and times mentioned and has demanded possession of said areas mentioned in said lease, and was entitled to the same, yet Her Majesty, represented by the Minister of the Interior of Canada, refused to give up the same to your suppliant, whereby your suppliant was deprived of the same by granting of the same to placer miners and has sustained damages thereby.\nThe prayer is\nthat he recover such damages as were sustained by reason of the lands mentioned in the said lease being granted to free miners as above mentioned.\nA careful consideration leads me to conclude that the lease gives only that which cannot be granted by law to others under the placer mining regulations.\nI have set forth above the material parts of lease, regulations and pleading that I think justify my coming to that conclusion.\nTo discourse upon these extracts to one reading them with the eyes of a lawyer would seem a waste of time.\nIf my conclusion is the result of an erroneous reading I cannot cure it\u2014by more words.\nThat brings us, however, only part of the way.\nThe question then arises, do the paragraphs, Nos. 2 and 3 of the petition mean in law more than that grants to free miners have been made since the lease was given to the suppliant?\nThe presumption is in favour of the Gold Commissioner having acted legally. If anything further occurred to rebut this, it should be set forth so that the court, asked to pass upon this pleading, might understand wherein the officer of the Crown had erred, and how the Crown might be held responsible for such error. Much stress has been laid upon the words \"the said area covered by said suppliant's lease.\" It may, for aught set forth in the pleading, have been found out on the 1st of August, 1898, when the five miles of the river came to be delimited as provided by the regulation No. 3, that there was then no river; or at all events, no \"submerged beds or bars below low-water-mark,\" in that part of the river now in question.\nThe beds in the river may have become subjects of operation for a placer miner.\nHow are we to interpret this pleading? Must it not be against the pleader? If the systems that the names of Stephen and Mitford respectively stand for are inapplicable, and ancient rigidity is not to be applied, surely the pleader must yet set forth his claim with a reasonable degree of certainty.\nIf we use the words \"area covered by the suppliant's lease\" in the popular sense, it might fairly be read as that area which, at the execution of the lease, was covered by a large stream and was supposed by all parties concerned as likely to have on the first of the then ensuing August a volume of water wherein dredges might move or be moved about and usefully operate.\nIf that is to be taken as the area, meant in the pleading, as it reasonably may be in the plain ordinary meaning, then it may in the legal result have vanished and given legal place to another use and right that could legally be created over the same supposed area.\nThe taking possession, even physical possession, of the same area might be in such case justifiable. But the word \"possession\" does not always in law mean physical possession.\nIf we are to read the words \"granting\" and \"granted\" in their original strict legal meaning together with the meaning that the word \"possession\" in such a connection bore, then it meant anything but land in possession. It was some incorporeal hereditament that lay in grant. A reversion for example, might lie in grant.\nSuch I take it, is all the appellant is strictly entitled to claim as the meaning here of the words \"granted * * * possession\" in this paragraph 2.\nThe meaning of the word \"possession\" being thus properly restricted, when we are asked, without any facts set forth in the pleadings to justify us in doing so, to impute to the officer or officers of the Crown an improper and illegal course of conduct, the appellant must fail to derive any benefit from the word \"possession\" used in this paragraph.\nHe fails, if the popular meaning is given some of the words relied on, and fails when the strictly legal meaning is given others. And if he can claim throughout a popular meaning for all he still fails.\nAgain, paragraph 2 may be fairly read as counsel for the appellant seemed willing to concede, as if the word \"thereby\" had been inserted in the third line before the words \"had placed in possession.\" The prayer being only for damages by reason of the lands * * * being granted * * * as above mentioned, seems to make this clearly so.\nAssuming that to be the correct reading, I cannot find any claim for damages that can be founded on issuing such a license as a placer miner is entitled to get\u2014even if oyer the same area. It would only operate therein when the appellant's rights, if any, ceased, and so far as they ceased.\nIt would be just what the 4th Regulation incorporated into the lease allowed the Crown to do. The 2nd proviso above quoted covers what this 4th Regulation may not in this regard. The line of cases cited by appellant's counsel seem distinguishable, if not quite inapplicable to such a grant, as this so called lease more aptly described I venture to think as a license, implies; unaccompanied by any actual physical possession, taken by anybody or if supposed to have been taken, yet not shewn to have been either directed by or adopted by the Crown in derogation of the appellant's rights.\nParagraph 3, I think, must fail with paragraph two for the essential part of it relies on paragraph two in using the words\nwhereby your suppliant was deprived of the same by the granting of the same to placer miners, etc.\nIt is useless unless rested upon paragraph two, or shewn that the Crown was bound to put appellant in possession. No authority was cited for binding the Crown, merely by the force of the grant or demise, to free land granted or demised from mere trespassers.\nI would, however, if I found Coe v. Clay,[4], followed by Jinks v. Edwards[5] (cited for this purpose and pressed upon us), at all applicable to this case and this instrument (even if treated as far as possible as a demise) with the implied covenant that word carries with it in a lease, have to consider the force and binding effect of these cases in relation to such an interest as created here.\nThe express language of the first proviso above quoted, relieves me from all such necessities and considerations. It plainly says that the regulations\nshall be deemed to contain all such stipulations * * * on the part of Her Majesty * * * as it is * * * contemplated * * * that leases issued thereunder shall contain. If it be said that this is reading these words, quoted thus, from the proviso in too literal and narrow a sense, I say, read them as speaking as part of what the whole scope and purpose of the instrument expresses, and we are brought back to the regulations as a whole as expressing what is intended or can be intended by any instrument made, as I have shewn this to be, pursuant thereto.\nI cannot find in these regulations anything warranting the proposition that the Crown ever undertook to put the appellant in the physical possession of anything.\nI cannot help saying that the omission in the 3rd paragraph of a date or anything to indicate at what stage in the order of events the alleged demand was made, is unsatisfactory and the frame of both paragraphs 2 and 3, generally embarrassing.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. Donaghy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Chrysler, Bethune & Larmonth.\n[1] 10 Ex. C.R. 390.\n[2] 10 Can. S.C.R. 335.\n[3] 11 App. Cas. 607.\n[4] 5 Bing. 440.\n[5] 11 Ex. 775.\n"}

The mortgage contained no provision for advances to contractors, etc., as the work progressed, beyond the following:\n\u201cAnd it is hereby agreed between the parties hereto, that the mortgagees, their successors and assigns, may pay any taxes, rates, levies, assessments, charges, moneys for insurance, liens, costs of suit, or matters relating to liens or incumbrances on the said lands, and solicitors\u2019 charges in connection with this mortgage, and valuator\u2019s fees, together with all costs and charges which may be incurred by taking proceedings of any nature in case of default by the mortgagor, her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and shall be payable with interest, at the rate aforesaid, until paid and, in default, the power of sale hereby given shall be forthwith exerciseable. And it is further agreed that monthly instalments in arrear shall bear interest at the rate aforesaid until paid.\u201d\nIn a suit for redemption,\nHeld, first, that the clause in the mortgage did not justify the mortgagees in making advances to contractors and persons supplying material, without the express order of the mortgagor.\nSecondly, that the mortgagees ought not to have recognized an order in favour of the contractor for the total amount of the loan when they knew that the contractor had not completed his contract and was, therefore, not entitled to the money when the order contained no name of a witness, and shewed that the mortgagor was unable to sign her name. The payment having been made by the loan company to a lumber company supplying material to the contractors for the building, without the express authority of the mortgagor, and the lumber company having taken an assignment of the mortgage, and attempted to enforce it against the mortgagor the transaction was declared fraudulent as against the mortgagor, and the payment to the lumber company disallowed.\nHeld, also, that the only costs the assignees of the mortgage were entitled to add to the mortgage debt were the costs of an ordinary redemption suit consented to by a mortgagee.\nJudgment appealed from varied, and appeal dismissed with costs.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba reversing the judgment of Perdue J. at the trial, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s action for redemption was dismissed with costs, and ordering that the plaintiff should be let in to redeem.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgment now reported.\nHellmuth K.C. for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is a redemption action in which the first question to be solved is whether or not the mortgagee advanced the moneys agreed to be advanced to an amount greater than fairly covered by the terms of a tender made the appellant, who is the assignee of the mortgage.\nIf these questions are, or either is, resolved in favour of respondent, many others raised need not trouble us.\nThe learned trial judge disposed of the questions raised before him on a ground, I think, untenable in law. The respondent appealed from his judgment to the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba. That appeal was allowed by the court and usual redemption judgment pronounced with some variation as to costs.\nThe circumstances raising these questions are as follows:\nThe respondent\u2019s husband on the 21st October, 1903, applied to the Great Western Permanent Loan and Savings Co., carrying on business in Winnipeg, for a loan of $1,500 upon property in Winnipeg, stated in the application to be owned by him and upon which were being erected buildings which it was expected, when completed, would be worth $2,400. Part of the money, it was stated, would be needed when the roof was on the building. This application was not complied with, but a mortgage was arranged for on the same property for $1,000 which was to be secured by first mortgage, to be given by the respondent.\nI do not find that she signed any application. On the 28th November, 1903, she executed the mortgage which is now in question to secure the $1,000. It was apparently intended to carry out what is appropriately described as a building loan. The mortgage, however, does not represent what one would expect to find in such a security. There is no appropriate provision enabling the mortgagees to advance to contractors and material men, what might be required for the purposes of paying them, so far as the loan would extend.\nThe mortgagees had absolutely no authority to advance without instructions from the mortgagor, save that which is contained in the following provision of the mortgage \u0e30\nAnd it is hereby agreed between the parties hereto, that the mortgagees, their successors and assigns, may pay any taxes, rates, levies, assessments, charges, moneys for insurance, liens, costs of, suit, or matters relating to liens or incumbrances on the said lands, and solicitors\u2019 charges in connection with this mortgage, and valuator\u2019s fees, together with all costs and charges which may be incurred by taking proceedings of any nature in case of default by the mortgagor, her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and shall be payable with interest, at the rate aforesaid, until paid and in default the power of sale hereby given shall be forthwith exerciseable. And it is further agreed that monthly instalments in arrear shall bear interest at the rate aforesaid until paid.\nThe difference between the parties has arisen out of the combined want of some provision of a more extensive kind than this; and a want of business methods in making such advances as were made.\nThe following copied from appellant\u2019s factum is a statement of the advances claimed to have been made by the mortgagees upon the mortgage:\nA.\nDec. 9\nTo cheque, G.

Such are the issues raised here.\nIt becomes necessary to examine the evidence bearing on each item or class.\nPart (i.e.$7.00) of A. and all of H.J.M.N. and S. amounting to $158.25 are admitted to have been properly paid.\nItems B.C. and D. are disputed and we have to determine whether in fact they were authorized.\nTo satisfy my mind on this point I have found it necessary to read nearly all the evidence in the case. It is conflicting.\nA bias appears in each one of the witnesses (except Mr. Crichton, a solicitor employed by respondent) on either side of this question.\nInterest and hate are both represented.\nThe only authority for these payments is the following order:\nEXHIBIT 7.\nMessrs. Taylor and Laidlaw.\nPlease pay to Wiebe and Jardine the proceeds of my loan in the Great West Permanent Loan & Savings Company, amounting to $1,000, less costs.\nWitness. (Signed)\nher\nKATE X HIEBERT.\nmark.\nOn the face of this order it is executed, if at all, by a mark, and there is no attesting witness, though it evidently was intended there should have been one. It was drawn up by a clerk in the office of the Loan Company\u2019s solicitors and it is addressed to them. The Loan Company had then deposited with them $400 of the loan to pay over as needed. They knew respondent to be illiterate, as she had executed the mortgage by her mark.\nThe firm of Wiebe and Jardine named in Ex. 7 had the contract to build the house which the respondent was having built on the mortgaged land, when the mortgage was executed.\nThey had got some cash from respondent to begin with and were entitled to $470 when the roof was on, but no more until their contract was completed. The contract never was fulfilled and no other payment ever fell due. I assume, though it is not clear, that the roof was on and this $470 due and payable when this order was written.\nThe least inquiry then would have disclosed the fact that not only was $470.00 all that they could be entitled to but also that material supplied by the lumber company of which appellant was then president remained unpaid to an amount exceeding, this sum.\nEvidently an order to pay the sum of $1,000.00 over to Wiebe & Jardine was a thing that should not have been countenanced by the solicitors under such circumstances.\nWhoever in the solicitor\u2019s office drew it and gave it to Jardine ought in any case to have made clear to Jardine that he should in dealing with this illiterate person get a witness to see that before she made her mark she understood what she was doing.\nNone of these things that ought to have been done were done, and thus Exhibit 7 must therefore be supported by clear extraneous evidence before it can be relied upon by appellant.\nHave we got that?\nUpon the best consideration I can give the conflicting evidence on the point I cannot find that what is given in support of appellant\u2019s contention outweighs that presented by the respondent.\nExhibit 7 was taken by Jardine to respondent\u2019s house about (I infer) four or five p.m. of 23rd December, 1904, and he says was there executed, by respondent in his presence.\nHe says, of course, that he \u201cexplained it to her,\u201d but when he tells, as he does, that when she had signed it by making her mark thereto she folded it up and was putting it away in her cupboard to keep, Ave can realize how little his explanation was worth.\nShe swears she did not understand what she signed, that she understood it related to a trifling matter of eight dollars and that on reflection she became doubtful and alarmed and told her husband the same evening.\nThe story of Jardine rather confirms hers of want of understanding. The action of herself and husband going at the earliest practicable moment to a solicitor to complain and with him to Taylor, the company\u2019s solicitor, and the result shewn below presents further confirmation. The inherent improvidence of the alleged order also tends to confirm an entire want of understanding it, when we bear in mind the state of facts above related.\nThe witnesses for the appellant swear that she referred the same evening to having signed an order, but they each gave varying shades of meaning as to her understanding of it from that of an order such as Exhibit 7 is, to an order for some money, or to one for some part of the loan.\nThese witnesses belong to one household and are contradicted by respondent and her husband who were present on the same occasion. They were all at the time friendly. They supped together that night, immediately after Jardine got Exhibit 7 out of her hands.\nThe statement, respecting which such diverse stories are told, was made on the said occasion of supping together.\nThese witnesses for appellant have quarrelled since, rather bitterly, with respondent and her husband.\nWiebe, who is the only one of them swearing to a definite admission of Mrs. Hiebert, was not bold enough to maintain such contention, before them, next morning in Mr. Taylor\u2019s office. He seems to have then assented to their story. Why does he now change?\nHowever all this may be the onus of establishing \u201cExhibit 7\u201d as a valid authority rested upon those setting it up and they have failed to satisfy me of its validity.\nRespondent and her husband accompanied by a solicitor called next day (24th Dec.) upon Mr. Taylor to complain of what had taken place.\nWiebe, the partner of Jardine, was also there, and took part in what followed.\nMr. Taylor on hearing the story very properly cancelled Exhibit 7.\nHe then wrote out what is Exhibit 8 in the case, and had it executed in presence of all parties I have named as present at this meeting.\nThis Exhibit 8 is as follows:\nEXHIBIT 8.\nTo the Great West Permanent Loan and Savings Company, pay the proceeds of current loan from you to me to Cornelius Hiebert and Franzes Wiebe.\n(Signed)\nher\nKATE X HIEBERT.\nmark.\nWitness,\nW. Madely Crichton,\nC. Hiebert. It is to be observed that this does not in terms cover or in any way ratify what had been done under Exhibit 7 and cannot in any way be used to justify the payments of items B. C. D. The cheques for C. and D. were only paid on the 24th and 26th December respectively.\nIt is also to be observed that Taylor, without any explanation for doing so, retained Exhibit 7 though cancelled.\nIn justice to Mr. Taylor, I think he never acted upon it. I would infer that he gave the cheques anticipating the signature and that somebody in his office blundered.\nI know he puts it in one place as if he were positive that Exhibit 7 was got before cheques issued. Other places shew he had no recollection. On such evidence I would prefer finding that a solicitor or some one he was responsible for, committed an error, rather than impute to him deliberately acting on such a document as this Exhibit 7 presents on its face, without inquiry and evidence to establish it.\nIt seems to me that the substituted authority of Exhibit 8 under the circumstances must be taken as an agreement between all concerned that unless in the case of some inevitable necessity such as payment of taxes or expenses the company would not attempt to deal with the moneys for which they had taken the mortgage unless by the joint direction of the parties named in the order Exhibit 8.\nI am unable to comprehend why so simple a method should ever have been departed from, but it was.\nIt seems as if suggestions of Jardine or of Wiebe without any reference to Cornelius Hiebert or his sanction were followed by the Loan Company through Mr. Taylor. Items Q. and R. were paid without complying with Exhibit 8 and Mr. Taylor in regard to these and similar items falls back upon the alleged right he had to pay out sums he saw fit for work or material that \u201chad gone into the building.\u201d\nThe following evidence given by Mr. Taylor shews what mistaken notions he had of the law and facts that should have controlled him:\nQ. And beyond what Wiebe told you you don\u2019t know whether that had any relation to the building or not?\nA. It is likely I relied on his statement that it was stuff supplied to him.\nQ. You got no authority whatever from Hiebert?\nA. No.\nCheque referred to marked as Exhibit No. 14.\nQ. Now, if it should happen\u2014that cheque (14) was given, I believe, for material ?\nA. Yes, he hauled in stone and lime, John Sharpe did, and it was given for material of some kind.\nQ. Now, if it should happen that the contractor would fail in the construction of his work so that this material man would not be entitled to the loan (amount) you would still advance the mortgage money without the authority of the mortgagee, would you?\nA. No, Wiebe and Jardine had an order.\nQ. No, their order was cancelled and substituted by Hiebert and Wiebe?\nA. I don\u2019t think that they could cancel it, and I didn\u2019t think so at the time.\nQ. You would not think so, and you did not think so ?\nA. No, not without Jardine\u2019s consent.\nQ. And you still acted under the order, Exhibit No. 7, and the authority therein contained, did you?\nA. The thing was a little mixed and we did the best we could to put the material in to the building.\nQ. You still acted under the authority contained in Exhibit 7 ?\nA. Yes, still regarded that.\nQ. And still acted on the strength of that?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Don\u2019t you recollect both Mrs. and Mr. Hiebert tell you that she hadn\u2019t seen or authorized the order, Exhibit 7 ?\nA. No, I don\u2019t recollect of him telling me that. Q. Would you say that they did not do so?\nA. Oh, I couldn\u2019t say that they didn\u2019t do that. They were in a good many times, and had a good deal of conversation.\nQ. Don\u2019t you recollect Mr. Crichton telling you that Mrs. Hiebert had not seen or authorized her mark to be affixed to the first order, Exhibit 7?\nA. I think I heard something about it in some way, but I didn\u2019t think there was much in it, though I think she authorized it all right.\nQ. You didn\u2019t think there was much in it?\nA. No.\nQ. Your wisdom, dictated to you that Mr. Crichton, a solicitor, and Kate Hiebert the mortgagor, and Cornelius Hiebert her agent, came to you often and told you that she had neither signed or authorized the signature to Exhibit No. 7, that still you would rise superior to that, and recognize the orders for the payment of the mortgage moneys ?\nA. I considered it a good order.\nQ. Notwithstanding what they told you?\nA. Yes, but I tried to keep the money going into the building notwithstanding the difficulties.\nQ. You had known that the building was tied up because there was not sufficient money to complete it?\nA. Yes, we got a message that this lien was filed, and of course, we stopped them.\nQ. In respect of the Jardine order, Exhibit No. 7, do I understand from you that you acted on that, notwithstanding that you had written \u201ccancelled\u201d over the front of it?\nA. We continued to put the money into the building at the request of either Wiebe or Sardine.\nQ. Who was really doing the business?\nA. Which business?\nQ. All, the building.\nA. Well, Mr. Wiebe appeared to have the most to do with it, although Jardine continued to take some interest in it, I don\u2019t know how much.\nThis, attitude of Taylor towards the business in hand is shewn in other parts of his evidence and has a bearing on nearly all he did including his later dealings with Black and the lumber company, to which I will presently refer.\nHis allegation that Jardine did not assent to the cancellation of Exhibit 7, and substitution therefor of Exhibit 8, is remarkable. A solicitor should not have assumed that the act of one partner could not bind the other in a matter of that kind, and should not have presumed without inquiry, if tempted to so assume, that the other partner had complained or had a right to complain.\nI have not overlooked the clause relative to repairs, etc., pleaded but not relied on before us.\nNeedless to say, the facts do not permit of its application here.\nItem F. is a claim set up of an advance of $45 for an insurance premium. I infer from the evidence that this was in respect of an insurance of $3,000. The application for the loan provided for an insurance of $1,500. The buildings were expected to be, when finished, of $2,400 in value. If any such insurance were procured as $3,000 and this $45 as premium is to be taken as paid in respect of that insurance, and no other is shewn, then I have no difficulty in saying that it was entirely unauthorized. Whatever rights such insurance may have created between the mortgagees and the insurance company it is inconceivable that any such insurance could have enured to the benefit of the mortgagor.\nIt was an over-insurance. It was unnecessary, as the land was worth $400 for the protection of the mortgagees at the time that it was effected. I do not think it was warranted as coming within the authority I have quoted. There had been no advance whatsoever made on the faith of this mortgage unless we are to treat the expenses incidental to the loan as such.\nThe item for the reasons I have stated must be disallowed.\nThere is now item \u201cT.\u201d of November 2nd, 1904, which is claimed to have been paid by cheque to the Alex. Black Lumber Co. for $414.78, to be considered.\nThe appellant\u2019s company had advanced material to the contractors. On their default liens were registered by the lumber company and others.\nThe respondent attempted to arrange matters by means of a second mortgage for $500.00 to the loan company.\nThere never was anything advanced on this mortgage though Mr. Taylor saw fit to blend it with the account of the first, and thereby made it appear in the statement as if an advance had been made.\nThe lumber company on the 2nd February, 1904, took steps to enforce their lien.\nThe respondent denied that so much lumber as claimed had gone into her buildings.\nIt was the 2nd February, 1905, before judgment was given, and when credit was given for what respondent, independently of mortgagees, had paid, there was only $270.00 due by respondent to the contractors.\nThe mechanics\u2019 liens against the property could not in law exceed what the contractors were entitled to recover from the owner. This Mr. Taylor admits was the legal position as he understood it. The respondent had nothing to do with the lumber company or its claim except in this way.\nThere might be claims of thousands of dollars registered. That did not make these claims such liens as a mortgagee could pay off within the meaning of above clause I quote.\nIn October, 1905, the appellant seemed to conceive that if he could induce the loan company to advance him on account of his company\u2019s claim for lumber they could charge it up to the loan and then he could buy the mortgage; and he accomplished all this, in order, as he says, to protect his company. Perhaps he might have safely added, by fraud, or force, or both, if need be.\nThe very essence of the scheme was a fraud. It was designed thus to improperly over-reach the respondent and defeat her right to resist the claims of her defaulting contractors, by so juggling with figures and facts as to make the contractors\u2019 claim neither due nor accruing due, wear the appearance of a mortgage or part of a mortgage in Black\u2019s hands. The rest of the plan was to rank as a lien holder also, at least for the balance, to continue this lien suit and rank with other lien holders, and recover against respondent the $270.00 out of her property.\nAll the lien holders were entitled to be treated equally. This appellant and loan company decided to ignore law and facts.\nThe October arrangement between the loan company and the lumber company was unique.\nAn assignment is made from the loan company to the appellant of the mortgage and is dated 28th October, 1904. The cheque by which the consideration for the transfer to Black was paid, is dated 13th October, 1904, by the lumber company for the sum of $1,032, though no such sum due.\nThen a cheque is given to the loan company by Taylor on behalf of the company. It is dated 2nd November, 1904, for $414.78.\nIt is pretended now, despite the facts I have ref erred to, that this was an advance to pay off a lien held by the lumber company.\nIt is pretended further, and the evidence of some gentlemen concerned in carrying the arrangement out is, if not expressly so stated, clearly intended to leave the impression on the mind of the court that the one transaction was quite independent of the other; that there was no understanding that one would depend on the other; and that the appellant was making an independent investment of his own. For a time during the course of this suit the respondent\u2019s claim that he was merely the trustee of the company of which he was president was denied. I am glad to say that this position of denying such trusteeship was not taken before us. I regret the other as untenable was not clearly abandoned and these transactions allowed to stand as they really were.\nThe whole was simply a dealing between the two companies whereby the loan company got rid of a troublesome affair on such profitable terms as it never could expect otherwise, for no such sum as $1,032 was due, and the lumber company acquired an instrument that it was so ill-advised as to suppose would enable it to crush or squeeze the respondent, and others concerned in the property in question in such a manner as to promote the recovery, by indirect methods, of what it claimed to be, but was not, entitled to receive out of the property.\nIn pursuit of such purpose, the notice (which bears date the 4th of November, 1904), of exercising power of sale was immediately set in motion, and served on respondent on 11th November, 1904. All these proceedings, it must be observed, were as needless as oppressive.\nIf there really existed a lien to be enforced the lumber company could have relied upon that to enforce their rights and had no necessity to adopt the circuitous method I have outlined. If there was no lien then there was not the slightest ground for the loan company\u2019s pretending to pay on account of an advance on the mortgage the cheque for $414.78.\nI do not find that steps were taken by the loan company to try to verify the question of lien or no lien or how much it amounted to or if any of it was due or accruing due. I do not find that anything was done to find out the relation of the lien holders to each other or how or in what proportion they might be entitled to rank or claim; or in any way in short to determine whether it would be prudent to exercise their alleged rights as mortgagees under the clause above quoted.\nThe payment to the lumber company cannot rest therefore on the right given to pay off liens. It was not acted upon. It paid off no lien. The $270.00 lien, part of which appellant\u2019s company was entitled to, remained and yet remains.\nIt was not so intended to pay this $270.00 when they made the payment. The attempt to set it up now as discharging a lien is unfounded and is to support a tainted dealing no mortgagee can maintain.\nIn some way, I cannot understand how, under an instrument in the form of this mortgage Mr. Taylor, the solicitor in acting for the company seemed to imagine, or desire the court to suppose he imagined, that the company had a right to pay out of the loan for anything going into the building, as he phrases it, regardless of what Exhibit 8 meant, and of whether a lien existed therefor or not.\nIt is entirely needless to refute such crude notions of this loan company\u2019s rights under this mortgage and on the facts surrounding it.\nYet to shew that Mr. Taylor had this view, we have only to read his evidence above in which he avows that he acted under Exhibit 7 and felt he had a right to rely upon it to justify payments of the kind I refer to, long after it had been cancelled by his own hand.\nI conclude that the alleged advance of $414.78 was a mere idle form, indeed a sham, gone through between Taylor and Black for the respective purposes I have indicated and, for that and other reasons I have just given, cannot be treated as an advance on this mortgage.\nIf the facts already recited do not establish this, I may add that I have failed to find any application beyond the idle form in the way of liquidating the lien which the lumber company alleged it had.\nI have searched in vain for relief respondent got or any trace of any application of the cheque till after the appellant had gone through the form of sale under the power of sale, or before respondent had made her tender and instituted this action.\nIt was urged before us that inasmuch as the learned judge had in the lien action credited this sum of $414.78 plus something more on the 2nd February, 1905, it must be taken into account in governing this case launched in 1904.\nAll I can see in this point is that the appellant instead of awaiting the results of his company\u2019s pending action on the lien, he claims his company had, he tried by the form I am dealing with to forestall those who would probably share with him in and for anything the liens attached to.\nIt is quite impossible to uphold the contention that the respondent gained, or had reduced for her, any liability she was under by the application of this cheque in reduction of the lumber company\u2019s lien. She was not concerned beyond seeing that the $270.00 which was the total amount charged on her property was not exceeded, and incidentally that the court was advised of all she had paid amongst or to the lien holders. If any one like the lumber company for purposes of their own saw fit to reduce their claim that was none of her business. It only enured to the benefit of other lien holders, creditors of the contractors, and not to her in any way. Her property was only subject to a lien if at all f or $270 when this $414.-78 cheque was handed over and it remains so yet.\nIf the appellant got hurt in the results it neither adds to nor subtracts from the proper amount due under her mortgage.\nThe result is that the claim of this item \u201cT.\u201d must be disallowed entirely.\nThe items (as to $26.00) of A. and all of E. J. K. O. and P. are without any foundation in law and ought never to have been claimed, and must be dissallowed.\nThe notion of a right to charge such an item as the $26.00 of A. when a mortgage loan has gone through may be maintainable, yet I think doubtful unless more expressly provided for than here, \u00abbut the charging it up, when a mortgage is executed, and continuing it there when the whole transaction has fallen through as here is quite unjustifiable.\nThe items admitted and tendered are all I can find due. There is nothing of accounting left to refer but the computation of interest and fixing the charges proper to allow in connection with the loan. If the parties cannot agree the computation must be made by the, officer to whom the matters in question were referred by the court below, who will have to deal with subsequent encumbrances and tax costs as dealt with in the court below. As to the absence of the alleged purchaser as a party there is no difficulty. The purchase was never completed by registration, so as to entitle the purchaser to make any claim that he took anything.\nThe Manitoba Real Property Act makes this plain. If he has any right it is as against the vendor only. The title is in the vendor and he is bound to submit to redemption.\nThe lis pendens bound all taking under him. From Bishop of Winchester v. Paine ([1]); to Robson v. Argue ([2]), where the authorities are reviewed and thence down, the law has been so. I asked for authority to shew how or why that was not so in Manitoba. I have not been furnished with any.\nI had occasion to review in Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke v. McGrade ([3]), the authorities preceding the earlier of those cases, and consider the principles upon which the proposition I put forward rests.\nI have no doubt that these principles are applicable here especially as the lis pendens is registered in compliance with the local law.\nIn the case of a completed sale where it could be argued that by the exercise of a power paramount to all such considerations, the title had passed, (if as I conceive such a case be possible), I would reserve to myself further consideration of the rule to be applied.\nI am disposed to think the court below overlooked some matters of costs, such as proceedings for sale up to tender, and imposing on respondent the costs she has to pay although in result I find of tender being enough she ought perhaps not to bear the costs. There has been and could be no appeal and I refer to these questions only to make clear that no costs of power of sale be now allowed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs to be taxed to and payable to the respondent forthwith after taxation; and the judgment below varied to declare that such costs and all costs of the appellant herein or heretofore incurred, beyond the costs of an ordinary suit for redemption form no part of the costs of the mortgagee, or which the appellant is entitled to add to the sum due under the mortgage; that the sum due under the mortgage is only the sum of $180.00 and interest from the 22nd of December, 1904, together with such reasonable sum not to exceed the sum of $41.00 as may be due in respect of expenses of the loan, exclusive of the $7.00 for valuations included in the above fixed amount; that none of the costs of the proceedings under power of sale be allowed; and that the formal judgment of the court below be so varied as to give effect to these declarations and directions.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. R. Haney.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Elliott & MacNeil.\n[1] 11 Ves. 194.\n[2] 25 Gr. 407.\n[3] 36 Can. S.C.R. 251.\n"}

On the trial of a creditor\u2019s action to set aside the transfer to G. as a fraudulent preference the manager of the Dominion Bank testified that G.\u2019s cheque was not refused from any doubt of S.\u2019s solvency but because he had heard that S. was dealing with another bank and he wished to close the account.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that under the evidence produced G. had no reason to suppose, when the goods were transferred, that S. was insolvent and he had satisfied the onus placed upon him by the provincial statute of shewing that he had not intended to hinder, delay or defraud the creditors of S.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe material facts are set out in the above head note. The trial judge found that Spada was insolvent when he transferred the goods to Garborino but not to the knowledge of the latter and that the transaction was not a fraudulent preference under the Ontario Act relating to preferential assignments. The Court of Appeal affirmed his judgment Mr. Justice Meredith dissenting.\nMcKay and Gideon Grant for the appellants.\nTytler and R.G. Smythe for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014After a full consideration of the evidence and of the arguments which were addressed to us, I am of opinion that we ought not to disturb the finding of the learned judge at the trial, approved by the full bench of the Court of Appeal, one learned judge alone dissenting.\nThe case depends on whether or not the respondent Garborino, when he entered into the impeached transaction with Spada, knew or had reason to believe that Spada was insolvent or unable to pay his debts in full.\nSpada was an Italian and had been in business in Toronto for a number of years, dealing in Italian goods. Garborino was also an Italian, and had been acquainted with Spada for a number of years, and in 1900 had lent him two sums of $500 each, and in 1901 $1,500, upon note, without security, and in 1902 had given the Dominion Bank a bond for $10,000 to secure an account which Spada had opened with that bank. That bond was replaced by one for $3,000 some time in 1904, and this bond and the loan of $2,500 upon note, continued until the time of the impeached transaction, in July, 1905. Spada\u2019s bank account was an active one from $3,000 to $5,000 per month, foreign drafts being presented, which were always paid.\nGarborino also had an account in the Dominion Bank, but at a different branch, and having in the beginning of June, 1905, issued a cheque for $1,700 on his account, payment was refused, and upon inquiry he was informed that his cheque would not be honoured until Spada\u2019s account for which they held his guarantee was arranged. At that time Spada owed the bank $1,906.25 over and above a sum of $524.75 which was standing at his credit in a savings account in the same bank. He also had an account with the Imperial Bank, with a balance at his credit, the proceeds of a loan of $1,000 made to him upon a warehouse receipt for goods in the possession of a warehouseman named Carrie.\nUp to this time, and until the refusal to pay his cheque, there was nothing to suggest to Garborino, or any one else apparently, any doubt of Spada\u2019s solvency. He was carrying on his business as usual, with a stock of goods in his store, as he had been doing for years. Nevertheless it was only natural that Garborino should desire to be relieved from the embarrassment occasioned by the refusal of his cheque. He saw Spada about it and the latter promised to arrange the matter in the course of a month. It is not said that Mr. Boss, the Dominion Bank agent, expressed to Garborino any doubt of Spada\u2019s perfect solvency, nor that he even entertained any such doubt. The explanation he gave in his evidence at the trial of his action in refusing Garborino\u2019s cheque was that he had heard or suspected that Spada was dealing with another bank, and so he wanted to have his account closed.\nNothing further occurred until the 10th of July, when Spada, as he had promised, proposed to arrange matters with Garborino and the bank by a transfer of the goods in the possession of the warehouseman Carrie to Garborino if the latter would pay the balance due to the bank, the goods to be taken as security for that payment and also for the $2,500 due to him upon his note.\nThis was agreed to, and they went together to the office of the warehouseman. On their way they went to the Imperial Bank and Spada there obtained a release of the warehouse receipt held by that bank by paying off the charge thereon, and taking it to the warehouseman, had the goods transferred into the name of Garborino, who gave him a cheque for $1,906.25 with which to pay the balance due to the Dominion Bank, and which was paid on the same or the following day.\nIt is this transaction, whereby Spada gave Garborino security for the sum of $2,500 which was due to him upon his note, and for the $1,906.25 paid to the bank, which is attacked as a fraudulent preference.\nNow up to the conclusion of that transaction, so far as appears, there was no knowledge by any one, but Spada himself, of any debts owing by him other than those which the transaction settled. The Dominion Bank was paid, and Garborino was secured. The debtor had his stock of goods in his store, and had a balance of $422 at his credit in the Imperial Bank.\nOn the following day, however, the 11th of July, Spada sold out his stock and absconded, and then for the first time it became known that he owed very large sums to persons with whom he dealt in Italy, and was insolvent.\nThe present action was brought by some of those creditors on behalf of themselves and others, and was brought within sixty days of the transaction impeached, by which under the provincial statute, the onus of proof was cast upon the defendant.\nI think the defendant has satisfied the onus cast upon him by the statute, and that his mental condition admitted in his evidence is sufficiently explained by the refusal of his cheque by the bank.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is a creditor\u2019s action to recover goods preferentially assigned by an insolvent debtor to a creditor within sixty days before action and, thus, presumed, by virtue of R.S.O. (1897) ch. 147, sec. 2, sub-sections 2 and 3, to have been fraudulent and void as against creditors so suing.\nThe first question raised is whether or not respondent can, by merely swearing that he accepted the transfer only as security for payment of old debts and did not know of the insolvency or eve thereof, escape the operation of the Act.\nHis story is that the larger part of this debt was represented by an old promissory note of $2,500, on which interest had accrued and that the transfer was by way of security only for that and another debt.\nThe transfer is only evidenced by a misdated invoice of the goods made out by the debtor, in his shop, and in respondent\u2019s presence, charging him with the goods at fixed prices in detail as if representing an ordinary sale and that invoice is receipted with thanks.\nHe swears positively, however, that despite the form of the transaction and his acceptance of this receipted account, it was not a sale but only a security for these debts that was intended.\nCourts have been known to hesitate to accept on such an issue the uncorroborated statement, as this is, by a party thereto, that a sale in written form was in fact only intended as security\u2014indeed, it has frequently happened that such statements have been held not proven. This statement does not rest there. The sum named as total of the prices fixed for the goods would not cover the indebtedness sworn to and set forth in the pleadings. It would fall short about three hundred dollars.\nYet the respondent tells, under oath, not only that the transaction was in fact intended as a security, but that the $2,500 note which was designed by the transaction to be secured was on his getting this receipted invoice given back to Spada and by him torn up. All this stands uncorroborated by any one or, indeed, in any way. Who ever heard before this of a creditor giving up to be torn up the very note for which he was getting security when the security, by his own evidence, would fall far short of covering the debt.\nHe had no other security for these debts, if his story be true, There was no memorandum of a stated account. He does not pretend there was any, or any accounting and balance struck at this time. He had no voucher to substitute for what this $2,500 note stood for. True, he produces three withdrawal receipts on his savings-bank account some years before that together amount to $2,500, but nothing appears, save his oath, that they had aught to do with this alleged promissory note\u2014or to connect them with Spada.\nHe was an intelligent money-lender as well as shopkeeper.\nWe ask, with respect, what security can creditors have in a statutory presumption created for their protection, if tales so absurd are to be accepted by courts to rebut the presumption?\nSir William Scott said over a hundred years ago, in the case of The \u201cOdin\u201d[1].\nIt is a wild conceit that any court of justice is bound by mere swearing; it is the swearing credibly that is to conclude its judgment.\nOf course, there are not many men so intelligent as the one here in question who would venture to swear to such absurdities.\nStress was laid by the learned trial judge and in the court below on the confidence the respondent had placed in his debtor as excusing him.\nWhen we find this giving of security, sale of goods and sham invoice, all carried out between two old friends on the day, indeed at the very hour, and in the place the debtor is arranging for what is admitted to have been a wretched swindle, under the guise of sale of his entire stock, by this same debtor, whereby his other creditors are defrauded, and then the debtor absconds,\u2014how can we be so cruel, so harsh, as disbelieve the man who was so trustful and confiding till the last, as the oath referred to shews?\nThe confidence began in lending money to, and giv- ing security for his friend and fellow countryman, to the Dominion Bank, which kept a cheque on both by insisting upon the respondent, the wealthier of the two, keeping $2,000 within the bank\u2019s reach, in their savings bank branch.\nFour years after these loans began and two or three years after the suretyship, which was rather continuous and increasing, had began, the respondent attempted to withdraw $1,700 out of the bank but was refused and was told that the refusal was owing to Spada, the debtor, having overdrawn his account $2,400.\nHe went to see his solicitor. The solicitor went with him to the bank. The money remained there. The respondent borrowed elsewhere the $1,700 he had needed to complete a loan.\nIt is quite clear the respondent\u2019s money in the bank had become impounded to meet Spada\u2019s obligations and so remained.\nSpada, when face to face with his banker and surety on this date, 7th or 8th of June, could do nothing. He did not pretend he could then do anything save promise, as he did, that in a month\u2019s time he was going to make everything all right.\nThe result on the mind of the respondent, he states thus:\n253.\u2014Q. You understood from that that he couldn\u2019t settle then; that he was hard up?\nA. I got kind of funny after him.\n254.\u2014Q. You got kind of afraid?\nA. Yes.\nRespondent waited, perhaps nervously, the expiration of that month. Meantime, once or twice, when Spada, who had come to spend most of his time in New York and Buffalo, was home, the respondent saw him and was again assured by Spada, \u201che would be all right.\u201d\nWhy, if he had confidence, did he require these re-assurances? Like a shrewd, sensible man, he accepted them, but felt as above quotation describes.\nThe very day, though a Sunday, the month had expired, we find him, I take the liberty of thinking, still \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cafraid,\u201d looking up Spada, telling him \u201cabout this account.\u201d And he said: \u201cCome in to-morrow and I will settle everything.\u201d\nNo explanation was given of how. But he went and saw him, Monday, 10th of July, and was told as follows:\u2014\nQ. Then did you go to see him?\nA. Yes. I went down and saw him at his shop and he told me that, if I lent him about $1,900, he would give me enough of goods to settle everything he owed me; and I said, \u201call right.\u201d He said he would give them to me to be security. He said they were some goods he had down to the storage. I said\u2014\u201call right, I would do that.\u201d\nIt was arranged, after some delays, that the warehouseman should give a receipt providing for delivery to respondent of all the goods now in question but seventy-five baskets of cheese expected in but not yet in the warehouse, and for those an order was given to respondent by Spada. Then, the same day, they went to the shop of Spada and the transaction took the form of the invoice I have referred to.\nThe goods were in bond. The duties were unpaid. The first delivery, ex-warehouse, to respondent was on 25th of July. The account for these duties is dated 13th July, charged Spada and so marked paid. Respondent paid them. What do these things mean? Are we to accept the giving up and tearing up of the note, if unpaid, and these duties unpaid, as only marks of confidence?\nI cannot find a word of evidence to say how the customs dues were agreed to be paid. Nothing explains this custom house part of the dealing. Nothing in it renders the story of giving up and tearing up of the note more credible.\nThe next day, after exchanging receipted invoice and note as stated above, they went to the bank, and Spada paid $500 cash and respondent $1,906.25 out of money he had in the bank. Several minor errors are made by the learned trial judge in regard to the details of the transaction and customs duties which I pass by.\nI, with every respect, venture to suggest that there is error of a radical kind in the learned trial judge\u2019s treating the advance out of the impounded money as a fresh loan to Spada and a badge of confidence on respondent\u2019s part. It seems to me this false assumption tainted the whole results.\nThe cheque or form does not alter the real essence of the dealing.\nIt was, as the banker swears, a substitution. Enforced loans of that kind are not of much value as a mark of confidence in the solvency of one\u2019s debtor and much less so when we find them preceded by a month\u2019s waiting to get from the debtor what was got here.\nIt was only after a month, I surmise, of feeling \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201cafraid\u201d that the respondent felt constrained to accept such goods as he did not want and could not handle, and make the best of things. How changed from the course of four or five years of dealing without security. Why was there such a change?\nThis presents a record I regret to see stand to be accepted as a test of how the presumption in question can henceforth be rebutted.\nThe following remarks, on pages 290, 291 of the judgment in the case of The National Bank of Australasia v. Morris[2], are in point.\nTheir lordships conceive that if the creditor who receives payment has knowledge of circumstances from which ordinary men of business would conclude that the debtor is unable to meet his liabilities, he knows, within the meaning of the Act, that the debtor is insolvent, * * *. What have the defendants to set against this strong evidence that the insolvency of Braun was apparent to them? First; that Balfour states that he did not believe or suspect that Braun was insolvent. We need not inquire nicely whether Balfour used the term \u201cinsolvent,\u201d as is suggested by a subsequent passage in his evidence, in a sense compatible with Braun\u2019s inability to meet his engagements. It is sufficient that he knew the facts which ought to have shewn clearly enough that Braun could not do so.\nThe presumption adds force to them.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs. I would modify somewhat the suggestion of Mr. Justice Meredith as to an allowance he suggests to the respondent, (but as the result is the appeal is to be dismissed, I need not say more), the learned judge who in the court below took substantially the same view as I do of the case.\nDUFF J. concurred with His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Johnston, McKay, Dods & Grant.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John Tytler.\n[1] 1 C.

On receipt of a cablegram from B, notifying him of what had been done, but without disclosing the name of the proposed purchaser, A replied, by letter, stating that he was willing to sell at the price named, that he would not complete the deal until he returned home, that the sale would be subject to an existing lease of the premises and that he would not furnish evidence of title other than the deeds that were in his possession, and requesting B to communicate these terms to the proposed purchaser. On learning the conditions, C, in a letter by his solicitors, accepted the terms and offered to pay the balance of the price as soon as the title was evidenced to their satisfaction. In a suit for specific performance,\nHeld, that the correspondence which had taken place constituted a contract sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, that the words \"so soon as title is evidenced to our satisfaction,\" in the solicitors' letter accepting the conditions, did not import the proposal of a new term and that A was bound to specific performance.\nHeld, also, that an arrangement, unknown to A and made prior to the receipt of his letter, whereby B was to have a commission on the transaction from C, could not have the effect of avoiding the contract, as B was not, at that time, the agent of A for the sale of the property.\nJudgment appealed from (12 B.C. Rep. 236) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial, which maintained the plaintiff's action for specific performance with costs.\nThe case is stated in the judgment of the court, by His Lordship Mr. Justice Maclennan, now reported.\nNesbitt K.C. and G. H. Cowan K.C. for the appellant. There was no concluded agreement with the plaintiff by the defendant or his agent, thereunto duly authorized, or any memorandum in writing sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. Hussey v. Horne-Payne[2] per Cairns L.C., at page 849. The whole correspondence must be looked at; North-West Transportation Co. v. McKenzie[3]. The letter stating his lowest price to be \"thirteen thousand net\" does not confer power upon the agent to enter into a contract for sale; Hamer v. Sharp [4] per Hall V.C., at page 55; Ryan v. Sing[5]; Wilde v. Watson[6] ; Wilkinson v. Stringer[7] per Turner V.C. The unauthorized contract by a person assuming to act as an agent cannot be confirmed in part and repudiated in part, it must be confirmed as a whole; see remarks by Ellenborough L.J. in Hovil v. Pack[8], also Cornwal v. Wilson[9] per Hardwicke L.C.; and Rader's Administrator v. Maddox[10]. The defendant was ignorant of the terms and of the parties to the contract. Banque Jacques-Cartier v. Banque d'Epargne de la cit\u00e9 et du district de Montr\u00e9al[11]. The court will refuse a decree for specific performance where there is merely a treaty in view of a future contract; Huddleston v. Briscoe[12] at pages 591-2; Stratford v. Bosworth[13]; Harvey v. Facey[14] ; and there was no unqualified acceptance, Dyas v. Stafford[15] ; Holland v. Eyre[16] ; Honeyman v. Marryatt[17]; Crossley v. Maycock[18] ; Culverwell v. Birney[19] ; McIntyre v. Hood[20] ; Winn v. Bull[21] ; Hudson v. Buck[22].\nThere is no evidence to identify the proposed purchaser and the letter from the plaintiff's solicitors treated the matter as incomplete ; parol evidence cannot avail, in such a case, to shew a completed contract ; Champion v. Plummer[23] per Mansfield L.J. The alleged contract does not state who are the contracting parties. See also Smith v. Surman[24]; White v. Tomalin[25]; McIntosh v. Moynihan[26] per Burton J. at page 242. There could be no unqualified acceptance where the new term was proposed \"subject to evidence of title being approved.\" Hussey v. Horne-Payne[27] per Jessel M.R. at page 752; Queen's College v. Jayne[28]. Moreover this acceptance was written by the solicitors without authority from the purchaser; Smith v. Webster[29]. Negotiations as to a completed contract were post- poned until the defendant's return home, and the negotiations shew changed terms of payments and as to defendant being relieved from payment of rates for local improvements. Bristol C. & S. A\u00ebrated Bread Co. v. Maggs[30] per Kay J. at pages 624-5 ; Jones v. Victoria Graving Dock Co.[31] per Lush J. at page 223 ; Jervis v. Berridge[32] per Selborne L.C. ; Harris v. Robinson[33]; Coventry v. McLean[34] ; Goring v. Nash[35] per Hardwicke L.J. at page 188 ; Powell v. Lloyd[36].\nThere was still a dispute between the parties and too much uncertainty to justify a decree for specific performance ; Pearce v. Watts[37] ; Rummens v. Robins[38] ; Clowes v. Higginson[39] ; Griffin v. Coleman[40].\nThe stipulation for a secret commission disentitles the plaintiff to the decree. Panama, etc., Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber, Gutta Percha & Telegraph Works Co.[41] per James L.J. at page 125; Ex parte Bennett[42] per Eldon L.C. ; McElroy v. Maxwell[43] ; Marsh v. Buchan[44]; Powell & Thomas v. Jones & Co.[45] ; Andrews v. Ramsay & Co.[46] ; Kersteman v. King[47].\nThe fact that a \"net\" fixed price was secured does not prevent the arrangement for a secret commission from operating as a fraud ; Fish v. Leser [48]; Bartram & Sons v. Lloyd [49]; Manitoba & North-West Land Corporation v. Davidson[50]. Plaintiff's course could only be justified by actual disclosure ; Grant v. Gold Exploration, etc., Syndicate[51] per Collins L.J. at page 158 ; Shipway v. Broadwood[52].\nEwart K.C. and Bird for the respondent. The decision in Hussey v. Horne-Payne[53] is not in point. There the agreement was clearly conditional. That case was also disapproved in Chippenfield v. Carter[54] per Wright J. at page 488. See also Hack v. London Provident Building Society[55]. Neither is it binding on this court in the construction of the documents now in question. Grey v. Pearson[56] at pages 106 and 108 ; Rossiter v. Miller[57] at page 1152.\nAs to the Statute of Frauds, a writing need not have as its object the attesting of an agreement. In re Hoyle[58] at pages 98, 99, 100. Nor need the agent's authority entitle him to sign a record of contract. It is sufficient if the agent had authority to sign a memorandum for any purpose. There is, in the cablegram and letter a description sufficiently identifying the purchaser who offered $13,000 net and paid $500 on account of purchase price. Rossiter v. Miller[59] per O'Hagan L.J. at page 1147, and Blackburn L.J. at page 1153. See also Carr v. Lynch[60] and Ryan v. United States[61].\nAs to the contention that the plaintiff's name does not appear in the contract ; (1) in the receipt for the $500 the plaintiff's name does appear ; (2) it also appears in the receipt given for title deeds, which carries the signature of the defendant himself.\nUpon the questions of law involved the following cases are cited ; Newell v. Radford[62]; Hood v. Lord Barrington[63] ; Sale v. Lambert[64] ; Commins v. Scott[65] ; Catling v. King[66] ; Sarl v. Bourdillon[67]; Barkworth v. Young[68] ; Parton v. Crofts[69].\nTwo papers may, by intrinsic evidence with the aid of parol evidence of surrounding circumstances, be connected to constitute a memorandum ; Ridgway v. Wharton [70]; Campbell on Sale[71] ; Buxton v. Rust[72] ; Long v. Millar[73] ; Shardlow v. Cotterell[74] ; Cave v. Hastings[75] ; Craig v. Elliott[76]. The reference to production of a title satisfactory to the solicitors does not import the proposal of a new term. It is a mere matter of detail.\nThe rule is even more elastic where it is merely required to supplement an incomplete memorandum, signed by the party to be charged, with another also signed by him. It is sufficient here if they can with reasonable certainty be construed as relating to one transaction. Allen v. Bennett[77]; Western v. Russel[78] ; Warner v. Willington[79] ; Baumann v. James[80] ; Studds v. Watson[81] ; Oliver v. Hunting[82]. It is sufficient if the name of the agent appears on the receipt for the deposit instead of that of the vendor. Smith v. Brentnell[83]. The names of the parties need not all be in the same document. Warner v. Willington[84] at p. 533; Buxton v. Rust[85]. The contract need not be in writing ; only the evid\u00e8nce of the contract is required to be in writing. The documents may be written alio intuito ; Jones v. Victoria Graving Dock Co.[86].\nAs to the arrangement for commission, there was nothing concealed in the action of the plaintiff; the defendant expressed no surprise at what he was told ; he knew very well that he had himself provided for the payment to the agent ; and he went on with the necessary preparations for closing the transaction after the plaintiff had told him of the payment to the agent. All cases re secret commission are dependent on fraud as an element of the defence. It must be proved. None here exists on the facts. Where concealment does not exist no secret about the commission can be pretended. Cavendish-Bentinck v. Fenn[87] ; Corporation of Salford v. Lever [88].\nThe following authorities are also referred to : Panama, etc., Telegraph Co. v. India Rubber, etc., Co.[89]; Ex parte Bennett[90]. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014 I am of opinion that this appeal fails. The action is by the respondent Calori against the appellant for the specific performance of an alleged contract of sale by the appellant to the respondent of a parcel of land in Vancouver.\nThe respondent succeeded at the trial and also in an appeal taken to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Irving J. dissenting, and the present appeal is from the judgment of the Supreme Court.\nThe question in the case is whether there was any contract between the parties, and whether there was a sufficient memorandum thereof signed by the appellant to support the action.\nThe appellant was a business man resident at Vancouver, and owning property there, but when the material acts bearing upon the case occurred, was absent in England.\nThe respondent, Calori, was a hotel proprietor in Vancouver, and a firm of W. A. Clark & Co. were land agents, also in Vancouver.\nOn the sixth of January, 1905, Clark & Co. (whom I shall hereafter call Clark), without any authority from either Andrews or Calori, cabled Andrews inquiring lowest price for the lot in question, and received an answer on the 9th of January, \"thirteen thousand net.\" He then went to Calori and proposed to him to buy at that price, but Calori refused, offering to give twelve thousand. Thereupon, Clark, on the same day, cabled to Andrews\u2014\"Best offer I can get $12,000 net to you ; can I accept?\"\nTo this Andrews made no reply, but between that date and the twenty-fifth of January, Clark managed to work Calori up to the $13,000 mark, and, on that day, Calori paid Clark $500 and obtained from him a receipt in the following terms:\u2014\nReceived from A. Calori the sum of $500, five hundred dollars, deposit on lot 24, block 8, D., 196, on purchase price of $13,000 (net to F. T. Andrews), subject to confirmation of owner. Title being satisfactory.\nThat was a strange, bold thing to do, inasmuch as he had no authority of any kind whatever from Andrews to do anything of the kind. I think that Calori's evidence, as well as the form of the papers, shews that Clark had no authority from Calori either, and was not his agent.\nHaving given Calori that receipt, he cabled to Andrews the same day, as follows:\u2014\nSold lot 24, block 8 196, thirteen thousand dollars net you deposit paid by client $500 confirm cable.\nUp to this point, neither Calori nor Andrews had signed anything which could be called a contract, or a memorandum of a contract, nor had anything been signed by any agent on behalf of either of them. Clark had assumed to sign the receipt as if he had authority, but he had none.\nNevertheless, the effect of paying the $500, and taking the receipt which he had taken was a verbal offer by Calori to buy the land from Andrews for $13,000.\nAndrews answered Clark's cable of the 25th of January, on the 27th, saying, \"writing acceptance,\" and he followed that by a letter to Clark on the 2nd of February.\nWhen writing this letter, Andrews knew that there was a certain person who was willing to buy, at $13,000, and also had actually paid a deposit of $500. That person, however, had signed nothing, and even his name was not known to him. But his identity and name were not uncertain. Both were known to Clark.\nThe letter was as follows:\u2014\nFebruary 2nd, 1905.\nMessrs. Clark & VanHouten,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nI am in receipt of your cablegram dated January 26th, offering me $13,000 cash for my property on Hastings street, lately occupied by McKay as a hardware store. I answered your cable (writing acceptance), my reason for doing this was I wanted it understood distinctly that I could not complete the deal until I returned, which may not be until April. It would be impossible to close before as the title deeds belonging to the property were left in Toronto. I will accept the offer on the following terms, that is, the adjustments to be calculated to the first of April. After that time the purchaser can collect the rents. The premises are leased for a year from last fall.\nKindly make it known to the purchaser so that there will not be any misunderstanding, be sure and tell the purchaser that I cannot give him possession of the premises, he will simply have to accept the present tenant, of course, I accept the thirteen thousand net, cash offer with the understanding that I am not to be called upon to produce or procure any title papers other than those in my possession, no doubt you have explained all the details to your client.\nI may state that the title to the Hastings street property was accepted by Davis, Marshall & MacNeill acting for Hull.\nKindly write and let me know if your client accepts these terms, as other parties have written and cabled me for price.\nYour prompt attention will greatly oblige.\nYours truly,\nF. T. ANDREWS.\nNow this letter is a distinct offer to sell the land in question, on certain specified terms and conditions, for $13,000 net cash, to the person who had paid the deposit of $500. It was written to Clark with a request that it should be communicated to that person, and Clark is requested to inform him whether the terms are agreed to. The letter was received by Clark and communicated to Calori, who agreed to the altered terms, and immediately instructed his solicitors to communicate that to Clark, which they did by letter of 22nd February. Clark communicated this to Andrews by letter of the 23rd February, for the first time disclosing to Andrews the purchaser's name.\nI think it is clear that, on receipt by Andrews of this letter of 23rd February, there arose a complete contract of sale and purchase between the parties, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, subject to a question arising upon certain words contained in the solicitors' letter of the 22nd of February.\nThat letter was as follows:\u2014\nFind enclosed herewith copy of letter of F. T. Andrews to you in regard to the sale of his Hastings street property to Mr. Calori. We have retained the original letter pursuant to your kind permission and will thank you to confirm the terms suggested by Mr. Andrews to him by letter. It will be quite satisfactory to Mr. Calori to take the property over, subject to the tenancy, and so far as the question of title deeds is concerned, we accept unreservedly the stipulations made by Mr. Andrews. We are ready, at any minute, to pay this money over to Mr. Andrews as soon as proper title is evidenced to our satisfaction, and we shall be obliged if you will ask Mr. Andrews to have such title deeds as are in his possession forwarded here with a solicitor's abstract to enable us to examine into the title fully.\nAnd it is urged that the words \"so soon as proper title is evidenced to our satisfaction\" are a new stipulation or condition of the contract proposed on behalf of the plaintiff, and which was never assented to by the defendant in writing.\nI am unable to assent to this view of those words.\nThe two letters must be read together.\nThe defendant had stipulated that the sale should not be completed until the first of April, after his return from England. His title deeds were in Toronto, and he is not to be called upon to produce any title papers other than those in his possession. He wants to have no trouble searching for or producing title papers not in his possession. That stipulation would clearly not oblige the purchaser to accept a bad or defective title, but, if accepted simpliciter, it might leave room for a contention that the purchaser had agreed to accept such title as might be shewn by the vendor's deeds and papers when produced, even if defective. To guard against any inference or contention of that kind the solicitors say, the money is ready, let Mr. Andrews send forward his deeds and the title papers in his possession. But, if these deeds and title papers do not disclose a good title, we must still be satisfied that it is good. I think the words which follow shew that is all that was meant. They ask for his deeds and a solicitor's abstract \"to enable them to examine into the title fully.\"\nThe sense in which these words were used is also illustrated by the language used by the same solicitors in their letter to the defendant of the 31st January. Their words are:\u2014\nIf the title as disclosed is satisfactory, there will be no delay.\nIn the case of Hussey v. Horne-Payne[91], a similar question arose, the words used in that case being \"subject to the title being approved by our solicitors.\" The Court of Appeal[92] held that these words were a new term. That was, however, dissented from in the House of Lords[93] Cairns L.C., at pp. 321-2, concur- red in by Lords Selborne and Gordon, and although the judgment was affirmed in other grounds, must be deemed to be overruled. Hack v. London Provident Association[94], in the Court of Appeal.\nIt was also contended that the parties did not regard the terms of the contract as completely settled by the letter of the 23rd of February, but entered upon a further discussion of terms.\nI do not think that anything which is shewn to have occurred can be regarded as a waiver of the contract which had been deliberately made, or as having opened the negotiations de novo.\nSome argument was also made upon the fact that Clark received a commission from Calori of $200 upon the transaction. If Clark had been the defendant's agent for sale, at that time, such a payment would have been a bribe and a fraud upon the defendant. 1 Dart on Vendors and Purchasers, page 214, and cases there cited. But Clark was not then the defendant's agent for sale, nor did he act for him at any time, until he was requested to communicate to the plaintiff his letter of the 2nd of February.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cowan & Reid.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bird, Brydone-Jack & McCrossan.\n[1] 12 B.C.

A. & Co. instructed, brokers in Philadelphia to purchase for them 600 shares of the stock, paying $9,000, nearly half the price, and pledged the whole 600 for the balance. The Philadelphia brokers pledged these shares with other securities to a bank as security for indebtedness and later drew on A. & Co. for the balance due thereon, attaching the scrip to the draft which was returned unpaid and 475 of the 600 shares were then sold and the remaining 125 returned to A. & Co. In an action by the latter to recover from C. the balance due on the advance to purchase the shares with interest and commission:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont. L.R. 435, affg. 10 Ont. L.R. 159), Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that the brokers had no right to hypothecate the shares with others for a greater sum than was due from C. unless they had an agreement with the pledgee whereby they could be released on payment of said sum; that there never was a time when they could appropriate 300 of the shares pledged for delivery to C. on paying what the latter owed; and that, therefore, they were not entitled to recover.\nThe bought note of the transaction contained this memo: \u201cWhen carrying stock for clients we reserve the right of pledging the same or raising money upon them in any way convenient to us.\u201d\nHeld, per Davies and Idington JJ., that this did not justify the brokers in pledging the shares for a sum greater than that due from the customer. Per Duff J.\u2014That the shares were purchased before this note was delivered, and it could not alter the character of the authority conferred on the brokers; and that no custom was proved which would modify the common law right and duties of the brokers and their customer in the transaction.\n(Leave to appeal to Privy Council was refused.)\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note and fully set out in the several opinions of the judges on this appeal.\nC. Millar, for the appellant. The brokers did not execute the order to buy the stock. They cannot be allowed to substitute their personal liability for the security to which appellant is entitled. DosPassos on Stock Brokers[3]; Cox v. Sutherland[4]; Mara v. Cox[5]; Douglas v. Carpenter[6] at page 333.\nBy placing appellant\u2019s order joined to orders from other customers with the brokers in Philadelphia no privity was created between the appellant and the sellers of the stock. Robinson v. Mollett[7]; Beckhuson & Gibbs v. Hamblet[8].\nFrom the time the stock was purchased it was always pledged by Ames & Co. for more than was due from appellant.\nTilley, for the respondent. Brokers are entitled to be indemnified against loss incurred in properly carry- ing out the customer\u2019s orders. Duncan v. Hill[9]; Thacker v. Hardy[10]; Forget v. Ostigny[11]. And such right is not lost by wrongful termination of the contract by the broker. It is only diminished in amount by the damage to the customer. Dos Passos on Stock Brokers, 2 ed., p. 230. Minor v. Beveridge[12]; Ames & Co. v. Sutherland[13].\nThe customer is deemed to be aware of the usual course of dealing and to authorize the broker to act in accordance therewith. Grissell v. Bristowe[14].\nThe brokers were not obliged to hold for their customer the particular shares bought. The evidence shews that this is a custom binding on the principal. Scott & Horton v. Godfrey[15].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014As more fully explained by my brother Davies, the plaintiffs (A.E. Ames & Co.), now respondents, allege that on the 28th April, 1902, as stock brokers doing business in Toronto, they were instructed by the defendant, now appellant, to purchase for him in a way sanctioned by the rules and usages of the Stock Exchange, a certain number of shares of the common stock of the Lake Superior Company at the then current market price. Coincident with the giving of the order, a certain amount was paid on account of the price by the appellant, it being then understood and agreed that the money required to complete the purchase was to be provided by the respondents. The two courts below find as facts that the stock was purchased and the mandate properly executed according to usage by the brokers and, on the evidence, as I read it, these findings are fully justified. I am of opinion that there is no error in the judgment appealed from. The brokers having fulfilled their duty according to the general known usages and customs of the Stock Exchange are entitled to recover their commission and the amount they expended necessarily and properly in the course and for the purpose of their employment. Mollett v. Robinson[16] at p. 94; Scott & Horton v. Godfrey[17] at p. 736; Bentinck v. London Joint Stock Bank[18] pp. 120-140-141; Chase v. City of Boston[19].\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the appeal court that to a large extent the questions to be determined in this appeal depend upon the appreciation the court forms of the evidence. Substantially the question to be decided is whether or not the plaintiffs have shewn affirmatively that they bought the stock they were instructed to purchase by and for the appellant, and after such purchase held the same for him so that at all times they were ready and able to deliver the stock to the defendant (appellant) had he come to them to redeem it.\nI agree with Anglin J., who delivered the dissenting opinion in the Divisional Court, substantially in his statements of the law governing transactions of this kind, and in his appreciation of the evidence, given by the partners of Ames & Co. The 300 shares of the stock of the Lake Superior Consolidated Company which appellant instructed his brokers, the respondent Ames & Co., to purchase for him and on which he advanced them the sum of $3,000 as a marginal payment, were purchased by Ames & Co. through their brokers Chandler & Co., Philadelphia, together with 300 other shares of the same stock for other customers by the same order and on the same day. On being advised by their brokers in Philadelphia of the purchase by them of the 600 shares, Ames & Co. remitted to Chandler & Co. $9,000 on the total purchase of the 600 shares leaving a debit balance against them with Chandler in respect of the purchase of $9,375 leaving the whole 600 shares in Chandler\u2019s possession as security for the balance. Chandler & Co. in turn, acting within their assumed rights, pledged all of the shares to a bank in Philadelphia as collateral security for monies due by them to the bank.\nOn 12th December, 1902, Chandler & Co. drew on Ames & Co. for the amount of the balance due to the former firm on the purchase of the 600 shares ($9,375) and interest, and annexed the scrip for the shares to the draft but the draft with scrip annexed was returned unpaid.\nFour days afterwards, viz., 16th December, 1902, Chandler & Co. sold the shares except 125 which they returned to respondent, Ames & Co. on the 30th December, at which time the respondent\u2019s account with Chandler was ended and closed.\nFrom the time of the purchase by Chandler of the 600 shares until their sale they were continuously pledged by Ames & Co. to Chandler for a greater sum than Conmee owed to Ames & Co. (compare Ames & Co.\u2019s account with Conmee, Ex. 1, and their account with Chandler & Co., Ex. 21), with the possible exception of two days just before their sale by Chandler, and there was no evidence shewing the right of Ames & Co. on behalf of Conmee to redeem his 300 shares from the possession of Chandler & Co. or the persons with whom that firm had pledged the shares in Philadelphia on payment of the amount Conmee owed on them.\nAs a fact Ames & Co. never had the 600 shares purchased by Chandler & Co. in their possession or under their control; they dishonoured the draft drawn on them by Chandler & Co. for the balance of the purchase money of the 600 shares of which Conmee\u2019s 300 formed a part, and there was no satisfactory or precise evidence of the existence of a condition of things enabling Ames & Co. to obtain and deliver over to Conmee these 300 shares from Chandler & Co. or their pledgees at any time after their purchase and until their sale on payment or tender of the balance due by Conmee on them.\nMr. Tilley, respondent\u2019s counsel, frankly admitted on the argument that unless these 600 shares in Chandler & Co.\u2019s hands or those of their pledgees were counted by Ames & Co. as available shares which they could deliver to any one of their customers for whom they had purchased and were carrying this particular class of Lake Superior common shares, on demand and payment by the purchaser of any balance due by him, he could not under the evidence contend that Ames & Co. had sufficient of these Consolidated Lake Superior common shares to meet possible demands which their customers might make upon them.\nFrom the time of the purchase by Chandler & Co. of the 600 shares the possession of which were admittedly necessary by Ames & Co. to enable them to discharge their obligations as brokers of their clients until their sale by Chandler & Co. after the dishonour of the draft on Ames & Co., the evidence shews that the shares were either held by Chandler & Co. for \u201cpurposes of hypothecation or for security of the debit balance owing by Ames & Co.\u201d and that only 125 shares were ever delivered by Chandler & Co. to Ames & Co., namely on December 30th after the sale of the other 475 shares.\nMr. Chandler of the firm of Chandler & Co., when examined, after stating how the shares were held by his firm as above, went on to say:\nThe six hundred shares were either deposited in the course of the ordinary transaction of business as collateral security with lenders or carried by us.\nHe was unable to say which, but he added that\nwhen deposited by their firm for an advance it would be liable to the lender for the firm\u2019s total indebtedness to the lender.\nNow it seems to me to have been incumbent on Ames & Co. under these circumstances in order to maintain this action and in the face of Mr. Tilley\u2019s admission as stated above, to have shewn their absolute right to obtain Conmee\u2019s 300 shares from Chandler & Co. or their pledgees at any time on payment of Conmee\u2019s balance to them on the purchase of the shares, and Chandler & Co.\u2019s readiness to deliver them on payment of such purchase money.\nI can find no satisfactory evidence on that point. The evidence of Mr. Fraser, one of the firm of Ames & Co., was simply in general terms. We could always have delivered the stock on payment. We could always make delivery to him of it without buying it.\nThe next answer he makes throws a flood of light on what he meant by saying the firm could always make delivery of the stock. He is asked:\u2014\nWhile the 600 shares were with Chandler\u2019s did you have enough shares to answer the requirements of all your clients without that? A. Well, I don\u2019t know.\nNow his counsel admits that he had not and on determining whether he could or could not deliver the shares to Conmee if demanded we are relegated to the facts in connection with the purchase and pledging by the Philadelphia brokers of the 600 shares, and the further fact that all the shares held by Ames & Co. were also pledged to cover their indebtedness.\nMy conclusion from these facts is not so much that there was a subsequent conversion of the stock purchased by Ames & Co. as that they never did legally purchase and hold for Conmee as they contracted to do and as in their statement of claim they stated they had done the 300 shares he had contracted with them to purchase and hold for him.\nIt was contended by Mr. Tilley that the bought note alleged to have been forwarded to Conmee at the time of the purchase of the shares by them had a memorandum on its margin as follows:\u2014\nWhen carrying stocks for clients we reserve the right of pledging the same in raising money upon them in any way convenient to us.\nAnd that this memorandum authorized and justified the pledging of the stock by the brokers in the manner shewn in this case. Without expressing any opinion whether or not this memorandum was brought to the notice of the defendant so as to form a condition of the contract entered into between him and Ames & Co., I am not prepared to say that its language authorized the pledging by the brokers of the stock for an amount beyond what the purchaser owed the brokers upon its purchase. In my opinion it does not. The language used should be confined to an authority to determine the \u201cmost convenient way\u201d they should pledge the stock and not to authorize them to pledge it for amounts which the law prohibited. If brokers desire that the latter power should be given them they must use in their contract clear and unequivocal language on this point.\nI take it there cannot be much difference of opinion as to the law regulating the broker\u2019s rights and liabilities towards his customer on the purchase of stock on margin.\nThe broker must at all times have on hand stock sufficient in quantity to deliver to his client upon the payment by the latter of the amount due by him upon the stock.\nThe purchaser does not rely upon nor does his right depend upon an engagement with the broker to procure and furnish the shares when required but upon the latter\u2019s duty and obligation to purchase and hold for the customer the number of shares ordered by the latter subject only to the payment of the purchase price or such part of it as may be unpaid.\nWhile the broker may lawfully pledge the customer\u2019s securities for an amount not exceeding the indebtedness of the customer to him any disposition of the securities or mingling of them with other securities pledged which has the effect of depriving the cus- tomer of his right to their immediate possession upon payment or tender by him of his indebtedness to the broker will amount to a conversion.\nIf the broker for his own benefit or convenience chooses to mingle his customer\u2019s securities with those of other of his customers or his own and rehypothecates them for a greater amount than the customer\u2019s indebtedness to him not retaining in his possession a like amount of similar securities or not having a special agreement with the bank or person with whom he has hypothecated the customer\u2019s stock preserving the rights of his customer as they are above stated, he is guilty of conversion.\nClarkson v. Snider[20], and the authorities collected in DosPassos on Stock Brokers (2 ed.) pages 257 and 259, especially Douglas v. Carpenter[21].\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the divisional and appeal courts, and judgment entered for the defendant upon the issue joined on the third statement of defence, with costs of that issue.\nIDINGTON J. concurred with Davies J.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014Appeal by defendant Conmee from a judgment against him at the trial for $4, 217. 62, affirmed by a divisional court, with a slight variation, Anglin J. dissenting, and afterwards affirmed by the court of appeal for Ontario.\nAmes & Co. were a firm of stock brokers in Toronto, when the facts of the case occurred, and their co-plaintiffs, The Securities Holding Co. have, by assignment, succeeded to the rights and interests of Ames & Co. The plaintiffs\u2019 case is that on the 27th of April, 1902, they were employed by the defendant, as brokers, for commission and reward, to purchase for him 300 shares of Lake Superior Consolidated Stock, of the par value of $100 per share, and to hold the same for him, upon a margin of ten per cent. of the par value, the marginal payment to be added to from time to time on demand, in case of a decline in the market value of the shares. They allege the contract to have been that the marginal payments were to be regarded as payments on account of the purchase money, the remainder of the purchase money being a loan by the brokers to their customer to be repaid on demand with interest, and secured by pledge of the shares, with right of sale on default of payment.\nThey allege a payment to them on the 27th of April, 1902, by the defendant of the sum of $3,000 on account of margin, and a purchase by them for him on the following day of 300 shares at $30\u00bd per share, equal to $9,150; that a further payment of $1,800 on account of margin was made, but that the shares having afterwards steadily declined in the market, they made frequent demands upon the defendant for further margin, and the same not having been paid, they sold the shares on the 10th of July, 1903, at $213\/16 per share, and they seek to recover $4,190.89 as a balance due to them from the defendant, for purchase money advanced on his behalf and interest thereon.\nIt appears to me that the all important question in the case is whether or not the plaintiffs have proved performance on their part of the alleged contract.\nWhat they did, according to the evidence, after receiving the sum of $3,000 from the defendant for margin, was to employ a firm of Chandler & Co., brokers in Philadelphia, to purchase, not 300 shares but 600 shares of the stock, at $30\u00bd per share, equal to $18,300, paying Chandler $9,000 on account of the price, and leaving a balance of $9,300 due to that firm, for which sum and interest the latter retained the whole 600 shares in pledge, as their security, continuously from the time of purchase until the following month of November, when the market value of the shares had fallen to $21\u215b per share.\nIt is also in evidence that, there being the large sum of $9,300 due to Chandler & Co., that company pledged these shares, along with other shares, to their bankers for a very large sum. And there is no evidence of any stipulation by the plaintiffs with Chandler & Co., if that would make any difference, that the 300 shares alleged to have been bought for the defendant, could be redeemed by or on behalf of the defendant, either from Chandler & Co.\u2019s bankers, or from Chandler & Co. themselves, on payment of the balance of purchase money owing by the defendant to the plaintiff, as upon a purchase of 300 shares only.\nWhat the plaintiffs contracted to do was to buy 300 shares for the defendant, and to advance for him the price, over and above the sum of $3,000, and to hold the shares as security, ready to be delivered on payment of their advance, with interest and commission.\nThe defendant\u2019s right upon such a contract clearly was to require delivery of the shares upon payment of what he owed with interest and commission. He became a debtor to the plaintiffs for an ascertained sum, and upon payment of that sum was to be entitled to delivery of the shares. But the plaintiffs had in the very act of purchase encumbered the shares, not merely with the sum which would have been due to them on a purchase of 300 shares, namely $6,300, but with a sum of $9,300.\nThat being so, I think it is clear the plaintiffs did not perform the contract on their part. They had not the 300 shares which they had agreed to buy, at any time ready to be delivered to the defendant on payment of the balance of the purchase money. There never was even a moment when he had a legal right to receive those shares on payment of what he owed. If the plaintiffs demanded them of Chandler & Co., they could not, as of right, have them without paying $9,300, instead of $6,300, which was all the defendant owed. Nor could either the plaintiffs or Chandler & Co. have them while they remained pledged to the bankers of the latter, without paying the bankers\u2019 whole claim.\nIt seems to me too plain to require authority to support the proposition, that while a broker, like any other mortgagee, may pledge his client\u2019s shares for an advance, he may not pledge them for more than is due to himself. He can have no right to expose his client\u2019s, or his debtor\u2019s property, to the contingencies or chances of his own solvency. Nor can it make any difference that he throws in what he deems sufficient countersecurity. It is clear, in my opinion, that if Chandler & Co. had bought 300 shares instead of 600, and if the plaintiffs treating them as bought for the defendant, had paid them the full price, the plaintiffs could not afterwards lawfully have pledged those shares, even with others, for a larger sum than was due to them by the defendant, without a distinct stipulation for redemption on payment of the latter sum. And if the broker could not do that after the purchase, no more could he do it the very moment and by the act of purchase. To do so after the purchase would be a wrong and a breach of trust of the plainest kind, and therefore to do so at the moment of purchase and as a part of the transaction must vitiate it as against the client and be a failure to perform his contract with him.\nWhile this position seems to me to be very clear on principle neither is it without authority. See Clarkson v. Snider[22]; Douglas v. Carpenter[23]; Taussig v. Hart[24]; DosPassos 257-9.\nThe case of Scott & Horton v. Godfrey[25], relied on by the learned chancellor at the trial, is quite different from the present. There the intention of the parties was that the broker should make a contract between his client and the sellers of the shares, and the action was by the latter against the client. It was as if Chandler & Co. were here suing Conmee. It is not suggested that there was any contract in the present case between Chandler & Co. and Conmee. The plaintiffs\u2019 case, as plainly stated in their statement of claim, is that they were to purchase and hold the shares for the defendant, and were to advance part of the purchase money. That case, moreover, was tried with a special jury who found the bargain to have been as contended for by the plaintiffs.\nI am therefore of opinion that the purchase made by the plaintiffs through Chandler & Co. was not a performance of their contract with the defendant.\nNor is it attempted to be shown that the plaintiffs made any other purchase of shares for the defendant. That is the purchase, and the only purchase, on which their claim is rested, either in their statement of claim or in their evidence. If there was any other purchase, what was its date? Or at what price was it made? There is not even a suggestion of any other.\nBut then it is said that the plaintiffs always had shares on hand to answer the alleged purchase for the defendant. It may be conceded that if they had bought 300 shares through Chandler & Co., and if they were in Chandler & Co.\u2019s hands subject to a sum not exceeding what Conmee owed, they could appropriate to Conmee any other equivalent number of shares in their possession, subject to the same debt. But if the purchase through Chandler & Co. was imperfect or defective, then they could not appropriate any other shares to the defendant, even if they had any number of them in their possession free and unpledged and unincumbered. Their contract with him was, as they themselves allege, to buy for him, and not to sell to him. They could not buy from themselves, and they do not pretend to have done so. Robinson v. Mollett[26].\nThe appeal should, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed, and the action should be dismissed with costs both here and below.\nDUFF J.\u2014The plaintiffs claim the balance of moneys paid by Ames & Co. in the purchase of 300 shares of consolidated Lake Superior common stock for the defendant as his brokers. The character of the employment of Ames & Co. in the course of which these moneys are alleged to have been paid is stated in the second paragraph of the statement of claim. I transcribe the paragraph in full: On or about the 27th day of April, 1902, the defendant employed and instructed the plaintiffs, as stock brokers for commission or reward, to purchase and hold for him certain shares of stock (300 of Soo Common) as particularly set forth in the sixth paragraph of the Statement of Claim and requested the plaintiffs to advance to him part of the moneys necessary to enable him to become the purchaser of such shares.\nThe payment\u2014in point of fact\u2014of the moneys sued for, is not in dispute. The defendant resists the claim upon the grounds, first, that the mandate of Ames & Co. was to acquire for him as his broker 300 shares of the stock referred to and to hold them for him upon the terms that on payment of his indebtedness in respect of their advances he should be entitled to the delivery of the shares, and that this mandate has not been executed; secondly, that if such a purchase was made he is relieved from liability to indemnify Ames & Co. in respect of it by reason of their subsequent wrongful dealing with the subject matter of the purchase.\nAs I think the defendants ought to succeed on the first ground, I wish to be understood as expressing no opinion whatever upon any of the points involved in the second.\nOn the day on which Ames & Co. received the defendants\u2019 order, they instructed their Philadelphia agents, Chandler & Co. to buy 600 shares of the stock in question. These were bought at 30\u00bd three parcels (one of 400 and two of 100 each) and the certificates, having transfers executed in blank attached to them, were delivered on the following day. Of the purchase price of the whole 600 shares Chandler & Co. advanced for account of Ames & Co. $9,375.\nThese 600 shares passed to Chandler & Co. on account of Ames & Co., subject to a charge for the whole sum advanced by Chandler & Co. They remained subject to that charge. There was no time when Ames & Co. were entitled in law to appropriate 300 of these shares to the defendant so that he could, on the payment of the amount which Ames & Co. had agreed to advance to him ($6,000.00 plus interest and commission) put forth his hand and take the appropriated shares as his own. I do not think, therefore, that speaking of any 300 of these 600 shares, it can, in accordance with the fact, be said that Ames & Co. had purchased them, and were holding them for the defendant, under the terms of their agency,\u2014that the defendant should be entitled to the delivery of them at any time upon the payment of these sums.\nI do not, of course, overlook Mr. Tilley\u2019s point, that Ames & Co., having other stock which they held for other customers free from any such burden, could at any time have met the defendant\u2019s demand. I think this point fails for the want of evidence to support it. Mr. Tilley relies on the evidence of Fraser; but that evidence in substance only amounts to this, that if the defendant had demanded his stock they could on payment of the balance of the purchase money have made delivery of it to him. I have no doubt that is so. I have no doubt, for instance, that, speaking after the event, Fraser could truly say that they could have got 300 shares from Chandler on the payment of the amount of Ames & Co.\u2019s advances; but the statement really affords us no assistance whatever on the point at issue.\nNor, with respect, can I agree with the view taken by Mr. Justice Osler in the court below that the failure on the part of the defendant to set up a wrongful dealing with the stock by Ames & Co. helps the plaintiffs in considering the effect to be given to this evidence. It is not a question, in my view, whether Ames & Co. did something analogous to a conversion of the defendant\u2019s stock in procuring from Chandler & Co. an advance of a portion of the purchase money on the terms on which it was procured. The advance by Chandler & Co. and the purchase, must, I think, be treated as a single transaction; and the real question put in the form most favourable to Ames & Co. is: Had they as a result of the transaction in question 300 shares of the specified stock which on payment of the sums referred to they were legally entitled to appropriate and deliver to the defendant? To shew that they had was, I think, part of the respondents\u2019 case.\nI have still to refer to Mr. Tilley\u2019s argument based upon the letter informing the defendant of the purchase dated 28th April, 1902, which is said to have been mailed to the defendant at Port Arthur. The letter contains a memorandum in the words:\nWhen carrying stocks for clients we reserve the right of pledging the same or raising money upon them in any way convenient to us.\nIt is argued that the defendant, having received this letter, by his silence acquiesced in Ames & Co.\u2019s course of dealing. On the evidence I have no difficulty in concluding that the term expressed in the memorandum was not referred to in the conversation which occurred when the defendant gave his order; and it is not disputed that the purchase by Chandler & Co. was complete before the defendant received the letter, if he ever received it. Assuming that it came to his attention, it cannot, I think, with respect to transactions already past be held to alter the character of the authority conferred upon Ames & Co. as a result of what happened at the time the order was given: North-West Transportation Co. v. MacKenzie[27].\nTo prevent misconception, I should add this. There is no sufficient evidence in this case, of any custom which would have the effect of modifying the reciprocal common law rights and duties of the defendant and Ames & Co. in respect of the matters I have dealt with. The case was argued by both counsel and I have dealt with it on that basis.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Thomson, Tilley & Johnson.\n[1] 12 Ont.

A. Allen, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appeal is allowed with costs. I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree in the opinion of my brother Maclennan.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories upon a case stated by the police magistrate of the City of Calgary arising out of the prosecution and conviction of the respondent under the provisions of the Medical Professions Act, ch. 28, of the statutes of Alberta.\nThe sole questions raised are whether or not the prohibition in the said statute against practicing medicine without being registered in accordance with the terms of that statute, and the imposition of a penalty for breach of such prohibition are intra vires the powers of the Legislature of Alberta. The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were carved out of the North-West Territories by Acts passed by the Dominion Parliament.\nPrior to the passing of said Acts, the \"Medical Professions Ordinance,\" ch. 52 of the Consolidated Ordinances of the North-West Territories, prohibited any one from practising medicine within the North-West Territories unless registered in accordance with the provisions of that Ordinance.\nA prior Ordinance created a corporation known as the \"College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North-West Territories,\" and this \"Medical Professions Ordinance,\" ch. 52,1 have referred to, continued the said corporation, and declared that all persons, registered members of such college under the provisions of the ordinance, should be a body corporate under the name of the \"College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North-West Territories,\" and should have perpetual succession, etc., as therein provided.\nTo this college was confided the keeping of the register of medical practitioners, and many powers were given it in the way of examining candidates for admission, and admitting when passed to registration, and in other ways regulating the conduct of members of the medical profession.\nWhen the provinces in question were being created it was found necessary to anticipate the dissolution of that corporation and similar corporations. Their existence as corporations would have continued as a matter of course. It seemed an obviously probable thing that a provincial body of the same character, and possibly endowed with the same powers, might in the course of time advantageously be created by each of the new legislatures for each province. It was quite obvious also that, if that should take place, it was desirable the functions of the corporation, with territorial jurisdiction, so to speak, should cease. It no doubt was apprehended that in such event dissolution of the old territorial corporations could not be brought about by either province, and possibly could not be provided for by legislation of the Dominion Parliament. It seems likely that to provide for this difficulty was all that was within the intention of Parliament in enacting sub-sec. 3 I am about to refer to.\nIt certainly would fall within the usual powers given to provinces of the Dominion; to regulate the practice of medicine; to regulate the practice of law, or other like professions; to fix the standards of qualification entitling such persons to practice; to prohibit others respectively not so qualified from practising; and if need be, to carry into effect such powers, to create colleges or such other corporations as the Legislature might deem proper.\nThese ample powers were certainly given and exist under sub-sec. 1, sec. 16 of the Alberta Act, unless the contention set up by respondents and upheld by the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories be correct. That contention is this, that sub-sec. 3 of said Act restricts this power of sub-sec. 1. Sub-sec. 3 reads as follows:\u2014\n3. All societies or associations incorporated by ot under the authority of the Legislature of the North-West Territories existing at the time of the coming into force of this Act which include within their objects the regulation of the practice of or the right to practice any profession or trade in the North-West Territories, such as the legal or the medical profession, dentistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and the like, shall continue, subject, however, to be dissolved and abolished by order of the Governor in Council and each of such societies shall have power to arrange for and effect the payment of Its debts and liabilities, and the division, disposition or transfer of its property.\nIt is to be noted that the corporation alone and what is enacted relative to its creation, continuation and dissolution is all this refers to. It does not refer to the numerous other legislative enactments found in chapter 52 above cited. It is urged that the words \"shall continue\" in this sub-section cannot be given effect to unless the powers given by the consolidated Ordinance, chapter 52, are to be held as continued in full force and effect at least until the Governor in Council shall have dissolved the corporation created as above and continued thereunder.\nIt seems to me that we must, in this as in many other cases, test this pretention by finding whether it lies or not within the general purview of the Alberta Act to reserve to this college, instead of the Legislature, this regulating power. Why should there be such an anomaly as withholding from these provinces the right to legislate upon such a wide field for legislative action as implied in this contention?\nIt does not appear that there existed any reason for the making of this distinction.\nIt certainly could not be contended that the Do minion Parliament had intended to reserve to itself, if it could, the right to alter the Medical Professions Act. Where is the legislative power supposed to rest if not in the newly created Legislature?\nIf it is replied that Parliament only intended the continuation as a temporary expedient, then what body would we expect to have power to determine the period of its existence?\nThe Governor in Council is given the power to dissolve the corporations in question, but the executive is not given the power to amend the provision of the Act in any respect.\nThis sub-sec. 3, when we look at it in the light of these considerations, obviously was designed to pro vide for the dissolution of these corporations, and the transfer of their property to some similar body.\nIt describes the class and, of abundant caution, needlessly but I think harmlessly, uses the words \"shall continue\" from which so very much is sought to be drawn by way of implication.\nIt was urged by respondent's counsel we should not find by implication the power to legislate that is claimed to have been given the Legislature.\nIt is not by implication at all that the power is given the Legislature. Section 16, sub-sec. 1 gives it clearly and explicitly in the power to alter existing laws save those thereby excluded unless restricted by sub-sec. 3. And all that was urged against giving an interpretation that rests upon mere implication is applicable to the interpretation by respondent's counsel of this sub-sec. 3. Not a word or line of it expressly provides such a restriction as has been suggested.\nIt is mere implication that the alleged restriction rests upon.\nIt is implication too of a far fetched kind. There is not the slightest reason why the continuation for a temporary purpose, of a corporate existence, that is intended to subserve a public and not a private interest, should imply that the duties interest to it as such are to extend and continue beyond the necessities of such temporary purpose. And moreover less so when, as I conceive, the temporary purpose was simply to await the action of the newly created legislatures or legislature. It was but a vessel to carry to some other place or sphere of action the seeds of a possibly regenerated activity that was designed and nothing more.\nIt had fulfilled its functions and was only to be prepared for death in a decent and respectable manner.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below if insisted upon.\nMaclennan J.\u2014Appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, setting aside a conviction of the respondent for practising medicine for gain within the Province of Alberta, without registration under the Medical Profession Act of Alberta, ch. 28 of the statutes of 1906.\nBefore the Alberta Act, statute of Canada, 4 & 5 Edw. VII. (1905), ch. 3, establishing a new province out of what before was the North-West Territories, there existed a corporation called \"The College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North-West Territories,\" the members of which, and those admitted from time to time by the council of the said corporation, had the exclusive right to practice medicine, surgery, etc., for gain and reward within the limits of the territories. That corporation was incorporated by the legislature of the territories, and had been in existence for many years. The ordinance made practice contrary to its provisions illegal and punishable by fine not exceeding $100.\nOn the 20th day of July, 1905, the \"Alberta Act\" (Canada) was passed and, by section 3, declared that the British North America Act, 1867, should apply to the new province in the same way and to the same extent as to the provinces theretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if Alberta had been one of them, except so far as varied \"by this Act\" and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more, and not the whole of the said provinces.\nBy section 16(1) provision is made for a continuance within the new province of all laws, orders and regulations in force at the passing of the Act, until re pealed, abolished or altered by the proper authority, that is, either by Parliament or by the newly created legislature.\nSec. 16 (3) provides that all societies or associations incorporated by or under the authority of the Legislature of the North-West Territories existing at the time of the coming into force of this Act, which include within their objects the regulation of the practice of, or the right to practice any profession or trade in the North-West Territories, such as the legal or medical professions, dentistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and the like, shall continue, subject, however, to be dissolved and abolished by order of the Governor in Council, and each of such societies shall have power to arrange for and effect the payment of its debts and liabilities, and the division, disposition or transfer of its property.\nThe Alberta statute makes provision for the medical professions in the new province very similar to those of the \"Territories Act,\" but confined to the province. It enacts and directs that all qualified members of the territories' college are qualified for membership in the new one, and that any who might be in arrears for annual fees would, on paying their fees to the old college, be qualified for membership in the new.\nIt provides for the admission and registration of persons who were not members of the old college, on compliance with certain rules and regulations, and forbids practice for reward within Alberta without registration, under a penalty.\nSection 16(3) is what is relied on to support the judgment. It is said that the Act expressly provides that the associations mentioned are to continue, and that the meaning of that must be that until the Governor in Council dissolves the old college, the Legislature can make no provision for medical education or practice within the province.\nI cannot assent to that view. It was to continue until it was dissolved by the Governor in Council, which might be at any time. It was not continued for active operation, but only for winding up, paying its debts and liabilities, if any, and the division and disposition of its property.\nIt is obvious that, unless provision was made for something to take the place of such societies, a most inconvenient state of things would result whenever the Governor in Council exercised the power vested in him. The Governor in Council could make no such pro vision. It is not pretended that Parliament could do so, and unless the province could do so no other power could but the Imperial Parliament.\nThere is nothing in the Act limiting in any way the jurisdiction over property and civil rights in the province, and the incorporation of companies with provincial objects conferred by the 93rd section of the British North America Act, 1867.\nThe Act does not assume to amend or alter or deal in any way with the Territorial Act, or with the corporation thereby incorporated. It deals solely with individuals. It says, no person shall practice for re ward within the province without certain prescribed qualifications, and if he do he shall be liable to a pen- alty. The Act of Parliament says it shall continue, and so it does. As a corporation it has not been interfered with nor affected in the slightest degree.\nGreat reliance was placed in the court below on Dobie v. The Temporalities Board ([1]), but that was a very different case from the present. The \"Temporalities Act\" was one which had been passed by the Province of Canada and which after the British North America Act, 1867, could not have been validly en acted by either Ontario or Quebec. Parliament could have passed it, because it concerned persons and trusts and property in both provinces. And the Quebec Act assumed to amend it in express terms.\nIn the present case, however, the Act, which has been held invalid, does not interfere in the slightest degree with the \"Territorial Act,\" or with the property or rights of the college incorporated thereby. It simply says no one shall practise medicine for reward in Alberta after the passing of this Act without a particular qualification.\nI agree with the conclusion and reasons of Stuart J. in the court below, and am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction con firmed.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Muir.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Such duty is not discharged by the employment of a competent architect to prepare plans for the building and a competent contractor to attend to the work of construction.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The fact that the building is in an unfinished state may render the obligation of the owner towards a workman employed upon it less onerous in law than it would be in the case of a completed structure. Per Duff J.\u2014Does the rule governing the duty of occupiers respecting the safe condition of the premises apply without qualification where the structure is incomplete and the invitee is engaged in completing it or fitting it for its intended use?\nPer Davies and Maclennan JJ.\u2014In the present ease the failure to guard against the effect of a sudden storm of so violent and extraordinary a character that it could not have been expected was not negligence for which the owner was liable.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (12 Ont. L.R. 4) and, of the Divisional Court (9 Ont. L.R. 57) affirmed, Idington J. dubitante.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of a divisional court[2] in favour of the defendants, Fraser & Co.\nThe plaintiffs are the widow and children of J.S. Valiquette who was killed while working in a boiler-house under construction for Fraser & Co. by collapse of the walls owing to the roof having been blown off by a severe wind storm. The action was brought to recover damages from the owners and the contractor and in the courts below the owners were exonerated from liability.\nJ. Lorne McDougall, Jr. for the appellants, cited Francis v. Cookrell[3]; Hyman v. Nye & Sons[4]; Heaven v. Pender[5].\nShepley K.C. and John Christie for the respondents referred to Indermaur v. Dames[6]; Welfare v. London & Brighton Railway Co.[7]; Pearson v. Cox[8]; Broggi v. Robins[9]. GIROUARD J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am not able to assent to the law laid down by Street J. in deciding this case to the full extent stated by him, and apparently followed by the Court of Appeal, though in the ultimate result I do not dissent from the conclusions reached.\nI do not think there is any difference in the result whether the duty which the owner of a building or structure into or upon which he invites workmen or people to enter owes to such workmen or people may be said to arise out of contract or tort.\nThat duty, as defined in Indermaur v. Dames6; Francis v. Cockrell[10]; Tarry v. Ashton[11] Marney v. Scott[12], and other cases, seems to be that he is bound towards those whom he invites into or upon the building or structure to use reasonable care and skill in providing that the property and appliances upon it, which it is intended shall be used in any work, are fit for the purposes they are to be put to or used for. The owner does not discharge that duty by contracting with a competent workman to do the work for him. It is no answer in a case where such building or structure is found unfit, for him to say I am myself incompetent to do the work or to say how it should be built so as to make it fit and proper, and I have employed a person who is competent to do the work for me, and if he fails in the discharge of his duty I am not liable. This is not the law as decided expressly in the cases I have cited. In Tarry v. Ashton[13], Blackburn J. says at page 319:\nIt was the defendant\u2019s duty to make the lamp reasonably safe; the contractor failed to do that and the defendant having the duty has trusted the fulfilment of that duty to another who has not done it. Therefore the defendant has not done his duty and he is liable to the plaintiff for the consequences.\nThe question is not one solely of the owner\u2019s competence or knowledge but whether the building work or appliances have been erected or provided with reasonable care and skill for the purposes intended. And the same rule must apply to an architect. It is not a question alone whether a competent architect was employed. The affirmative answer to that question would not of itself settle the liability of the owner any more than the affirmative answer to the question whether or not he employed a competent contractor. The ultimate question upon which the liability of the owner or occupier must rest is whether the building or structure was erected, or appliances were provided, with reasonable care and skill having in view the object and purpose for which they were intended and were to be used or applied. If that reasonable care and skill is shewn to have been wanting and to have been the cause of the injury complained of the owner cannot escape from liability by shewing simply that he employed a competent architect or competent contractor. As Sir Frederick Pollock puts it in the 5th edition of his work on Torts, at page 477, adopted by Bigham J. in his judgment in Marney v. Scott[14];\nThe duty (of the owner or occupier) goes beyond the common doctrine of responsibility for servants for the occupier cannot discharge himself by employing an independent contractor for the maintenance and repair of the structure, however careful he may be in the choice of that contractor. * * * The structure has to be in a reasonably safe condition so far as the exercise of reasonable care and skill can make it so.\nAnd see Addison on Torts, 8 ed. (1906), at page 722.\nCompare on this point the judgments of this court in Grant v. Acadia Coal Co.[15]; McKelvey v. Le Roi Mining Co.[16]; Canada Woollen Mills v. Traplin[17].\nThe question then that seems to be for us to decide is whether or not the structure at the time it was blown down had been constructed with reasonable care and skill, having regard to its size, situation and intended purpose.\nI have gone carefully through the evidence and find upon this crucial point a great difference of opinion between contractors and architects of great experience and reputation.\nI have reached the conclusion that the storm of wind, call it cyclone, tornado, hurricane, or what you will, was of a very unique, severe and exceptional kind, confined to a narrow area and striking upon this building in its unfinished state with extraordinary force and fury.\nThe openings in the gable wall which first blew down, intended for doors and windows, were all open and unclosed and were being used in part to take into the building parts of the boiler and its appurtenances then being erected. I do not think that under the circumstances the failure to have these openings closed at the moment the storm struck the building necessarily indicated negligence as the sudden and extra- ordinary wind was not one of a character which should reasonably have been expected or guarded against.\nI am not satisfied from a careful reading of the conflicting evidence that I could clearly find there was want of reasonable care and skill in the construction of the building and that this caused its destruction and the consequent loss of life.\nI am rather inclined to hold that the cause of the disaster was the violent hurricane of an extraordinary kind which struck the unfinished building at a time when the opening for the windows and doors on the gable end were still unclosed, a condition which under the circumstances as I have stated already did not necessarily indicate actionable negligence.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I understand that a majority of this court, some for reasons of fact, and others of law, have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI desire to say that in my opinion, if the findings of fact by the learned trial judge be correct, I have great doubt of the correctness of the result about to be arrived at.\nIt may be that the unfinished state of the building, to the knowledge of deceased, rendered the responsibility of respondents less onerous than in law it seems to be in the case of a completed structure into which the possessor invites others.\nThe stress laid upon the engagement of a competent superintendent in the place of an architect and competent contractors, does not seem to me warranted when we find the superintendent architect disclaiming all responsibility for the connection between the steel and brick just where the weak spot proved to be in the building.\nIt can serve no useful purpose for me now to pursue the matter further than to express my doubt.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother Davies.\nDUFF J.\u2014As the evidence does not entirely satisfy me that the collapse of the defendants\u2019 building was due to any want of care or skill in the construction or maintenance of it, I am unable to say that the case is within the operation of the rule expressed in the passage quoted from Pollock on Torts (7th ed.) at page 498, and relied on by Mr. McDougall; that passage, I think, correctly states the rule governing the duty of occupiers respecting the safe condition of completed structures ready for use and occupation; but I should require further consideration before deciding that it applies without qualification where the structure is incomplete, and the person injured is engaged either in the completion of the structure itself or in fitting it for its intended use.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Latchford & Daly.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Christie, Green & Hill.\n[1] 12 Ont.

On appeal to the Court of King's Bench, the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed, the action was maintained, damages being assessed at ten dollars up to the time of action, the plaintiff's right to recover subsequent damages was reserved and the defendant was enjoined against continuing to trouble the plaintiff in his possession of his lands by permitting the water escaping from the ice-house to flow thereon and ordered, within a time limited, to take proper means to abate the nuisance.\nThe material facts in evidence and the questions discussed on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nBeaudin K.C. and Belcourt K.C. for the appellant.\nBisaillon K.C. and H. R. Bisaillon for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The plaintiff and defendant are owners of contiguous properties in the Town of St. John, Iberville. The plaintiff, now respondent, being the owner of the lower land complains that the defendant, now appellant, the owner of the upper land, has built, quite recently, on his, the defendant's, property, a large ice-house (135 feet long, by 30, by 35 feet), the water from which, as the plaintiff alleges, flows down on to his land to his damage.\nThe defence, in effect, is that the ice-house is constructed at a distance of about three feet from the division line, every proper precaution having been taken to prevent damage or injury by flooding; that the water produced by the melting of the ice does not reach the plaintiff's property; and, finally, that the defendant is entitled to use his property in any way not prohibited by law or by regulation. Art. 406 C.C.\nThere is a mass of conflicting testimony as to whether the most scientific rules were observed in the construction of the ice-house, but the real question of fact to be determined by us is: Has the ice-house erected by the defendant aggravated the servitude of the lower land so as to create any appreciable damage[1], or has what would be, if permitted, a new servitude resulted from its construction?\nIn the Superior Court the judge finds:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que l'humidit\u00e9 de l'amas de glace dans la glaci\u00e8re ait suint\u00e9 \u00e0 travers le mur de la glaci\u00e8re du cot\u00e9 nord, ni que l'eau provenant de la fonte de la glace se soit infiltr\u00e9e le long des cot\u00e9s du mur de la maison et de la cuisine, ni dans le terrain du demandeur, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer des dommages au demandeur.\nAnd in appeal, the unanimous finding of their Lordships is:\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'intim\u00e9, en se servant de la glaci\u00e8re comme il le fait, aggrave la servitude du fonds de l'appelant, en.envoyant sur ce fonds plus d'eau qu'il n'en d\u00e9coule naturellement du fonds de l'intim\u00e9, et cause \u00e0 l'appelant des dommages qui ne peuvent qu'aller en augmentant.\nThe difference between the findings is more apparent than real. In appeal their Lordships, on the evidence, came to the conclusion that there has been an aggravation of the legal servitude to plaintiff's detriment, and in the Superior Court, Mr. Justice Paradis finds, not that there is no overflow, but that the water has not penetrated plaintiff's property so as to cause him damage. We are again in this case without the notes of the judges below and we can only speculate as to the reasons which induced them to adopt these apparently divergent conclusions. Presumably, the only difference is in the appreciation of the meaning of the word \"aggravated\" in article 501 of the Civil Code.\nBy what is admitted to be a departure from the strict rule of construction, the French text book writers hold that, where the aggravation results merely from a change in the natural conditions without materially adding to the volume of water which the proprietor of the lower land is obliged to receive, then the resulting damage must be serious (dommage s\u00e9rieux), to justify a possessory action, as, for instance, in the case of contiguous properties used for agricultural purposes, if the proprietor of the higher land ploughs his furrows in the ordinary way and that the rain or other surface water accumulates therein and thence flows with accelerated speed on to the lower property, the proprietor of the latter cannot complain unless there is serious damages. 7 Laurent no. 370; Baudry-Lacantinerie, no. 1432; 3 Mignault, page 16; Faucher v. Hall[2].\nA careful examination of the books has satisfied me that when the French text writers and courts speak of dommage s\u00e9rieux they have reference to some serious damage resulting from the diversion of or other interference with water which would otherwise flow naturally from the upper land without the aid of man, and which the proprietor of the lower land is, in any case, bound to receive. See consid\u00e9rant in the case of Bareau v. Servois[3] on page 718:\nQu'en presence de ces faits ainsi declar\u00e9s constans, l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9, en d\u00e9cidant, comme il le fait, que le propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur n'avait rien enterpris qui f\u00fbt de nature \u00e0 aggraver la servitude du fonds inf\u00e9rieur, etc.\nA great deal of the doubt and uncertainty which apparently prevailed in the Superior Court as to the facts might have been avoided if the case had been referred by the judge of that court to experts for a report as to the character of the building and the cause of the increased flow with special reference to that part of the water artificially brought on to the higher land by reason of the construction of the icehouse, and I have anxiously considered whether, even at the present time, this should not be done. But a careful examination of the record has led me to the conclusion that, to make such an order would save neither time nor money. We must decide the question before us, which is not so much whether the legal servitude existing when the appellant acquired his property has been aggravated, but whether the appellant can establish a new and different servitude without either grant or recognition. Art. 549 C.C.\nI have come to the conclusion, not without serious hesitation, that the ice-house is proved to have been built without the proper precautions being taken to prevent the overflow of the water produced by the melting of such a large body of ice and that this water does penetrate, as found by the court of appeal, through the soil to the plaintiff's property and to his injury.\nThe witnesses say that fifteen or twenty per cent of the ice melts during the summer months, and this is established in the present case to be equivalent to fifty thousand gallons of water which must find an outlet somewhere and the natural slope of the land is towards plaintiff's premises. The defendant very properly contends that, in law, the plaintiff, as owner of the lower land, is obliged to receive such waters as flow from the adjoining land on a higher level; but the code and the commentators add that this obligation is limited to such waters as flow naturally and without the agency of man, such as, for instance, snow water, rain water, eaux pluviales; he is not obliged to receive the waters which flow, for instance, from an artesian well created by artificial means. This, I submit, with deference, is the effect of article 501 of the Civil Code, which corresponds with article 640 of the Code Napol\u00e9on.\nIn Laurent, Dr. Civ., vol. 7, no. 360 ; Demolombe (Servitude), vol. 1, no. 36; Baudry-Lacantinerie (Des Biens), vol. 5, no. 828; Aubry et Rau, vol. 3, para. 240, page 11, note 21; will be found the conflicting opinions and speculations of the text writers as to the obligations of the owner of the lower land and the rights of the proprietor of the upper land. The accepted doctrine is, however, I think fairly stated by Dalloz (R\u00e9pertoire de Jurisprudence vo. \"Servitude,\" no. 84):\nIl faut donc reconna\u00eetre qu'en d\u00e9finitive la question de pr\u00e9judice dominera toutes les d\u00e9cisions et que les juges n'h\u00e9siteront pas \u00e0 consacrer les actes nouveaux du propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur, si le propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur ne peut pas justifier d'un s\u00e9rieux pr\u00e9judice. L'art. 640 confirme ces principes dans sa derni\u00e8re partie. Il dit:\u2014\"Le propri\u00e9taire ne peut pas \u00e9lever de digue qui emp\u00eache l'\u00e9coulement des eaux. Le propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur ne peut rien faire qui aggrave la servitude du fonds inf\u00e9rieur.\" Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9, par application de ce principe, d'une part, que l'art. 640 ne peut autoriser le propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 demander la suppression des ouvrages pratiqu\u00e9s par un propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur, pour faciliter l'\u00e9coulement des eaux, s'il est constant en fait que ces ouvrages, en maintenant les eaux dans leur cours naturel, n'ont pas aggrav\u00e9 la servitude des fonds inf\u00e9rieurs.\nBut the same author, at no. 88, says:\nLe propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur serait-il tenu de recevoir les eaux d'une fontaine nouvellement ouverte, si l'ouverture \u00e9tait due \u00e0 des travaux du propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur? M. Pardessus, t. I., p 204, a \u00e9tabli une distinction.\" Si la source nouvelle, dit-il, se fait jour par l'effet des travaux dont se compose habituellement la culture d'un champ, par exemple en creusant un foss\u00e9, cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement n'est que la cons\u00e9quence du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l'\u00e9coulement nous semble devoir \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme naturel; mais si, par des fouilles faites pour se procurer de l'eau, on vient \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un puits art\u00e9sien, il serait douteux que le propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur dut recevoir ces eaux. Nous croyons cependant, ajoute le m\u00eame auteur, que les tribunaux auraient le droit d'obliger celui des propri\u00e9taires inf\u00e9rieurs qui leur paraitraient pouvoir recevoir les eaux avec le moins de dommage \u00e0 subir cet \u00e9coulement au moyen d'une indemnit\u00e9.\" Nous pensons, avec MM. Duranton, t. 5, no. 166; Demolombe, Servit. p. 32; Duvergier sur Toullier, t. 3, no. 509, note 1; Marcad\u00e9, art. 640, no. 2; Daviel, t. 3, no. 901; Ducarroy et Bonnier, t. 2, no. 264; que ce syst\u00e8me n'est pas admissible. Il ne l'est pas d'abord \u00e9videment en ce qui concerne les puits art\u00e9siens. L'art. 640 est formel, et les tribunaux seraient \u00e9videmment sans pouvoir pour forcer l'un des propri\u00e9taires \u00e0 recevoir les eaux, m\u00eame avec indemnit\u00e9. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une simple aggravation, mais d'une servitude nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9e.\nAnd herein I find the solution for the difficulty that has arisen in this case. If it is beyond doubt, as all the authors admit, that the proprietor of the lower land is not obliged to receive the waters from the higher land which are brought there by the act of man, even on payment of an indemnity, and the case of the artesian well is given by many as illustrating the distinction, then\u2014Can the proprietor of the lower land be obliged to receive the waters from the ice-house in question in this case? Where is the difference in principle? It must be noted that in the Quebec Code there is no disposition corresponding with the amendments made to the Code Napoleon, 29th April, 1845; 10th June, 1854; and, finally, 8th April, 1898, by which provision is made for an indemnity to be paid to the proprietor of the lower land for damages caused to him in such a case as the present one.\nUnder the Quebec system, if the proprietor of the lower land is prejudiced, he is not entitled to an indemnity; there is no provision in our law to justify him in applying for it. If his property is prejudicially affected, he is without any remedy, except the one adopted in this case. Therefore it is necessary to give a more rigid interpretation to the article of our Code than is given to the corresponding article of the Code Napol\u00e9on, which, as amended, recognizes, in effect, the principle of expropriation on payment of indemnity in cases where the public interest requires it, e.g., agriculture or industry.\nIt would, no doubt, be more convenient and more in the interests of adjoining proprietors to adopt, in Quebec, the rule of the French law, but that is for the Legislature and not for us.\n5 Baudry-Lacantinerie, no. 826, states the law as it was before the amendments to the French Code, as follows:\nEn principe, d'apr\u00e8s l'art. 640, les fonds inf\u00e9rieurs ne sont pas tenus de recevoir les eaux qui d\u00e9coulent des fonds sup\u00e9rieurs par suite du fait de l'homme, (argument des mots sans que le main de l'homme y ait contribu\u00e9), telles que les eaux m\u00e9nag\u00e8res, industrielles ou celles provenant d'un puits art\u00e9sien. D'autre part, en vertu du m\u00eame texte, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds sup\u00e9rieur ne peut \"rien faire qui aggrave la servitude du fonds inf\u00e9rieur.\" La servitude naturelle doit, en effet, \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux seules n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s d\u00e9rivant de la situation des lieux. Si, dans un but quelconque, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds sup\u00e9rieur intervient pour modifier l'\u00e9coulement naturel des eaux, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds inf\u00e9rieur est en droit de s'y opposer et de dire que la nature, la situation des lieux ne l'obligent pas \u00e0 subir une modification provenant du fait de l'homme.\nI will not attempt to analyse the evidence for the purpose of proving that their Lordships of the court of appeal came to a proper conclusion on the facts, but I have no doubt that the 50,000 gallons of water produced by the melting of the ice is not all absorbed by the earth and that the greater portion filters through the soil and reaches the plaintiff's land.\nIt is to be observed that, while the injury at the time the suit was brought may not have been of a very serious character, still it is a permanent injury which, in the course of time, must become more and more serious and will last so long as the present conditions are allowed to prevail.\nI have not overlooked Claude v. Weir[4], and in reading the judgment of Dorion C.J., I am reminded of the observations of Brett L.J., at page 225, in Ecclesiastical Commissioners v. Kino[5], in 1880:\nTo my mind (said His Lordship), the taking of some expression of a judge used in deciding a question of fact as to his own view of some one fact being material on a particular occasion as laying down a rule of conduct for other judges in considering a similar state of facts in another case is a false mode of treating authority. It appears to me that the view of a learned judge in a particular case as to the value of a particular piece of evidence is of no use to other judges who have to determine a similar question of fact in other cases where there may be different circumstances to be taken into consideration. I would confirm the judgment of the court of appeal with costs.\nGirouard J. (dissident).\u2014Nous voil\u00e0 encore en face d'une de ces actions possessoires qui nous sont soumises presqu'\u00e0 chaque terme, et \u00e0 Ton trouve en jeu plus d'ent\u00eatement que de principes de droit ou d'int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire; mais le pr\u00e9sent terme est particuli\u00e8rement remarquable, puisque nous avons quatre causes (sur neuf) de ce genre, qui nous viennent toutes des districts ruraux. L'intim\u00e9 n'en est pas \u00e0 son premier essai au sujet 4e l'aggravation de la servitude des eaux \u00e0 laquelle son fonds est assujeti. En 1897, il avait un premier d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9 avec les voisins Dunn, mais plus sagement avis\u00e9 cette fois, il porta non pas une action possessoire qui rel\u00e8ve de la plus haute cour de la province, mais une action en dommages pour $25, qui fut renvoy\u00e9e. Ces proc\u00e8s, toujours ruineux pour les plaideurs particuli\u00e8rement s'ils sont au possessoire, sont, en France, jug\u00e9s sommairement depuis un si\u00e8cle par les juges de paix; mais en la province de Qu\u00e9bec, comme au temps de l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, ils traversent toutes les hautes jurisdictions du pays et arrivent m\u00eame au Conseil Priv\u00e9.\nComme toujours, nous avons ici un dossier volumineux, qui ne soul\u00e8ve qu'une simple question de fait et l'application d'un principe de droit \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire. Un propri\u00e9taire \u00e9l\u00e8ve sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 St. Jean, une immense glaci\u00e8re de 135 pieds de long sur 30 de haut, suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art et sans violer aucune loi de la province ou de l'autorit\u00e9 municipale. Le demandeur, qui a vu \u00e9riger cette glaci\u00e8re, n'a pas protest\u00e9 ni repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qu'elle aggraverait la servitude. (Cass. 22 janvier, 1866. S.V. 66, 1. 68; Delorme v. Cusson[6]; Parent v. Quebec North Shore Turnpike Road Trustees[7]. Il demanda seulement de la placer plus loin de la ligne, afin de ne pas lui enlever compl\u00e8tement la vue, l'air et le jour, concession \u00e0 laquelle il n'avait pas droit. Il n'offrit pas de faire creuser \u00e0 frais communs ou \u00e0 ses frais un foss\u00e9 d'\u00e9gout dans les trois pieds que l'appelant laissa entre la glaci\u00e8re et la ligne de division, ce qui de son aveu n'aurait co\u00fbt\u00e9 que quelques piastres et aurait probablement fait dispara\u00eetre les effects de la servitude naturelle elle-m\u00eame. Le fonds sur lequel la glaci\u00e8re est b\u00e2tie est en effet sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de l'intim\u00e9, son voisin, dont la surface est d'un sol mou, mar\u00e9cageux et humide, et qui en sus subit une pente graduelle d'une couple de pieds. Il fut toujours assuj\u00e9ti \u00e0 la servitude des eaux provenant du fonds de l'appelant, mais l'intim\u00e9 soutient qu'elle fut aggrav\u00e9e par la construction de la glaci\u00e8re. L'on con\u00e7oit ais\u00e9ment que cette construction n'a pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9 la situation des lieux de l'intim\u00e9, dont la vue s'est trouv\u00e9e obstru\u00e9e et que l'ombrage d\u00e9robait dor\u00e9navant aux rayons du soleil. Mais l'appelant n'a pas agi avec malice ou rancune ; il s'est tenu dans la mesure de son droit et n'a pas aggrav\u00e9 la servitude du fonds inf\u00e9rieur. 0. C. art. 406 et 501. C'est ce qu'a trouv\u00e9 la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le juge du \"district (Paradis J.), r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 St. Jean m\u00eame depuis nombre d'ann\u00e9es et par cons\u00e9quent connaissant bien la localit\u00e9 qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendue et n'a qu'une population de 4,000 \u00e2mes. \u2013\nConsid\u00e9rant (dit-il) qu'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que l'humidit\u00e9 de l'amas de glace dans la glaci\u00e8re ait suint\u00e9 \u00e0 travers le mur de la glaci\u00e8re du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord, ni que l'eau provenant de la fonte de cette glace se soit infiltr\u00e9e le long des c\u00f4t\u00e9s du mur de la maison et de la cuisine, ni dans le terrain du demandeur, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer des dommages au demandeur.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il est en preuve que d\u00e8s avant la construction de la dite glaci\u00e8re le terrain du demandeur \u00e9tait humide et impropre . \u00e0 la culture, etc.\nLe savant juge a vu et entendu les t\u00e9moins durant une longue enqu\u00eate qui dura plusieurs mois, et je ne crois pas que les juges d'appel (Lacoste J.C., Boss\u00e9, Blanchet, Trenholme et Champagne, ad hoc, JJ.) \u00e9taient en aussi bonne position d'appr\u00e9cier la preuve et les circonstances de la cause.\nMais c'est particuli\u00e8rement lorsque je lis leur jugement que je deviens convaincu qu'ils ont fait erreur. Ils ne nous ont pas transmis de notes, mais le texte du jugement nous fait suffisamment conna\u00eetre leur pens\u00e9e. Elle n'est pas selon moi tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e de celle du Juge Paradis. Ce dernier a trouv\u00e9 que l'eau de la glaci\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas descendue sur le terrain de l'intim\u00e9 \"de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer des dommages au demandeur.' Il est vrai que la cour d'appel est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une conclusion contraire, mais elle ajoute que les dommages quant \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent ne sont pas appr\u00e9ciables:\nConsid\u00e9rant (dit-elle) que la cour ne peut appr\u00e9cier actuellement l'\u00e9tendue des dommages que l'appelant a subis, bien qu'elle en constate l'existence.\nJe ne puis voir en loi aucune diff\u00e9rence dans une cause comme celle-ci, entre des dommages inappr\u00e9ciables et des dommages qui n'existent pas. La. cour d'appel accorde $10 \u00e0 titre de dommages accrus \u00e0 l'institution de l'action et maintient l'action possessoire. C'est \u00e9videmment un dommage nominal qu'elle fixe au hazard et d'une fa\u00e7on arbitraire.\nIl ne suffit pas pour une cour d'appel, dans mon humble opinion, de d\u00e9clarer qu'il existe des dommages et de renverser le juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui en nie l'existence, sans indiquer au moins o\u00f9 est la preuve de ce qu'elle avance. C'est ce qu'elle n'a point fait. Nous faut-il parcourir les 600 pages imprim\u00e9es de la cause pour la trouver? Quelle est la nature des dommages qu'elle accorde? Elle ne le dit pas. Il ne faut pas oublier que le demandeur les r\u00e9clame de trois chefs : $75 pour dommages \u00e0 la maison, $42 pour perte de loyer et $300 pour d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. De quel chef, les $10 sont-elles accord\u00e9es? C'est ce qui n'appara\u00eet pas. A-t-elle consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l'eau de la couverture des deux cuisines de l'intim\u00e9 qui finit par p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans la cave de ses logements? Impossible de le dire.\nDans mon humble opinion, cette cause n'est pas susceptible de dommage nominal. L'appelant n'a viol\u00e9 aucune loi, aucun droit foncier appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, condition qui est essentielle pour l'accorder. Puis, il n'y a aucune preuve de dommages sp\u00e9ciaux qu'un juge peut r\u00e9gler et fixer, s'ils sont constat\u00e9s, en accordant une somme nominale, ce qui fut fait dans plusieurs esp\u00e8ces, particuli\u00e8menent dans Dunning v. Girouard[8]; County of Ottawa v. Montreal, Ottawa and Western Ry. Co.[9]; et ce qui fut refus\u00e9 faute de preuve de dommages sp\u00e9ciaux, dans Williams v. Stephenson[10]; Coghlin v. La Fonderie de Joliette[11].\nEnfin, supposons qu'il y aurait des dommages inappr\u00e9ciables. Est-ce une raison suffisante pour avoir recours \u00e0 l'action possessoire, l'une des plus on\u00e9reuses qui soient connues dans notre syst\u00e8me de proc\u00e9dure? Est-ce bien l\u00e0 le trouble pr\u00e9vu par l'article 1064 du code de procedure. Il n'y a pas eu empi\u00e9tement de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni aucune intention de le faire. Il n'y a eu aucun acte d'usurpation qui porte une atteinte s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 la possession. Dans de pareilles circonstances, le recours du plaignant est non pas l'action possessoire, mais l'action en dommages.\nEn effet, l'action possessoire ne doit \u00eatre prise que dans les cas de trouble appr\u00e9ciable, r\u00e9el et s\u00e9rieux. Je suis loin de dire que pour r\u00e9ussir, le demandeur doit recouvrer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Non, mais le trouble dont il se plaint doit \u00eatre grave et s\u00e9rieux, comme dans les esp\u00e8ces signal\u00e9es par Mr. Bisaillon C.R., \u00e0 la fin de son factum et r\u00e9sum\u00e9e par Demolombe, t. 12, n. 662. Dans le cas de trouble ou dommage inappr\u00e9ciable, il y a lieu d'appliquer la r\u00e8gle de minimis non curat lex. C'est la jurisprudence non seulement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, mais de tous les pays. Ce principe fut consacr\u00e9 par M. le juge deLorimier, une autorit\u00e9 reconnue en ces mati\u00e8res, dans la cause de Rivest v. Savignac[12], qui fut confirm\u00e9 en revision par un fort banc (Tait, Taschereau et Davidson JJ.) en 1895. Il s'agissait d'une action possessoire prise par un propri\u00e9taire contre son voisin dans des circonstances certainement aussi favorables que dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce. Il y fut jug\u00e9 :\nConsid\u00e9rant que les actes faits par le d\u00e9fendeur et dont se plaint le demandeur, ne sont pas d'une nature abusive du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni faits en vue de causer injustement aucun trouble dans la possession du demandeur;\nConsid\u00e9rant, que les actes du d\u00e9fendeur n'ont caus\u00e9 et ne peuvent dans l'avenir causer au demandeur aucun tort, trouble, pr\u00e9judice ou dommage appr\u00e9ciable, et qu'aucun d'iceux ne peut en loi donner ouverture \u00e0 l'exercice du droit d'action possessoire en complainte, etc. Le juge deLorimier, dans une opinion tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9e, discute longuement le principe que pour avoir recours au possessoire, il faut un trouble appr\u00e9ciable, un dommage r\u00e9el et s\u00e9rieux. Le savant juge[13] observe:\nC'est ici le cas d'appliquer la maxime du droit romain \"de minimis non curat pr\u0153tor.\" On ne trouve ici aucun des caract\u00e8res qui distinguent les actes de trouble pouvant donner ouverture \u00e0 l'action en complainte. En effet, tous les actes de troubles caus\u00e9s par un voisin ne donnent pas ouverture \u00e0 la complainte, autrement le voisin ne pourrait point causer le moindre tort ou dommage, soit \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture, ou au mur ou au foss\u00e9 de ligne sans que de suite il y e\u00fbt mati\u00e8re \u00e0 l'action possessoire en complainte.\n\"Le trouble (dit B\u00e9lime, no. 315) doit \u00eatre un acte qui menace la possession, et non pas seulement tout acte contraire \u00e0 cette possession.\" \"C'est un acte flagrant d'usurpation,\" dit Jocotton, Des actions civiles, p. 460.\nLe m\u00eame principe me para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par le juge Pagnuelo dans Hampson v. Vineberg[14], et son jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel. La condition du \"pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux\" pour le fonds inf\u00e9rieur est requise pour \u00e9tablir l'aggravation de la servitude des eaux aux termes de l'article 501 du code civil.\nLe juge de Lorimier cite un grand nombre d'autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises \u00e0 l'appui de son opinion. Je me contenterais d'attirer l'attention sur une ou deux.\nC'est ainsi que par arr\u00eat du 31 mai, 1848, la cour de cassation a jug\u00e9:\nLe propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur est tenu de recevoir les eaux qui s'\u00e9coulent du fonds sup\u00e9rieur, encore bien que, par des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur, la quantit\u00e9 des eaux soit augment\u00e9e, si, d'ailleurs, il n'en r\u00e9sulte aucun dommage r\u00e9el ou appr\u00e9ciable, pour le fonds inf\u00e9rieur, etc. S.V..48, 1, 716.\nPar arr\u00eat du 22 janvier, 1866, (S.V. 66, 1, 70), la m\u00eame cour interpr\u00e8te de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on le principe de L\u2019article 501 de notre code, correspondant \u00e0 l'article 640 C.N.:\nAttendu que l'art. 640 C. Nap. n'interdit pas au propri\u00e9taire du fonds sup\u00e9rieur tout changement, toute transformation dans son h\u00e9ritage;\u2014Que, suivant une saine interpr\u00e9tation de la loi, il peut modifier son exploitation, \u00e9lever des constructions, alors m\u00eame que ces travaux auraient pour r\u00e9sultant d'accro\u00eetre le volume des eaux coulant naturellement vers les fonds inf\u00e9rieurs, pourvu qu'il n'en r\u00e9sulte pas un s\u00e9rieux pr\u00e9judice pour ces derniers, etc. S.V. 66, 1, 69.\nL'arr\u00eatiste fait suivre le rapport de ces deux arr\u00eats d'une foule de d\u00e9cisions et commentateurs.\nEnfin, Hue, un savant jurisconsulte qui fait \u00e9cole de nos jours, dans son nouveau commentaire, t. 4, p. 326, n. 284, \u00e9d. 1893, r\u00e9sume la doctrine dans ces quelques lignes:\nLa disposition naturelle des lieux \u00e9tant la seule cause de la charge impos\u00e9e au fonds inf\u00e9rieur, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds sup\u00e9rieur doit s'abstenir de tous travaux qui auraient pour r\u00e9sultat d'augmenter la pente du terrain ou de rendre l'\u00e9coulement des eaux plus rapide ou plus consid\u00e9rable, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer au fonds inf\u00e9rieur un pr\u00e9judice appr\u00e9ciable.\nHuc cite un arr\u00eat de la cour de cassation de 1er. avril, 1886, S.V. 90, 1, 467.\nVoir aussi Gilbert sur Sirey, \u00e9d. 1892, p. 334, n. 23; Fuzier-Herman, t. 1er. p 824.\nEnfin, dans la cause Drysdale v. Dugas[15] invoqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, cette cour a reconnu le m\u00eame principe. Comme l'observe le juge Taschereau, un propri\u00e9taire peut bien b\u00e2tir une \u00e9curie sur son fonds, pourvu qu'il, n'incommode pas son voisin \"gravement.\" et ne lui. cause pas de \"dommages s\u00e9rieux.\" Ici les dommages prouv\u00e9s \u00e9taient de f 398 pour le pass\u00e9.\nLa cour d'appel reconna\u00eet que le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par l'appelant n'est pas appr\u00e9ciable, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement qu'elle n'a pu l'appr\u00e9cier. C'est ce que les t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9 eux-m\u00eames \u00e9stablissent. L'architecte Benoit\ndit:\nComme je l'ai dit tant\u00f4t, il n'y a pas de dommages appr\u00e9ciables maintenant; si j'\u00e9tais pour acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, je ne dis pas que j'en ferais une diff\u00e9rence pour moi-m\u00eame.\nEn pr\u00e9sence d'une telle preuve, ce que la cour d'appel aurait d\u00fb faire, c'\u00e9tait de confirmer le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, sauf recours pour l'avenir.\nJ'avais pens\u00e9 qu'il serait peut-\u00eatre dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d'ordonner une expertise afin de s'assurer des dommages existant aujourd'hui, car elle ne pourrait \u00e9videmment \u00e9claircir la situation \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'institution de l'action et avant. Le demandeur lui-m\u00eame nous emp\u00eache d'avoir recours \u00e0 cet exp\u00e9dient; il se r\u00e9serve en effet tous ses recours pour l'avenir. Il peut se faire qu'il puisse \u00e9tablir que depuis l'institution de l'action, ses logements sont devenus \"inhabitables et insalubres\" par suite de l'aggravation de la servitude, ainsi qu'il all\u00e8gue \u00e0 tort qu'ils \u00e9taient avant son action. Dans ces circonstances graves ou autres semblables, il peut invoquer le possessoire; mais qu'il n'oublie pas que ce n'est que dans les cas d'aggravation de la servitude, c'est-\u00e0-dire, de trouble appr\u00e9ciable, r\u00e9el et s\u00e9rieux, qu'il peut r\u00e9ussir. Le trouble doit \u00eatre non seulement appr\u00e9ciable, c'est-\u00e0-dire, qu'il puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9; il faut de plus qu'il soit s\u00e9rieux, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances. S'il est inappr\u00e9ciable, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, ou presqu'insignifiant, peu consid\u00e9rable, le plaignant doit se pourvoir en dommages devant les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures. La porte des hautes cours lui est ferm\u00e9e et s'il l'ouvre, il ne lui sera pas permis d'\u00e9craser de frais inutiles un voisin qui lui a caus\u00e9 quelques petits torts, mais qui a agi de bonne foi et n'a jamais eu l'id\u00e9e de porter atteinte \u00e0 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni \u00e0 sa possession.\nIl ne me reste qu'une observation \u00e0 faire, au sujet de l'incertitude des travaux \u00e0 faire pour vaire dispara\u00eetre la nuisance\" dont l'intim\u00e9 se plaint. Le jugement n'indique aucunement les travaux \u00e0 faire; il autorise en termes vagues \"les ouvrages ou d\u00e9molitions qui seront jug\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires.\" Sera-ce la d\u00e9molition de la glaci\u00e8re ou le creusage d'un foss\u00e9 dans les trois pieds ou autre ouvrage? Impossible de le dire. L'appelant a droit de savoir exactement ce que la cour demande de lui. Cette omission a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fatale \u00e0 un pareil jugement. Claude v.

Mais je suis seul de ce sentiment.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nThe case is not free from difficulties, owing to the conformation of the ground in question, and to the fact that the dampness, shewn to exist inside respondent's building, may in part arise from want of proper provision on his own part, to conduct water falling on and off his own building away therefrom. I cannot, however, help feeling that this dampness has been materially increased by the daily melting, for four months of summer, of so much ice, in such close proximity to the respondent's house as this melting ice is placed.\nI cannot infer that three feet of earth will, as a matter of course, pen back this water, so constantly soaking into that three feet of earth, so that it will not damage the building of respondent.\nOn the contrary, I must say, that in the absence of express proof that the said three feet of earth consist of such an unusual quality that its texture is impervious to water, it would seem to me proper to infer that it becomes by the constant soaking so saturated that like a large sponge it conducts the water to the respondent's building, to the impairment and ultimate destruction thereof.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: I.S.

See Harrison v. Morehouse[21].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. Davies J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick confirming an order or decree of the Probate Court for St. John City and County settling the accounts of the executor of the estate and distributing the surplus amongst the legatees.\nThe proceedings taken were at the instance of the surviving executor Henry S. Daly, the present appellant, who had fyled his accounts and obtained a citation calling upon all parties interested, chiefly his nephews and nieces, children of his sister Hester, to shew cause why these accounts should not be finally allowed and passed, and an order should not be made for the distribution of the estate according to the will of the testator.\nThe accounts as fyled did not credit the estate with any money of the testator at the time of his death and only credited f 800 as the cash received from the sale of certain leasehold premises of testator.\nAbout seven or eight days after testator's death in 1891, Henry S. Daly and his sister Jane Agnes, as executor and executrix of their father's will, had applied for probate thereof, and amongst other statements in their petition which the statute required to be verified on oath, was one that testator had died possessed of personal property to the value of about $4,800.\nIt was conceded on the argument that this valuation included certain moneys now in dispute which had been deposited by the testator in his life time in the Savings Bank and Bank of Montreal, in the joint names of himself and his daughter Jane Agnes \"with power for either of them to withdraw.\"\nAs a fact it was shewn that between March 31st, 1887, when the account in the Savings Bank was opened by the testator, and June, 1891, when he died, there had been two additional deposits made by him personally, and that there had been no withdrawal.\nNo inventory of the estate was fyled by the executor as required by law until the time when, many years after his father's death, he obtained the citation to pass his accounts and no reference was made in the inventory to these moneys left on deposit, the personal estate being alleged to consist of a certain leasehold interest in some lands and that alone.\nThe main questions tried out in the Surrogate Court and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, were first, whether the surviving executor was liable to account to the estate for the moneys standing to the credit of testator and his daughter at time of testator's death in these banks, or whether they passed to the daughter Jane, his co-executrix, as joint depositor with their father by survivorship, in which latter case they went to the appellant under Jane's will ; secondly, the true meaning of the bequest by the testator of all moneys he died possessed of\nto his daughter Jane to hold and be enjoyed by her while she remained unmarried;\nand thirdly, whether the executor had accounted for the real value of the leasehold sold by him at auction when he returned $800 as that value, or was bound so to account for its true value in the open market.\nAbout a month previous to obtaining the citation the appellant had fyled an inventory in which the value of the leasehold was put at $1,500. The evidence of the witnesses at the hearing put the value between that and $3,500. The probate judge settled it at $1,800. A preliminary question as to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court of New Brunswick to determine the liability of the trustee executor so far as determining the value of this leasehold was concerned, and to pass his accounts and make distribution of the estate amongst the cestuis qui trustent, under the will, was raised in this court by the appellant for the first time. He had invoked such jurisdiction himself, fyled his accounts, placing such value at $ 800 at which he had sold, and transferred the leasehold interest, issued his citation for passing same, and for distribution of the estate, and in this court of appeal for the first time raises the question of the powers of the court he had invoked to make the orders he had prayed for, so far as the value of the leasehold he had disposed of was concerned.\nA careful reading of \"The Probate Courts Act\" of New Brunswick, 61 Vict. ch. 35; R.S.N.B. ch. 118 satisfies me that the Probate Courts of that province have been invested with co-ordinate and concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of equity over \"all the estates of deceased persons in the province,\" and as well over the accounts of executors and administrators as such and the distribution of the personal estate of the deceased, as over their accounts as trustees under the will and \"over the administration of the trust estate.\" See secs. 13, 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54.\nThese concurrent powers are carefully guarded so as to protect all interests concerned. In the first place an appeal is given by section 115, as of right to the Supreme Court of the province from any final order or decree of the judge and when allowed by the Supreme Court or a judge thereof from any decision of the judge of probate, whether a final order or decree or otherwise. Secondly, the Supreme Court in Equity or a judge thereof has power, section 77, in cases where \"concurrent or like jurisdiction\" has been given to the Court of Probate, to assume exclusive jurisdiction and to stay the exercise of such concurrent powers by the Probate Court or judge taking such powers to itself alone.\nSection 58 declares that the passing and allowing of any account of a trust as provided in the Act shall subject to appeal have the same force and effect as if the accounts had been passed and allowed by the Supreme Court of Equity.\nThere, are many other sections unnecessary to refer to, protecting the interests of parties interested in the administration of an estate and in the passing of the accounts.\nThe Probate Court having concurrent jurisdiction therefore with the court of equity over the administration and distribution of the estate of Paul Daly, the appellant, as executor and trustee invoked that jurisdiction, fyled his accounts, and prayed that they might be passed and the estate distributed according to the will. He appealed from the order or decree made by the judge to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, not excepting to the jurisdiction but simply to the merits of the decree. From the judgment of the Supreme Court confirming the decree of the Probate Court, he appeals to this court, and for the first time raises the question of the jurisdiction and powers of the Probate Court. For the reasons I have given I do not think his objections to jurisdiction can be entertained. His remedy if he doubted the jurisdiction of the Probate Court or thought that the circumstances demanded that the estate should be administered and distributed by the court of equity, was to have applied to that court to stay the proceedings of the Probate Court and to administer and distribute the estate.\nThen with reference to the merits and assuming that these accounts had been passed and administration and distribution awarded by the court of equity, would this court alter, modify or annul the decree, if that court had determined that under the circumstances it would be an injustice to the beneficiaries under the will to set the sale aside and order a new sale, and had held the executor, trustee, liable to account for the true value of the interest he had disposed of instead of the nominal value he had returned?\nAssuming therefore the Probate Court to have had general jurisdiction, the questions remain as to its proper exercise.\nAppellant contends with respect to two several sums, one of $1,095, standing on deposit in the Government Savings Bank at the time of Paul Daly's death in the joint names of himself and his daughter Jane \"with power for either one to withdraw\" and another sum of $1,020 standing in a somewhat similar position in the Bank of Montreal, that these sums became Jane Daly's absolutely on her father's death by right of survivorship.\nThe Court of Probate and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick both held under the evidence that there was absolutely nothing beyond the mere fact of the deposit in the joint names, with power for either to withdraw, to shew that Paul Daly intended these moneys to be a gift to his daughter, and that such fact of a joint deposit standing alone did not create a trust for the daughter under the facts as disclosed. When considered with all the accompanying facts I am of the opinion that this conclusion is correct and that these moneys must be accounted for as part of the estate. Shortly stated these accompanying facts are that each person in whose names the moneys were deposited had the right to withdraw them at any time, that this right could only be exercised with respect to Savings Bank deposits at any rate on production of the deposit book, that Paul Daly appeared to have retained exclusive possession of this during his life and by his will executed previously to the deposits had left all his moneys that he died possessed of to his daughter Jane (the joint depositor who lived with her father alone) while she remained unmarried for her life, and in the event of either contingency (marriage or death) then over to his son and his daughter Hester, and that after testator's death, Jane, together with her brother the appellant, jointly petitioned for probate of their father's will and in such petition stated that the father died possessed of personal property to the value of $4,800 of which these moneys on deposit admittedly formed a part.\nJane had therefore either been kept by her father in entire ignorance of these deposits in which case the father's silence and the retention by him of the deposit books in his own possession taken in connection with the disposition he had made of the moneys by his will of which she was an executrix would be strong evidence to shew that these deposits were made in the joint names simply for convenience to enable her to draw moneys in his life time in case of sickness or if he thought it desirable for other reasons or after his death as executrix, and not for the purpose of creating a trust for the daughter or making a gift of the moneys to her; on the other hand, if she knew from her father of these deposits having been made then the statement in the petition which had to be filed under oath a few days after the death of the father that these moneys belonged to the estate was cogent evidence that she was aware from the knowledge gained from her father that it was not his intention to make a gift to her by the joint deposit. Any such knowledge as she possessed on the point was doubtless communicated to her co-executor who joined with her in the petition.\nTaking all the circumstances together including the facts that the executors continued to deposit to the credit of the same accounts the moneys arising from the sale of the personal property of the deceased, I am not satisfied that the judgments of the courts below on this point should be disturbed.\nA large number of cases Irish and American were cited at bar to which I have referred. There is no general governing principle applicable to questions of the kind I am now considering. In every case it is a question of intention to be gathered from the special facts and circumstances and the family relations or otherwise of the parties.\nThen Mr. Newcombe raised the question as to the power of the executor to sell the remainder of the leasehold having assented to the legacy and put the tenant for life into possession.\nConsidering that the objection is raised by an executor who has already done the thing he now complains he had no power to do, and has sold the remainder of the leasehold and applied for an order for distribution of the proceeds, the objection seems an extraordinary one. But I do not think there is anything in it. The sale was made not by the executor qua executor, but in his capacity of executor trustee for the beneficiaries. In Williams on Executors, 10th ed., p. 49, the law is stated to be as follows:\nIt sometimes happens that a testator directs his estate to be disposed of for certain purposes without declaring by whom the sale shall be made. In the absence of such a declaration if the proceeds be distributable by the executor, he shall have the power by implication.\nI think that rule applies here.\nIt was next argued that it was incompetent to charge the executor on the basis of wilful default in a proceeding of this kind without pleadings and notice. But as I have already attempted to shew the determination of the facts respecting the value of this leasehold property and its distribution as part of the assets of the estate are questions over which the Probate Court has general concurrent jurisdiction with the equity courts. Any difficulties which exist in the exercise of this jurisdiction are the creation of the appellant himself and he, be it remembered, is the man who has invoked the jurisdiction and asked the court to pass his accounts and make distribution of the assets.\nThe question arises upon the power of the court to charge appellant as executor trustee with a larger sum than he returned in his accounts as the proceeds of the sale.\nThe courts below held, I think correctly, that the sale of the leasehold was for a totally inadequate price, that the sale was made without the precautions necessary to safeguard the beneficiaries and that although ostensibly made at auction and to a third person it was really for the trustee executor himself. That being so it needed no authority to shew that the sale could not stand and was not binding on the beneficiaries. It could have been set aside by them on application to the court of equity. The principle is not that a man shall not sell to himself, but that the sale shall be voidable if he is both seller and has a substantial interest in the purchase money. In re Moore[22]. But the appellant denies that he was the purchaser or interested in the purchase. He contends that the sale was a bona fide auction sale at which the best obtainable price was had. The whole evidence gathered round that issue with the result that the courts below found that this property was purchased secretly but really for the appellant for the sum of f 800, that it was worth at least $1,800, and directed he should be charged with that sum for it instead of the $800 he returned as the purchase money.\nI agree with the contention in the plaintiff's factum that a purchase by an executor at his own sale is not necessarily void but merely voidable at the option of those who may be interested in the estate and that if they do elect to avoid the court of equity would be the proper court for them to appeal to. But here the facts are peculiar. The factum of the appellant shews that up to the hearing of this appeal the point of his contention was that there was no evidence he had any interest in the sale. The proceedings had gone on for some time before it transpired that the sale of the leasehold was really made by appellant to and for himself. The courts below have both found against him on the contention on this point, and we agree in their finding. General jurisdiction over the administration of the testator's estates being vested in the Probate Court and concurrent powers with the court of equity to allow and pass any account the appellant invoked that jurisdiction, the whole case was fought out on the assumption that the court had the necessary jurisdiction and the disputes related alone to the propriety of its exercise.\nIf the appellant had resold the property at an advance price it is beyond argument that under the findings of fact of the probate judge he would be liable to account to the estate for the enhanced price. In the notes to the leading case of Fox v. Mackreth[23], I find it laid down that :\nExecutors and administrators will not be permitted either immediately or by means of a trustee to purchase for themselves any part of the assets, but will be considered as trustees for the persons interested in the estate and must account to the utmost extent of the advantage made by them of the subject so purchased.\nI see no injustice in compelling an executor who has secretly sold the testator's property to himself for an inadequate price being compelled to account to the estate for its real and true value. Hall v. Hallett[24], and other cases are referred to. In that case the defaulting trustee who had sold shares improperly was not compelled by the court to go into the market and buy back other shares, but the court thought that justice would be done under the circumstances by compelling him to pay the value of the shares.\nIn the case of Nant-Y-Glo and Blaina Iron Works Co. v. Grave[25], V. C. Bacon says at page 748:\nI can find no authority and no case has been referred to but Hall v. Hallett24 in which the.court has confined its power of relief to the mere restitution of the thing which has been taken away. The court of equity would doubtless mould its relief so as to meet the justice of the case and would not in all cases necessarily consider that full justice had been done by a defaulting trustee by the mere restoration of property he had improperly taken away. The Probate Court might under the circumstances of this case have stayed its hand and referred the parties to the court of equity for relief. But the appellant invoked its jurisdiction, pressed for its exercise, contested and disputed all the facts including the real value of the leasehold he had sold and bought for himself and now in this court of final resort to which he has appealed desires to have the proceedings reopened and the parties, for a very small sum, put to the great expense of an equity suit to have determined the questions he himself sought to have decided and practically consented should be determined by the Probate Court. I do not think he should be heard to do so.\nThe only remaining question is as to the meaning of the bequest to the daughter Jane and the executors' duty with respect to the control of the \"moneys\" which the testator left to her \"to hold and be enjoyed by her while she remains unmarried\" with a bequest over in case of her decease or marriage.\nI am of opinion that with respect to \"moneys\" Jane was not entitled to the possession and disposition of the same but to the income only.\nIn the case of Thorpe v. Shillington[26] Mowat V.C. held that:\nWhere money, mortgages and promissory notes were bequeathed to a legatee for life she was not entitled to the possession and disposition of the same, but to the income only, though of farming stock and implements given for life by the same clause she was to have the use in specie.\nThis being so then the executor would be liable to account to the estate if he handed over the corpus of the moneys to the legatee and any of it was lost. In this case it is apparent none was lost as the appellant on his sister's death received back $5,000 or $6,000 being practically her entire estate.\nBefore closing I wish to say a word about the form in which the case came before us. No formal decree or order was made in the Probate Court and had the fact been brought to our notice at the beginning of the argument I would have been strongly inclined to urge that in accordance with the practice of the court the appeal should either be dismissed or stand over until the record was properly completed and the decree was actually taken out and was before us, but as all parties strongly urged that the issues were sufficiently defined in the reasons for judgment given in the courts below and that further postponement would in view of the amount in dispute result in comparatively speaking heavy costs, the court somewhat reluctantly consented to hear the argument, intimating, however, that its doing so must not be taken as a precedent.\nWhatever may be the practice of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in hearing appeals from the Surrogate Court, a jurisdiction covering interlocutory as well as final judgments, I think it should be clearly understood that an appeal to this court will not be heard unless the formal decree has been taken out and appears upon the record.\nIn my judgment the appeal should be dismissed with costs and the decree taken out in accordance with the judgment of the judge of probate. Idington J.\u2014This is an appeal by Henry S. Daly the surviving executor of the last will of his late father, Paul Daly, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, affirming the judgment of the Probate Court of the City and County of St. John, upon the hearing of a petition by said surviving executor to the judge of the said court to have the accounts of the administration of said estate, by said surviving executor, duly allowed and passed.\nThe petition alleged that the petitioner had administered the said estate, and that there was annexed to the petition the account of such administration.\nIn pursuance of the prayer to have all proper citations issued and orders given in the premises, such citations were issued and all persons concerned in the estate appeared.\nThe account annexed to the petition has been as a result of the inquiry amended in some ways that the appellant does not complain of but in others that he does complain of.\nThe testator died on or about the 5th of June, 1891.\nThe last will now in question was made on the 12th of February, 1886, and appointed the appellant and his sister Jane Agnes Daly, executor and executrix thereof.\nThe testator bequeathed to Jane Agnes Daly certain leasehold property while she remained a single woman or until death and then over to be sold and equally divided between the appellant, if living, and another sister or others; or over otherwise in alternative events and in ways needless to detail here.\nThe testator's said will then contained the following provisions: And as to any money of which I may die possessed after the paying of my funeral expenses and the charges of proving this my last will, I give, devise and bequeath the same to my said daughter, Jane Agnes Daly, to hold and be enjoyed by her while she remains unmarried, and in case of her decease or marriage, whichever event may first happen, I direct the same to be divided equally between my son, Henry S. Daly, and my daughter Hester V. Brown; and in case of the death of either the said Henry S. Daly or Hester V. Brown before such division takes place, then the share of the one so dying without children her. or him surviving, shall enure and be paid to the survivor, otherwise the children of the one first dying shall be entitled to share equally with the survivor.\nThe testator after making this will deposited from time to time in the Saving Bank and in the Bank of Montreal on deposit receipts.\nA feature common to each set of these deposits was that either the testator or his said daughter Jane Agnes Daly could withdraw such deposit.\nSome slight differences might be noted in the mode of deposit, in each case, but in the view I take these need not, as they might otherwise have required to be, dwelt upon.\nAt the time of the death of the testator the result of these deposits was that over a thousand dollars was left in each place of deposit. The daughter never drew upon either account, and may not have known of either.\nThe appellant in his account annexed to the petition for passing accounts, gave no credit for these sums deposited, though in the petition for probate signed by him and his sister, they were included in the estimated sum of the personalty belonging to the testator's estate.\nMany presumptions of law and of fact may have left it a fairly arguable question, whether or not these sums had not by survivorship become the property of Miss Daly, but I cannot see how these slight presumptions can be now maintained by the appellant, against this solemn admission on his part, that in fact they did form part of the testator's estate.\nI am therefore unable to come to any other conclusion than that thus declared by the appellant and his sister.\nShe was allowed by the appellant who received them to use, and in part at least to carry, these deposits, received after the grant of probate to them, as executor and executrix,\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the court granting probate.\nIt is urged that she was entitled to possess them, and so deal with such deposits as she saw fit, until the bequest over became operative.\nI cannot assent to such a proposition.\nShe cannot be said to have been the specific legatee of these sums in any such sense as to entitle her to the exclusive possession of them.\nThe rule laid down in Howe v. Earl of Dartmouth[27] seems applicable and the principle upon which it proceeds is conclusive against such a contention.\nThe appellant as executor became possessed of these funds and in duty bound to see that they were so secured that they should be available for those entitled, to what remained of them at her death.\nClearly the appellant once possessed of these moneys, (which were not like the leasehold estate specifically bequeathed), as the facts shew he was, is bound to account for them.\nIt seems no formal judgment ever issued in the Probate Court.\nWe are left to construe the opinion of His Honour Judge Trueman as a decree. I understand counsel for respondent do not claim it means more than that the appellant must, after reasonable time to realize upon the securities the late Miss Daly held, representing these moneys, become bound to pay over and distribute the same.\nI would give the time that would be reasonable to do so, but in any event declare that he must account for the sums in question within such reasonable time with interest from the death of the late Miss Daly.\nAnother question raised by the appeal is, that the appellant claims he has been wrongfully charged with the sum of one thousand dollars, lost to the estate by reason of his having sold at a sacrifice the leasehold property.\nHe sold at public auction, without proper means to protect the estate from loss, and I have no doubt by circuitous methods, not countenanced by any law, acquired in name of his wife this leasehold property.\nI doubt somewhat the jurisdiction of the Probate Court thus to deal with such a matter upon an application to pass accounts.\nThough a sale by a trustee to an agent for himself, in substance to himself, is often spoken of as no sale, and as void, the result is not accurately described by these words.\nIt is for the cestui que trust to say whether or not he will permit it to stand.\nIt may be better for him to affirm such a sale. It may be more advantageous than to insist on avoiding it. In such a case it is not open to the offending trustee to insist upon its nullity.\nThe rule first suggested by Lord Thurlow, and later adopted by Lord Eldon, in Ex parte Hughes[28] and Ex parte Lacey[29], that the property should, if the cestui que trust so elect, be put up for resale at the price at which the trustee had purchased and if any r advance made the resale should take effect, but if no bidding the trustee should be held to his bargain, seems to be in accord with reason and justice.\nLewin on Trusts, 10th ed., says at p. 561, that\nthe same principle has since been followed in numerous other cases, and the practice may be considered as settled.\nWhat authority has the Probate Court to deal with the matter in that way in passing accounts?\nI asked counsel to point out to me the statutory provision giving the Probate Court, which is the creation of statute, or judge thereof, any such jurisdiction. He faintly relied on the implied power in the section providing for a final passing of accounts and discharging the executor or trustee.\nI fail to be able to construe that section or anything in the Act in question as giving any such power.\nThe property in sales such as that in question often passes out of the control of the trustee into hands entitled to retain it and then the trustee may be compelled by the cestui que trust to account for the differences of price or for the difference between the sum the trustee paid and the real value of the estate at the time of the purchase with interest. See Lewin, p. 561.\nI doubt if on the passing of accounts the Probate Court or judge can apply this remedy against the will of either party concurred. I incline, however, to the opinion that all parties agreeing he can. Many things here and there in the statute, such as the jurisdiction given over the property, the power to enforce filing an inventory and the power of removal of the executor guilty of waste and to substitute another who no doubt could sue for such loss by waste, indicate that by consent the probate judge might in assessing such damages be acting within what is implied in these more comprehensive powers.\nThe parties are not agreed as to what was intended here.\nCounsel for appellant urges that all that took place in regard to the valuation of the property in question is attributable to the issue of whether or not the appellant had become entitled to his discharge.\nIf the appellant had been able to satisfy the learned judge of the Probate Court that he had credited full value of the property no need for going further. But it is said if he failed to so satisfy the learned judge then all the judge could do was to refuse to discharge him, and let the matter stand over until, by some more appropriate proceeding, the amount of loss to the estate might be determined and recovery from the executor had.\nThe difficulty I find is that while the evidence given on both sides might be attributed to the determination of this suggested primary question, it seems to be impossible to suppose on all the facts appearing that such was the real purpose of the appellant in conducting his side of the question.\nI cannot find that he ever took the ground that it was not competent for the learned judge to determine the whole matter in difference as he has done.\nA perusal of the evidence, and consideration of the manner of presenting it, leads me to the conclusion that both sides assumed the learned judge had jurisdiction to try such issues, and at all events understood that the contest conducted was of that nature and that its result would be, if the evidence warranted it, the charging appellant with such loss.\nI do not infer that any other contest was made than the right of respondents to have the appellant made answerable for such loss. The appellant clearly denied the loss, and in any event, the liability on his part, even if it existed, inasmuch as he had sold by auction to the highest bidder, to make it good.\nThese are objections quite different from objecting to the jurisdiction of the forum. Indeed he seems to have selected this forum to dispose of the whole of those matters in issue. Can he escape from the result?\nHis grounds of appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick are set forth in detail, and I do not see my way to reading them as covering an objection to the jurisdiction of the trial judge.\nCan he now raise that question? Can he do so any more than one who has submitted to any other form of arbitrament?\nThis is not the case of a tribunal absolutely without jurisdiction. In such cases the mere trial decides nothing,\nIt is the case of a tribunal having a jurisdiction to pass upon accounts the party moving it presents, and in which rectification of such accounts is clearly a matter incidental to the full discharge of the duty thus devolving upon the court. The boundary lines of this power of rectification are exceedingly difficult to define in some cases. The mistake in stating an amount received from a sale is clearly within it. The petitioner, assenting to that power of rectification, being extended to the case of an amount set down, not by mistake but correctly, yet the result of mistake, in conducting the business of the trust, clearly must bind him.\nI cannot distinguish this case from the latter.\nThere was no surcharge as I conceive there ought to have been to present the matter properly. There were no pleadings or issue of any kind such as might have possibly been directed. The ordinary case requires none. I mention these things to shew how loosely the parties proceeded without objection by the appellant. Hence when they disagree here as to the meaning of their proceedings below we have to extract from the whole proceedings the intention of the parties as best we can. The respondents must be held to have assumed and recognized that the property itself had got into innocent hands.\nThe appellant cannot be heard now to take any other position. His case has not, on the facts, any merits. His appeal must be dismissed. But the formal judgment should protect him from the possible embarrassments created by want of any formal judgment in the Probate Court.\nMaclennan J.\u2014There are two main points in this appeal. The first relates to the jurisdiction of the Probate Court to charge the appellant with the loss to the estate by reason of a sale of the testator's leasehold house at an' undervalue; and the second to the claim of the appellant, as executor of the estate of his sister Jane, that his sister became, at her father's death, entitled by survivorship to the money on deposit with the government and the Bank of Montreal on savings account.\nAs to the first point, it is contended that the leasehold having been sold at public auction, after due advertisement, the propriety or validity of that sale could not be attacked or questioned by the probate judge, and that the only forum in which that could be done was the Supreme Court in Equity. It may be that the sale could not be set aside in the Probate Court, but it is not necessary to decide whether that could be done or not, for the probate judge did not assume to do that, and could not have done so without the purchaser Wilson, or the appellant's wife, for whom the purchase was said to have been made, or both of them, being made parties to the proceeding, which was not done.\nWhat the learned judge has done, and what he had undoubted authority to do, is to find that the property was sold at a great undervalue, by the wilful neglect and default of the appellant, as the surviving executor of his father's estate.\nThe testator died on the 5th June, 1891, and on the 12th of the same month, the appellant and his sister Jane who were appointed executor and executrix of his will, presented a petition to the judge of probate asking for probate thereof to be granted to them, and stating that the testator had no real estate, but had personal property to the value of about $4,800 all situate within the City of St. John. Allowing for the money and household furniture, which was the only other property left by the testator; the leasehold must have represented about $ 2,200 of that valuation.\nThe appellant made no application to have his accounts as executor passed until after the death of his sister Jane, on the 6th of April, 1903. On the 16th May, 1903, he made an affidavit, verifying an inventory of the estate, in which he described the lease- hold in question as being valued at f 1,500, and it is shewn to have been assessed at that sum. There is evidence that offers of f 1,500 and f 1,800 for the property had been made to the appellant and refused by him, and witnesses of experience deposed to valuations as high as $2,500 and $3,000.\nThe property was sold for $800, a sum slightly less than the clear rental income for two years.\nIt is clear that when an executor or trustee for sale has disposed of property at a gross undervalue, he may be called upon, in an accounting, to explain his conduct, and if it appears that the loss arose by reason of his neglect, carelessness or other misconduct, he may be charged therewith, as for wilful neglect and default.\nIn such a case it is not necessary for the cestui que trust to take proceedings to set aside the sale. In many cases that may not be possible; the purchaser may have bought fairly and honestly, and may have got a good title, and the only remedy available to the beneficiary may be to hold the executor or trustee responsible for his neglect of duty.\nThat is what the learned judge has done here, and I think he had sufficient evidence before him to support his finding.\nThe appellant and his wife had been living in the ground floor of the house for about seven years, and were still in occupation at the time of the sale, and another tenant occupied the first floor. The purchaser at the sale was one Wilson, who deposes that he bought the property for the appellant's wife, that he had the request from her personally, saw her personally and spoke to Mr. Bustin about it, and he understood that Bustin and Porter were acting for the appellant. The appellant however denies that he knew his wife was the purchaser until after the sale, but knew immediately afterwards. He was present at the sale, which was managed by his solicitors Bustin & Porter. In his evidence he at first endeavoured to conceal that his wife had been the purchaser. He said:\nMr. Wilson was the purchaser. Mr. Wilson is my landlord now. I have made no arrangement with Mr. Wilson for rental. He has not paid me the $800. I do not know of my own knowledge that Mr. Wilson has paid the $800. I do not intend purchasing the property, and I do not know that my wife intends purchasing.\nAfterwards, however, he admits that he knew immediately after the sale that Wilson purchased for his wife. It is not difficult from all this to infer that the cheque which Mr. Wilson says he gave in payment, was repaid with the money which was drawn upon it.\nIt is noticeable that the advertisement of sale is defective. It is silent as to the duration of the term, or whether renewable, or what the income was from rents. The sale was without reserve or a reserved bid, notwithstanding a suggestion by the solicitor of the respondents that a sale without reserve, or without an upset price being fixed, might result in the property being greatly sacrificed. The answer by the appellant's solicitors to this suggestion was, in effect, that neither he nor his clients had any right to interfere, and that the executor had the sole right to decide how it should be disposed of. In the same letter they stated that the property was assessed for $1,500, and in a subsequent letter that two offers had been made of about $1,750 each.\nI am of opinion that the probate judge was right in charging the appellant on the footing of wilful neglect and default, and that the sum with which he has charged him was well warranted by the evidence.\nIt was objected before us that it was not competent to the probate judge to take the account against the appellant on the footing of wilful neglect and default, for want of jurisdiction and for want of pleading. I think, looking at the provisions of the Probate Act, ch. 118, R.S.N.B., 1903, there can be no question of the learned judge's power, and as to the want of pleading it is too late, the appellant not having, so far as appears, raised the objection in either of the courts below, to raise it for the first time in this court\nThe other question has also in my opinion been rightly decided against the appellant.\nIt is hardly disputed, and I think could not be for a moment, that the money which was deposited, both in the Bank of Montreal and in the Government Savings Deposit, was the testator Paul Daly's money But it is said that the form of the receipts given for those deposits made the father and his daughter Jane joint tenants of the money, so that at the father's death his daughter became entitled to the whole by survivorship. I do not see how that can be so. In a case of joint tenancy neither party is exclusive owner of the whole. Neither can appropriate the whole to himself. Here, however, the father did not lose his right to take the whole, by authorizing his daughter also to draw. He could still draw the whole whenever he pleased, up to the day of his death, and if he did it would all be his own money. Could his daughter have done that? I do not think so. She could as against the bank have drawn it all, and a payment to her would have discharged the bank; but the money would still have been the father's money in her hands. She would have been accountable to him for it all. If I authorize another to draw a cheque on my bank account that is not necessarily or prima facie a gift. My mandatory would be responsible to me for so much money, unless I gave it to him expressly as a gift. Here there are no words at all of gift used by the father. He gave her nothing but authority to draw or to receive his money, expressly reserving and retaining his own right. It is no more than if he wrote to the bank saying, 1 authorize you to honour my daughter's cheques on my deposit.\nThe daughter was therefore no more than an authorized agent, and when her father died the authority he had given was revoked by operation of law, and the funds remained the money of the testator's estate, subject to the provisions of his will.\nThe daughter never drew anything during her father's life time, but within eight days after his death, instead of claiming the money as her own, joined her brother the appellant in a petition for probate, declaring that her father's estate was of the value of about $4,800, which it could not possibly be without including the savings deposits.\nNot only that but on the same day of the signing of the said petition she deposited $250 of money found in the testator's house in one of the savings accounts, and made two further similar deposits, one of $100 admitted to have been her father's money, and the other on the 6th October afterwards, the sum of $189 the proceeds of the sale of the testator's household furniture.\nThese subsequent deposits shew that neither at the time of the testator's death nor for months afterwards, had his daughter Jane any idea that the deposits stood in any different position from the rest of her father's estate.\nI am therefore clear that the judgment is right in relation to the savings deposits. On the other minor questions which were raised by the appellant I entirely agree with the judgment of the probate judge.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bustin & Porter,\nSolicitor for the respondents: A.

Act, 1867, ss. 111 and 142.\nAmong the assets of the Province of Canada at Confederation were certain special funds, namely, U. C. Grammar School Fund, U. C. Building Fund and U. C. Improvement Fund, and the province was a debtor in respect thereto and liable for interest thereon. By sec. 111 of the B.N.A. Act., 1867, the Dominion of Canada succeeded to such liability and paid the Province of Ontario interest thereon at five per cent, up to 1904. In the award made in 1870 and finally established in 1878. on the arbitration, under sec. 142 of the Act to adjust the debts and assets of Upper and Lower Canada, it was adjudged that these funds were the property of Ontario. In 1904 the Dominion Government claimed the right to reduce the rate of interest to four per cent., or if that was not acceptable to the Province to hand over the principal.\nOn appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court in an action asking for a declaration as to the rights of the province in respect to said funds,\nHeld, affirming said judgment (10 Ex. C.R. 292), Idington J. dissenting, that though before the said award the Dominion was obliged to hold the funds and pay the interest theron to Ontario, after the award the Dominion had a right to pay over the same with any accrued interest to the province and thereafter be free from liability in respect thereof.\nHeld, also, that until the principal sum was paid over the Dominion was liable for interest thereon at the rate of five per cent. per annum. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], declaring that the Dominion Government was entitled at any time to pay to the Province of Ontario the principal of the Upper Canada Grammar School Fund, Upper Canada Building Fund and Upper Canada Improvement Fund, and that until the same was paid the province was entitled to interest thereon at the rate of five per cent. per annum.\nThe action was brought on behalf of the Province of Ontario to recover from the Dominion of Canada the sum of $9,549.23 alleged to be payable to the province on the 31st of December, 1904, being one-half of one per centum interest on the capital of certain trust funds held by the Dominion and belonging to the province, such trust funds being known as:\nThe Upper Canada Grammar School Fund............. $ 312,769.04\nThe Upper Canada Building Fund. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,472,391.41\nThe Upper Canada Improvement Fund\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 124,685.18\nTotal\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026............. $1,909,845.63\nThe province also asked for a declaration that the Dominion of Canada is not entitled, without the assent of the Province of Ontario, to make any alteration in or reduction from the rate of interest of five per centum per annum alleged to be payable upon such trust funds.\nThe Dominion of Canada by its answer denied its liability to pay the sum demanded and asked for a declaration:\u2014 1.That the Dominion is under no obligation to pay interest at the rate of five per centum per annum upon the said funds, but may reduce the interest to a lower rate ; and\n2.That the said trust funds may at the option of the Dominion be paid over to the province.\nBy an amendment to the statement of defence it was alleged on behalf of the Dominion that on the 29th day of December, 1903, the Minister of Finance of Canada, being the proper Minister of the Crown in that behalf, duly made a tender in writing to the treasurer of Ontario to pay the amount of the indebtedness due by the Dominion to the Province of Ontario in respect of the said trust funds ; that the said tender was not accepted by the government of the Province of Ontario, whereby the Dominion became and was discharged from further payment of interest upon the said indebtedness.\nThe alleged tender was contained in a letter written by the Minister of Finance to the treasurer of Ontario on 29th December, and was as follows:\nSir,\u2014The question of the rate of interest to be allowed and paid upon the amount in the hands of the Dominion belonging to the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec and known as trust funds, has been under consideration in my Department, and in this connection I beg to refer you to my letter of 28th April last\nThe amount of these funds, in the case of Ontario is $1,909,845.63, embracing the Upper Canada Grammar School Funds, the Upper Canada Building Fund, and the Upper Canada Improvement Fund.\nIt has been decided to pay, on the 1st of January, 1904, the interest on these funds, at the rate heretofore paid, namely, 5 per cent. After that date, interest at the rate of 4 per cent. will be paid until further notice, or until the principal of the funds is paid to Ontario in full. If this arrangement is not satisfactory to your government I shall be pleased to receive notice to that effect, whereupon arrangements will be made to pay off the principal sum at an early date.\nThe questions that are presented for solution are stated by the learned judge as follows:\n1. Was the Dominion of Canada prior to the 31st day of December, 1904, under an obligation to pay to the Province of Ontario interest on the funds mentioned at the rate of five per centum per annum?\n2. Had the Dominion the right at the date mentioned without the assent of the province, to reduce the rate of interest from five to four per centum per annum?\n\"3. Has the Dominion the right at any time to pay or hand over to the province the amount of such trust funds, with interest accrued thereon, in discharge of its obligations in respect thereof, both as to the principal and the interest?\n\"4. Was a good tender made to the province on behalf of the Dominion, before this action was brought, of the amount of such funds, so as to discharge the Dominion of any obligation theretofore existing to pay interest on such funds?\"\nThe action was tried by Mr. Justice Burbidge at Toronto, on the 5th and 6th days of October, 1905, and the court was pleased to direct that the action should stand over for judgment and on 9th April, 1906, it was adjudged as follows:\n1. This Court Doth Declare that the Dominion of Canada is liable under contract to pay interest on the trust funds referred to in the pleadings mentioned herein at the rate of five per centum per annum, so long as the Dominion of Canada retains the said trust funds and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n2. And This Court Doth Further Declare that the Dominion of Canada while retaining such funds is not entitled to reduce the said rate of interest thereon without the assent of the Province of Ontario, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n3. And This Court Doth Further Declare that the Dominion of Canada may at any time pay or hand over to the Province of Ontario the said trust funds or any one of them with interest at the rate aforesaid then accrued thereon, if any, in full discharge of its obligation in respect to the said funds or any one of them as the case may be, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n4. And This Court Doth Further Declare that the Dominion of Canada did not before action make to the Province of Ontario any sufficient tender of the said funds or any of them and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n5. And This Court Doth Order and Adjudge that the Province of Ontario do recover against the Dominion of Canada the sum of $9,549.23.\n6. And This Court Doth not see fit to make any order as to the costs of this action.\nThe Province of Ontario, by notice duly filed and delivered, has appealed, as dissatisfied with so much of the learned judge's decision, as appears on the third paragraph of the judgment as follows:\n\"That the Dominion of Canada may at any time pay or hand over to the Province of Ontario the said trust funds or any one of them with interest at the rate aforesaid then accrued thereon if any, in full dis- charge of its obligation in respect to the said funds or any one of them as the case may be, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\"\nAnd the Dominion of Canada by notice of cross-appeal duly filed and delivered has appealed against so much of the learned judge's decision as appears in the first, second, fourth and fifth paragraphs of the judgment. Such notice specifying as follows:\n\"Take notice that upon the hearing of the claimant's appeal from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Burbidge in this cause, delivered on the 9th day of April, A.D. 1906, the respondent intends to contend and insist that the said decision should he varied by striking out and vacating such parts of the said decision as adjudge and declare that the rate of interest payable on the funds in question is five per centum per annum and that the Dominion of Canada cannot retain such funds and reduce such rate of interest without the assent of the Province of Ontario and that the letter from Mr. Fielding to Mr. Ross, of the 29th day of December, 1903, did not constitute a good and sufficient tender and offer by the Dominion of Canada to the Province of Ontario of the funds in question, and that the province is entitled to recover from the Dominion the sum of $9,549.23 claimed in this proceeding, and the respondent intends to contend and insist that it should be declared that the respondent is under no obligation to pay interest at the rate of five per centum per annum upon the said funds, but may reduce the interest to a lower rate, and that this action in respect of the said claim for the sum of $9,549.23, being one-half of one per centum interest on the capital of certain trust funds, should be ordered to be dismissed.

The learned counsel dealt at length with the history of the respective funds in question on the appeal and the proceedings on behalf of the governments of Canada, Ontario and Quebec prior and preparatory to the arbitration of 1870.\nThese funds were held by the government of Canada in trust, first for the Province of Ontario and Quebec jointly and, after the award of the arbitrators finally confirmed in 1878 for the Province of Ontario alone. On the principal of these funds five per cent interest has been paid to the province from Confederation up to 1904 when the Dominion government claimed the right to reduce the rate. This income from, the funds has always been under the control of the provinces, subject, of course, to its disposition according to the conditions of the trust. The sole duty and obligation of the Federal Government was to pay the interest. As to the disposition of it that government had nothing to say.\nThen the Province of Ontario and Quebec have always paid to the Dominion, under section 112 of \"The British North America Act,\" five per cent. on the excess of the debt of the old Province of Canada over $62,500,000 at the union. That, we submit, is confirmatory of the principle laid down at Confederation as applicable to these funds.\nSection 109 of \"The B. N. A. Act\" vests in the province all the property it owned at the union and it follows that the province must have the sole legislative control over it. That position has always been asserted by Ontario in respect to these funds and practically recognized by the Federal Government up to 1904.\nThen the arbitrators who took the accounts between the Dominion and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec up to 1892 allowed five per cent. on these funds the question of rate of interest having been especially submitted to them. We submit that that was a recognition of our legal position.\nIf the sole legislative control over these funds is with Ontario the Federal Government cannot, except with the concurrence of the Legislature, pay over the capital and so be relieved of its liability to pay this interest. Newcombe K.C., Deputy Minister of Justice, and Hogg K.C. for the respondent. In their statement of claim the appellants base the right to receive five per cent, interest on these funds, first, on the fact that prior to the arbitration of 1870 the Dominion and the two provinces agreed upon certain principles and rules by which the arbitrators were to be governed, one of which was that the Dominion should pay said rate on the funds in question; secondly, that the award fixed the same rate as an obligation of the Dominion.\nThe correspondence does not establish this claim. One feature of it was that the Upper Canada Improvement Fund was to be paid in any case. It is said by our learned friends that that only applied to a small portion of the fund, but we do not so understand it. But as to all the funds the alleged agreement was only come to as governing the parties until the arbitrators should decide as to the ownership which the award eventually provided was in Ontario so far as these funds were concerned. Moreover, in a letter from Hon. Mr. Wood, treasurer of Ontario, to the Hon. Mr. Rose, dated 5th December, 1868, the writer states that it would be unwise for the province to commit itself to cast iron rules in the classification or allocation of the varied items of debt and credit, practically saying that they did not agree in the policy of settling rules at all. And in a subsequent document, described as a \"memo, of an informal conference between the Treasurer of Ontario and the Minister of Finance\" the former agrees to the Dominion retaining the funds \"for the present\" and paying five per cent. interest thereon. We submit that the meaning was that the award would determine the question. Then we come to the question of the right of the Dominion to pay over the capital of the funds when it is deemed expedient to do so. This question has been obscured by speaking of the funds as trust funds and the Dominion as a trustee. We submit that they were never held in trust. That it was always a debt due from the Dominion, and Ontario always treated it as such. Then, when the award finally affirmed in 1878, decided that these funds belonged to Ontario the Dominion government was in a position to pay its debt the creditor having been ascertained.\nThe learned counsel then dealt at length with the later arbitration dealing with accounts between the Dominion and the two provinces not settled by the award of 1870 and argued that two of the funds in question were not submitted in that reference and that the award determined nothing as to the matters in issue on this appeal.\nShepley K.C. was heard in-reply.\nNewcombe K.C. in reply on the cross-appeal.\nGirouard J.\u2014The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given-in the court below.\nDavies J.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Burbidge of the Exchequer Court of Canada in his judgment in this case, I am of the opinion that the appeal and the cross appeal should both be dismissed and the judgment below confirmed.\nI only desire to add a few words, upon the argument strenuously urged at Bar by Sir Aemilius Irving and Mr. Shepley with respect to the funds in dispute between the two Governments in this suit, that since Confederation Ontario's sole right has been to receive interest at the stipulated rate and Canada's sole obligation has been to pay it, and that these relative rights can only be affected, altered or modified by concerted legislation on the part of the Dominion and the Province, and that in any case even if legislation was not necessary on the part of the Dominion, it was necessary on the part of the Province which could not, as I understand the argument, in its absence either enforce payment as against the Dominion or be compelled to receive the moneys in question by the Dominion.\nI confess myself quite unable to follow this reasoning. I am in full accord with Burbidge J. in his holding that from Confederation until the validity of the award made by the arbitrators appointed under the 142nd section of the British North America Act, 1867, it was necessary that the Dominion should hold these funds. It could neither get rid of its statutory obligations with respect to them by voluntary payment or tender, nor could payment be enforced from it by suit. After, however, the validity of the award had been sustained, the right of the Province to demand payment and the correlative right of the Dominion voluntarily to pay over the monies seems to have become complete.\nIn my opinion these correlative rights and obligations are not dependent upon concerted legislation of the Parliament and Legislature or upon legislation by the province alone.\nThe rights and obligations arose out of the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, and although while they were unascertained as to their extent and amount, they were incapable of being enforced or acted upon either by the Dominion or the province, the moment the award of the arbitrators defining and fixing their amount and extent was validated, that moment the rights and obligations of the Dominion and the province became capable of being exercised and enforced. The Legislature of Ontario could not by ex parte legislation prejudice the right of the Dominion to discharge its statutory liability and obligation with respect to these moneys, or alter its rights with respect to them in any way.\nThe liability was one created by Imperial legislation and completed and rendered definite and capable of being discharged by the award made pursuant to that legislation. The right of the Legislature of Ontario to deal with the funds themselves when paid over to the province even to the extent of modifying or altering the trusts which it is contended are impressed upon them, is not before us for consideration and is of course not dealt with by us.\nThe liability of the Dominion to the province with respect to these funds and their payment over when the amounts were ascertained and awarded is one entirely apart from and unaffected by the fact that the moneys were trust moneys and should be so treated by the province when received by it.\nThe old Province of Canada having disappeared at Confederation, and the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec having been carved out of it, provision had to be made for the adjustment between the two newly created provinces of the debts, liabilities assets, etc., of the late province. The mode adopted by the Imperial Act and the award following it and made in pursuance of it, was to treat these funds which really and practically existed as a matter of book-keeping only, as real and existing funds and as alike assets and liabilities of the late Province of Canada. As a liability of course they added to the debt of the old province on which, beyond a fixed amount, the two new provinces had to pay interest to the Dominion at the rate of 5 per cent., and as an asset of the late province a special tribunal was created by the Act to adjust and divide them as well as other assets between the two new provinces. Pending the decision of this statutory tribunal the Dominion held the books of the late Province of Canada, and continued the accounts of the several special or trust funds and was contingently liable to account for them to whichever one of the two new provinces the arbitration tribunal determined and apportioned them.\nThat tribunal determined in the 5th paragraph of its award that the\nspecial or trust funds (now in question) including the several investments in respect of the same or of any of them should be and the same are hereby declared to be the property of and to belong to the Province of Ontario for the purposes for which they were established.\nWhen that award was made and completed, the obligations and rights of the Dominion with respect to these moneys so far as the Province of Ontario was concerned, which previously had been uncertain and indefinite, became definite and certain. Its obligation to pay to Ontario the moneys of these funds if demanded became and was clear, and the right of the province to demand and receive them equally clear. No further legislation. was in my opinion necessary either concerted as between the Dominion and the province, or by the Province alone, to enable the Dominion to discharge its obligations or the province to enforce its rights;\nThe Dominion was in no way or sense obliged to see to the execution by the province of the trusts impressed upon the moneys nor could it by legislation of its own in any way interfere in the matter. It had one clear duty and obligation, and that was to pay over to the province the moneys which had been awarded to it. That obligation could be discharged by the voluntary payment or tender of the moneys or by its payment if and when the province demanded it ; and the right of the province so to demand or enforce the payment did not in any way depend upon further or other provincial legislation.\nWith respect to the question whether Mr. Fielding's letter to Mr. Ross of the 29th December, 1903, constituted a good and sufficient tender of the funds in question, I entertain grave doubts, but I am not satisfied that the judgment appealed from is so clearly wrong on the point as to justify me in voting to reverse it.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal in both cases.\nIdington J.\u2014In the province of Upper Canada there was set apart in the reign of his late Majesty George the III, a quantity of waste lands of the Crown for the endowment of grammar schools and also of a university.\nThereafter 2 Vict. ch. 12 passed by the Parliament of that province directed amongst other things the investment of the moneys derived or derivable from such. source in the debentures of the province at six per cent, interest.\nThe provinces of Upper and Lower Canada were subsequently reunited by 3 & 4 Vict. ch. 35, of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nOn the 18th September, 1841, the Parliament of these united provinces repealed 2 Vict. ch. 12, above mentioned, but directed the investment of the moneys derived or derivable from above mentioned source to be invested in debentures. One section speaks of debentures of Upper Canada bearing six per cent. interest and the next of debentures without naming a rate of interest. These sections I refer to as obviously shewing that no particular rate of interest at that date formed an essential feature of the trust. Debentures of Upper Canada would no longer be available and I infer that the rate of interest for new investments of the fund was left for future conditions to determine.\n16 Vict. ch. 186 of the Province of Canada repealed the last named Act and out of the same subject matters and other possible sources of a like nature created a fund to be called \"The Upper Canada Grammar School Fund,\" which was to be invested in Government or other securities by the direction of the Governor in Council.\nIt may, to shew the spirit of this legislation, be noted before leaving, for the present, this history of the fund, that for a time the administration of the trust was confided to the Council of King's College.\nAnother fund was created by the Parliament of Canada at a later date, from entirely different sources, and designated \"The Upper Canada building fund.\" This was directed by Consolidated Statutes for Upper Canada, 1859, ch. 70, sec. 3, to be invested by the Receiver-General under instructions from the Governor in Council in \"Provincial Securities\" and the interest on such securities to form part of the said fund.\nThis fund was primarily to be drawn upon to meet the expenses of building a lunatic asylum and then to defray the expenses of procuring a. site for or of erecting any other public building in Upper Canada for any institution of general importance to the inhabitants of that portion of the Province of Canada.\nThis Act provided that such securities might be disposed of by the Receiver-General on the approval of the Governor in Council, and the proceeds applied to meet lawful payments out of the fund.\nTo appreciate the history of this fund and the bearing thereof on what ensued, we must bear in mind that though Upper and Lower Canada were united, yet the past history and the conditions of each, during the period from the Union of 1840 to the time of the Confederation of the provinces in 1867, was of such a nature as to render the united government and administration thereof in some respects substantially one of a dual character.\nTo compensate Upper Canada for the advances made to bring to a close the system of feudal tenures in Lower Canada, the Upper Canada building fund was used.\nWhen we penetrate to the bottom we may be tempted to smile at the device adopted, and possibly needed, to reconcile one part of the common country to the payment made, to aid in sweeping away what was an obvious hindrance to the progress of another part, and incidentally to that of the whole.\nWe may even be tempted to think that this device was after all but a bundle of book-keeping entries. Yet it was a recognition and record to be borne in mind, and when separation came and Upper Canada became in regard to such matters an independent province, this setting apart of such fund was properly dealt with as a trust. Another fund of $124,685.18 which was, by the Board of Arbitrators hereinafter referred to, set apart as part of a fund designated \"The Upper Canada Improvement Fund,\" representing things and purposes that enured or were to enure to the benefit of Upper Canada, is also in question.\nThe next step in the history of these trust funds, first and secondly dealt with, appears in a report of the then Minister of Finance dated March, 1860, in the following language:\nBy the assumption of the Provincial securities held by Trust Funds the Government have, as stated in the report of the Board of Audit, assumed these amounts as due ta the funds by the Province and have thus cancelled so much of the debt, an arrangement more consistent with the actual position of these trusts and more correctly shewing the actual debt of the Province.\nThe report of the Board of Audit upon which the foregoing report proceeds, shews that there had actually been issued debentures to represent these two funds first named above, and that as a matter of convenience it was deemed better to destroy the securities, so far as consisting of provincial debentures, and credit the sums to the funds and pay interest thereon as a debt, in fact, of the province.\nThe report of the Board, somewhat inconsistently with the view taken by the minister, represents it as virtually a public debt; though not appearing so in the statement of affairs.\nI gather from what appears that the rate of interest had theretofore been six per cent., and for another year was continued at six per cent.\nIn 1861, the report of the Audit Board proposed that the rate be five per cent. as the then prevailing \"public interest\" instead of six per cent.\nThere does not seem to have been any legislation giving authority to do all this, or when done to confirm it.\nSuch, as far as I can see, was the position of matters when the British North America Act, 1867, was passed ; and it was then found necessary to provide for the liabilities of the Province of Canada.\nSection 111 of that Act provided that\nCanada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each Province existing at the Union.\nSection 142 of the same Act provided as follows:\nThe division and adjustment of the debts, credits, liabilities, properties and assets of Upper Canada and Lower Canada shall be referred to the arbitrament of three arbitrators, one to be chosen by the Government of Ontario, one by the Government of Quebec, and one by the Government of Canada; and the selection of the arbitrators shall not be made until the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of Ontario and Quebec have met; and the arbitrator chosen by the Government of Canada shall not be a resident either in Ontario or in Quebec.\nPreceding the reference, thus provided for, a good deal of negotiation took place, and correspondence was had between the respondent's Minister of Finance and appellant's treasurer. Amongst other things, the respective rights of the parties hereto and the rates of interest to be credited appellants, in relation to the funds now in question, were discussed.\nIt was pointed out that what would in effect be a permanent annuity based on a five per cent rate of interest might be agreed upon. It was pointed out by appellant's treasurer in answer thereto, that such an arrangement might not meet with the approval of the people of Ontario, and at all events, was ultra vires the powers of the Government.\nNothing came of these suggestions except to recognize for the time being five per cent, as the rate, coupled with consents or rules to facilitate the work of the arbitrators. It is to be observed that though these rights were discussed, no question of a duty in the nature of a trusteeship on the part of the Dominion was then raised, as in later times.\nThe Board of Arbitrators appointed pursuant to section 142 of the British North America Act, 1867 heard the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec and on the 3rd September, 1870, awarded amongst other things, as follows:\nV. That the following special or trust funds, and the moneys thereby payable, including the several investments, in respect of the same of or any them are, shall be, and the same are hereby declared to be the property of, and to belong to, the Province of Ontario for the purposes for which they were established, namely:\u2014\nAmongst those trust funds, specified, are these in question herein. It seems to me that up to the making of this award there was only a general obligation created by section 111 of the British North America Act, 1867, and by this award it was reduced to a degree of certainty.\nIt might have happened that the arbitrators in the manifold adjustments possible between the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec might have determined in such a way as to wipe out any of these liabilities of the Dominion arising out of the existence of the two first created of these trust funds. If they had there would have been no help for it. Indeed the third of these now in question was created by this award. What then was prior to the award, or thereupon became, the legal relation of the parties in regard to these funds?\nThe Dominion claims it stood thereafter and stands now as a simple debtor to Ontario for certain specified sums of money and that it has a right to terminate instantly the relation by tendering the money.\nThe province denies this, and claims that until it gives consent the simple relation of debtor and creditor does not exist; a trusteeship existed and must remain so, coupled with an obligation to pay the rate of 5 per cent. interest as heretofore.\nThe appellant received from the respondent interest at the rate of five per cent; ever since Confederation (perhaps not up to the award as regularly and in settled form as after) upon the two first named, and since the award above mentioned, on all three of these funds until 29th December, 1903, without material objection on either side. What happened then was that the Minister of Finance on that date wrote the premier and treasurer of Ontario that it had been decided to pay on the 1st January, 1904, interest on these funds at the rate of five per cent., but after that date, interest at the rate of four per cent, would be paid, until further notice, or \"until the principal of the funds be paid to Ontario in full.\nIf that proposal should not be satisfactory to the Ontario Government arrangements would be made to pay off the principal at an early date.\nTo this the premier and treasurer of Ontario replied 6th January, 1904, denying the right of the Dominion to terminate its trusteeship by the payment over to Ontario of the trust funds in question, and that the five per cent. rate of interest could not be modified without the consent of Ontario, and suggesting a judicial determination be had of these questions.\nCorrespondence ensued on this subject between these ministers and those representing them, without much progress, until on the 13th October, 1904, the solicitor for the Ontario treasury pointed out different methods of getting a judicial decision respecting the interest on these trust funds.\nNothing seems to have been agreed upon but the Dominion on the 1st of January, 1905, only paid at the rate of four per cent. instead of five per cent, as theretofore and hence this suit, begun immediately after.\nThe action was brought by appellants not only to enforce payment of the usual rate of interest which had been denied by the respondent, but also to have it declared that the Dominion is not entitled, without the assent of the Province of Ontario, to make any alteration in or reduction from the rate of five per centum per annum payable upon the trust funds in question.\nNot having succeeded in obtaining this declaration in the court below, and that court having declared\nthat the Dominion of Canada may at any time pay or hand over to the Province of Ontario the said trust funds or any one of them with interest at the rate aforesaid then accrued thereon, if any, in full discharge of its obligation in respect to the said funds or any one of them, as the case may be, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly,\nhence this appeal wherein we are limited to the express affirmation or denial, or affirmation of one and denial of the other claim, as thus stated.\nIt seemed to me at the close of the argument that the true ground upon which the Dominion might rest a claim and method it might adopt, had not been taken. I therefore asked counsel if we could go beyond either of the limits I have just stated, and was expressly answered by both sides, that it was not desired by either party that the court should do so.\nIt appeared and still appears to me that the rate of interest is the kernel of the whole matter in dispute. It is for that reason that I have traced the history of the funds, specially in relation to the question of interest.\nIf the appellants can maintain the proposition that the Dominion is bound to pay interest at the rate of five per centum per annum on these funds until Ontario directs otherwise, it means, under modern economic conditions, that an interminable annuity has been created, as the result of the history I have recounted, in favour of the appellant at the expense, to a very material extent, of the Dominion, without any consideration therefor, and without any contract therefor, either express or implied, and solely by and through a legislative accident.\nCan this be? Can it ever have been intended that the substitution of one trustee or quasi trustee for another whose existence was terminated by this same Act that created the obligor and the obligation, should become bound to benefit the appellant thus at the expense of other provinces?\nIt seems unnecessary to labour with such a proposition.\nCounsel for Ontario did not seem desirous of pushing their client's claim so far.\nBut why stop short of that if there is no relief for the Dominion save by the consent of Ontario?\nIf the province is entitled to exact five per cent. until its assent is given the position it holds is so clearly and so substantially advantageous to it that it may safely be assumed assent never will be given.\nAny interpretation of section 111 that would be so strained as to produce results contrary to justice, and foreign to the probable intention of the parties to the compact, upon which the British North America Act, 1867, rests, must be guarded against. The express language of the section will not justify such results.\nEven if the section can be so read as to cast upon the Dominion at least the investment part of the bur-then of executing the trust, as to which I express no opinion, surely that cannot carry with it unless expressly so declared the duty of finding an investment at five per centum per annum.\nIt formed no part of these trusts as originally constituted that the self-constituted trustee should pay five per cent. Their history shews no fixed rate of interest, save when Upper Canada issued debentures at six per cent., and by its legislation constituted King's College Council Managers of the Grammar School Fund for a short time and then directed investment in such debentures.\nThe interest varied from time to time. It was six, or five, or less, as accident of investment brought.\nOfficers of the Crown, without statutory authority therefor, fixed it at five per cent., because that was the then prevailing \"Public interest.\"\nCan the successor to such a trusteeship, even if we are to treat the Dominion as a trustee, be expected to find more than the market value of the money will bring? And bring by investment a trustee can justify?\nUnless the trust can be clearly shewn to be by virtue of the terms of its creation one that must produce five per cent. to the cestui que trust and the liability thus created fall within section 111 as a liability to be met by the Dominion ; or a contract can be shewn to so bind the Dominion ; I fail to see any right the province has to claim five per cent. in perpetuity.\nI would be disposed to think that a contract of that kind must be sanctioned by Parliament before it could bind. I cannot find that there has ever been a contract express or implied binding the Dominion to pay five per cent. per annum in perpetuity.\nOf course so long as the Dominion uses the money as has been done, and the user has not ceased, the rate must, if the principles that usually govern the conduct of ordinary trustees is applicable, be the legal rate of five per cent.\nFor these reasons I am unable to assent to declaring in this regard as the province has prayed for.\nWhen we pass to the question of whether or not there has been created any contract express or implied of a less extensive purport, what do we find?\nWe have between these parties a relationship of nearly forty years' duration arising either contractually (if such relation could exist) or as a recognized mode, in accord with the creation of these trusts, whereby the Dominion was discharging a statutory obligation in regard thereto, by paying half yearly interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, recognized as binding by old Canada in administering the trust when the obligation of that province was transferred, and imposed upon the Dominion.\nThe principle that the reasonable expectations raised by a mode of dealing over long periods ought not to be disappointed, has found solution in many cases by the law imputing as part of the contract an obligation to continue until a definite time had been fixed by notice of the termination of the dealing fixing time therefore either according to the expiration of what would be a reasonable time or a recognized legal period of time. Without discussing what would be a reasonable time to be inferred here as part of the contract, I may point out that the Finance Minister evidently realized this principle and suggested six months hence from the time of notice. That notice he gave has failed and I think properly so. The correspondence since has furnished no substitution therefor, but ended in three days' notice. If the position declared in the court below be correct notice never was necessary. I cannot look at the matter so. I would not look at it so if similar questions had arisen, as arise here, between private individuals.\nThe necessity for clear, explicit notice is, I can see, much greater here where so large a sum of money and so important a trust and so many questions of a difficult character have to be considered and settled.\nMoreover the constitutional principles that must be held to govern the conduct of the Ontario ministers in a matter of this kind rendered it impossible for them to deal with and determine what should be done on three days' notice, in relation to the acceptance or rejection of the proposal tentatively made by the Minister of Finance.\nThe province had, by 33 Vict. ch. 9, sec. 5, enacted what should be done with the income, but no similar or any provision ever appears to have been made for the corpus of these trust funds.\nAssuming the Minister of Finance armed with the necessary Parliamentary authority to make such proposals, upon which the argument has not so enlightened us as to make his position in that regard clear beyond doubt, it seems to me his proposals must under such circumstances fail of present effect unless assented to by Ontario ministers authorized to deal with the matter as proposed. It was urged that these sums of money were and always had been from the time of the award in 1870 declaring the funds \"to be the property of, and to belong to the Province of Ontario, for the purposes for which they were established\" simple debts due from\nthe Dominion to Ontario ; as if from a banker to his customer. Neither the history of the funds nor the respective character of the trusts first and secondly referred to, nor the language used can justify such an assumption.\nThese funds might well be, within the language of the award, the property of Ontario, yet held for that province in trust, for the purposes for which the trusts were established.\nIt may be but a form that the representatives of the people are asked to sanction every important step of ministers in the conduct of the business of the Crown but these forms, that seem to some but mere forms, to be set aside at will, are constituted law that bind ministers and Crown alike and have secured and still secure the liberties of the people.\nThe questions raised of what is meant by the terms of these trusts or either of them ; the nature of the obligation resting upon the Dominion relative thereto by virtue of section 111 of British North America Act, 1867 ; the discharge of the Dominion from such obligation ; the effect of the award in 1870, between the provinces in settling or solving that obligation ; the determination of what the award means in using the words I have quoted ; the want of some constituted authority on behalf of Ontario to receive and discharge and take charge of such a trust; are by the contentions of the respondent apparently of no consequence but to be solved by the treasurer of assistant-treasurer of Ontario or a marked cheque handed to him and which practically it is declared below it would be his duty to accept.\nMatters of infinitely less importance than a combination of all these questions, raised as they are by the proposal of the Finance Minister, are daily deferred until the people have by their representatives passed thereon.\nThe minister who would have dared without the sanction of the legislature to have transferred and perhaps transformed trust funds that by the sanction of the Legislature had been administered for over thirty years in one way, that is by leaving the fund in a safe place beyond the personal control of any provincial minister, at interest, would I venture to think have deserved the censure of that Legislature.\nIt seems to me that until the province has in a proper constitutional method shewn it is ready to receive \"for the purposes for which they were established\" as awarded, the moneys thereby payable it could not claim from the Dominion such payment.\nUntil it does so the Dominion must, in my opinion, remain the custodian of these funds. What its duties may become merely as such forms no part of this case calling for our decision.\nThe Upper Canada Land Improvement Fund is so different in origin and character that it may not stand on the same footing in this regard as the other funds.\nThey have all, however, been treated as regards the proffered payment as if one and the same and hence for the present must stand disposed of here in the same way.\nI am therefore unable to uphold the declaration made in the court below and think the judgment in that regard should be reversed.\nIt is to be observed that the case presents many novelties. When the rights were created upon which the parties rest, there was no court to determine which might be right or wrong. When we look at it as a case of the Crown against the Crown it is anomalous indeed.\nWhen we try to grasp the principles that must guide us we find those principles of law that govern individuals in their several relations in many respects apt for the purpose. They do not, however, cover the whole ground.\nWhen we reflect for a moment, we find that to apply only these principles to the adjustment of the rights of independent provinces, or of an independent province and the Dominion, we find we are face to face with problems requiring other considerations and for which we have no precedent. If the ordinary constitutional principles we have been accustomed to deal with fail to cover the whole ground, when we seek for precedents amongst those who are governed by a federal system, and the fundamental principles of our English law, and have developed those principles and those of constitutional government in relation to the rights of federated states inter se, we are warned by the recent case of Webb v. Outrim[2] how much the Crown may stand for in our federal system.\nI have, following the lines of argument before us, treated the matter in part as if in law there could be a contract, and as if in fact there were a contract, though obviously it is an assumption of the Crown, contracting with the Crown. I have reasoned as if there might be and as if there were a trust created in fact, and in law, and as if we could bring to and within our jurisdiction a partial supervision of the < execution of such a trust.\nIn Kinloch v. Secretary of State for India[3] at pages 625 and 626, Lord Selborne explained and justified the application of the word \"trust\" in such a connection and drew the line between the lower trust that the Court of Chancery could administer and the higher which lies beyond its jurisdiction.\nThe Crown or Crown and the High Court of Parliament, must respectively, as occasion calls for, control and administer the so-called higher trusts, and may confide such part of the control or administration thereof as either or both may respectively see fit, in regard to such cases, to such authority as deemed fit.\nThe trusts in question here are clearly of these higher trusts, and we are given jurisdiction by the following section 72 of the Exchequer Court Act in R.S.C. 1906:\n32. When the legislature of any Province of Canada has passed an Act agreeing that the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction in cases of controversies:\u2014\n(a) Between the Dominion of Canada and such province;\n(b) Between such province and any other province or provinces which have passed a like Act; the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction to determine such controversies.\n2. An appeal shall lie in such cases from the Exchequer Court to the Supreme Court.\nAnd the same has also been enacted by R.S.O.1897, ch. 49.\nThis section does not trouble with such difficulties as suggested above, but in a most drastic manner imposes on the court below and on us, the duty of settling the controversy whether arising from contract or trust. The principles upon which the administration of trusts proceed are better applicable to our settling the controversy than by acting upon a supposed contract of the Crown with the Crown especially as all that in fact appears to have the element of contract in it is applicable to solving the question, assuming we do proceed on the basis of a trust.\nThere has been no question raised, and the case was argued without reference to the peculiar features of the Crown's relation thereto which I have adverted to.\nI think the cross-appeal fails. I do not think this a case for costs.\nThe appeal should be allowed without costs to the extent of rescinding para. 3 of the formal judgment of the court below, and declaring that the declaration asked for by the statement of claim cannot be made as asked.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion of my brother Davies.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the reasons given by Mr.\nJustice Burbidge in the court below.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: \u00c6milius Irving.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

A. Archambault K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014By virtue of a special assessment made in connection with the widening of St. James street, and which became due and exigible on the 14th March, 1898, the appellant, as a proprietor interested in the work of improvement, was indebted to the city in the sum of $3,788.02, with interest, as claimed from the first of April, 1898. To recover these sums an action was brought by the city on the 4th February, 1902. To this action the defendant pleaded the prescription of three years and the current year under section 120 of the city charter then in force, 52 Vict. ch. 79.\nBy special answer the city alleged interruption of prescription, but this was not insisted upon and may now be considered as withdrawn.\nThe question to be determined on the pleadings is as to the meaning of the words \"within three years in addition to the current year\" to be found in section 120, which section reads thus:\n120. The right to recover any tax, assessment or water-rate under this Act is prescribed and extinguished, unless the city within three years, in addition to the current year, to be counted from the time at which such tax, assessment or water-rate became due, has commenced an action for the recovery thereof, or initiated legal proceedings for the same purpose under the provisions of this Act; and the privilege securing such tax, assessment, or water-rate avails to the city, notwithstanding any lapse of time for the recovery of any sum which may, by any judgment, be awarded to the city, for such tax, assessment or water-rate; provided that in case any special assessment is made payable by annual instalments, the prescription runs only from the expiry of each such instalment.\nThe Superior Court, Taschereau J., held that the action was brought en temps utile, that is to say, within the time fixed by this section, and on appeal this judgment was confirmed.\nWe are, much to our regret, deprived of the advantage of reading the notes of the judges who sat in the case below, and who must have given the question much careful consideration. Although somewhat in-artistically expressed, I am of opinion that the intention of the legislature, so far as I can gather it from the words used, was to give the city a right to recover the amount of the assessment by suit brought within three years from the time at which it became due in addition to the year then current. The three years are to be counted in addition to the current year as I read the statute. Which is the current year to which the three calendar years are to be added? Surely the year current when the tax became due and not the year then beginning. The word \"year\" used alone means a calendar year. Gibson v. Barton[2] page 329 ; and \"current year\" means the year running \u2014passing\u2014current\u2014on its progress : Ann\u00e9e courante celle qui est en voie de s'accomplir (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vol. 3, No. 1729).\nCan we hold that the Quebec legislature intended two terms which have such distinct meaning as current year and calendar year to be interpreted as convertible.\nThe tax became due and exigible on the 14th March, 1898, when the special assessment roll, as finally revised, was deposited in the treasurer's office. Section 231 of the charter. And the year current when the tax was due was for purposes of taxation the year beginning May, 1897, and ending May, 1898.\nIn the City of Montreal v. Cantin[3], Taschereau C.J. says at page 228, construing the same statute:\nHere the statute decrees not merely that the assessment became due but also that it may be recovered immediately after the deposit of the roll creating the debt, and gives the remedy, the right to collect it immediately. And when it adds that the prescription runs from the date that the assessment became due, using the same expression, or when payable by instalments from the date of the expiry of each such instalment, that cannot but be construed as if it said, in so many words, that the prescription runs from the date of the deposit of the roll, or from the expiry of each instalment, if any.\nThis is a special tax payable once and for all, and prescription runs from the date of the deposit of the roll as it would run in the case of a tax payable by instalments from the expiry of each instalment.\nOn page 2 of their factum, the respondents say:\nTake the case of an annual assessment or tax imposed and levied, we will say, for the period of time comprised between the 1st of May of one year and the 1st of May of the next and becoming due, as the majority of taxes do, on the 1st day of November, the city would have the right to sue for three full years of such annual assessment as well as for the year current at the time of the institution of the action; thus, an annual tax or assessment which became due on the 1st of May, 1898, would not be prescribed until the 1st of November, 1902, that is, the city at any time between the 1st November, 1901, and the 1st November, 1902, could take action for the amount of the assessment which became due on the 1st November, 1898, as well as for any assessments in subsequent intermediate years, in addition to the current year.\nI cannot quite understand what this paragraph means. If the tax became due on the 1st May, 1898, prescription would begin to run from that date and an action could then be taken for the recovery of the amount of the taxes unless some provision in the city charter postponed payment until November. No such provision has been pointed out to us and I have not been able to find any. I repeat however that in my opinion the words \"current year\" in section 120, mean the year current at the time the tax became due. It is immaterial in so far as this case goes whether it is the current year for taxation purposes May, 1897, to May, 1898, or the fiscal year which is the same as the calendar year, 1st January, 1898, to 1st January, 1899. In one case the current year would end May 1st, 1898, and in the other January 1st, 1899; and in either alternative therefore the three years would have expired either May 1st, 1901, or January 1st, 1902. The action brought in February, 1902 was beyond the term. To hold otherwise is to refuse to give effect to the words \"current year,\" and to say that when the legislature used the words \"three years and the current year\" it meant four calendar years, and the four years must be counted from the day the tax became due.\nThe natural and ordinary meaning of the word \"current\" used in this connection, is running\u2014moving \u2014flowing\u2014passing\u2014present in its course as the current month or year : ( Century Dictionary).\nThe question we must answer is, what was the year running\u2014passing\u2014current in its progress when the tax became due in March, 1898, not what was the year then beginning. I repeat the answer is either the year fixed by the municipality for taxation purposes or the then calendar year.\nIt is unnecessary to say that the sense in which a word is used is to be gathered from the context, and one of the most elementary rules of construction requires that effect must be given if possible to every word, clause or sentence in a section. Undoubtedly three years means three calendar years, and if the legislature meant four calendar years why not have substituted the word four for the word three, but having used the words \"current year\" instead must we not say that it was obviously their intention by these words to refer to the year then running. If the legislature used the word \"current\" to qualify year, must it not presumably have been for some purpose to which we must give effect.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGirouard J.\u2014The old charter of the City of Montreal in force at the time the proceedings in this cause took place, 52 Vict. ch. 79, sec. 120, provides that \"the right to recover any tax, assessment, or water rate, under this Act, is prescribed and extinguished, unless the city, within three years, in addition to the current year, to be counted from the time at which such tax, assessment or water rate became due, has commenced an action,\" etc. The judges of both courts below have held that the \"current year\" means the year of the institution of the action. I am inclined to agree with them, especially in view of section 117, granting a privilege upon the land assessed. That section declares that\nsuch privilege does not extend beyond the amounts due for three years, that is to say, for the year when such claim is made, and for the three years next preceding that year.\nI think that these two clauses of the charter must be read together; at least one helps the other; and if any doubt exists in section 120, section 117 removes it. Practically, the city has four years to sue for taxes or assessments, and in this case the action was taken in due time.\nThe expression \"current year\" is not unique in the legislation of the Province of Quebec. It is to be found in arts. 2122, 2123 and 2124 of the Civil Code, and it is remarkable that the above interpretation had been adopted by the courts and commentators. Macdonald v. Nolin[4]; Troplong, Priv. Hyp. n. 698, ter; 3 Aubry et Rau, 4th ed., par. 285, 698.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014The determination of this appeal depends upon the proper construction of section 120 of 52 Vict. ch. 79 (1889) of the Province of Quebec. That statute was the city's charter at the time of the assessment and levying of the special tax now in dispute. The section reads:\nThe right to recover any tax, assessment or water-rate under this Act is prescribed and extinguished unless the city within three years in addition to the current year to be counted from the time at which said tax, assessment or water-rate became due has commenced an action for the recovery thereof or initiated legal proceedings for the same purpose under the provisions of this Act; and the privilege securing such tax, assessment or water-rate avails to the city, notwithstanding any lapse of time, for the recovery of any sum which may, by any judgment, be awarded to the city, for such tax, assessment or water-rate; provided that in case any special assessment is made payable by annual instalments, the prescription runs only from the expiry of each instalment.\nMuch ingenuity was exercised in trying to give a limited meaning to the words of the section both with respect to the kind of taxes whether special as well as general to which it was applicable, as also to the time within which the city could recover the tax. I think the controlling words of the section are the words I have italicized above \"to be counted from the time at which the said tax, assessment or water rate became due.\" Those words interpret, define and make certain what otherwise might be held indefinite and uncertain, namely, the meaning of the words \"current year\" excluding the idea that they could mean either the \"city financial year\" or the \"calendar year\" as alternately suggested, and covering ordinary as well as special taxes or assessments. They make, in my opinion, that quite plain which in their absence might be doubtful, namely, exactly what \"current year\" meant, and the exact time it covered in each case by arbitrarily fixing its commencement, namely, the day the tax became due. The reason, no doubt, for such a definition was the fact that the special and general taxes fell due on different days. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Girouard.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed.\nWhatever may have been the motive or reason for expressing the law limiting actions for the recovery of taxes and rates by the defendant corporation in the language which has been used, I think that language does not admit of the construction contended for by the appellant.\nThe section in question declares that the right to recover is extinguished, unless the city, within three years, in addition to the current year, to be counted from the time at which the tax becomes due has commenced an action, etc. I think it is impossible to contend or hold that the current year here mentioned commences otherwise than as expressed, namely, at the time when the tax becomes due.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I dissent from the judgment of the majority of the court for the reasons stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaudin, Loranger & St.\nGermain.

The defendants denied liability, counterclaimed for damages for breach of the condition of the contract and charged the plaintiffs with having sold a quantity of similar pills to certain persons who had infringed their trade-mark and with having participated, with these persons, in a fraudulent conspiracy to injure the defendants' business. The learned trial judge maintained the plaintiffs' action in part, without costs, maintaining the incidental demand in respect to damages sustained by loss of profits through the wrongful sale of the pills and for expenses in obtaining evidence as to breach of contract, with costs, but disallowed certain other expenses incurred in the prosecution of the conspirators by the defendants, and he also found that the plaintiffs had not participated in the conspiracy.\nThe Court of King's Bench affirmed this judgment, and the plaintiffs appealed.\nThe majority of the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Davies and Maclennan JJ. dissented in respect to the damages allowed on the incidental demand for loss of profits alleged to have been sustained in consequence of the sale of the pills supplied in breach of the contract.\nThe following notes of reasons for the judgment were delivered.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the court below.\nGirouard J.\u2014This case involves only questions of fact decided by two courts. The respondents charge fraud against the appellants ; it has been found by the two courts below, and I do not think that the evidence would justify me in disturbing their findings. For that reason, I do not feel disposed to quarrel with the principles they applied to assess the damages. Arts. 1065, 1073, 1074 C. C.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the court of appeal for the Province of Quebec confirming a judgment of Mr. Justice Archibald of the Superior Court in favour of the appellants for the sum of $413.67 and condemning each party to pay his own costs.\nThe amount of the judgment given in favour of the plaintiff was reached by allowing him $2,435.33 for goods sold and delivered to the defendants (respondents) and deducting therefrom a, sum of $2,021.66 for damages claimed to have been sustained by the defendants by reason of a breach of contract made between the parties by which the plaintiffs received a private formula from the defendants for the manufacture of a particular pill and agreed not to manufacture and sell pills from the formula to others than the defendants.\nThe items which were found by the trial judge as damages were for\nLoss of profits on a quantity of these pills\nmanufactured and sold by plaintiffs to one\nGauvreau and his associates............................... $1,586.66\nExpenses paid by defendants in employing\ndetectives and analysts in finding out\nthe necessary facts......................................................435.00\n$2,021.66 There was some argument on the appeal as to the correctness of the amount found in plaintiffs' favour of $2,435.33 it being contended on his behalf that they were entitled to a much larger amount for pills which they were in process of manufacturing for defendants, but which were not delivered to them owing to their breaking off business relations with plaintiffs on discovery of the latters' breach of their contract. On this point, however, we were all of opinion that the judge's findings were correct and should not be disturbed.\nThe questions in dispute were thus reduced down to those arising out of the defendants' counter claim for damages.\nThese naturally divide themselves into two, first the claim for defendants' expenditure in employing detectives to discover and discovering through their own agency the fact that plaintiffs had manufactured and sold pills from their private formula to other parties (one Gauvreau a chemist and his associates) and the expenses paid by them to analysts to analyze the pills so sold in order to prove that they were made from their private formula. Secondly, damages in the nature of loss of profit claimed by reason of the subsequent sale of the pills by Gauvreau and his associates to the public in wrappers counterfeiting defendants' trade mark.\nWith regard to the first items amounting to $435 I am of opinion that they were properly allowed because I think there was a contract proved between the parties of which the plaintiffs were guilty of a breach and these expenses were under the circumstances necessary and legitimate in view of the fact that plaintiffs when charged with the breach emphatically denied the facts through their manager and threw the onus upon defendants of proving them. That the manager's denial may have been hasty and bon\u00e0 fide when made with the knowledge he then had can avail nothing in the light of the facts subsequently proved that the alleged sales had been made.\nThe evidence of Brick, plaintiffs' manager, is conclusive as to the existence of the contract claimed by defendants because he frankly states, that all their trade circulars issued to the public contained the explicit statements and assurances that\nprivate formulae entrusted to our temporary care are treated and handled in the strictest confidence in manufacture. Numbers and not names are invariably used.\nIt was on these assurances defendants contracted with them and the sales made by them (even if inadvertent and unintentional) to the chemist Gauvreau and his associates were in breach of such contract.\nThe other main question argued was as to the plaintiffs' liability to pay the damages claimed by defendants by reason of the sales to the public by Gauvreau and his associates of a portion at least of the 300,000 or more pills sold to them by plaintiffs. Can these alleged damages be held in any way under the facts as proved to be the direct result of plaintiffs' breach of contract?\nThe parties Gauvreau and others who purchased these pills from the defendants did so according to the evidence alike of Gauvreau, who ordered the pills, and Pineo, the plaintiffs' agent in Montreal, who received the orders from him and transmitted them to the plaintiffs in Toronto as \"Blaud's Nux Vomica No. 4 pill,\" a standard preparation which if it had been supplied would have been a sufficient answer to defendants' claim, they not having any special right or property in the formula. As the evidence shewed, however, the pills supplied Gauvreau and his associates contained the two additional ingredients which defendants had added to Blaud's Nux Vomica No. 4 pill and so came within the private formula of defendants supplied to the plaintiffs for manufacture. Whether this arose from carelessness or negligence matters not ; it was clearly such carelessness or negligence as under their contract with defendants they would be liable for, so far as any direct damages are concerned.\nBut Gauvreau, who bought the pills, had entered into a conspiracy with one Cloutier and others fraudulently to counterfeit the defendants' trade mark, enclosed the pills in boxes similar to those in which defendants sold their pills, and wrapped them up in defendants' counterfeited trade-mark.\nThis alone would constitute a wrong as between Gauvreau and the defendants. A mere sale by the latter parties of the pill without any violation of defendants' trade-mark would not have rendered them liable to defendants. But, of course, without using and counterfeiting of the defendants' trade mark there would not probably have been any sales. There is no pretence under the evidence for saying that the plaintiffs were parties in any sense to these fraudulent sales or fraudulent attempts to sell. On the contrary the criminals themselves, who were afterwards indicted and punished for their crimes expressly in their evidence in this suit exonerated Pineo, plaintiffs' agent, from any complicity in or knowledge of their intended fraud and Pineo's evidence is to the same effect.\nThere is no evidence to the contrary and the learned trial judge, speaking of the only bit of evidence which could be urged as supporting the contention of plaintiffs' complicity in the violation of defendants' trade-mark by Gauvreau and his associates, says :\nIn this case I am not prepared to say that the plaintiffs in applying the red colour to the pills sold by them to Gauvreau, Massicotte and Cloutier did apply a false description to these goods within the meaning of the article of the Criminal Code or did violate the trade-mark of the defendants.\nI therefore, come to the conclusion that the expense of the defendants in convicting the parties of forgery of their trade-mark in which forgery the plaintiffs took no part other than the rendering it possible, as above pointed out, cannot be charged against the plaintiffs.\nIn these findings I entirely concur and while I agree with the learned judge in striking out of defendants' claim the counsel fees paid by them in the prosecution of the fraudulent counterfeiters for counterfeiting defendants' trade mark, I cannot see on what principle these fraudulent sales under these counterfeited trade marks can in any way be held to give rise to a claim for damages against the plaintiffs who were not in any way parties to the fraud.\nIn the chain of events which led up to the fraudulent sales by Gauvreau and his associates the plaintiffs were parties to the extent of furnishing the goods. But they knew nothing whatever of the contemplated fraud and it certainly cannot be inferentially imputed to them in the face of the explicit denials of Pineo, their agent, on the one hand and of all the conspirators on the other.\nThe judgment of the court of appeal seems to proceed upon the ground stated by Lavergne J. that \"the fraud was perfectly proved.\" So it was as against all the conspirators. But certainly not as against the plaintiffs, who in the words of the finding of the trial judge, did not \"violate the defendants' trade mark\" and \"took no part\" in the conspirators' forgery. At the utmost they did something, sold the pills, which enabled the purchasers without their knowledge subsequently to commit a crime.\nPeople are not supposed to commit crimes and the protection against them is not the vigilance of the parties excluding the possibility of committing them, but the law of the land. See the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Colonial Bank v. Marshall[1], at pp. 567-8, where the authorities are referred to.\nThe damages, if any, sustained by defendants were so sustained because of sales by Gauvreau and his associates of a quantity of pills sold in boxes similar to those used by defendants and wrapped in the latter's trade-mark which Gauvreau et al. had counterfeited.\nAs I have shewn the plaintiffs were in no way parties to this fraud nor can it be imputed to them from the only fact which at all connects them with Gauvreau et al., namely, that they sold him 300,000 or more of these pills and that such sale was a violation of their contract with defendants.\nSuch criminal action of Gauvreau's from which defendants suffered was, it is true, a sequence of the improper sale by plaintiffs to Gauvreau, but in no way a consequence of such sale.\nThey cannot be presumed to have had any knowledge of Gauvreau's criminal intentions as to the counterfeiting and use of defendants' trade-mark, which alone enabled him to make the sales and so damage defendants; on the contrary the evidence negatives such presumption.\nThese damages therefore not being the direct and proximate cause of the plaintiffs breach of their contract with defendants are not recoverable against plaintiffs.\nThe result would be that the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court of appeal and the judgment of the Superior Court confirmed by the court of appeal amended by disallowing the $1,586 allowed for damages for loss of profits on the alleged fraudulent sales of pills, leaving a balance in favour of plaintiffs of $2,000.43 for which judgment should be entered for them.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court on the question of costs to stand.\nIdington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge and in the court below, I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smith, Markey & Skinner.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brosseau & Holt.\n[1] [1906] A.C. 559.\n"}

V. Mott, Esq., Fernie, B.C.:\u2014 Re sale to you of mill site.\u2014Dear Sir:\u2014The Crow's Nest Pass Coal Company hereby agree to sell to you a piece of land at or near Hosmer Station, on the Crow's Nest line, to contain at least one hundred acres of land, at the price of $5.00 per acre; payable as follows: When title issued to purchaser, title to be given as soon as the company is in a position to do so. Purchaser to have possession at once. The land to be as near as possible as shewn on the annexed sketch plan. Yours truly, W. Fernie, \"Land Commissioner.\"\u2014The lands claimed were not those shewn on the sketch plan but other lands alleged to have been substituted therefor by verbal agreement with another employee of the defendant company, at the time of survey.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (12 B.C. Rep. 433) but on different grounds, that specific performance could not be decreed in the absence of any proof of authority of the agent to sell the lands of the defendant company, and that the mere fact of investing their employee with the title of \"Land Commissioner\" did not estop the defendants from denying his power to sell lands.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of Morrison J. by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe facts of the case and questions at issue on this appeal sufficiently appear from the head-note and the judgments now reported.\nNesbitt K.C. and Deacon for the appellants.\nMarsh K.C. and J.A. Macdonald K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I concur for the reasons given in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument I was of the opinion that this appeal was a hopeless one.\nThe action was one for specific performance and the contract relied upon to bind the company was a letter written to one Mott, plaintiff's assignor, by an official of the company who signed himself \"W. Fernie, Land Commissioner.\" The letter purported to agree to sell to Mott a piece of land at or near Hosmer Station on the Crow's Nest line to contain at least 100 acres of land at the price of $5 per acre, and contained the following:\nThe land to be as near as possible as shewn on annexed sketched plan.\nNow as a fact the plan of the piece of land as surveyed by plaintiffs produced in evidence and a conveyance of which was sought to be enforced shewed a plot of land, alike it is true in acreage, but altogether different in its boundaries from the land shewn on the sketch plan attached to Fernie's letter. It was contended on the appellants' part that Tonkin, a general manager of the company, had subsequently orally authorized a survey to be made of the lands for which specific performance was sought to be enforced under the alleged agreement made by the land commissioner, Fernie.\nI am quite unable to put any construction upon the evidence with respect to Tonkin's position or powers, or as to what he told the surveyor when he was going to make the survey which would justify the court in assuming or concluding that Tonkin had made or intended to make or had authority for making a new agreement entirely altering the boundaries of the lands referred to in Fernie's letter relied upon as a binding agreement. I do not see how it is possible to construct a binding agreement against the company by combining Tonkin's statement with Fernie's letter and substituting for the lands described in the letter other quite different lands.\nOn this ground alone the action would fail. But I fully agree with respondents' contention that there was no evidence shewing any authority in Fernie to bind the company to any agreement for the sale of their lands or of any other lands excepting perhaps it might be in the town-site of Fernie, or any evidence by which the company held him out to the person to whom the letter was written or to the public as one who possessed such authority.\nThe respondents were not a land company and had not authorized any one to sell the lands which they were acquiring from the railway company and they had never offered so far as appeared any lands for sale outside of their town-site lots. Whatever author- ity to sell lands Fernie may have had on the date of the; writing by him of the letter relied upon was confined to the town site and it is not contended that these lands in question were within these confines.\nFernie it is alleged did make a sale of a lot within the town site to one Mott but that was not until some months after the alleged agreement in this case.\nThen is there anything in the agreement that the company by investing him with the title of \"Land Commissioner\" necessarily and in absence of other evidence estopped themselves from denying his power to sell their lands? I do not think so. I do not think the title necessarily implies any such power and under the facts of this case I cannot find any good grounds for supporting the agreement arising out of estoppel. I agree with respondents' counsel that in itself and apart from other evidence the title has no legal significance and that at any rate it does not per se imply an authority to sell lands. No such extrinsic. evidence was given. See Hobbs v. Esquimault and Nanaimo Ry. Co.[2].\nFor these reasons and without expressing any opinion on the point as to its having been a condition of the agreement for sale that Mott should build a mill upon the property at any early date and that he abandoned all idea of doing so, I think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI do not find any authority for Mr. Fernie to bind the company to such an agreement. Not do I find any evidence of his having been so held out by the company as their agent to sell the lands in question as to entitle the appellants to claim relief as the result thereof.\nThe uncertainty of the land in respect of which the negotiations were had, the want of identity of the lands referred to in the memorandum (even if it be otherwise sufficient to comply with the Statute of Frauds,) with those claimed, the want of authority in Tonkin to make a new agreement, and the legal impossibility, as it seems to me, to construct, as submitted to us, a case from what Tonkin said, coupled on to what Fernie wrote and did, and refer the acts of possession thereto so as to entitle the plaintiffs, if that case had been made on the pleadings, to relief on the ground of part performance of an oral contract, render the appeal hopeless.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

On appeal from the decision of the said court to the Supreme Court of Canada council for the City of Halifax contended that the proceedings were really an appeal against an assessment under the city charter, that no appeal lay therefrom to the Supreme Court of the Province, and, therefore, and because the proceedings did not originate in a superior court, the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada did not lie.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J., that as the appeal was from the final judgment of the court of last resort in the Province, this court had jurisdiction under the provisions of the Supreme Court Act and it could not be taken away by provincial legislation.\nPer Davies J.\u2014Provincial legislation cannot impair the jurisdiction conferred on this court by the Supreme Court Act. In this case the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia had jurisdiction under Order XXXIII., Rule 1 of the Judicature Act.\nPer Idington J.\u2014If the case was stated under the Judicature Act Rules the appeal would lie but not if it was a submission under the charter for a reference to a judge at request of a ratepayer.\nBy sec. 313 of the said charter (54 Vict. ch. 58) as amended by 60 Vict. ch. 44, \"Every insurance company or association, accident and guarantee company, established in the City of Halifax, or having any branch office, office or agency therein shall * * * pay an annual license fee as hereinafter mentioned. * * * Every other company, corporation, association or agency doing business in the City of Halifax (banks, insurance companies or associations, etc., excepted) shall * * * pay an annual license fee of one hundred dollars.\"\nHeld, that the words \"every other company\" in the last clause were not subject to the operation of the ejusdem generis rule but applied to any company doing business in the city. Judgment appealed from overruled on this point.\nA carriage company agreed with a dealer in Halifax to supply him with their goods and give him the sole right to sell the same, in a territory named, on commission, all monies and securities given on any sale to be the property of the company and goods not sold within a certain time to be returned. The goods were supplied and the dealer assessed for the same as his personal property.\nHeld, Davies and Maclennan JJ. dissenting, that the company was not \"doing business in the City of Halifax\" within the meaning of sec. 313 of the charter and not liable for the license fee of one hundred dollars thereunder.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (39 N.S. Rep. 403) affirmed, but reasons overruled.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] in favour of the defendants on a stated case.\nThe case stated and submitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was in the following terms:\n\"Stated Case.\n\"In re The Assessment of The McLaughlin Carriage Company, Limited, by The City of Halifax.\n\"The McLaughlin Carriage Company, Limited, an Ontario corporation entered into the following recited agreement with one A.

In case any vehicle so shipped shall not be returned, re-shipped, or sold and settled for in full within six months after the time of shipment, the dealer agrees to allow out of his commission an amount sufficient to pay interest at seven per cent. on the wholesale price of all vehicles unsold, or, if sold, on the balance remaining unsettled after the expiration of said six months until the same shall be fully paid.\n\"7th.\u2014The said company is not to be held responsible or liable for any charges express freight telegrams, or any other expenses whatever, except as authorized by the said company or traceable to their negligence or errors.

The company objects to pay such $100 special tax. The question for the court is, \"Is the company liable, under any Act or ordinance, to pay it\"?\nDated, Halifax, N.S., March 19th, 1906.\nF. H. Bell, Acting City Recorder, City of Halifax.\nW. F. O'Connor, Solicitor for McLaughlin Carriage Co., Ltd.\"\nThe Act under which the license fee of f 100 was imposed is sufficiently set out in the above head-note. The court below held that the \"Every other company, etc., doing business in the City of Halifax\" meant a company of the same kind as insurance companies previously mentioned in the Act and the McLaughlin Co. not being ejusdem generis was not liable to pay it.\nF. H. Bell for the appellants.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The facts of this case are stated fully in the notes of Sir Louis Davies.\nThe preliminary objection to the jurisdiction must be dismissed. The Legislature of Nova Scotia, with respect to this court, has no power to limit the right of appeal any more than it can confer jurisdiction. The only question to be considered by us is as to whether or not the judgment appealed from is the final judgment of the highest court of final resort in the province on a special case. If the case comes within the terms of our \"Supreme Court Act,\" as we hold it does, there the matter ends. Clarkson v. Ryan[2]. I agree with Sir Louis Davies that the doctrine of ejusdem generis has no application in the present case because the intention of the legislature is made abundantly clear by the language used. It is undoubtedly a general rule for the interpretation of statutes that, where particular words are followed by general words, the generality of the latter should be limited by reference to the former, but when the language used leaves no doubt as to the intention of the legislature, I see no reason why we should introduce a rule of construction to cut down the plain meaning of the words used in the statute. Section 313 of the city charter provides, in the first place, for the assessment of the real estate and personal property owned by insurance companies or associations, accident and guarantee companies established in the City of Halifax, or having any branch office or agency there, and for the payment, in addition, of an annual license fee which varies according to the nature of the business done by the company. The same section provides, in addition, for the assessment of the real estate and personal property owned by other companies, corporations, associations or agencies (excepting insurance companies or associations;) which are assessed under the first part of the section, and for the payment, in addition, of a license fee which differs from that imposed on the excepted companies.\nClearly the intention of the legislature was to distinguish the different classes of companies and make different provision for each class. That, is, in my opinion, the plain meaning of the statute and, if this construction is correct, the doctrine of ejusdem generis, as I said before, has no application.\nThe next question is as to whether or not the company was doing business in Halifax within the meaning of the section. It is to be borne in mind that, on this appeal, the question to be decided is whether or not the respondent company was obliged, in the circumstances, to pay an annual license fee of one hundred dollars. To decide this question, it is not necessary to consider whether or not the company was exercising a trade or carrying on a business for profit which would bring it within the cases decided as to the meaning of the Income Tax Acts.\nThe special case on which this appeal comes before us, after setting out in full the agreement between the respondent company and Melvin, the dealer at Halifax, contains the following paragraphs:\u2014\nIn pursuance of the terms of such agreement, the company shipped a number of carriages to said Melvin, who was a dealer in agricultural implements, etc., with premises on Bedford Row, Halifax, and while some of said carriages were on Melvin's premises, the same were assessed, together with other property on the premises, at the regular rate as private property of Mr. Melvin.\nMelvin had no other relation to the company than that created by the recited contract, but he exhibited a sign over his door, \"The McLaughlin's Carriage Company's Carriages.\"\nBesides assessing the stock as aforesaid to Melvin, the assessors have imposed upon the company a special tax of $100, as a company doing business within the city. The company objects to pay such $100 special tax. The question for the court is,\u2014Is the company liable, under any Act or ordinance, to pay it?\nIt does not appear that anything was ever sold by the respondents or that any business was ever done by them in the City of Halifax.\nThe facts, as disclosed by the agreement, briefly are:\u20141st. That Melvin, who is called the dealer, was appointed to sell, or rather solicit orders for the sale of, the finished vehicles of the company within the limite of the City and County of Halifax.\n2ndly. Orders were to be sent by the dealer to the office of the company, at Oshawa, in Ontario, where they might be filled or rejected at the option of the company.\n3rdly. When the orders were accepted, the goods were delivered free on the cars at Oshawa station:\u2014\n4thly. All goods shipped by the company to the dealer direct were to remain the absolute property of the company;\n5thly. The. dealer was paid by a commission equivalent to the difference between the wholesale price charged by the company and the retail price at which the vehicles were sold by the dealer who guaranteed all the sales;\n6thly. It does not appear that the goods in Melvin;s store were there for sale or merely as samples, or that they were intended to be delivered on sales entered into at the City of Halifax or on sales made in the county ;\n7thly. The company allowed the dealer for rent for the first year $50, or three per cent. of the business done, if it was more than $50.\nUnder these circumstances, it cannot be said that the company rented any definite portion of Melvin's premises or that they did or that they contemplated doing business in Halifax so as to come under the obligation to pay the license fee.\nTo send property into Halifax for the purpose of filling orders received at Oshawa or to execute orders received from purchasers in the county, is not doing business in Halifax within the meaning of section 313.\nMunicipal corporations cannot be allowed to impose burdens unless the authority to do so is clearly given them by law.\nMelvin was doing business in Halifax and part of the business for which he was taxed was the selling of respondents' carriages and, by the special case, it appears that he was assessed as owner of the carriages which he had in his possession.\nIt cannot be said that the company was obliged to take out a license to authorize Melvin to sell carriages for which he was assessed as owner. On the facts as stated in the special case, all that can be said is that Melvin was appointed to solicit orders, but I do not think it can be reasonably held that the company exercised or carried on business in the City of Halifax.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in a special case submitted to it by the parties in which judgment it was determined that the question asked as to the liability of the respondent company to pay a special annual tax or license fee as being a company doing business within the City of Halifax, should be answered in the negative and that the appellant should pay the costs.\nA preliminary objection was taken at the argument to our jurisdiction to hear the appeal but, after hearing counsel on the point and considering the rule of the \"Nova Scotia Judicature Act under which the special case was submitted a majority of this court was clearly of the opinion that the. objection must be disallowed and the case heard upon its merits.\nOur jurisdiction to hear appeals depends, of course, upon the \"Supreme Court Act\" and its amendments, and no legislation of the provincial legislatures could impair that jurisdiction. It did not seem to us, however, after reading order xxxiii, rule I., of the \"Judicature Act,\" that any reasonable doubt existed as to the power of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to hear and determine the question submitted to them on the facts of this special case, nor in fact was any such doubt suggested by the court below.\nThe decision appealed from was based entirely upon the application to the construction of section 313, as it now stands amended, of the charter of the City of Halifax, of the rule of construction sometimes applied to Acts of Parliament of doubtful meaning and known as the doctrine of ejusdem generis.\nI have carefully read and considered the section of the charter in question and am bound to say that I cannot understand how the rule of construction referred to can be invoked or applied with regard to that section so as to exclude the company, respondents, sought to be charged with this license fee.\nThe rule, when applicable at all, operates to cut clown and limit the otherwise plain meaning of general terms by reference to the terms and language of their immediate context. If the language of the statute had been \"every bank, fire insurance, life insurance or marine insurance company or other company doing business in the city shall pay a license fee of one hundred dollars\" it might, under the authorities, reasonably be contended that the rule of construction adopted by the court below applied and that the \"other companies\" to be subjected to the tax must be construed to be other companies of the same class as those enumerated if a common class was capable of being ascertained.\nBut the section is not framed in any such way, but in a way which, to my mind, prohibits the application of the ejusdem generis rule of construction altogether. In the first place, the annual license fees imposed upon marine or fire insurance companies is four times greater than that imposed upon life assurance, accident or guarantee companies or associations. Banks are dealt with in another section, 316, and are expressly exempted from this as are also other companies at the time of the enactment of the section \"exempt from taxation.\" Provision is made in the case of companies engaged in more than one branch of insurance business that they shall pay license fees for the two branches of insurance for which licenses are imposed, and exempting them altogether for the period of time when they are only winding up their business in Halifax and not doing any new business.\nThen follows the general independent sentence, now in controversy, relating to \"every other company\" specially exempting from its operation banks which are dealt with in a subsequent section, insurance companies previously dealt with and other companies \"exempt from taxation.\"\nI am utterly unable to accept the argument that, in such a clause and with reference to such general words so used their plain meaning could be cut down and limited by the arbitrary application of the doctrine of idem genus. The argument does not commend itself to me as reasonable and no authority was or could be cited in its support.\nThen respondents relied upon the contention that, under the special case as submitted, they could not be held to be a company \"doing business\" in Halifax within the section. I do not suppose there can be any difference between \"doing business,\" as used in this section, and \"carrying on business.\" The authorities seem to me conclusive against the respondents as I understand the facts and construe the special case. I have carefully read all the cases cited before us. All these cases before that of Grainger & Son v. Gough[3], in the House of Lords, were cited and reviewed in the decision of that case and the true principle which must be invoked as a .test to determine whether, in any case, a person or company can be said to be \"carrying on business\" laid down and acted upon. I think that principle is embodied clearly in the head-note to that case, which reads as follows :\u2014\nA foreign merchant, who canvasses through agents in the United Kingdom for orders for the sale of his merchandise to customers in the United Kingdom, does not exercise a trade in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts, so long as all contracts for the sale and all deliveries of the merchandise to customers are made in a foreign country.\nAs Lord Herschell says, at page 335:\nIn all previous cases contracts have been habitually made in this country. Indeed this seems to have been regarded as the principal test.\nAnd he then quotes with approval the rule as stated by the then Master of the Rolls, in Erichsen v. Last[4].\nWhenever profitable contracts are habitually made in England, by or for foreigners with persons in England because they are in England to do something for or supply something to those persons, such foreigners are exercising a profitable trade in England, even though everything to be done by them in order to fulfil the contracts is done abroad.\nLord Watson, in his judgment, pages 339-340, says:\u2014 In Werle & Co. v. Colquhoun[5], the decision of the Court of Appeal was based upon the express ground that the foreign wine merchant exercised his trade in England by making contracts there for the sale of his champagnes through his English agent. Erichsen v. Last[6], although it did not relate to the wine trade, was a decision of the same class.\nLord Davey, concurring with the majority of the law lords in their judgment, says, at page 346,\nthat all Mr. Roederer's sales to this English customers are made at Rheims for delivery in that place, and the goods sold are, in fact, delivered to the customers in Rheims,\nand further on he says he forbears commenting on the earlier cases because\nthey all differ in the vital respects that sales of goods were in those cases made in England.\nThe case cited in our court of The City of London v. Watt & Sons[7] seems to have been decided on the same principle and reasoning.\nNow, applying that principle to the facts of this case, I cannot see that there can be any doubt on the facts of the special case that the carriages, etc., sent by the respondents to their agent in Halifax were so sent for the purpose of being sold and delivered by that agent in such city to the purchasers there. The goods of the respondents were, by the very terms of the agreement, placed with their agent in Halifax for the purpose of sale and delivery by him, they retaining the property in the goods until sale, contributing towards the rent of the premises their agent occupied and providing that any sale made by the agent was to be made for the company respondent and any note for the price taken in their name and sent to them. The agent was to receive a commission only and every provision of the agreement goes to satisfy my mind that it was the respondent company which was carrying on business, it was their goods that were being sold and delivered in Halifax, it was there the contract was made and there delivery took place to the purchaser and it was there the purchase money was collected for them.\nAn objection was taken that the special case did not specifically state that any carriages had actually been sold and delivered by the agent. But the company were surely carrying on business just as much while their agent was engaged in the act of selling as they were a moment afterwards when the contract was completed. The goods of the respondents were in their agent's shop in Halifax, exposed for sale with the sign over the door, \"The McLaughlin Carriage Company's Carriages\" inviting the public to enter and buy, and it would, to my mind, be an unfair refinement upon the meaning of words to hold that, although they had sent their stock to their agent in Halifax to sell and he had entered into an agreement with them to sell the goods for them and actually exposed for sale with public notice over his door that they were respondents' carriages there was no carrying on of business until some purchaser had positively purchased one of the carriages. There is a carrying on of business, in my opinion, when the goods are exposed for sale in a business shop or store by a servant or agent authorized for the purpose and the public invited to buy. Some observations of Lord Herschell in the case of Grainger & Son v. Gough[8] above cited, at page 332, are pertinent. Speaking of the language used by one of the judges of the court of appeal, in that case, he says:\u2014\nAnother member of the court seems to have regarded the finding\" in the case that \"the appellants are agents in Great Britain for the sale of Roederer's wine\" as invoking a finding that sales by Roederer took place in this country. Standing by itself, the finding would probably have this meaning.\nIt is true that he finds that the whole facts of that case, when considered, shewed that the finding did not have such meaning. But, in this case, I cannot entertain any doubt, on the whole case, that the language of the case, read in the light of the agreement which forms part of it, justifies the finding that respondents were \"doing business\" in Halifax within the meaning of these words in the section of the charter before referred to.\nI would therefore reverse the finding of the court below, answer the question put in the affirmative and allow the appeal with costs in this court and the court below.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on what is said to be a stated case.\nThe so-called stated case is so meagre in what it presents as a case that I feel at a loss in dealing with it.\nIt is headed, as follows :\nStated Case.\nIn re, The Assessment of the McLaughlin Carriage Company, Limited, by the City of Halifax.\nThen follows, without note or remark of any kind, a copy of a long agreement between the respondents and one Melvin in relation to the terms upon which he agrees to sell goods of respondents' making. Then there follows:\nIn pursuance of the terms of such agreement, the company shipped a number of carriages to said Melvin, who was a dealer in agricultural\u2019 implements, etc., with premises on Bedford Row, Halifax, and, while some of said carriages were on Melvin's premises, the same were assessed, together with other property on the premises, at the regular rate as private property of Mr. Melvin.\nMelvin had no other relation to the company than that created by the recited contract, but he exhibited a sign over his door, \"The McLaughlin Carriage Company's Carriages.\"\nBesides assessing the stock to Melvin, the assessors have imposed upon the company a special tax of $100, as a company doing business within the city. The company objects to pay such $100 special tax. The question for the court is,\u2014\"Is the company liable, under any Act or ordinance, to pay it?\"\nDated, Halifax, N.S., March 19th, 1906.\nF. H. Bell,\nActing City Recorder, City of Halifax.\nW. F. O'Connor,\nSolicitor for McLaughlin Carriage Co., Limited.\nThat is what is called the stated case which we are expected to pass upon.\nIt so happens that the Nova Scotia statutes of 1891, ch. 58 sec. 313, called \"An Act to consolidate and amend the Acts relating to the City of Halifax\" provide for a stated case being submitted by the Assessment Court of Appeal which hears ratepayers' appeals from their assessments.\nCounsel for the respondents would, I think, have been right in his objections that the appeal would not lie if it had been, as he supposed, a submission under those provisions for referring at the request of a ratepayer to a judge. It would have fallen within the same class as The James Bay Railway Go. v. Armstrong[9], which we refused to hear last March. Assuming, as appellant's counsel shewed, that the statutory case was framed pursuant to order 33, Rule 1, of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia\/ the appeal may lie. The majority of this court have held so. I should have preferred further consideration of the matter. I think the stated case ought to have shewn upon its face clearly the authority for the court before which it is submitted to hear such a case in order that the very foundation of our jurisdiction and theirs should appear.\nIf the reference by the stated case were something in the nature of making the court, without authority, co-assessors of the City of Halifax, I should not hear it.\nIf, however, it was intended to raise some question, such as appears in the cases of The City of London v. Watt & Son[10], and The Toronto Railway Company v. The City of Toronto[11] approving the former and cases cited in both, it would be a proper case to submit, and for us to hear on appeal from the judgment thereon.\nSo long as the officers and courts specially designated to make and adjust assessments are, as they generally are, independent of, and as they ought to be, free from influence or direction by the municipal council, such a corporation has no right to interfere and, generally speaking, cannot be impleaded in any matter arising from a due discharge of the duty to be done by these special courts and officers.\nIn the meagre statement of this case, it is impossible to say how it came about, at what stage in the assessment proceedings, or in, or for what year, or at what time of the year the assessment in question was made, or if the city assessors or city had imposed the $100 as a rating, or city claims it in any way as a license fee, or raises the question of the right to assess a company, or corporation, or an agency, or because the company has an agency in Halifax or, in either case, is submitting an actual concrete case or merely an academic one.\nThe part of the sub-section 313 to which we have been referred and which we have to interpret, when amended, is as follows:\u2014\nEvery other company, corporation, association or agency doing business in the City of Halifax (banks, insurance companies or associations and other corporations now exempt from taxation excepted) shall be assessed in respect of the real estate and personal property owned by said company, corporation or association, in the same way as the other, ratepayers of the City of Halifax are assessed, and shall, in addition thereto, pay an annual license fee of one hundred dollars. If the amount of such assessment should exceed a sum equal to one per cent. on the paid-up capital of any such company or corporation, it shall be reduced to an amount equal to one per cent. on such paid-up capital, which sum shall include the license fee. Every plate-glass insurance company, and the boiler inspection and insurance company of Toronto, shall only pay, under this section, a license of twenty-five dollars.\nWith respect, I cannot think the ejusdem generis rule has anything to do with interpreting this part of section 313, which evidently was, or ought to have been, intended for an independent sub-section. I do not discard, however, the rest of the section or other sections in that part of the Act, as amended, in trying to get at the meaning of the part I have quoted.\nIf a license fee is what we have to deal with, why should it be called, in the stated case, a tax? Why should it have been mixed up with the assessment? A license may be referred to as a tax, but every tax by way of assessment is not necessarily a license fee. The legislation blending these subject matters together is objectionable and makes the statute obscure. That obscurity is not removed but increased by the mode the case is framed.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Russell that the statute imposing a tax must be construed strictly and should be expressed by clear and explicit language.\nDo the words \"agency\" and \"doing business\" in the City of Halifax mean such a business as Mr. Melvin seems to carry on, or something else? He seems a sort of general agent and selling carriages is only one of the many things his agency business covers. I cannot help reading the word \"agency\" here as being applicable to that sort of agency Mr. Melvin himself is carrying on. Yet, I cannot imagine that he is the kind of party the City of Halifax is in pursuit of.\nIt is quite likely that when the city induced the legislature to frame this section as it is, the intention was to reach companies outside of Halifax, which had agencies engaged solely, or substantially only doing business for them in the City of Halifax.\nClearly, if this latter was, as I imagine, what was intended, the intention has not been expressed, and I have no right to interpret by my imagination but by what is said.\nAgain, the license fee is to be \"in addition\" to other rates imposed and seems to imply that it is applicable to such company or agency as may have such a footing in Halifax as to be assessed for some property. I think the test of whether the company to be reached was doing business of that substantial character as to be possessed of assessable property may well be considered. The company here in question does not seem ever to have had any property in Halifax to be assessed. The carriages have been assessed to Mr. Melvin, as the case shews.\nFor these reasons alone, I would be unable to find that the company in question came within the meaning of the Act.\nAgain, if we take the words \"doing business\" literallly, any company owning and assessed for a small lot in Halifax and getting a horse shod in that city might be accused of \"doing business\" there and require a license of $100 for the privilege of thus \"doing business.\"\nIf these suggested interpretations be supposed fanciful, I can only say they are no more so than that which the appellant asks us to adopt. We are not, as in some cases, bound to find the true meaning. If we cannot find that this remarkable section means in law what the appellant claims, the matter ends.\nLet us turn to the agreement and assume that the words \"doing business\" were intended to cover the case of a company carrying on business in Halifax, either as having its home and head-quarters there, or by establishing a business that might reasonably be treated as a branch or agency of a home business elsewhere. The agreement provides a means of selling goods to Mr. Melvin of Halifax, at Oshawa, to be by him re-sold in Halifax City or the County of Halifax, and, at the same time, securing payment therefor. Such seems to me the end of the transaction. He sells for such prices as he sees fit, for cash, or on credit, as he sees fit; but, if on credit, he must take notes to be approved of, and of a specific character, as security to the company; for he remains liable for the prices named to him. He can make such sales where he sees fit, in such shop, or out of shop, as he seems fit. He binds himself to sell at reasonable prices and not to sell other carriages as long as the company supply him with their make and must thoroughly canvass the assigned territory. He must pay freight and expenses as a purchaser would, where, as often happens, for security sake, the title remains in the company.\nThe company rents no premises, pays no rent, hires nobody, fixes no hours of labour, in short, controls nothing in the way of doing business except retaining, as security, the title to the goods. For the first year, which ended, 4th March, 1904, by way of provision for encouraging energetic work, something was to be allowed, and it was expressed, to help to pay rent. It might as well have been expressed for money spent on cigars during the first year. We are not shewn it had anything to do with tax or license fee for the year now in question. . The so-called commission might have been put as a discount for cash when paid.\nI cannot find that a business which is so little under the control of the company, and carried on as I describe, can be said to be within the meaning of the words \"doing business\" in Halifax, and, looked at as meaning carrying on business there. I fear the appropriate illustration, respondents' counsel gave, of the methods by which sales are made of proprietary medicines, would not be the only instance to be found wherein the business community would be surprised, if such a \"supplying of goods to another man as this company does to Melvin, would be interpreted as establishing an agency or carrying on business within a city elsewhere than at their home, within the meaning of this and similar statutes.\nThe company are manufacturers who do not seem desirous of becoming merchants as well. I have not failed to read appellant's factum, which asserts how:\nthat in practice the assessors of the city have confined this tax almost entirely to foreign companies doing a considerable business in the city without the possession in the city of much taxable property.\nIf the City of Halifax has, as this statement indicates, entrusted a discriminating option, in the making of the assessments, to the assessors, the zeal to tax foreign companies has outrun both law and discretion. If the legislature desires to prohibit anybody doing business in Halifax and has power to do so, it would be simpler to say so, and add the condition, \"unless $100 first paid.\"\nThe reference in the agreement to Melvin as an agent suggests the case of Ex parte White, Re Nevill[12] wherein, though in an entirely different connection, but on an analogous agreement, observations are made that have a pertinent application.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nI think the facts clearly establish that the defendants are a company doing business in the City of Halifax.\nThat being so, the only remaining question is whether section 313 of the city charter applies to them and I think it does. I think the words \"every other company, corporation, etc.,\" cannot be held to mean companies ejusdem generis as those previously enumerated, that is, of the same nature as insurance and guarantee companies.\nThat is apparent from the express exception of banks, and corporations exempt from taxation, from those other companies which are made subject to the $100 tax.\nIn my opinion the respondents are subject to the $100 tax, and the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDuff J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: F.

Rep. 476), which had affirmed the judgment at the trial withdrawing the case from the jury and dismissing the action and allowing the plaintiff his costs up to the time of service of the statement of defence, costs being given against the defendant in all the courts and a new trial ordered. Davies and Maclennan JJ. dissented and, taking the view that the refusal, though illegal, had not been made maliciously, considered that, on that issue, the plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages, that, in other respects, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed and that there should be no costs allowed on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial, whereby the case was withdrawn from the jury and the appellant's action was dismissed without costs to the respondent, but with costs to the appellant up to the time of the service of the statement of defence.\nThe respondent is Provincial Secretary of the Province of British Columbia and a member of the Executive Council. The appellant, on 24th April,1906, left with the respondent a petition of right in order that the same might be submitted to the Lieutenant Governor of the province for his consideration and for the purpose of obtaining from him the necessary fiat as provided by the \"Crown Procedure Act\" (R.S.B.C. ch. 57) sec. 4. The respondent, on 2nd May, brought the petition of right before the Executive Council. It was then discussed but no minute of council was prepared, nor was any order in council made. Pursuant, however, to the decision arrived at by the council, the appellant's solicitors were notified by the respondent, by letter dated 2nd May, that the council did not see their way to recommend that the fiat be granted. To this the appellant's solicitors replied by letter of 3rd May, asking whether they were to understand from this that the respondent declined to submit the petition to the Lieutenant Governor. The respondent by letter of 4th May replied in the affirmative.\nThe action was brought by the appellant on 7th May, 1906. On 21st June, 1906, the respondent brought the matter again before the Executive Council and a formal minute was prepared refusing the fiat, which was duly approved by the Lieutenant Governor. The respondent then, on 22nd June, filed his defence, in which this submission and refusal is set up, and also paid into court the sum of $5.00 to satisfy the appellant's claim. The appellant refused to accept this, and proceeded to trial. There was no suggestion in the evidence of fraud or malice on the part of the respondent.\nMr. Justice Morrison, at the trial of the action, withdrew the case from the jury and gave judgment for the respondent, dismissing the action but ordering the respondent to pay the costs up to the time of the service of the defence. This judgment was sustained by the judgment appealed from.\nW. S. Deacon for the appellant, As all the members of the full court agreed that the defendant's refusal to submit the petition was an actionable wrong\u2014Hunter C.J. and Irving J., expressly so deciding, and Martin J. not disagreeing, we submit that the case should not have been withdrawn from the jury, and that the grounds upon which the majority of the court refused a new trial were insufficient.\nThe action was not for mere delay in submitting, or for omission or neglect to submit, but for a specific refusal to do so. The defendant being sued for obstructing and preventing the plaintiff in the prosecution of his remedy on 4th May, 1906, it is immaterial that he ceased to do so on 21st June, following\u2014if his conduct on the latter occasion can be regarded as a cessation of his obstruction. The question is not whether a new trial should be refused because only nominal damages were recoverable, nor as to the amount of damages recoverable, but merely whether the plaintiff had been accorded that trial by jury which had been ordered, and to which he was entitled. There was no verdict, as the whole case had been withdrawn from the jury by the trial judge, and there was nothing for the appellate court to review but the propriety of the course adopted. Wood v. Rockwell[2]; Beatty v. Oille[3], per Ritchie C.J. at page 712; Scammell v. Clarke[4]. The plaintiff has the right to have left to the jury all issues proper to be passed upon by the jury. See \"Supreme Court Act,\" 3 Edw. VII. ch. 15, sec. 66 (B.C.); Lewis v. old[5]; Cowan v. Affie[6]; Denmark v. McConaghy [7]; Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. The Cobban Manufacturing Co.[8].\nIf the consideration of what damages the jury might have properly awarded, had it been permitted to pass upon that question, was proper to be entered upon by the full court, the conclusion that such damages would necessarily be assessed as nominal is erroneous, because the right infringed was not a mere naked right, the enjoyment of which could be said to be of no value, but an important constitutional privilege and civil right. See Ashby v. White[9], per Holt C.J.; per Bowen, L.J., in The Queen v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[10], at page 236; per Langdale M.R., in Ryves v. Duke of Wellington[11], at page 464; per Jervis C.J., in Eastern Archipelago Co. v. The Queen[12], at pages 914 and 915.\nThe remedy by petition of right is an absolute and specific form of legal remedy, and the defendant has interfered with and prevented the plaintiff from prosecuting it. See Chaster on Powers of Executive Officers (5 ed.), pages 162, 163, and cases there cited. The defendant's conduct derived no validity from his having procured the concurrence in it of the Executive; per Romer J., in Raleigh v. Goschen [13], at page 77, and per Sir R. E. Webster, A.G., arguendo, at page 78. See also Ferguson v. Earl of Kinnoull [14], pages 251 and 305, and cases cited, and the language of Lord Brougham, at page 305.\nThe circumstances under which a tort is committed are proper for a jury to consider on the question of what damages should be awarded. Merest v. Harvey [15].\nNesbitt K.C. for the respondent. The rights of the appellant, if any, were under section 4 of the \"Crown Procedure Act,\" and, had it not been for the letter of the respondent of 4th May, there could have been no cause of action as the petition was ultimately submitted in due form and without unreasonable delay. Irwin v. Grey[16]. There was, in truth, no real refusal to submit in the first instance, but, if what happened amounted to a technical refusal to submit the petition as required by the statute, the appellant became thereby entitled to nominal damages only. No actual damage resulted, and there were no circum- stances of aggravation. The court, will not order a new trial merely for the purpose of enabling a plaintiff to obtain a judgment for nominal damages; Scammel v. Clarke[17]; Simonds v. Chesley[18]; Milligan v. Jamieson[19]; nor where nothing is to be gained thereby. The court may itself direct the proper judgment. Goddard v. Midland Railway Co.[20]; Allcock v. Hall[21]; Bryant v. North Metropolitan Tramways Co.[22]; Feize v. Thompson[23]; Yorkshire Guarantee & Securities Corporation v. Fulbrook & Innes[24].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This appeal is allowed with costs. I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting)\u2014In this case I concur with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Mac-lennan and would dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J\u2014The appellant claimed to be entitled to a renewal of a license from the Crown, which expired on the 26th of January, 1906, to cut timber and had made, on the 24th of January, 1906, application to the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for British Columbia, for such renewal of license.\nHe was either refused or his application so neglected that he had a grievance.\nThe question raised by the appellant was whether or not he had been thus denied properly a renewal of license. He presented a petition of right seeking to have this question determined and his alleged right to renewal declared.\nThe petition was presented on the 24th day of April, 1906, under the Crown Procedure Act, R.S.B.C. ch. 57. Section 4 thereof reads as follows:\n(4) The said petition shall be left with the Provincial Secretary, in order that the same may be submitted to the Lieutenant-Governor for his consideration, and in order that the Lieutenant-Governor, if he shall think fit, may grant his flat that right be done. No fee or sum of money shall be payable by the suppliant on so leaving such petition, or upon his receiving back the same.\nThe defendant seems to have had no regard to the statute and after he had, as he alleges, brought the matter under the notice of his colleagues at council, refused to submit this petition to the Lieutenant-Governor as the statute requires.\nThis refusal is shewn by the respondent's letters to the appellant's solicitors in the correspondence in evidence. The acknowledgment of the receipt of the petition is shewn and then an ambiguous letter comes from respondent and the following letters cover the point now raised:\u2014\nMay 3rd, 1906.\nThe Honourable the Provincial Secretary,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir,\u2014\nNorton v. Rex. We are in receipt of yours of the 2nd instant. Will you kindly let us know if we are to understand from same you decline to submit the petition of right to the Lieutenant-Governor for his fiat and oblige.\nYours truly,\nWADE, DEACON & DEACON,\nPer W. S. D. EXHIBIT 5.\nProvincial Secretary's Office, Victoria, No. 1207.\nMay 4th, 1906.\nMessrs. Wade, Deacon & Deacon.\nBarristers, Vancouver, B.C.\nSir,\nNorton v. Rex. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yours of 3rd instant, asking if you are to understand from my communication that I have declined to submit the petition of right to His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor. In reply I beg to say that is what I intended to convey in my previous letter.\nI have the honour to be Sir, your obedient servant,\nFRED. J. FULTON,\nProvincial Secretary.\nThere seems here an express refusal to discharge a duty created, by statute.\nThe appellant became entitled the moment of this refusal to an action for breach by respondent of his statutory duty.\nThe action was brought and then awakening to a sense of duty the respondent proceeded, before filing his pleas herein, to an apparent discharge of this duty.\nThe result was a refusal by the Lieutenant-Governor on the advice of the respondent to grant a fiat.\nThe respondent then pleads this and payment into court of five dollars to cover the damages.\nThe case proceeds to trial by means of a special jury without any motion to stay proceedings, if such a step were open.\nThe case is tried with that jury until the foregoing defence is shewn by the evidence of defendant and then upon motion of his counsel the learned trial judge dismissed the action.\nBy what right this was done, I am quite unable to understand. A majority of the court below, however, uphold the proceedings.\nThe learned Chief Justice assigns as a reason for so doing that the statute specifies no time within which the Provincial Secretary is required to submit the petition and, therefore, a reasonable time must be allowed for him and the Executive Council to consider the matter.\nInasmuch as the respondent's letters shew that the executive had been consulted and had come to the decision that he announced and he explicitly states a refusal after all that to submit the petition as the law directs, I fail, with great respect, to understand this reason in its relation to the right of action that had already, as clearly as possible, arisen before action as the result of respondent's express refusal.\nThe respondent's evidence shews that the reason assigned by him when advising the Lieutenant-Governor to refuse the fiat was the same as present to the mind of respondent and his colleagues in the first place, when refusing to submit the matter at all.\nThere was thus, it seems to me, clearly no ground for taking more time.\nUnder the circumstances set forth in this case, the claim for more time would, of itself, be a matter for the jury's consideration in estimating the damages.\nThe payment into court of a nominal sum does not seem to me to mend matters.\nIt does not seem as if the respondent had even then properly realized his dereliction of duty and thereby evinced such recognition of it.\nHis Majesty and His Majesty's representatives have not yet become mere pawns.\nI will not affirm that as a matter of course and as settled by law a neglect to submit a subject's petition to the representative of the Crown is to be covered by a tender of five dollars.\nThe speculation as to the possible result may in any such case be a matter of some difficulty for the jury in considering the damages, so far as it can properly enter into the matter of such consideration.\nThe minister's act in anticipating, as he did, the result thereof, by moving without any new fact or change of position in the subject matter he had to deal with, may or may not have improved his position. All that was for the jury. The case ought to be tried out and properly tried out.\nTo maintain the proposition that a minister of the Crown can be so protected in disregarding the statute seems to me equivalent to repealing it.\nThe result, if the petition had been properly dealt with, is something we can say nothing about.\nI think Mr. Justice Irving, in his dissenting judgement, put the matter in the only way it can be properly viewed.\nIt is peculiarly a case for a jury to assess damages in, if they come to be assessed. A direction to assess only nominal damages would have been an error. And, much more grave is the dismissal of the action without going through even the form of finishing the trial.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the costs of the abortive trial be borne, in any event, by the respondent.\nMACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, dismissing an appeal from a judgment at the trial dismissing the action.\nThe action was brought against the defendant who is the Provincial Secretary of the Province of British Columbia, and claimed damages for the refusal by the defendant to submit a petition of right on the plaintiff's behalf for the consideration of the Lieutenant-Governor.\nThe petition was dated the 24th April, 1906, and was received by the defendant on the 26th of April. On the 2nd of May, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff saying that the petition had been laid before the Executive Council and they did not see their way to recommend the fiat. On the following day the plaintiff wrote to the defendant inquiring whether his letter meant that he declined to submit the petition to the Lieutenant-Governor for his fiat.\nThis was answered by the plaintiff on the 4th saying that was what his letter intended to convey.\nThis action was commenced on the 7th of May, and the statement of claim was delivered on the 11th of June following alleging that the defendant wrongfully and illegally, and maliciously declined and refused to submit the petition, and claiming $10,000 damages.\nOn the 22nd of June the defendant filed a statement of defence, in which, after denying the several allegations of claim, he set up two other defences, the first being that after the commencement of the action, namely, on the 21st of June, he had submitted the petition to the Lieutenant-Governor, who had refused his fiat therefor, and the other defence being that, while denying all liability, he brought into court the sum of five dollars as enough to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff replied, saying nothing as to the payment into court, but joining issue generally, and by way of further reply, denying that the petition of right had been submitted to the Lieutenant-Governor,and alleging that if it was, and if the fiat was refused, it was refused capriciously and without sufficient or any reason; and also that if it was submitted, and the fiat refused, the defendant, and other responsible advisers of the Lieutenant-Governor, so advised him capriciously and without any, or any sufficient, reason.\nAt the trial, before a special jury summoned at the instance of the defendant, the plaintiff endeavoured to adduce evidence of the merits of his petition, but this was properly disallowed by the learned judge; and there was no evidence whatever of malice on the part of the defendant in omitting or refusing to submit the petition in the first instance, nor any evidence of caprice on the part, either of the Lieutenant-Governor, or any of his advisers, in connection with the subsequent refusal to grant a fiat.\nOn the contrary, it appeared that when the petition was received by the defendant, it was promptly submitted to the executive council who came to the conclusion that it was not a case in which they ought to advise the Lieutenant-Governor to grant a fiat; and so, what the defendant, erroneously as I think, deemed the unnecessary formality of submitting it to the Lieutenant-Governor, was omitted.\nAt the conclusion of the trial then, the case stood thus. The defendant had, without any malice or evil intent, committed a breach of duty towards the plaintiff, in not submitting his petition to the Lieutenant-Governor, as well as to his colleagues. Taking the wrong to have been committed on the 2nd of May, the action was brought on the 5th, and on the 21st of June the petition was submitted and the wrong was righted. What possible injury or damage could the plaintiff have suffered between the 2nd and the 5th of May, or up to the 21st of June? It is impossible to perceive what such damages could be, beyond the costs of the action. And even those might perhaps have been avoided, if the plaintiff had called the defendant's attention to the positive terms of the statute, instead of at once issuing a writ.\nOn the 21st of June the duty, the neglect or refusal of which was the cause of action, had been performed. There could be no more damage after that. The cause of action was not the refusal of a fiat. There could be no action for that. The cause of action was the refusal to submit the petition. The plaintiff's damage would be exactly the same if the fiat had been granted, and in either case must have been, at the utmost, merely the delay between the 2nd May and the 21st June, in having the question decided whether he was to have a fiat granted or not. And no other injury or damage was proved or even suggested.\nI am, therefore, clearly of opinion that no damage more than merely nominal was proved, and that it would not have been competent to the jury to assess substantial damages, which they could have done only by exercising their imaginations. Williams v. Stephenson[25].\nBut while I think the learned judge was right in withdrawing the case from the jury, I think the judgment on the main issue should have been for the plaintiff. I think the defendant did illegally refuse to submit the petition, although not maliciously or wrong- fully, and that the plaintiff should have judgment on that issue, with one dollar damages, he having refused to accept the larger sum.\nI think the action in other respects should be dismissed, but the judgments as to costs, at the trial and in appeal, should stand, and that there should be no costs of this appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am in accord with the majority of the judges of the full court in the opinion, (which seems also to have been the opinion of Erle C.J. as indicated in his judgment in Irwin v. Grey[26] at page 637,) that by virtue of the Crown Procedure Act an obligation rests upon the Provincial Secretary, with whom a petition of right has been left, to submit it to the Lieutenant\u2014Governor, and that for his refusal to perform that obligation an action lies at the suit of the suppliant. The contention\u2014vigorously pressed upon us\u2014that the duty of the Provincial Secretary under the statute is discharged when, after consideration of the petition, it is decided by him and his colleagues of the Executive Council not to recommend that a fiat be granted,\u2014leaves out of account two things;\u20141st. That the statute speaks of a submission to the Lieutenant-Governor, a consideration by the Lieutenant-Governor, the grant of a fiat by the Lieutenant-Governor;\u2014and, 2ndly. That, while His Majesty or (in a province of Canada,) His Majesty's representative, cannot under the constitution act without the advice of a responsible minister or ministers, and while the decision in all questions of administration must ultimately rest with those who will be responsible, still the constitutional function of any particular minister or ministers of the Crown is to inform and advise and not to dictate.\nIt seems necessary to point out that to this last stage the development of cabinet rule has not yet come; and it is, perhaps, not superfluous to mention that the Provincial Secretary's statutable obligation to submit the petition is something altogether different from the political obligation he owes to the Crown as its officer and one of its advisers, in respect of advice and otherwise, wherein he is not accountable at the suit of any individual.\nThat the plaintiff left with the defendant, as Provincial Secretary, his petition of right, or that there is evidence upon which a jury might properly find that prior to the commencement of the action the defendant refused to submit it to the Lieutenant\u2014Governor is not disputed.\nIt is to be observed that the plaintiff does not rest his title to relief upon the neglect of the defendant to submit the petition, but upon his express refusal to perform his statutable obligation. The plaintiff's case is that, upon this refusal, a cause of action vested in him, and I am, consequently, unable to concur in the view, expressed by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia and by the learned trial judge, that the submission of the petition, six weeks after the cause of action arose and the action had been commenced, is an answer to the plaintiff's claim.\nIt is quite true that not every neglect to submit a petition would so prejudice a suppliant in his legal rights as to give rise to a right of action. The suppliant's right is not to have his petition submitted instanter. The Provincial Secretary has his duties as a minister of the Crown, and considerations regarding the orderly conduct of business would indicate the desirability that, on the submission of a petition to the Lieutenant-Governor, it should be accompanied by the advice of his minister or minister's, together with such information as should enable him intelligently to appreciate the grounds of that advice. The time necessary to get such information and to consider and consult respecting such advice, the Provincial Secretary is unquestionably entitled to take.\nBut no such justification seems to be suggested here.\nIt was, on the evidence at least, open to the jury to find that the defendant's refusal was a decisive refusal to submit the petition, in any event, a refusal in denial of the plaintiff's right to have it submitted.\nIf, upon that refusal, the plaintiff was not entitled to sue, how long was he bound to wait?\nAnd, to concede that he could then sue is surely to concede that he had then a right of action.\nIt does not, indeed, seem to be contested that the plaintiff's evidence would have supported a right of action if nothing further had happened;\u2014a right of action, that is to say, for damages founded on the defendant's wrongful act in refusing to submit his petition.\nSuch a right of action, once vested, cannot, I think, be got rid of except by a release or by satisfaction of it;\u2014and the subsequent submission cannot, I think, he said to be either of these.\nThe plaintiff having presented evidence upon which a jury might not improperly have found that he had, at the hands of the defendant, suffered an actionable wrong, it was his right to have his case submitted to the jury, with\u2014at the lowest\u2014a direc tion that, if they should so find, he would be entitled to a verdict for nominal damages; and, on such a finding, it would be his right to have judgment against the defendant for such sum as the jury should under that direction award. In point of fact, the plaintiff's case was not submitted to the jury; and his action was dismissed. It is argued that, in these circumstances, the plaintiff can now have no relief, because, it is said, the evidence clearly shews that no jury acting within its duty, could award more than nominal damages. This view seems to have met with the approval of Martin J. in the court below.\nWith great respect, I cannot agree with it. Assuming it to be clear on the evidence that nominal damages only could properly be awarded, it is at least as clear that the plaintiff has not had judgment pronounced upon the issues of fact involved in the action. The tribunal appointed to try those issues\u2014the jury\u2014has had no opportunity of passing upon them; and assuming it to be the rule that in such a case a new trial should not be granted, if on the evidence the only proper verdict would be a verdict for such damages, the basis of the rule must be that in such a case the court of appeal has power to enter such a verdict and will do so. Somewhere, by some tribunal, the plaintiff is entitled to have the validity of his claim determined by a judgment in the action he has brought. Ubi jus ibi remedium. A cause of action which\u2014its constituent facts having been proved in a proper proceeding\u2014the courts will not enforce, seems to be a contradiction in terms. The plaintiff would, therefore, be entitled, even in this view, to have the judgment dismissing the action set aside; and judgment entered in his favour for nominal damages. But I wish to express no opinion upon the question\u2014where, that is to say, the jury has not had an opportunity of passing upon the case, whether or not the court of appeal can, under the practice at present in force in British Columbia, against the will of either party, enter such a verdict; in my opinion it is unnecessary.\nI am unable to come to the conclusion that there is not evidence fit for the consideration of a jury upon the question whether or not they should award the plaintiff nominal damages only. Very cogent arguments may unquestionably be urged in favour of the view that an affirmative answer should be given to that question; but I think it should be left to the jury to pass upon the validity of them.\nThe plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to a new trial. He should also have the costs of the appeals to this court and to the full court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. J. Deacon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D. G.

Co. was to tender for a triangular piece of land offered for sale by the Ontario Government containing 19 acres and convey half to the C.P.R. Co., which would not tender. The division was to be made according to a plan of the block of land with a line drawn through the centre from east to west; the C.P.R. Co. to have the northern half. The G.T.R. Co. acquired the land but the Government reserved from the grant, two acres in the northern half. In an action by the C.P.R. Co. for specific performance of the agreement:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court of appeal (14 Ont. L.R. 41) Maclennan and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the C.P.R. Co. was entitled to one half of the land actually acquired by the G.T.R. Co. and not only to the balance of the northern half as marked on the plan.\nThe court of appeal directed a reference to the Master in case the parties could not agree on the mode of division.\nHeld, that such reference was unnecessary and the judgment appealed against should be varied in this respect.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the court of appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial by which plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed. The action was for specific performance of an agreement for division of land acquired by the defendant company from the Ontario government. The material facts affecting the appeal are stated in the above head-note.\nWalter Cassels K.C. and Cowan K.C. for the appellants.\nArmour K.C. and MacMurchy for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies and in the direction varying the judgment appealed from.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice of the court of appeal for Ontario I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs and the judgment of the court of appeal confirmed excepting that part referring to the Master the division of the land.\nThe land respecting which the agreement between the railways was made was a particular plot of land in Toronto belonging to the Crown well known to the officials of both railways and in form a triangle or nearly so bounded on one side by the appellant\u2019s railway tracks, and on the other by those of the respondent with Pacific Ave. as a base line. An agreement to be gathered from the correspondence of the officials of the respective railway companies was made that the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. should abstain from tendering for the land and \u201cleave the appellants free to deal with the Crown in the interest of both parties,\u201d that the Grand Trunk Railway Co. should purchase it and that it should be divided equally between the companies, both paying one half the purchase money.\nAfter the land was purchased by the appellants subsequently to the above agreement the parties treated the land bought and conveyed by the Crown to the appellants as the identical parcel which had been the subject matter of their agreement although as a matter of fact a small portion at the north-west corner of the plot of about two acres was withheld by the Crown and not sold leaving 17.91 acres conveyed to the appellants for the sum of $32,500.\nI think it must be taken to have been the common intention of the parties and that it sufficiently appears in the correspondence that whatever land was in fact acquired was to be divided equally between the companies, each paying half the purchase money.\nThe plaintiffs (respondents) tendered a conveyance of the north half of the lands acquired by appellants divided in accordance with the principle of division adopted, and I think agreed to by both companies at the time when both supposed the plot would include the two acres subsequently withheld by the Crown, and the plaintiffs at the same time offered to pay the defendants one half of the purchase money according to the agreement.\nI think they are entitled to the decree asked by them. Once the conclusion is reached that the land less the two acres is the subject matter of the contract, then the same scheme and principle of division should be applied as was I think understood and agreed to when the parties thought the parcel would embrace the two acres.\nI think the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied accordingly and that the cross-appeal against the reference to the Master should be allowed and the appellants declared entitled to have the deed of the one half of the lands executed and delivered to them as prayed for on payment of $16,250 and interest at 5 per cent. from 6th May, 1903.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014These parties agreed that a triangular piece of land in Toronto, of about 19 acres, offered or about to be offered for sale, by the Ontario government should be tendered for by the appellants and that in consideration of the respondents\u2019 refraining from tendering they should have an option for five years after the appellants\u2019 acquisition of the same to pay one-half the purchase price and receive a conveyance of a specified half of what was thus acquired.\nThis specified half was defined by a line drawn through the block as shewn on a plan prepared for the purpose, assigning the half, north of the line, to the respondents.\nThe dividing line that was thus drawn makes as clear as can well be, the principle upon which the division was to be made. The line was drawn from the apex of the triangle to the base line thereof. The apex was formed by the intersecting and diverging boundary lines of the respective properties on which the respective tracks of these companies were laid.\nBut for the fact that the Government did not offer, as expected, the entire block of 19 acres, but reserved two acres of the north half thus defined, and sold the remaining 17 acres, there could not be the slightest question about the certainty of the land that was to be bought or the part of which the respondents were to get. The two acres were the extreme north-west part of the triangle, and therefore, would come out of the part allotted by the plan to the respondents. These two acres were neither an essential part for the purposes of the whole dealing in question nor were they necessary to enable a fair and equal division by applying the principle or method of division shewn by the dividing line drawn, as already described, through the block.\nIt is not clear when the Government decided to reserve these two acres. It is clear, however, that from the beginning to the close, one-half of the whole land being dealt with was what the parties contemplated each should get. It was agreed that the appellants should carry, if need be, until the expiration of the option, the whole property, and receive from the respondent 5 per cent. per annum upon half of the cost price of the whole. It is fair to infer, from the close attention paid by both parties to the subject matter of the purchase that they were both aware of the reservation of the two acres in question.\nIt is clear to me, reading the correspondence and plans in question, that the parties were of one mind throughout, until after two years from the drawing of the above mentioned plan, a new manager came into control of the appellant company.\nIt was I think intended by both to accept the division of the whole upon the principle indicated by the dividing line I have referred to. The tender was deposited with the Commissioner of Public Works in November, 1901, some six months after the understanding was arrived at. The correspondence shews respondents\u2019 officers never lost sight of the matter, but kept pressing it on until the tender was so deposited. This tender was accepted by an order in council on the 22nd Sept., 1902. Curiously enough, the respondents, two days after the order in council, revived the correspondence, and pressed for closing up of the transaction between the appellants and the Government, and the appellants and themselves.\nThe appellants having been rather tardy, the respondents\u2019 solicitor, on the 3rd of June, 1903, prepared a deed, and forwarded it to the appellants\u2019 solicitor with an intimation that the purchase money, half of the whole price, would be forthcoming on execution of the deed. This seemed to be the result of appellants\u2019 general manager asking respondents to confer with the appellants\u2019 manager McGuigan.\nThis was an explicit exercise of the option. Between the date of this letter of June 3rd, tendering the deed and money, and the 5th Oct., 1903, much correspondence ensued, urging attention to the matter. Many excuses were given, but chiefly that appellants\u2019 new general manager had not been able to attend to it.\nSome months afterwards, this general manager attempted to make appellants\u2019 action in this matter conditional upon something entirely foreign to this particular business. He seemed to claim that there was no understanding. He was told very decidedly by respondents\u2019 vice\u2011president that this business would not be made dependent upon any other business and that there was an understanding. The general manager claimed then that there was no record with his company, and finally refused to concede what everybody dealing with the matter up to that time had apparently assumed was within the respondents\u2019 rights.\nThere never could have been any doubt in law or in fact of the respondents\u2019 right to the land north of the dividing line drawn at the start. Appellants seek to set that aside by the alternative plan they offer. They are not entitled to do so. They recognized the respondents\u2019 right to one-half the total area purchased. They made and yet make no question of the two acres. The plan adopted in the proposed deed tendered for execution is, I think, under all the facts and circumstances absolutely correct. It manifestly is the fair and reasonable manner in which the division of the whole seventeen acres should be divided as between these parties, if divided into two equal parts, and especially, having regard to their respective needs and the benefits to be derived from such partition, and the appropriate line of division in principle acted upon from the beginning of the dealing in question.\nIt is clearly what any one in the position of respondents was entitled to expect and what they might fairly understand as had in view by appellants throughout, until the change of manager.\nI see, therefore, no need for a reference unless there be a doubt as to the accuracy of the measurements in the proposed deed, about which no question has been raised.\nI am unable to understand why the respondents should, under the circumstances of the application to the railway commission, have brought up anything, in regard to their rights in question, there. They had exhausted by that time all that long continued pleading and remonstrance could have possibly done to press their rights upon the attention of the appellants. The railway commission had no authority to determine the dispute.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs, the cross-appeal allowed with costs, and the judgment in the court below amended in regard to the matter of reference in the way I have indicated.\nMACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014I regret to be obliged to decide that this appeal ought to be allowed.\nI think there was a good contract between the parties for a defined piece of land. The appellants were to acquire the whole, one defined half for themselves, and the other defined half for the respondents, in case the latter within a limited time exercised the option of taking it. And the price to be paid by the respondents was one-half of the price paid by the appellants for the whole, with interest at five per cent. from the time of payment. The contract, in effect, was for an option upon a defined parcel.\nThe appellants were unable, without any fault on their part, to acquire the parcel which was the subject of the agreement. But having obtained a very large part of it, I think that, in all fairness, they ought to have acceded to the demand of the respondents for so much of it as they did acquire. But standing, as they have a right to do, upon their strict legal rights, I think we must give effect to them.\nBy the contract the respondents were to have no rights whatever in the south half of the land. Their right was exclusively in the north half, the part surrounded green, in the plan 1(a), dated 31 May, 1901, referred to in Mr. McNicol\u2019s letter of the 1st June, 1901.\nThe contract unfortunately makes no provision for the case which has occurred, of the appellants failing to obtain all the land bargained for. There was no tenancy in common created in the whole parcel. The price to be paid was one-half the price to be paid for the whole.\nIf the respondents are to receive so much of the north half as was actually acquired, how is the price which they should pay to be ascertained? There is no evidence how the price paid for the whole was estimated, whether at so much per acre, or how otherwise. I see no way in which the price to be paid by the respondents, for the only part of the land to which they can have any claim under the contract, can be ascertained.\nThis difficulty is overcome, in the judgment appealed from, by holding that the respondents are entitled to one-half of the land actually obtained by the appellants; and that the price to be paid is one-half of the purchase money of the whole, with interest, and by referring it to the Master to make a proper division. In my humble opinion that is not warranted by the only agreement made between the parties.\nI think the appeal should be allowed, and that the action should be dismissed with costs, in the courts below but without costs of the present appeal.\nDUFF J.

The Master\u2019s report found that they were the only incumbrancers and fixed a date for payment by them of the amount due to the mortgagees. After confirmation of the report S. obtained assignments of these judgments and was added as a party. He then paid the amount due the mortgagees and the Master took a new account and appointed a day for payment by the mortgagor of the amount due S. on the judgments as well as the mortgage. This report was confirmed and the mortgagor having made an assignment for benefit of creditors before the day fixed for redemption an order was made by a judge in chambers adding the assignee as a party, extending the time for redemption and referring the case back to the Master to take a new account and appoint a new day. Held, affirming the judgment of the court of appeal (13 Ont. L.R. 127) that under the provisions of sec. 11 of the Assignments and Preferences Act the assignee of the mortgagor could only redeem on payment of the total sum due to S. under the mortgage and the judgments assigned to him.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the court of appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of a divisional court in favour of the defendant Swanson.\nThe question raised for decision on the appeal was whether the appellant, assignee of the defendant Stinson, mortgagor, under an assignment for benefit of creditors, could redeem on payment of the mortgage debt alone or had to pay as well the amount due on the judgments assigned to Swanson by judgment creditors who had proved their claims in the Master\u2019s office. The Master ruled that he need only pay the mortgage debt but his ruling was reversed on appeal to the Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench Division whose decision was affirmed by a divisional court and the court of appeal.\nD.L. McCarthy for the appellant.\nHamilton Cassels K.C. and R.S. Cassels for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Maclennan for dismissing this appeal.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. DAVIES J. having heard a portion only of the argument took no part in the judgment.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be looked at as raising only the question of the right the appellant would have after Swanson had redeemed the prior mortgagee and been thereafter found by the consequent report of the Master to be redeemable only upon payment of the entire sum of mortgage and executions.\nThe appellant as assignee can have no higher right than the mortgagor, unless when representing his creditors, and seeking to set aside some act his creditors might, but which he could not attack.\nAn application of the mortgagor, at the same stage in the proceedings as that in which the assignee made his application, could have been rested only upon an appeal to the equitable consideration of the court.\nThe only right the mortgagor had as such, at the date of the assignment, was to apply to the court to allow him to redeem Swanson, and I fear the answer to such an application on the mortgagor\u2019s part would have been; you can redeem only on paying all the Master\u2019s report has found him entitled to. Else when might the process end? The mortgagor had imposed upon the judgment creditors by his neglect and default the burthen and expense as well as hazard of redeeming the mortgagee. I do not think he should be heard without excuse and as of course to ask to set all that aside.\nThe assignee was liable to have been, and should have been, met by this same answer upon the motion before Mr. Justice Mabee and had his status fixed then and there. Respondents, I infer, did not insist upon that there.\nAt all events the result in the divisional court, of which the same learned judge was a member, seems to reduce the position to that I have indicated as what ought to have been, and possibly was intended; save the election given conditionally to have a sale of the property in question.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Meredith that neither tacking, nor consolidation, technically and properly, so called, have, or at least, should have anything to do with the matter.\nI cannot say that the discretion, if open to the court, was ill exercised in refusing to the appellant more than it has given.\nI am unable, however, as at present advised, to follow beyond this the reasoning upon which the courts below have proceeded. An execution such as those here in question against a mere equitable interest in lands and unenforceable without some proceeding in court constitutes a lien and nothing but a lien. I am unable to appreciate the mental process by which it is transformed into another kind of claim or lien, as it were in the twinkling of an eye, by the Master signing a report to settle priorities. I reserve to myself, should the occasion ever call for it, the right to reconsider the authorities relied upon in the court below, resting upon such as I, with the greatest respect, consider rather metaphysical reasoning.\nI would prefer giving the fullest effect that possibly can be given to a beneficent statute that is intended to administer the debtor\u2019s estates upon an equitable basis as between all the creditors. The distinction between this case and such others as I refer to, may not be quite clear, but appear to me substantial. For example, a judgment creditor holding more than one judgment as the respondent Swanson did, might have chosen after redemption of a mortgagee to have said he was doing it by virtue of No. 1 of his judgments. He might thus have reserved his other judgments, to enforce them against other parts of the debtor\u2019s estate. I do not see why he should not. I do not understand why any hard and fast rule should be applied to bind him against his will.\nI take it for granted that in this case having elected to consolidate (I use the term in no technical sense but as expressing the fact) his judgment debts with the mortgage debt he could not escape, when applying for his final order for foreclosure, the consequence of being held to have taken the land in satisfaction of the mortgage and the four judgments. He thus elected to be cut out of resorting to the possible rest of the estate.\nHad he elected otherwise, I am unable to understand how he could have been held bound to have done so. He need not have proven for more than the one by virtue of which he elected to redeem. I put this to counsel on the argument and have no reply backed by authority.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The question in this appeal is whether an assignment for the benefit of creditors, made by an insolvent mortgagor, in pursuance of the \u201cAssignments and Preferences Act,\u201d R.S.O. (1897) ch. 147, as amended by 3 Edw. VII. ch. 7, sec. 29, has the effect of practically undoing and vacating the proceedings in an action for the foreclosure of the mortgage, after redemption of the mortgage, by one or more judgment creditors duly made parties to the foreclosure proceedings, and after final account taken, and a day appointed for final redemption or foreclosure.\nI agree with the judgment of the court of appeal, affirming a judgment of a divisional court, that the assignment had no such effect.\nThe Act provides that an assignment for creditors shall take precedence of attachments, garnishee orders, judgments and executions not completely executed by payment, etc.\nWhen the foreclosure proceedings were commenced, there were four executions against the mortgagor in the hands of the sheriff. In the course of those proceedings the execution creditors were made parties, and they and the mortgagee proved their respective claims, and a day was appointed for redemption by the mortgagor.\nAfterwards the respondent acquired the judgment debts proved in the action, and redeemed and obtained an assignment of the mortgage.\nA further account was then taken both of the mortgage and judgment debts, and a day was appointed for redemption, or foreclosure in default of payment by the debtor of the aggregate sum of the mortgage and judgment debts, and interest and costs; and it was a few days before the expiration of the time for redemption that the assignment for the benefit of creditors was made.\nNow, I think that under those circumstances the defendant had become something more than a mere judgment or execution creditor. He had become a mortgagee of the lands in question, not merely to secure the original mortgage debt, but also the judgment debts. The judgment debts had become a charge upon the mortgage lands in due course of law, and that charge was as valid, and as much binding upon the mortgagor, as if he had made the charge by deed. The moment the judgment debts had been proved, the executions in the sheriff\u2019s hands might have been allowed to expire without affecting the charge on the mortgage lands.\nThat being so, I am clearly of opinion that the defendant\u2019s rights in the foreclosure proceedings were not affected by the assignment, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Carscallen & Cahill.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Farmer & Gould.\n[1] 13 Ont.

Nesbitt K.C. and Wright for the appellant.\nHodgins K.C. and Frost for the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The questions for our determination are whether in cases where a municipality is divided into wards and a by-law other than one for contracting a debt is submitted for the approval of the electors each rate payer is entitled to vote in each ward in which he has the necessary qualification, and secondly whether in the case of the particular by-law now in question where the right of the rate payer to vote in each ward was denied and refused the by-law should because of such refusal be quashed.\nThe able and exhaustive analysis to which the \u201cMunicipal Act of Ontario\u201d was subjected in its several consolidations and amendments by counsel for the several parties satisfied me that amidst much which was ambiguous and obscure one fact was clear and that was that the whole controversy depended upon the construction to be given to section 355 of the \u201cConsolidated Municipal Act of 1903.\u201d\nThat section lying in the statute between sections 353 and 354 defining the qualifications of ratepayers entitled to vote \u201con any by-law for contracting a debt\u201d and sections 356 and 357 giving the form of oaths of freeholders and leaseholders in the expressed cases of \u201cby-laws for contracting a debt\u201d reads as follows:\nWhere a municipality is divided into wards each ratepayer shall be so entitled to vote in each ward in which he has the qualification necessary to entitle him to vote on the by\u2011law. Do the words \u201cso entitled to vote in each ward\u201d refer to the by-laws \u201cfor contracting debts\u201d with respect to which alone the two preceding sections refer or can they be made to apply to all by-laws as to which the assent of the ratepayers is required?\nIn his very clear factum, as also in his oral argument, Mr. Nesbitt frankly conceded it was only as regards electors who are ratepayers entitled to vote under sections 353 and 354 that the appellants are here raising any claim. It seemed to me on the argument that this admission made it next to impossible to give to the words of section 355 the broad interpretation he sought to put upon them.\nWhen the \u201cLiquor License Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1897, ch. 245, was passed providing that such a by\u2011law as that now before us should be duly approved before its final passing\nby the electors of the municipality in the manner provided by the sections in that behalf of the Municipal Act,\nthere existed a section of the latter Act, 137, expressly providing that\nin towns and cities every voter may vote in each ward in which he has been rated for the necessary qualification\nexcept with respect to the mayor or reeve when he was restricted to one vote.\nIn the consolidation of 1897 that section was continued as section 158, but in the revision of 1899 it was entirely changed and the duplicate voting no longer extended to by-laws but was expressly confined to councillors and aldermen where they were elected by wards.\nUntil this change was made there can be no doubt that the principle of duplicate voting was applicable to all by-laws requiring the approval of the electors. Sections 353 and 354 had not then been limited to by-laws for contracting debts and Mr. Nesbitt contended that at any rate until that limitation was introduced into these sections in 1903, the principle of duplicate voting by wards must be held to have been continued, notwithstanding the dropping out and changing of section 158 in 1897.\nBut conceding all that, we find in 1899 the legislature in express terms limiting sections 353 and 354 to \u201cby-laws for contracting debts.\u201d\nWhen this change was made section 158 had disappeared and all trace of express provisions for polling duplicate votes on by-laws other than those for contracting debts seems to have been eliminated from the Act.\nMr. Nesbitt now frankly admits that the ratepayer referred to in the disputed section 355 of the consolidation of 1903 is the ratepayer whose qualification is determined by the two preceding sections 353 and 354. Then, if so, it seems to me the words \u201cso entitled to vote\u201d must necessarily relate to and be confined within the limitation of subjects on which he can vote expressly set out in these sections\u2014which would mean so entitled to vote on by-laws for contracting debts.\nI thought at one time it might be possible to hold that these words \u201cso entitled to vote\u201d might be held to have reference to any preceding sections in which the right to vote was defined or clearly set out on which construction it might refer to section 348 providing in the case of municipalities divided into wards for the delivery to the deputy returning officer for every ward of a voters\u2019 list containing the names of all persons appearing by the then last revised assessment roll to be entitled to vote in that ward.\nBut Mr. Nesbitt disclaims, as I understand his argument, that these persons so appearing on the list are the persons \u201centitled to vote\u201d referred to in section 355. The reference is exclusively he says to those electors who are such ratepayers as are defined in sections 353 and 354 and it is only as to the manner of their voting that he contends.\nThat being so, and the principle of duplicate voting upon by-laws generally which formerly expressly existed having been eliminated, by the dropping out from the Act of the old section 158 and by the express limitation introduced into sections 353 and 354 confining them to by\u2011laws for contracting debts, I am of the opinion that, in view of the frank and proper admission before referred to made by Mr. Nesbitt, there is only one reasonable construction which section 355 can in its present collocation bear and that is that the words so entitled to vote mean so entitled on by-laws for contracting debts to which the two preceding sections 353 and 354 and the two subsequent sections 356 and 357 exclusively relate. They are only entitled to vote in each ward on by-laws submitted to them for contracting debts.\nThe appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I am clearly of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nUnless the appellant\u2019s argument in favour of double voting can be maintained, there is nothing else to support his contention, and I think a careful consideration of the various sections of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d affords no warrant for double voting on a liquor by-law.\nSection 141 of the \u201cLiquor License Act\u201d requires such a by-law to be approved by the electors, in the manner provided by the sections in that behalf of the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d\nBy section 2(5) of the latter Act, the word \u201celectors\u201d is defined to mean the persons entitled to vote at any municipal election, or in respect of any by-law, * * * in the municipality, ward or polling division.\nThe question then is, what is the manner, provided by the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d for the approval of a by-law by the persons entitled to vote in the municipality of Owen Sound?\nThe answer to that question is found in section 338, and following sections. Section 338 provides that in case a by-law requires the assent of the electors of a municipality, before the final passing thereof, the following proceedings shall, except in cases otherwise provided for, be taken for ascertaining such assent: after which follow various detailed directions, preparatory to the poll.\nSection 350 directs that the poll shall be held at the day and hour previously fixed, and that the vote shall be taken by ballot.\nSection 351 then declares that the proceedings at the poll, and for and incidental to the same, and the purposes thereof, shall be the same, as nearly as may be, as at municipal elections, and all the provisions of sections 138 to 206 inclusive, except section 179, of this Act, so far as the same are applicable, and except so far as herein otherwise provided, shall apply to the taking of votes at the poll, and to all matters incidental thereto.\nNow looking back to sections 138 to 206, we find a number of sections from 158 to 163 inclusive under the general title of: \u201cWhere and how often electors may vote.\u201d These sections provide, with minute particularity, that in cities and towns, townships or villages, no persons shall vote more than once, for mayor, reeve, councillor or alderman, except in cities and towns where aldermen or councillors are elected by wards, in which an elector may vote once in each ward in which he has the necessary qualifications, for each alderman or councillor to be elected. The same rule of one vote is applied by section 160 to elections for county councillors, and section 162 imposes a penalty of $50 for voting oftener than allowed by the Act.\nThese sections being made applicable to votes on by-laws by section 351 conclude the question, unless they are excluded from application to the present by-law by the words in that section, except so far as herein otherwise provided.\nI think it is clear that there is nothing otherwise provided, except as to by-laws for, contracting debts.\nSections 353 and 354 deal with by-laws for contracting debts and with those alone, and make minute provision for by-laws of that kind; and it is plain that the following section 355 must be held to refer to by-laws of the same kind, when it provides that each ratepayer shall be so entitled to vote in each ward in which he has qualifications.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Following this, the waterworks were constructed which furnish water to the inhabitants of the Village of St. Joseph. Two years afterwards, in 1881, the reservoir proving insufficient, B. Roy brought water from adjoining lands through the pipe across the property of Vital Cliche. The right of servitude of B. Roy did not authorize him so to pass water from adjoining lands over the farm of Vital Cliche, nevertheless, he allowed him to do so and the pipe remained there up to the time of the trouble complained of. In 1883, B. Roy sold his waterworks and transferred his rights to his brother, V\u00e9n\u00e9rand Roy, the defendant (respondent). On 17th May, 1897, Vital Cliche granted by a deed of lease to the (respondent), for the purposes of his waterworks, 'the right to carry on his works (vaquer) upon the lands of the lessor, Nos. 540, 540a, 598 and 1399 of the cadastre of St. Joseph and the right of placing pipes and making cisterns and other works in connection with the said waterworks and repairs thereto.' In 1900, Vital Cliche sold to his son, (appellant) the lands charged with the servitude charging him with the obligation to 'conform to the lease granting the servitude by the vendor to V. Roy and generally to all other servitudes which might exist upon the land sold, which the said purchaser declared he was aware of.' In 1899, the (respondent) formed a partnership with one Gagn\u00e9, who was himself proprietor of certain waterworks supplying the Village of St. Joseph. The two systems of waterworks were combined, and the deed of partnership was registered on 23rd November, 1899, conformably to the law. In 1905, the firm of Boy & Gagn\u00e9 wished to renew the pipe which had been placed on the lots in question in 1881. The (appellant) objected to this and brought an action n\u00e9gatoire against the (respondent). The latter pleaded that he was not owner of the waterworks, alleged the partnership with Gagn\u00e9, made public by the registration of the declaration, and, further, that the firm, owner of the waterworks, was within the exercise of its right of servitude in renewing the pipe.\"\nThe Superior Court held that the right of bringing water from the adjoining lands had not been granted by the deeds in question and maintained the plaintiff's action. On appeal, the Court of King's Bench held that the defendant had proved that he was acting for the firm of Roy & Gagn\u00e9 which claimed the right of maintaining the pipe on the land of the plaintiff and bringing water through it from the adjoining lands for their waterworks; that the firm was exercising the right of servitude granted by the deeds, and, consequently, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the action with costs. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe deed of 1897 limited the exercise of the servitude to lots 540 and 598. Consequently the respondent must shew authority for what he has done elsewhere. Arts. 549, 558 C.C. From these articles it necessarily follows: that the respondent must find all the rights which he claims in his title deed; that possession, even immemorial, of additional rights of servitude, would not constitute a title; and that he can do nothing, in the exercise of his servitude, to aggravate the easement over the servient land. See Riou v. Riou[1]; Chamber-land v. Fortier[2]; Commune de Berthier v. Denis[3]; Pr\u00e9vost v. Belleau[4]; McMillan v. Hedge[5]; Roy v. Beaulieu[6]; 3 Aubry & Rau, pp. 92, 93, 94; 8 Laurent No. 256 ; 8 Demolombe Nos. 847, 848.\nSufferance confers no title. The Code specially enacts that a written title is necessary and that possession, even immemorial, is insufficient to establish a servitude. Even if Vital Cliche had verbally consented to the extension of the pipes, such consent could not be proved by parol evidence. He is not a party in this case, and there is no writing and no commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit to support such evidence. Art. 1233 C.C.\nWith regard to the partnership with Gagn\u00e9 and the objection that the action should have been directed against both, the court of appeal expressed no opinion. The trespass was committed by the respondent and he is therefore sued for the act which he committed himself ; it is immaterial whether or not he was then member of a partnership. The trespass is a d\u00e9lit and he is therefore jointly and severally responsible with his partners and may be sued alone. Art. 1106 C.C.\nThe deed of 1900 contains no acknowledgment of any servitude of bringing the water from the adjoining lands. It merely provides for existing servitudes legally established and cannot be construed so as to include, in general terms, servitudes founded on no title whatever and without legal existence which cannot be presumed to have been accepted.\nIn 1879 the waterworks were supplied by the springs on appellant's lots, but they ran dry and the whole supply of water now conies from the adjoining lands. The servitude ceased when the things subject to it assumed such a condition that it could no longer be exercised. Art. 559 0.0. Therefore, the object of the servitude having ceased to exist, the servitude itself is extinct and the servient lands have ceased to be subject to it. But, if the appellant has the right to bring water from the adjoining lands to replace the former supply from these springs, a new servitude, which was not contemplated by the parties, is created.\nMorin for the respondent. The respondent is a perfect stranger to the issues raised in this action ; if any trespass has been committed, the firm of Roy & Gagn\u00e9 alone is responsible, and the judgment tinder appeal is right.\nWe also rely upon the reasoning of Chief Justice, Sir Alexandre Lacoste, which we make part of our arguments.\nThe circumstances did not call for impleading the firm, as warrantors, as provided by article 187 C.P.Q., because their title was registered; Arts. 2116, 2098 and 2127 C.C. The deed of 19th September, 1897, vested title in the firm to the servitude which has been exercised. The existence of the new branch pipes was known to the appellant at the time he acquired the property and accepted the charge of the servitude granted in favour of the firm and all other privileges vested in them for the purposes of the waterworks and for making repairs to the same. If there can be a doubt in the meaning of the deed, it is to be construed, according to Art. 1014 C.C., in such manner as to the effective rather than nugatory.\nThe branch pipes which the appellant asks to have demolished are an integral part of the whole system of waterworks and demolishing them would prove fatal to the operation of the whole system. The expenses incurred in the repairs are estimated at $800, and the land on which right of servitude is contested is only about 150 feet wide, a pasture field of little value. The damages alleged to have sustained are purely nominal. The Superior Court assessed them at $10 for illegal occupation of that land during 25 years and Eoy & Gagn\u00e9 merely renewed, at the same places and with pipes of the same size, the old pipes which had been in the same ground for 25 years.\nAlex. Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.\nMorin for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGirouard J.\u2014Je suis d'avis de confirmer le jugement dont est appel avec d\u00e9pens, non pas pour les motifs exprim\u00e9s dans le texte du jugement, mais pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par le juge-en-chef Lacoste, aux quelles je ne puis rien ajouter.

VII. c. 58, s. 237\u2014Animals at large\u2014Construction of statute\u2014Words and terms\u2014\"At large upon the highway or otherwise\"\u2014Fencing of railway\u2014Trespass from lands not belonging to owner.\nC.'s horses strayed from his enclosed pasture situated beside a highway which ran parallel to the company's railway, entered a neighbour's field adjacent thereto, passed thence upon the track through an opening in the fence, which had not been provided with a gate by the company, and were killed by a train. There was no person in charge of the animals, nor was there evidence that they got at large through any negligence or wilful act attributable to C.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (16 Man. R. 323), that, under the provisions of the fourth sub-section of section 237 of \"The Railway Act, 1903,\" the company was liable in damages for the loss sustained notwithstanding that the animals had got upon the track while at large in a place other than a highway intersected by the railway.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the court of appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Richards, at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note and the questions raised on the appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported. Blackstock K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. Edward O'Connor for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree that the findings of the trial judge on the question of the plaintiff's negligence should not be disturbed.\nI also agree that the meaning of the rather ambiguous words of the four sub-sections of section 237 of the \"Railway Act, 1903.,\" \"Animals at large upon the highway or otherwise\" must be construed to mean \"otherwise at large,\" that is, at large otherwise than upon the highway and not as suggested by Mr. Black-stock \"at large or otherwise upon the highway.\" This latter suggestion would put a limitation upon the meaning of the section never contemplated by Parliament. Properly construed the section covers the case of the cattle of the plaintiff killed on the railway track.\nSince the revision of the Statutes in 1906 the question has ceased to be of importance as the revisors have changed the language so as to make it express what I think was the real meaning of Parliament. It now reads in the Revised Statutes \"At large whether upon the highway or not.\"\nIdington J.\u2014The questions raised in this appeal turn upon the interpretation of the 4th sub-section of section 237 of the \"Railway Act, 1903,\" which reads as follows:\u2014 4. When any cattle or other animals at large upon the highway or otherwise, get upon the property of the company and are killed or injured by a train, the owner of any such animal so killed or injured shall be entitled to recover the amount of such loss or injury against the company in any action in any court of competent jurisdiction, unless the company, in the opinion of the court or jury trying the case, establishes that such animal got at large through the negligence -or wilful act or omission of the owner or his agent\\ or of the custodian of such animal or his agent; but the fact that such animal was not in charge of some competent person or persons shall not, for the purposes of this sub-section, deprive the owner of his right to recover.\nIt is first claimed that the horses which were killed on appellant's railway track had\ngot at large through the negligence or wilful act or omission of the owner or his agent, or of the custodian of such animal or his agent,\nand, therefore, no action can be maintained.\nThe case was tried by Mr. Justice Richards without a jury and he has found the facts to be against this contention.\nIt seems to me if he placed implicit reliance on the evidence of the respondent he could not well find otherwise.\nThe question then remains, what is meant by \"animals at large upon the highway or otherwise\" getting upon the property of the company and being killed or injured by a train?\nA good deal of ingenuity was shewn during the argument to put upon the words \"at large upon the highway or otherwise'' some meaning other than the plain, ordinary, grammatical meaning the words bear and thus let the appellants free from liability in cases such as this.\nReasons to support these other meanings were sought for in the past history of the legislation bearing on the duty to fence a railway track, and the interpretation thereof by the courts. It was urged that behind all that was the common law, which cast the burthen of the care of cattle upon the owner and had to be considered.\nBearing that in mind it was said we must treat all the statutory law on the subject as an invasion thereof, and, therefore, give such statutes a restricted meaning.\nThe principle appealed to is theoretically sound, but how far is it applicable here?\nI doubt if having due regard to the nature of the title the railway company has acquired, and reason for its acquisition, a full examination of the question from the point of view urged would avail the companies much.\nI will not labour with it, however, for the reason that the language of the statute is so explicit I do not require to; and for the further reason that the long line of cases so much relied upon and the manifest hardship they wrought, in very many instances, seemed to demand a remedy for cases such as the one now in hand.\nTo any one conversant with the history of the struggle that had gone on in the courts for half a century over the nature of the obligations resting upon a railway company to fence its track, there is nothing surprising to find a radical change in regard thereto in \"The Railway Act of 1903.\"\nFinding that radical change in the language of the legislature relative to the nature and extent of the obligation to fence, I see no reason for restricting or straining the meaning of the words.\nThe word \"otherwise\" does not mean the same, but a something different from that preceding it. I cannot find anything more aptly different, from being at large on the highway, than just the case the facts here present.\nI do not think it necessary for this case to attempt to determine the limits of the obvious change introduced by this Act, as I have observed, relative to the duties of railway companies to fence.\nOne would expect to find the duty to fence and the liability to compensate for losses suffered through want of proper fencing, generally speaking, correlative.\nIt seems as if we had here a duty to fence created, but when we come to consider the right of action, it seems doubtful, to say the least, whether the action rests on that statute or the section 4, quite independently of what precedes it.\nIf it remain without amendment, many cases may be found necessary to settle what it does mean.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014The question in this appeal depends on the true construction of section 237 of the \"Railway Act\"\nThe horses which were killed strayed from the plaintiff's field, which lay on the south side of a highway, which, running east and west parallel to the railway, crossed the highway, entered a field adjacent to the railway, passed thence upon the track through an opening, which had never been provided with a gate by the company and were killed.\nThe field adjacent to the railway was not the property of the plaintiff.\nThe first question is whether the highway crossed by the animals is such a highway as is referred to in section 237, or at all events in sub-section (4) of that section.\nI think it is clear that the highway referred to in the first three sub-sections, is one crossing, or intersecting, the railway, and not one running parallel to it, as did the highway in question.\nThe first sub-section forbids animals to be at large upon any highway, within half a mile of the intersection of such highway with a railway at rail level unless, etc.\nSub-section (2) provides for the impounding of cattle found at large contrary to the provisions of the section, plainly meaning at large upon an intersecting highway.\nSub-section (3) deprives the owner of animals killed at the point of intersection of any right of action.\nThen follows sub-section (4). which is relied upon by the plaintiff, and it gives an action to the owner of animals at large upon the highway or otherwise which get upon the property of the company, and are killed or injured by a train, unless under certain specified conditions.\nI think the kind of highway here mentioned is the same as that mentioned in the preceding sub-sections, that is to say, an intersecting highway. It is not a highway, or any highway, but the highway, that is, the same highway mentioned before.\nThere is no evidence that the highway crossed by the animals was an intersecting highway, and unless the words \"or otherwise\" make the sub-section applicable to the present case I think the plaintiff cannot recover. I think, however, that those words require us to uphold the judgment.\nIn my opinion those words, reasonably and fairly construed, mean at large upon the highway, or at large in any other way or place. They widen the meaning so as to embrace the circumstances in which these animals were. They were at large, first upon the highway parallel to the railway, and afterwards in the neighbouring field, from which they passed upon the company's line.\nThere is no evidence that they got at large through any negligence or wilful act of the plaintiff or his agent, or of their custodian or his agent, and the subsection makes the fact that no one was in charge of them immaterial.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs here and below.\nDuff J. concurred with Maclennan J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

The defendant Cleveland did not appeal from this judgment, but, on an appeal by the company, the judgment at the trial was reversed and the action dismissed with costs. The issues on the present appeal were, therefore, confined to the claim against the company.\nOn the appeal coming on for hearing, Galt, for the respondents, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that, under section 36 of \"The Mechanics' and Wage Earners' Lien Act\"[2], there could be no appeal from the judgment in question. Without calling upon the appellant's counsel to reply, the court ordered the argument to proceed upon the merits of the appeal.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions raised upon this appeal are stated in the judgment of the majority of the court, delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington.\nC. P. Wilson and A. E. Hoskin for the appellant.\nAlex. C. Galt for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons given by the court below, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\n260\nI do not think the time fixed by statute within which proceedings must be taken to enforce a mechanics' lien, should be extended on evidence so unsatisfactory as that here offered. I fully agree in the appreciation given by the Court of Appeal to that evidence, that the plaintiff himself treated the contract as completed on the 20th of April, 1904, and also as to the reason for Burn's intention to return.\nThe argument failed entirely to satisfy me that he intended to return with any idea of completing a contract he had already, in the view of both parties, practically and substantially completed.\nIdington J.\u2014The defendant Cleveland contracted with his co-defendants to build, in Winnipeg, a grain elevator.\nIt was specified in their contract that a complete dust collecting system was to be installed therein.\nThe system adopted was one in which at least two kinds of contrivances, known as Day's patented dust collectors and Day's patented furnace feeders, of which the appellant was the patentee, were to be used.\nThe appellant agreed with Cleveland to do the work and supply the material for that part of his contract with respondents which involved the complete system of dust collecting that was to be installed.\nThe respondents had nothing to do with this subcontract beyond approving the system or being satisfied with its execution. It was well known to them that the sub-contract was made, and, no doubt also known, that it was necessary for their contractor Cleveland to obtain this patented machinery from appellant, yet no attention was paid by the company to the Mechanics' Lien Act. If companies or others disregard the plain and obviously proper provisions of this statute, they should not set up, as is done here, a wail about losing money thereby.\nThe questions for us are: Did the appellant be- come entitled by virtue of the said Act to a lien upon the respondent company's property for the amount of work and material covered by this sub-contract? And if so,\u2014Has he lost it by reason of failure to register within thirty days from the completion of such subcontract?\nThe lien was registered on the 30th of June, 1904. It is not denied that the work was done, or, alternatively, that the work would have been done by appellant but for the action of respondents.\nIt is claimed the lien was not registered in time. That depends on whether the work was completed on the 19th April, 1904, or not.\nThe appellant's work on that date was all done save some parts which would not cost very much to do and which could have been done in a few hours had the rest of the work Cleveland had to do been ready to receive these parts in their proper place.\nAppellant's foreman arranged with the man in charge for Cleveland that he, the appellant's foreman, would do these things at a later date; that he would return for the purposes of seeing the machinery he had placed work properly and give satisfaction, and then could and would supply all the minor things in question.\nHe then went home to Minneapolis, the domicile of appellant also, and on the 20th April, having reported the state of his work to appellant's book-keeper, the whole contract was charged up as if finished. The completion having been delayed by Cleveland, the appellant was entitled to look to him for a substantial payment having only received about one-third of his contract price.\nOn the 2nd of June, without instructions from anybody, the book-keeper wrote a letter to the respondent company's manager calling attention to this and stating that letters on the same subject to Cleveland remained unanswered and that the work was completed.\nThis letter does not seem to have been answered.\nThe respondents now lay stress upon the facts of this charging up the contract price and writing this letter and they say that, coupled with statements made by appellants' foreman before leaving Winnipeg in April to the effect that he was \"through\" and was taking his tools and material away, there can be no doubt but that the appellants' men supposed the work all completed and that, in fact, it must be inferred therefrom that it was completed on the 19th April.\nThis seems to have been relied upon in the court below.\nIt appears to me an unwarranted conclusion when we find it as conclusively proven, as anything can be proven, by Clapp, the superintending foreman in charge of the work for Cleveland, when appellant's men left in April that this foreman of appellant was to return and finish as already stated.\nCounsel for respondents on the argument before us would not venture to cast the slightest doubt on the honesty of Clapp and admitted he had no interest in the matter. How then, as I asked, could his story be impeached or affected by the circumstances already referred to? I have not heard any answer to this. I cannot conceive any effective answer possible. The bookkeeper, being human, erred. No claim, resting on such obvious error, can stand. It led to giving an appearance of truth to the ground relied upon by respondents. It was, however, I fear, merely an appearance of truth.\nThe test question here is whether or not the appellant could in law have sued on the 20th of April and recovered from Cleveland as for a completed contract. I am of opinion he could not. Trifling as the parts unfinished were, the party paying, in such a case, was entitled to insist on the utmost fulfilment of the contract and to have these parts so supplied that the machine would do its work.\nWe must not overlook the nature of the work to be done and the possibility of the slightest departure from the true way to construct rendering it worthless.\nI am not surprised to learn that workmen doing this class of work desire as well for their own reputation as for the purpose of satisfying their patrons that they should see it running, and running in good order, before considering it completed.\nObviously the machine was absolutely useless without some of the parts that remained to be attached thereto, and another part of it so defective as to be liable to burn the buildings down and leave the appellant, in that event, if he had so handed it over, liable to an action.\nApply these tests, and the cases relied on below have no application here.\nTruly the things in question do look trifling; so does the most of patented machinery to the wise people that see it working. I am abundantly satisfied that if we had been hearing the converse of this case, on the facts it presents, in an action begun by appellant, in April, when the work was charged up in the books, we would have been told by respondents that a clearer case of an unfinished contract could not be found.\nI fear interest blinds the apprehension.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, with costs of court below.\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree in the opinion of my brother Davies.\nDuff J. concurred with Idington J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Campbell, Pitblado, Hoskin & Grundy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tupper, Galt, Tupper, Minty & McTavish.\n[1] 16 Man.

Before this work was completed and during the absence of the tenant, the plumbers' men, who were at work in another part of the same building, with steam cut off for that purpose, at the request of the caretaker employed by the landlord, turned the steam on again which, passing through unfinished pipes connected with the shop, escaped through an open valve in a radiator and injured the tenant's goods.\nHeld, that the landlord was liable in damages for the negligent act of his caretaker in allowing steam to be turned on without ascertaining that the radiator was in proper condition to receive the pressure, and that the plumbing firm were also responsible for the negligence of their employees in turning on the steam, under such circumstances, as they were acting in the course of their employment in what they did although requested to do so by the caretaker.\nThe judgment appealed from (16 Man. R. 411) was affirmed with a variation declaring the plumbers jointly liable with the landlord.\nThe action was against the two defendants, jointly, and the plaintiff obtained a verdict, at the trial, against both. The Court of Appeal confirmed the verdict as to McN. and dismissed the action as to the other defendants. McN. appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, making the other defendants respondents on his appeal.\nHeld, that the plaintiff, respondent, was entitled to cross-appeal against the said defendants, respondents, to have the verdict against them at the trial restored. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], by which the judgment of Dubuc C.J. at the trial, maintaining the action against both defendants, was affirmed in respect to the verdict against the present appellant and the action was dismissed with costs in respect to the Standard Plumbing Company, respondents.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the judgment now reported.\nUpon the filing of this appeal by the defendant, McNichol, the plaintiff notified the company that, upon the hearing of the appeal by McNichol, she would contend that the decision of the Court of Appeal should be varied and the judgment of His Lordship Chief Justice Dubuc, entered at the trial of the action, should be restored, except as to some damages caused by the escape of water. The company had filed a factum and also appeared by counsel who was heard on the cross-appeal, subject to objection as to its competency.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada considered that, under the circumstances, it was competent for the plaintiff to cross-appeal in this manner, permitted supplementary factums to be filed by all the parties and heard counsel on their behalf upon the cross-appeal.\nNesbitt K.C. and Aikins K.C.

Wilson for the respondents, The Standard Plumbing Company.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant McNichol was, in 1904, the owner of a building in Winnipeg, and, in July of that year, the respondent, Miss Malcolm (the plaintiff in the action) leased from him part of the building for use as a millinery shop. The appellant agreed to furnish heat sufficient, at a temperature of 40 degrees below zero in the open, to maintain a temperature of 70 degrees above zero in the shop. Shortly before the respondent became his tenant, the appellant adopted a system of heating his building by means of steam to be distributed to radiators in various parts of it through pipes connected with a steam generating plant in the basement.\nIn consideration of the appellant's agreement to supply heat, the plaintiff agreed to pay in each month, from October to April inclusive, a sum of $15 in addition to the rent reserved. In December the respondent found that her shop was insufficiently heated and that in consequence she was seriously hampered in the prosecution of her business.\nIn the latter part of December in response to numerous complaints by the plaintiff, the appellant's agent employed the respondent, the Standard Plumbing Co., to place in the shop an additional radiator, by means of which it was expected that sufficient additional heat would be supplied.\nTo provide a channel for the passage of steam into this radiator, it was necessary to connect it by a pipe with the appellant\u2019s main distributing pipe; and owing to the absence of any means of isolating the branch pipes supplying individual rooms, it was necessary, while making this connection, to shut off the steam from the distributing pipe at or near the boiler.\nThe plumbing company's workmen had completed and affixed this branch pipe on the evening of the 28th of December, but finding that the radiator supplied by the appellant required alterations to adapt it to the reception of steam, and that, for this reason, they would be unable to connect it with the branch pipe that evening, inserted a valve at the end of this pipe to prevent its escape and turned on the steam. Almost immediately after this, the plaintiff observed water dripping from the ceiling of her shop. The plumbers, on being informed of this, first went to the basement and turned off the steam. The appellant's caretaker finding that he was unable to get access to the room from which the water was apparently coming, left for the purpose of getting a key from the tenant of it, and the plaintiff, being informed by the plumbers that steam would not again be turned on that night and that it would be unnecessary for her to return in order to give access to the shop, locked the door and went away. In the evening, the foreman of the plumbing company, having arranged with the caretaker to return and assist him in endeavouring to ascertain the source of the flow of water, did return and found that the caretaker, having got access to the room above the shop, had discovered that it was due to the breaking of the air valve in one of the radiators there, and had, by closing the valve attached to the pipe leading to the radiator, obviated the danger of any further escape of water. The foreman then, with the assistance of the caretaker, turned on steam in the basement. In the morning, the plaintiff's sister returning to the shop found that the valve, which the plumber had inserted in the branch pipe the day before, was open and that the shop was filled with steam, which was still escaping in considerable volume.\nThe plaintiff's goods were much damaged by steam and water and, to recover compensation for this damage, the present action was brought.\nIn my opinion, the act of turning steam into the distributing pipe, without either having taken or immediately taking steps to ascertain with certainty whether the branch pipe constructed that day leading into the plaintiff's shop was so closed as to prevent the escape of steam, was a negligent act for the consequences of which the immediate actors and those responsible for their conduct are answerable in an action. Both the plumber and the caretaker were engaged in the act of turning on the steam. That the continued escape of steam into the shop in the existing state of its temperature would lead to serious damage to the plaintiff's goods and to serious interruption of her business must have been known to both. That there was no person there to observe the escape of steam was known to the plumber and must have been known to the caretaker, if he gave the slightest attention to the subject. In these circumstances, those who undertook to expose this unfinished pipe to the access of steam under the pressure maintained on the appellant's system, for a continuous period, assumed, I think, an obligation to ascertain that this was attended with no risk of its escape. In point of fact, the operation, if proper precautions were taken, was not attended with the slightest risk. Ocular inspection alone, the steam having been turned on, would enable anybody, long before its escape in sufficient volume to cause any harm, to ascertain the fact with certainty and to prevent that harm by closing the valves at the boiler.\nI agree entirely with the view of the Court of Appeal that, in these circumstances, nothing which occurred in the afternoon absolved either the plumber or the caretaker from the duty of ascertaining the condition of the valve with certainty before the escape of steam would have time to cause serious injury.\nThe majority of the court having come to the opinion that the plaintiff's cross-appeal is competent, the real questions on the appeal are, I think, whether, for this negligent act, the responsibility can be fixed on the appellant and the plumbing company or upon either and which of them.\nFirst of the responsibility of the appellant. It is contended on his behalf that\u2014following in this, not the usual merely, but the only prudent course\u2014he employed the plumbing company as skilled persons to execute the work of placing the radiator in the plaintiff's shop and connecting it with the distributing pipe; and that this employment included shutting off the steam before commencing and the turning it on after completing the work ; and that, having committed the work to competent independent contractors, he cannot be held responsible for the negligent conduct of the contractors or their servants in the course of it.\nI have already intimated that, in my opinion, the caretaker and the plumber were jointly engaged in the act of turning on the steam which led immediately to the damage complained of. It is not, I think, a fair inference from the facts in evidence that the landlord had abandoned the control of the heating system to the plumbing company during the execution of the work they were engaged to do, and that the caretaker was merely the mechanical helper of the plumber; on the contrary, the evidence shews that the steam was turned on at the suggestion of the caretaker.\nSuch an intervention on the part of the landlord is sufficient, in my opinion, to fasten upon him responsibility for the act in which they were engaged.\nBut I cannot agree that, assuming the work in question had been committed to the control of an independent contractor, the landlord could, in the circumstances of this case, for that reason, escape responsibility. The landlord's contract was to supply heat absolutely. This, I think, clearly brought him under an obligation to see that the contract was carried out with reasonable care with a view to the object of the parties in entering into it\u2014that the demised premises should be in a fit state to enable the plaintiff to carry on her business. North Eastern Railway Co. v. Elliott[2]; Robinson v. Kilvert[3]; Aldin v. Latimer, Clark, Muirhead & Co.[4].\nWhen, then, the landlord, having broken his contract to supply heat, chose, in order to enable him to carry it out\u2014either because the existing system was deficient or because it suited him best so to proceed\u2014 to execute the work in progress when the damage occurred, he remained, I think, fully subject to the obligation referred to and consequently was bound to carry out the work in such a way as not to interrupt the tenants in their enjoyment of the premises, in so far at least as such interruption should be preventable by the exercise of reasonable care. But it is said the plaintiff specifically assented to the execution of the work and that having regard to the character of the work, there was involved in this assent the delegation of the execution of it to skilled persons and therewith an assumption of the risk of their careless or unskilful work. I think that the fact that the plaintiff assented to the work is not fairly open to dispute, but what did that assent imply? Possibly an assent to such an interruption of her use of the premises as the execution of the work in the ordinary course\u2014 that is to say, with due care and skill\u2014should entail. It is difficult to see on what ground the implication can be carried further. But it is not necessary to put the plaintiff's case so high.\nAssuming that the tenant's assent to the placing of the radiator and connecting it with the heating system implied the assumption of the risk of the failure on the part of a competent plumber to use due care and skill, in so far as the work should require the exercise of an expert plumber's skill and knowledge, I am quite unable to discover any reason for extending this implication in the circumstances of this case so far as to absolve the landlord from the duty of taking such precautions as any unskilled person could take, and the necessity of which must have been apparent to any such person applying his mind to the situation; the duty, that is to say, of seeing when steam was turned into the connecting pipe whether or not it had a way of escape into the tenant's shop. It was not, in any sense, a case in which the landlord was dependent upon expert assistance; not, for example, one of those cases in which the carelessness or the unskilfulness of the expert becomes apparent only when the resulting mischief has been accomplished.\nFrom all these considerations, the duty to see that such precautions were taken, appears to me to arise inevitably from the landlord's contractual relation with his tenant; and to be involved in the responsibility undertaken by him in assuming to execute the work in question for the purpose of enabling him to carry out his contract. I am unable to distinguish the case in principle from cases where works are executed under a statutory obligation.\nThere remains the question of the responsibility of the Standard Plumbing Co. I have already said that in my opinion the act of the company's foreman in turning on the steam was, in the circumstances, a negligent act. The Court of Appeal has taken the view that in this he was the servant of the landlord only, and that consequently the plumbing company is not responsible. With great respect, and after some hesitation, I cannot agree with this view. I think he was acting in the course of his employment in what he did, although he did it at the request of the caretaker. Moreover, I am not satisfied that the view of the trial judge upon the evidence to the effect that the valve not being closed was due to the neglect of the foreman plumber or his assistant is erroneous.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, Robson & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent,\nMalcolm : Hudson, Howell,\nOrmond & Marlatt.\nSolicitors for the respondents,\nThe Standard Plumbing Co.: Hough, Campbell & Ferguson.\n[1] 16 Man.

Two days before giving the notes, R. had signed an agreement setting out the bargain, in which the following provisions appeared\u2014\"And for the purpose of further securing payment of the price of the said machinery and interest * * * the purchaser agrees to deliver to the vendor, at the time of the delivery of the said machinery as herein provided or upon demand, a mortgage on the said lands (i.e. lands described at the foot of the agreement), in the statutory form containing also the special covenants and provisions in the mortgages usually taken by the vendors. And the purchaser hereby further agrees with the said vendors that the vendors shall have a charge and a specific lien for the amount of the purchase money and interest, or the said amount of the purchase price, less the amount realized, etc., should the vendors take and re-sell the said machinery * * * and any other land the purchaser now owns or shall hereafter own or be interested in, until the said purchase money and all costs, charges, damages and expenses, and any and all notes or renewals thereof, shall have been fully paid, and the said lands are hereby charged with the payment of the said purchase money, obligations, notes and all renewals thereof, and interest and all costs, charges, damages and expenses as herein provided, and, for the purpose of securing the same, the purchaser hereby grants to the vendors the said lands * * * And, on default, all moneys hereby secured shall at once become due, and all powers and other remedies hereby given shall be enforceable.\" In an action to recover the amount of the notes past due and to have a decree for a lien and charge upon the lands therefor under the agreement.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the right of the company to enforce the lien depended upon the interpretation of the whole contract; that the provision as to the lien only became operative in the case of a complete delivery pursuant to the contract, and that the alternative words \"or upon demand\" must be taken as meaning upon a demand made after such complete delivery.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, affirming the judgment of His Lordship Chief Justice Debuc, at the trial, in favour of the plaintiffs for the sum of $809.50 and for a lien therefor upon the lands described in the statement of claim.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington now-reported.\nW. Bedford Mulock K.C. for the appellant.\nC. P. Wilson and A. E. Hoskin for the respondents.\nGirouard J.\u2014While concurring with my brother Idington in his reasons for allowing this appeal, I cannot assent to the reservations he makes of any other remedies the respondents may have. I prefer to leave them to work out such remedies which are not disposed of by our judgment as they may be advised.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by my brother Girouard.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal is from the Court of King's Bench for Manitoba, which was equally divided on an appeal from the learned trial judge's judgment for the respondents. The respondents sold the appellant an entire outfit of second hand threshing machinery for the sum of f 1,400 and took from the appellant three so-called promissory notes of equal sums covering the entire price agreed upon. Though these instruments are in the pleadings called promissory notes, I doubt if they are such in law.\nThe appellant also had signed, two days before giving these, an agreement setting forth the bargain between him and the respondents and, in this agreement, the following provision appears:\nAnd for the purpose of further securing payment of the price of the said machinery and interest, and of all loss, costs, charges, expenses and damages as herein provided, and of the costs of drawing and registering the mortgage, the purchaser agrees to deliver to the vendor, at the time of the delivery of the said machinery as herein provided or upon demand, \u00e0 mortgage on the said lands in the statutory form containing also the special covenants and provisions in the mortgages usually taken by the vendors. And the purchaser hereby further agrees with the said vendors that the vendors shall have a charge and a specific lien for the amount of the purchase money and interest, or the said amount of the purchase price, less the amount realized by the said vendors after deducting the costs, charges and expenses aforesaid, should the vendors take and re-sell the said machinery under the foregoing powers, whether such amount be considered liquidated damages or the purchase money or price, or the balance thereof, upon the said lands, and any other land the purchaser now owns or shall hereafter own or be interested in, until the said purchase money and all costs, charges, damages and expenses, and any or all notes or renewals thereof, shall have been fully paid, and the said lands are hereby charged with the payment of the said purchase money, obligations, notes and all renewals thereof, and interest and all costs, charges, damages and expenses as herein provided, and for the purpose of securing the same, the purchaser hereby grants to the vendors the said lands. And the said purchaser will pay all taxes, rates, incumbrances or any charges upon said lands from time to time, as the same should be paid, and in the event of the vendors paying at any time any premiums, rates, taxes, incumbrances, or any charge upon said premises (they, the vendors, shall be subrogated to the position and rights of the party to whom the payment is made), the amount thereof, with interest thereon at ten per cent. per annum until re-payment shall be a lien and charge upon the said lands, and shall be payable forthwith to the vendors, without demand or notice and, on default, all moneys hereby secured shall at once become due, and all powers and other remedies hereby given shall be enforceable.\nThe lands are described at the foot of the agreement.\nThe action is to recover the amount of the notes past due and to have a lien and charge upon the said lands for the sum of $1,344 still owing and unpaid under the said agreement, etc., etc.\nThe entire outfit of machinery bargained for never was delivered by the respondents to the appellant. Very substantial parts thereof needed for immediate use were removed by some prior lien-holder. Some parts never came to the appellant's hands. Other parts came into the possession of the appellant and were tested by him and found wanting in that efficiency he was entitled to expect under the terms of his bargain, and had he notified the respondents of this, he would, apparently, have been entirely freed from any liability of any sort arising out of the bargain. Instead of doing so, he dealt with the matter in such a way that he may have incurred some liability.\nThe question now raised is independent of that and as to the right of the respondents to enforce the lien called for under the provision above quoted. It must be determined by the interpretation of the whole contract and especially this provision, neither of which anticipate changes in the original bargain.\nI am of the opinion that the said provision will only become operative in the case of a complete delivery pursuant to such a bargain.\nSuch, as I read it, is the express language of the contract. The alternative \"or upon demand'' must be taken to mean upon demand after the delivery.\nIt certainly would surprise any buyer signing any such agreement to have a demand for a mortgage made upon him at the execution of such an agreement which might only provide for a delivery months after the signing.\nThe later words regarding a lien upon the lands must, when we consider the scope of the provision, be held to be governed by what precedes them. They are merely intended to cover the same property when a mortgage has not been asked and mean no more than that, in default of the mortgage being given, a lien will be held to have been created by the delivery; or, in other words, by the complete fulfilment by the vendors of their part of the bargain, no alternative modification of the original bargain and sale being provided for by the agreement.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the alleged lien declared never to have existed and the claim for and action to enforce it be dismissed.\nThe appellant, however, dealt with the respondent in relation to some parts of the machinery in such a way that he may be liable to pay as for goods sold and delivered or otherwise.\nThe appellant may have some explanation in regard to this phase of the dealing that may relieve him from such liability.\nThe respondents may also have some right to place their claim in quite a different light than that presented herein.\nThey refused to amend or ask leave to amend and put any sort of alternative claim in such a way before the court below as to enable us properly to adjudicate upon it, and, I think, they must abide the result of doing so.\nI do not feel that we can here give them relief by way of judgment as asked on the notes past due. The questions raised by the elimination of the question of lien, leave the claim upon the notes above as apparently or imperfectly untried. A reference back seemed to me at first possible, but I see nothing to be saved or gained thereby on the whole.\nAll rights the respondents may have outside of the claim to enforce the lien or mortgage claim on the land must be reserved to the respondents.\nIn dismissing the action, as it seems we must do with costs, it should be declared to be without prejudice to the rights of the respondents against the appellant for anything save and except the right or claim to enforce the alleged lien or claim for a mortgage.\nIn assuming that the respondents may have some other remedy of such a nature as I have indicated, it must be clearly understood that I have formed and pass no opinion in favour thereof or against it.\nThe case, in that regard, has only been considered by me so far as to see if, upon this record, we could here properly give any relief.\nIt seems quite impossible to deal effectively and properly with anything but the alleged claim for mortgage or lien.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs, including costs of appeal in the court below.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by my brother Girouard. Duff J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs and dismissing the action with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mulock & Loftus.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Campbell, Pitblado, Hoskin & Grundy.\n"}

(1897), c. 147, s. 3(1).\nMcG., a merchant in insolvent circumstances, although not aware of that fact, sold his stock-in-trade and deposited the cheque received for the price to the credit of his account with a private banker to whom he was indebted, at the time, upon an overdue promissory note that had been, without his knowledge, charged against his account a few days before the sale. Within two days after making the deposit, McG. gave the banker his cheque to cover the amount of the note. In an action to have the transfer of the cheque, so deposited, set aside as preferential and void.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (13 Ont. L.R. 232) that the transaction was a payment to a creditor within the meaning of the statute, R.S.O. (1897) ch. 147, sec. 3, sub\u2011sec, 1, which was not, under the circumstances, void as against creditors.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Divi- sional Court[2], and the judgment of Falconbridge C.J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action to set aside an alleged preferential transfer was dismissed with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note, and are also referred to in the report of the judgment, on 2nd April, 1907[3], dismissing a motion to quash the appeal.\nGeorge C. Gibbons, for the appellants.\nMeredith K.C. and Brewster for the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal is from the Court of Appeal for Ontario upholding a judgment of a Divisional Court of that province and a judgment of the learned trial judge in a creditors\u2019 suit to set aside a transfer by the debtor of a cheque received within sixty days from the attack thus made on the transaction.\nIn the Divisional Court the late Mr. Justice Street dissented and gave some strong reasons to shew that the prim\u00e2 facie presumption created by the Revised Statutes of Ontario (1897), ch. 147, against such assignments by an insolvent or one on the eve of insolvency was not rebutted.\nEven if the difficulties in the way of the creditors here, arising from the semblance of the transaction to the case of payment, which is not within the statute, could be got over, I fear we cannot, since the case of Baldocchi v. Spada[4], recently decided in this court, interfere with the judgment of the court below. The comparison seems to me somewhat as follows:\nThe debtor there was shewn clearly to have been so hopelessly insolvent that, after his estate was depleted by something over $4,100 worth of stock transferred to the preferred creditor, the other creditors would not realize more than a few cents on the dollar.\nHere the proof is not so clear. The learned trial judge credited the debtor when he swore that he did not believe he was in fact insolvent at the date of the transaction.\nThe total debts were small and would have been wiped out by sales of the debtor\u2019s real estate, at values for which it had been assessed, and otherwise valued at.\nAgain, the preferred creditor there was the creditor for money lent and long past due and the guarantor to the bank for his debtor and here the note was past due to the banker.\nThere the guarantor had been called on to make good his guarantee to the sum of nearly $2,000 and the debtor could not meet his debt but promised he would in a month, just as the debtor here did. In both cases forbearance was shewn for some weeks before the alleged preferential assignments in question were made.\nThere the creditor was so alarmed that he ad- mitted under oath he had \u201cfelt funny and afraid\u201d when default was made.\nHere the creditor swears that he did not believe the debtor was insolvent and that he considered him solvent. This he swore to with the knowledge derived from a statement of the debtor\u2019s affairs given him some time before, and the debtor who had given this statement was recognized by him and admitted by appellants\u2019 counsel at the trial to be an honest man.\nThe debtor in the other case was the reverse of this and indeed fled just after the alleged preferential transfer and his creditor contented himself with not inquiring though he had felt \u201cfunny and afraid\u201d for a month before.\nThe evidence here may, in the last analysis, rest on rather too sanguine estimates but, beyond that, seems credible.\nThe usual course of business between the parties was observed here, but there, as between the parties, there was a clear departure therefrom.\nThe evidence in the Baldocchi Case[5] I dealt with in my opinion therein.\nAs I intimated there, I would have preferred seeing the parties claiming under such preferences held to a different standard.\nThis case may not be quite satisfactory but the claim of Garborino in the above case having been upheld with much less to rest upon than that of the respondent, I do not see how I can, in view of these features common to both, refuse to uphold this judgment.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs. MACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree to the dismissal of the appeal. I think it unnecessary to add anything to the reasons given in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gibbons, Harper & Gibbons.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Blewett & Bray.\n[1] 13 Ont.

L.R. 144), was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Mulock C.J. at the trial[2], by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed without costs.\nThe action was brought to restrain the defendants from continuing an alleged infringement of the trade- mark \u201cshur-on\u201d claimed by the plaintiffs as their registered trade-mark as applied to eye-glass frames, sold by them as traders in optical goods, by the use of the coined word or term \u201csta\u2011zon,\u201d as applied to similar optical goods sold by the defendants, and to restrain them from fraudulently counterfeiting the plaintiffs\u2019 goods and from selling such similar goods with the brand, label or description \u201csta-zon,\u201d for an account in the usual manner and for damages.\nAt the trial, Mulock C.J. held that there was no similarity in the terms in question calculated to mislead the public and that there had been no infringement of a trade-mark. This decision was affirmed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from which the present appeal is asserted by the plaintiffs.\nThe questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgment of His Lordship, Mr. Justice Davies, now reported.\nCassels K.C. and McIntosh for the appellants.\nJ.H. Moss and C.A. Moss for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the court below.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am for dismissing this appeal on both grounds on which it was sought to be supported, viz.\u2014the infringement of a trade-mark and the fraudulent counterfeiting of plaintiffs\u2019 goods. I do not think either of the words or distortions of words \u201cShur-on\u201d or \u201cSta-zon\u201d is merely an inventive word which could be used as a trade-mark.\nOn the contrary, I hold these terms to be merely corruptions of words descriptive of the eye\u2011glass frames to which they were intended to be applied\u2014and that they were intended to be so descriptive. They cannot therefore be properly trade-marks.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Osler that neither visually nor phonetically are these words, or distortions of words, alike, and I do not think that the mere use of \u201cSta-zon\u201d as applied to their eye-glass frames by the respondents was calculated to mislead purchasers into the belief that they were buying plaintiffs\u2019 goods, which they had advertised under their trade-mark or tradename of \u201cShur-on.\u201d The idea intended to be conveyed by the use of these corruptions of words may have been the same, but the fact that there is a common idea underlying the use of both words or corruptions and intending to describe some special merit in the article would not of itself be sufficient to enable plaintiffs to maintain the action. He could not pre-empt nor claim the exclusive use of the idea descriptive of some merit in the article. The very fact of it being descriptive and not inventive would be fatal to its validity as a trade-mark, while, if not descriptive, his only claim, on the ground of the fraudulently passing off of defendants\u2019 goods as his, lay in the use of a word which, as I agree, is neither visually or phonetically like the word he claimed as his trade-mark or name, and is not calculated to mislead the purchasing public into the belief that they were obtaining plaintiffs\u2019 eye-glass frames.\nIn many of the cases cited the question as to the passing off of one man\u2019s goods for those of another turned upon the appearance of the goods or the pack- ages in which they were wrapped as they were put upon the market or upon other misleading methods adopted.\nAnd if the defendants here had by advertising or otherwise adopted means which would mislead the public into the belief that in buying their goods they were really buying plaintiffs\u2019, they would have brought themselves within the well-known rule relating to passing off goods.\nBut the case turns entirely upon the use of the word \u201cSta-zon\u201d instead of \u201cShur-on\u201d and the contention that the use of the former word would mislead the public into the belief that they were purchasing the plaintiffs\u2019 goods known under the name of \u201cShur-on.\u201d\nFor the reasons given I do not think it would.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think, for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Osler, in the court below, which though brief cover all the grounds upon which the action might, by any possibility, on the evidence before us, have been rested in either alternative put before us, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in dismissing the appeal for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Macdonald & Macintosh.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aylesworth, Wright, Moss & Thompson.\n[1] 13 Ont.

The indorser lived at Richibucto, N.B. Notice of dishonour of the first note was mailed to the indorser at Richibucto, and, at the same time, the protest was sent by the holders to an agent at Halifax, N.S., instructing him to take the necessary steps to obtain payment. The agent, on the same day that he received the protest and instructions. sent, by post, notice of dishonour to the indorser at Richibucto. As the other notes fell due, the holders sent them and the protests, by the first packet from London to Canada, to the same agent, at Halifax, by whom the notices of dishonour were forwarded to the indorse at Richibucto.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the sending of the notice of dishonour of the first note direct from London to Richibucto, with the precaution of also sending it through the agent was an indication that the holders were not aware of the correct address of the indorser and the fact that they used the proper address was not conclusive of their knowledge or sufficient to compel an inference imputing such knowledge to them. Therefore, the notices in respect to the other notes, sent through the agent, were sufficient.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the holders had failed to shew that they had adopted the most expeditious mode of having the notices of dishonour given to the indorser. The maker of the note gave evidence of an offer to the holders to settle his indebtedness, on certain terms and at a time some two or three years later than the maturity of the last note, and that the same was agreed to by the holders. The latter, in their evidence, denied such agreement and testified that, in all the negotiations, they had informed the maker that they would do nothing whatever in any way to release the indorser.\nHeld that the evidence did not shew that there was any agreement by the holders to give time to the maker and the indorser was not discharged. If the existence of an agreement could be gathered from the evidence, it was without consideration and the creditors rights against the sureties were reserved.\nPer Idington and Duff JJ. that a demand note given in renewal of a time note and accepted by the holders is not a giving of time to the maker by which the indorser is discharged.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (37 N.B. Rep. 630), reversed.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], affirming the judgment of His Lordship, Chief Justice Tuck, at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the questions at issue on this appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nTeed K.C. for the appellants.\nW. D. Carter for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is allowed with costs. I concur in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal arises in an action brought by the appellants the payees of four promissory notes given to them by George K. McLeod, all dated at St. John, N.B., 1892, falling due respectively September 30th, 1893. 1894, 1895 and 1896, and all indorsed by respondent W. H. McLeod. The first three are for \u00a31625 sterling each, and the last one for \u00a31705 16s. sterling.\nThe defendant in his pleas denied (1) presentation; (2) notice of dishonour; and alleged; (3) an agreement by the appellant with the maker, Geo. K. McLeod, to give him time for payment of all the notes whereby respondent as surety became discharged; and (4) payment.\nThe appellants are merchants carrying on business in London, England, and it is conceded that the notes as they respectively fell due were properly presented and protested for non-payment.\nThe substantial contests are whether or not proper notices of dishonour were sent to respondent and whether or not, even if so, he was discharged by a valid agreement between appellants and the maker of the notes, Geo. K. McLeod, giving him time for payment.\nIt appears in evidence that the defendant, respondent, lives in Richibucto, New Brunswick, but there is no evidence of knowledge by the appellants of that fact, unless the inference of such knowledge should be drawn from the fact that when the first note fell due a notice of the dishonour of the same was sent to defendant by the appellants, from London, the following day, addressed to Richibucto. At the same time and by the same mail, the appellants forwarded the protest of the non-payment of that note to their agent, the manager of the Merchants' Bank of Halifax, Nova Scotia, instructing him to take the\nnecessary preliminary steps to obtain from the maker and from respondent W. H. McLeod, payment of the note. Pursuant to these instructions Duncan, their agent, on the same day that he received by mail this letter from appellants, in Halifax, sent by post notice of dishonour to W. H. McLeod at Richibucto. The fact of the appellants having taken the precaution of sending the protested note to their agent Duncan in Halifax, and having a notice of dishonour sent by him to McLeod, rather rebuts the inference sought to be drawn from the sending of the notice to him from London to Richibucto direct and indicates an uncertainty on the part of the appellants as to McLeod's proper address which goes to rebut knowledge. The fact that they hit upon the proper address is by no means conclusive of their knowledge, or sufficient to compel an inference imputing such knowledge to them. With respect to all the other three notes the practice adopted by appellants was to send the dishonoured note and protest by the \"first Canadian mail leaving London for Canada\" after the day of the dishonour of the note, to their agent Duncan the manager of the Merchants' Bank, Halifax, by whom notices of dishonour were forwarded to defendant.\nThe evidence of Wrampe, the appellants' clerk, with respect to the forwarding of these letters from London on the dishonour of the first note leaves no room for doubt on that point. He says, speaking of the notices sent with respect to the first note:\nThe mail direct for Canada closed on Thursdays. There was no mail leaving for Canada between Sept. 30th and Oct. 4th, so that both of these letters C.H.C. 6 and C.H.C. 7 were posted in time to catch the first mail leaving for Canada after Sept. 30th.\nHis evidence with respect to the sending of the protests of the other three dishonoured notes to Duncan at Halifax to have the notices of dishonour sent to McLeod is to the same effect, namely, that they were posted in time \"for the first mail leaving for Canada after the note became due.\" The evidence of Ferand, an official of the general post-office, London, was to the same effect, so far as proving the days when the mail left England for Canada direct. These witnesses were not cross-examined and the only evidence given even suggesting that these mails by which the protested notes were forwarded to Duncan were not the first mails leaving London for Canada after the dishonour of the notes was that of Geo. K. McLeod who of late years had lived in New York and did not profess to have accurate knowledge on the subject. He says that, so far as his knowledge was concerned,\nmails leave London for North America, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday as a rule and that (he should think) three-quarters of the Canadian mails came by way of New York.\nBut whether he was speaking with reference to the postal arrangements of the year when his evidence was given or to the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896, when the notices were sent does not appear.\nI have no hesitation in holding on this evidence that the appellants cannot be held to have had knowledge of the defendant W. H. McLeod's address ; that they were therefore justified in forwarding the protests of the dishonour of the notes to their agent Duncan in Halifax in order to have the necessary inquiries made and notices of dishonour sent to his proper address, and if as a consequence of so forwarding these protests and notes to their agent any necessary delay occurred (of which fact I am bound to say I see no evidence) the appellants were justified and excused under the law of England which is the law applicable to this case in respect to such delay. Duncan's evidence is clear and undoubted that he forwarded on from Halifax to McLeod at Richibucto the proper notices of dishonour the same day he received the protests in each case from the plaintiffs in London, and there is the further evidence from the post-office clerk at Richibucto of the day the defendant McLeod took the notices out of the post-office at Richibucto they being registered notices. The evidence given on these points, in my opinion, satisfies the requirements of the law as to the giving of proper notices of dishonour and no evidence beyond the quite unsatisfactory general statement of Geo. K. McLeod was given with respect either to the knowledge by appellants of his brother's address or as to the mails leaving London for Canada. W. H. McLeod himself was not examined as a witness.\nThen with respect to the defence that there was an agreement between the appellants and the maker of the note Geo. K. McLeod whereby the latter was given time for payment, I am quite unable to conclude that any such agreement existed.\nIt appears Geo. K. McLeod was in London in the autumn of 1898 negotiating with the appellants for a settlement of his account with them. These negotiations continued for some time until, as McLeod in his evidence says, they culminated in a letter written by him on 12th December, 1898, to the appellants which was put in evidence. This letter professes to state certain terms of settlement as having been proposed by appellants to McLeod which he says he will accept; amongst them was the payment by McLeod of a much smaller sum than he admittedly owed appellants\nin full and final settlement of the indebtedness to your firm of my brother and myself. The letter winds up with the following:\nYou will agree to give me an extended time of payment of sum agreed upon until Dec. 31st, 1900, by which date this settlement is to be finally completed by me. If you will kindly confirm the terms as herein stated you will oblige me.\nThere was no written confirmation of the terms stated or proposed in this letter, but McLeod says that he had several subsequent interviews with the appellants and that at one of these the partner with whom he was negotiating consented to accept these terms of settlement.\nThe trial of the case was postponed after this evidence to enable the evidence of appellants to be obtained on this point and that of John Fleming, the senior partner in the firm was obtained by Commission and read in evidence when the hearing was resumed. In his evidence Mr. Fleming says, that his firm had\nprovisionally agreed in March, 1898, to accept the sum of \u00a33,25.0 plus interest in settlement of Geo. K. McLeod and William H, McLeod and George McLeod's indebtedness, but George K. McLeod wanted to reduce this amount as stated in his letter of 12th December, 1898, now before the ,court. Robinson Fleming & Co. (appellants) never at any time either in writing or verbally agreed to any such desired reduction and they rejected the proposal made in the letter of 12th December, 1898.\nHe goes on to state further that in all the negotiations his firm informed McLeod they\nwould do nothing whatever in any way to release William McLeod or George McLeod, Sr.\nuntil whatever sum which might be agreed upon as a compromise was paid in cash, and he produced another letter to his firm from Geo. K. McLeod dated 1st Sept., 1899, which was read in evidence wherein he, McLeod, withdraws his previous letter of 12th December, 1898, the terms of which he had stated had been accepted, and submitted new and different proposals for settlement and amongst them one that he George\nengaged to do his best to get necessary consents of W. H. McLeod and of his father (and any other necessary parties if any) to this proposed settlement.\nFleming further states that\nAll these negotiations with Geo. K. McLeod were merely proposals and without prejudice to Robinson Fleming & Co., and it was continuously clearly understood that W. H. McLeod's responsibility as endorser remained intact till Robinson, Fleming & Co., were in receipt of the cash.\nGeo. K. McLeod was personally present at the adourned hearing of the case. He was then further ex-mined on behalf of the defendant and stated that he had heard Mr. Fleming's evidence taken on commission end. He gives however no contradiction of any kind to the specific statements of Mr. Fleming which I have met out above or any explanation or statement respecting them.\nWith this letter of Geo. K. McLeod's in evidence of the date 1st Sept., 1899, unexplained, withdrawing his previous offer of 12th December, 1898, which he had previously stated appellants had accepted, and with the uncontradicted evidence of Mr. John Fleming denying that the negotiations had resulted in any settled agreement or that they were anything more than mere proposals of Geo. K. McLeod's which, if carried out, they were willing to accept and explicitly stating that \"it was clearly continuously understood\" by all parties that W. H. McLeod's responsibility as indorser was to remain intact, I cannot entertain any doubt upon this branch of the case. I conclude from the evidence clearly that there was no binding agreement of compromise made between appellants and Geo. K. McLeod whereby he was given time for payment of the debt he owed appellants; that if any such agreement could be spelled out of the evidence the reservation of appellants' rights against the sureties was a part of it ; and that in, any event the suggested agreement was without consideration and not binding.\nSee as to the reservation of rights against sureties, Gorman v. Dixon[2].\nThere remains only the question of the balance due upon the notes sued on. No difference of opinion apparently exists as to the credits to which Geo. K. McLeod is entitled in his accounts with the appellants. But there is a dispute as to the manner in which these credits ought to be appropriated having reference to the notes and defendant's liability upon them. As we have all the materials before us to enable us to deal with the point in dispute there is no reason for referring the case back again in order to have the proper calculations and appropriations made.\nCounsel on both sides have submitted statements shewing how the balance would stand if the accounts are made up according to their several contentions. When once the defendant's liability on the four notes sued on is determined the only substantial difference of opinion seems to be whether the first payments received by the appellants should be appropriated to the payment of the interest due under the agreement of the 2nd November, 1891, in pursuance of which agreement these notes were given or whether the defendant has the right to have these payments strictly appropriated to the notes ignoring the interest payable under the agreement.\nI do not think there can be any reasonable doubt on the point. The 5th and 13th clauses of the agreement seem conclusive that interest is to be calculated and payable upon the amount of the account as then settled every six months, and that any moneys collected from insurance for total loss on any of the properties referred to in the agreement\nshould be applied in liquidation of first payments due by Geo. K. McLeod under this agreement.\nThe first moneys due were the half yearly accruing interest and the account should be settled upon that basis, and the moneys collected from insurances on total loss\nappropriated first to the payment of this interest as provided by the agreement.\nI think also that they should be settled on the basis of a debt of \u00a36,580 only as due by Geo. K. McLeod to appellants, namely, the \u00a35,000 cash advance and the old debt of Geo. McLeod, Sen., of \u00a31,500, and excluding the subsequent advances of \u00a31,600 made by appellants to Geo. K. McLeod.\nCalculated on this basis the balance due on the notes and for which the appellants are entitled to recover I think amounts to the sum of $30,717.57 up to the 1st day of June, 1907, as submitted by appellants' counsel in one of his tabulated statements.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts and for the purpose of arriving at the actual balance due and recoverable by appellants on the notes sued on a reference should be made to the Registrar of this court, and judgment entered for the amount found to be due by him on the basis above referred to together with costs as above.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellants sued the respondent as indorser upon four promissory notes which fell due in the years 1893, 1894, 1895, 1896, respectively. His chief defences are want of notice of dishonour and that time was given the maker of the notes by a binding agreement for the payment of the said notes.\nIt seems that the principal debtor was unable to pay his debts in full and sought to compromise with the appellants or their predecessor in title in regard to the debts represented by the notes now sued upon. It is alleged by the principal debtor in his evidence that there was, incidentally to the negotiations therefor, such an agreement as set up. I doubt whether what he says was sufficiently definite to constitute an agreement. Besides there evidently was no consideration for any agreement down to the proposal of 1st. September, 1899, and he is contradicted as to what he alleges prior to that date.\nThe proposal of September, 1899, was followed by the acceptance of a deed and a demand note from the principal debtor to the plaintiffs.\nThe question is raised whether we can fairly infer from the whole of the evidence, including the letter of September, that an understanding had been come to, that time would be extended until the 31st December, 1900 (the time for payment of the \u00a33,250 which was to be taken in satisfaction of the entire debt), in consideration of George K. McLeod giving his demand note and the deed of the property. I am, after giving it the best consideration I can, unable to infer therefrom any agreement for time. Amongst other considerations that press upon me in consideration of this question, I think it is clearly implied in the letter that the creditors had not, up to the date of the letter, accepted, or intended to accept any proposition by which they would release the sureties.\nCan we infer from the giving of the deed to facilitate future sales of property, applicable to the liquidation of the debt, that the demand note referred to was to be demanded only at some future time? We may suspect that such was the arrangement in consideration of getting the deed. I cannot see my way to infer it as a fact. See Twopenny v. Young[3], in features of fact not unlike this. Then, is a renewal by demand note a giving of time?\nThe renewal by a promissory note payable at a future date assuredly is in itself a giving of time.\nBut how can a demand note which is instantly due the moment delivered, and can be sued upon then, and upon which the statute of limitations runs from the date or instant of delivery, if they differ and delivery be later, be held to be a giving of time?\nIf the demand note, either by expressions on its face, importing necessity of a future demand, or by agreement outside of it, was not instantly payable, the defendant should have so shewn to maintain his plea.\nI think the defendant fails on this branch of the case.\nThen we come to the defence of want of notice of dishonour. It is conceded that it fails on the facts regarding the first note.\nThe facts relative to the notice of dishonour given in respect of the other notes require more consideration. It is not alleged in evidence that the address of the indorser was unknown to the holders when the notes respectively fell due. It cannot be so inferred. No one has asked us to do so. To get the benefit of such ignorance by way of excuse it must be affirmatively proven.\nThe address of the indorser was known and acted upon when the first note was protested and, as it remained unpaid the knowledge, I would presume, continued, especially as the address was in fact the same throughout and the same parties held the other notes as they fell due.\nThe appellants' knowledge and means of acquiring further knowledge of the indorser's address were such that I am surprised that we have no attempt at explanation of why these means were not used or this knowledge acted upon. The same clerk who gives evidence as to what was done in relation to the protesting and notice of dishonour seems to have been in charge of that part of the business during the whole time, and I have no doubt knew the address or he would have excused himself in his evidence.\nThe Halifax agent was not specifically asked regarding indorser's address or residence as he would have been if want of knowledge of residence had troubled the holders. Clearly, the holders ignored the necessity for notice of dishonour and seemed to suppose something else was needed.\nInstead, however, of sending a notice of dishonour to that address which was known, none was sent in respect of the three later notes from London, in England, where they fell due.\nWe find in reported cases many unusual methods to have been adopted in transmitting notice to indorsers, but none upheld that were not shewn to have been the result of ignorance of the address or at least as expeditious as if sent by the ordinary mail service from the place of dishonour.\nHere the method adopted was simply to have the note protested without the usual notice to indorsers of its dishonour and then the protest and note were sent by mail to an agent in Halifax with instructions to do what was necessary to collect and protect the legal rights of the holders. When the agent at Halifax received these instructions there, he sent, on the respective days on which he received them, a dunning letter by mail from Halifax to the defendant at Richibucto, where he lived, notifying him. Whether the dates of the respective receipts by the agent at Halifax of such instructions were the same day as mail reached Halifax, we are left to guess.\nThere is no evidence of how long it would have taken these notices, if mailed in London, as they should have been, on the respective dates of protest, directed to the defendant at Richibucto, to have reached there.\nNor is there anything to shew how long it would, in the ordinary course of mail service between Halifax and Richibucto, have taken the notices, mailed as they were at Halifax, to have reached Richibucto, or the defendant at Richibucto, in the respective years of such mailing. We are, in short, without any means of comparison between the time of transmission by proper methods and those which were adopted.\nHow can we, without some evidence shewing ignorance of residence or address, or that the irregular or unusual method resulted or probably resulted in defendant's receipt of such notices within the same time as if the business had been properly attended to, assume what we are asked to assume in order to over- come the defence in question?\nThe burthen of proving notices or excusing want of such rested on the appellants and, when they chose, without excuse, to adopt an unusual method, they were bound to shew that it was quite as effective in regard to time as if they had adopted the ordinary and proper method.\nI have tried to get from a tabulation and comparison of the postal results in evidence something to help, but the meagre data we have renders it hopeless.\nWhen I consider that the only evidence we have leaves us entirely in the dark as to the course of transmission of the mails from England to Canada, it is, I respectfully submit, absurd to try and give effect to notices from Halifax.\nFor aught I know, or appears in evidence, the notices of dishonour, if they had been mailed properly in London, might have reached Richibucto before they could have reached Halifax. A table is given of dates of closing in London of certain mails. Whether the \"direct packet for Canada\" spoken of in the evidence means a vessel for Halifax or Quebec or Montreal, I know not. Where such packet's mail bags for Halifax, in those years in question, would have been dropped in Canada, I do not know and am not told. If dropped elsewhere than at Halifax, it does not appear whether or not there were direct means of transmission from that point to Richibucto without going via Halifax. Why was Halifax selected for the purpose of following or finding a man that was last heard of at Richibucto in another province than where Halifax is? Are we to assume, without proof or a tittle of evidence, that notice re-mailed, for example, from Winni- peg or elsewhere to Richibucto or any other place in the wide Dominion of Canada would be proper and be held good? Are we to assume diligence in selecting Halifax instead of, say Saint John, either to find the man or his address?\nIn going via Halifax, we are not told how much time would have been lost by re-sorting, or by re-sorting and delivering there, before a re-mailing by Mr. Duncan, the plaintiffs' agent, could take place. Can we assume that Mr. Duncan was at home on each occasion and received on each occasion the several instructions so sent so soon as mail reached Halifax?\nCan we venture under such circumstances to say that the most expeditious way was adopted, even if it were proper to adopt an irregular means of transmission? For aught that appears, a re-mailing from Quebec or Saint John, or any other place than Halifax might have been more expeditious than a re-mailing at Halifax.\nIn the face of the positive neglect in London, which I have pointed out, in regard to trying to find the indorsees address, and the facts that we have not a single precedent that I can find, for adopting such peculiar means of inquiry for a man's address and such postal means of transmission as were adopted here, and of what we know such postal interruption means, in handling and re-mailing, I fear it would be going rather far to uphold this notice, without evidence clearly shewing it was the best that could have been done.\nChief Justice Tuck points out that the usual mail route from London to the Province of New Brunswick is by way of New York and coupling mail service that way with what is in evidence as to mail direct to Canada there would be four mails each week from London. In view of what transpired in court, when Mr. McLeod was giving his evidence on that point, and that counsel did not object to the learned Chief Justice intimating his right to act upon what was common knowledge to him and to them, I am inclined to think, in view of the silence conceding consent, that he was entitled to use such general knowledge as he possessed, though possibly not strictly, in legal phraseology, \"common knowledge.\" Certainly he was in a better position to know than we. He had some warrant for doing so from what transpired in court. We have none for using what information we can get on the subject.\nWithout saying that the case of Muilman v. D'Eguino[4], is no longer law, I may be permitted to remark that a good many changes have taken place in this world since that decision. Its bearing may need reviewing.\nThe only remaining question is whether or not the first of these four notes has been paid.\nThe notes were given pursuant to an agreement in writing of 2nd November, 1891, between George K. McLeod and Robinson, Fleming & Co., to whom George K. McLeod's father was indebted in the sum of \u00a31,580 16s. And in consideration of George K. McLeod assuming the debt, Robinson, Fleming & Co. were to advance him \u00a36,000. It was agreed that defendant should become indorser for the notes which were to be given for the entire sum including old debt and new advance. The agreement provided for the payments of this entire sum being by \u00a31,000 on or before 30th September, 1892, and four equal payments in each succeeding year thereafter.\nOwing to a fire destroying part of the security, which the agreement also provided for being given, the proposed advance of \u00a36,000 was cut down to \u00a35,000.\nThat left a debt of \u00a36,580 l8s. to be paid and the four notes now in question of \u00a31,625 each were given therefor on 30th January, 1893.\nI observe they would not exactly cover it, but also observe that no explanation is given and no point made of the fact. Some allowance in the way of rebate or interest between the date of agreement and advance is probably the explanation of this discrepancy.\nThe defendant was, beyond all question, a surety. He was entitled, as surety, to have the moneys derived from any securities his principal gave for the debt, applied to the payment of what he had become surety for, and to be thereby discharged.\nTo secure these debts, the principal mortgaged vessels, and other property, and in compliance with the agreement, insured vessels so mortgaged. The result was the receipt by appellants of $6,801.79, \u00a3423 9s. of which was received 22nd April, 1894, and \u00a3960 of it, 25th May, 1894.\nI venture to hold, notwithstanding Mr. John Fleming's sworn interpretation of clause 13 of the agreement, that this money, as well as that received later, was applicable to, and only to, the payment of the said note which was the only one then past due, saving any question of appropriation for interest on the whole, which the agreement, by paragraph 5, provides is to be paid at 5 per cent. every six months.\nAfter this, in the same spring of 1895, another property known as the Kouchibouguac property, applicable in the same way, was sold for $3,250. Though not a cash sale, I think, as between parties to this suit, it must be treated as if cash, as the appellants took for the credit part of it an interest-bearing mortgage to themselves.\nIn this way it is clear that, even if out of the moneys thus realized the interest on the debt is taken every six months, there were balances which, applied to the first, note, as I think they must be, fully extinguished it.\nEvidently by the appellants' advances to George K. McLeod, later on or in some other way, which had no relation to the agreement so far as this phase of it is concerned, they became his creditors for other large sums remaining unpaid, besides those secured by defendant's indorsement.\nIt seems as if they had felt entitled to treat all their claims as if on the same footing.\nThe second clause of the agreement seems as clear as the English language can make it that this was not so.\nIt reads:\n2. For the better securing to Messrs. Robinson, Fleming & Co. the repayment of the said advance of \u00a36,000 and said past due debt of \u00a31,580 16s, George K. McLeod agrees to give, etc., etc.\nThen the above and other securities are specified. Whatever may have transpired between appellants and George K. McLeod after these securities were thus specifically hypothecated for the purposes of the debts now in question herein, there could not be anything done by them to the detriment of the surety, now respondent herein.\nThe only possible question that could have arisen up to the spring of 1895, as to appropriation of payments received from these securities, on account of the principal, would be as between the first and second notes.\nThe facts here present no such difficulty for the creditors did not seek to prefer in the way of appropriation the second note to the first, so far as the evidence before us shews.\nNor do I think it ever was open, as against the surety, for the creditors here under this agreement, to appropriate in any other way than according to the order of time of same having fallen due.\nThe case of Kinnaird v. Webster[5], presents an application of the principles to be observed in such cases, so far as I have proceeded.\nThe result of adhering to the terms of the agreement in question, and the observance of the principles applicable, render the result to my mind clear. Had the progress of events been somewhat different, one can easily see some interesting questions regarding a surety's right in regard to appropriation of payments, as likely to have arisen.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies. Duff J. (dissenting),\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. J. Coster.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William D.

VII. c. 11, s. 2, s.-s. 3 {N.B.)\u2014 \"Longshoreman\" \u2014\"Workman,\"\nAs an appellate tribunal for the Dominion of Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada requires no evidence of the laws in force in any of the provinces or territories of Canada. It is bound to take judicial notice of the statutory or other laws prevailing in every province or territory in Canada, even where they may not have been proved in the courts below, or although the opinion of the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada may differ from the evidence adduced upon those points in the courts below. Cooper v. Cooper (13 App. Cas. 88) followeda.\nThe plaintiff, a longshoreman, was engaged by the defendant, in Montreal, to act as foreman on his contracts as a stevedore at the port of St. John, N.B. While in the performance of his work, the plaintiff went into the hold to re-arrange a part of the cargo in a vessel, in the port of St. John, and, in assisting the labourers, stood under an open hatchway where he was injured by a heavy weight falling upon him on account of the negligence of the winchman in passing it across the upper deck. The winchman had attempted to remove the article which fell, without any order from his foreman, the plaintiff, and with improperly adjusted tackle. In an action for damages instituted in the Superior Court, at Montreal,\nHeld, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover either under the law of the Province of Quebec or under the provisions of the New Brunswick Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 11, as he came within the class of persons therein mentioned to whom the law of the latter province relating to the doctrine of common employment does not apply.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, (Charbonneau J. dissenting), whereby the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe action was instituted in the Superior Court, at Montreal, for recovery of damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff while in the discharge of the duties of his employment as a foreman or \"walking boss\" on the steamship \"Evangeline,\" in the port of St. John, in the Province of New Brunswick, under an engagement by the defendant, a contracting stevedore, alleged to have been made at Montreal.\nOne of the grounds of defence in respect of which an issue was raised on the appeal was that, if the damages claimed had resulted from negligence by one of the plaintiff's fellow-servants, in the service of the defendant at the time of the accident, the law applicable to the obligations and rights of the parties was the law of the place where the d\u00e9lit or quasi-d\u00e9lit occurred, viz., the law of the Province of New Brunswick, by which the defendant would be relieved from liability towards the plaintiff under the doctrine known as that of common employment. In order to prove the law of New Brunswick, the evidence of legal counsel of that province was received at the trial.\n\u00c0twater K.C., for the appellant, during the argument proceeded to discuss the question upon the evidence thus adduced. He was interrupted by the court and the following decision was delivered by The Chief Justice.\u2014I think it proper that I should here announce, after having consulted with my brother judges, that this court, constituted as an appellate tribunal for the whole Dominion of Canada, requires no evidence as to what laws may be in force in any of the provinces or territories of Canada. This court is bound to follow the rule laid down by the House of Lords in the case of Cooper v. Cooper[1], in 1888, and to take judicial notice of the statutory or other laws prevailing in every province and territory in Canada, suo motu, even in cases where such statutes or laws may not have been proved in evidence in the courts below, and although it might happen that the views as to what the law might be, as entertained by the members of this court, might be in absolute contradiction of any evidence upon those points adduced in the courts below.\nThe argument then proceeded upon the other issues in question on the appeal.\nAt the trial in the Superior Court at Montreal, Mr. Justice Curran found that the plaintiff, a long-. shoreman., had entered into a contract with the defendant, a stevedore, at the City of Montreal, to act as chief foreman in the loading and unloading of vessels at the ports of Montreal and St. John, N.B; that he sustained the injuries complained of on account of the negligence of a fellow workman in unloading a heavy barrel which fell upon him through an open hatchway while he was assisting the ship-labourers in re-arranging part of the cargo in the hold; that he was not guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident and that the defendant was responsible in damages.\nThe principal grounds of defence, urged upon the appeal, were that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence and, consequently that he could not recover under the law, as proved, of the Province of New Brunswick, where the doctrine of common employment prevailed; that the plaintiff was not a person engaged as a \"workman\" within the meaning of the third sub-section of section 2 of \"The Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act\" (3 Edw. VII. ch. 11), of the Province of New Brunswick, where the injury had been sustained, and that, under the law of the Province of Quebec, if applicable, there should be mitigation of damages on account of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff.\nThe effect of the judgment appealed from was to affirm the judgment entered in favour of the plaintiff.\nAtwater K.C, and Duff for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and H. U. Paget Aylmer for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. The two courts below find that the accident complained of was caused by the negligent act of a workman in the service of the appellant during the regular course of his employment and, on this finding of fact with which we see no ground for interfering, the appellant would be liable in damages both under the law of New Brunswick and that of Quebec. Girouard J.\u2014It is not necessary for the determination of this appeal to decide the question of interprovincial law. Whether the responsibility of the appellant is to be decided by the Quebec law or by the law of New Brunswick, the action of the respondent; lies, in Quebec under the common law and in New Brunswick under the Workingmen's Compensation Act. This Act, differently worded from the English Act, applies in express terms to \"longshoremen,\" and we have no difficulty in deciding that Lee belonged to that class of workingmen.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014Whether the law of Quebec or the law of New Brunswick is to prevail in this case the result is the same. I cannot find any evidence of contributory negligence that would, in the one case, deprive the respondent of his right to claim anything, or, in the other reduce the amount of damages he might be entitled to.\nOn the evidence he is clearly entitled to recover.\nHis injuries are admitted and the appellant admits that they were the result of the negligence of the appellant's man in charge of a winch, in handling therewith the barrel that fell upon the respondent and produced the injuries in question.\nThe only hope of escape for appellant from liability seemed to rest in his establishing, first, that the law of New Brunswick should prevail, and next, that \"The Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act\" of that province did not cover the respondent's case because he was not engaged in manual labour.\nI incline to think that the law of New Brunswick should prevail on the facts here. And I have no difficulty in holding that the Act in question clearly covers the respondent as a longshoreman specifically designated in section 2, sub-section 3, of the Act, as one of the class of men who are to be entitled to the benefit of the Act. The test of manual labour is quite beside the question, as I view it.\nI concur in the judgment of the Chief Justice during the argument that we must act on the doctrine laid down in Cooper v. Cooper[2], and acted upon by the House of Lords therein, in our dealing with the conflicts of law that may arise between, or rather the differences of law that may arise for consideration in the different provinces. This is the common forum of all and, though the provincial courts may, of necessity, hear evidence of the laws of another province, we must place our own construction upon that law (which may be foreign law in the provincial court), whenever the case comes here for consideration.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Girouard.\nDuff J.\u2014It is unnecessary to consider whether the law of Quebec or the law of New Brunswick furnishes the rule of decision in this case; if the former, it is not disputed that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed; if the latter, the statute relied upon clearly, I think, applies and confers upon him a right to relief. I do not enter upon an examination of the views of the learned gentlemen who gave evidence in the court below as to the state of the law of New Brunswick. Upon that question we are bound, I think, to apply the rule acted upon by the House of Lords in Cooper v. Cooper[3] and to give effect to our own views.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant; Heneker & Duff.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLennan, Howard & Aylmer.\na Note: Cf.

The sheriff's sale was set aside and M. then abandoned the property to the curator of the estate, and filed a claim, as a privileged creditor, for necessary and useful expenses incurred by him in preserving the property for the general benefit of the mass of the creditors, including therein charges for moneys paid as premiums on policies of fire insurance effected in his own name during the time he had held possession.\nHeld, that, in the absence of evidence to shew that such insurances had been so effected otherwise than for his own exclusive interest, he could not be collocated by special privilege, on the distribution of the proceeds of the estate, for the amount of the premiums.\nWhen the appeal first came on for hearing upon inscription ex parte, on suggestion by one of the creditors, not made a party to the appeal, the. court ordered the postponement of the hearing in order that all interested parties might be notified.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, whereby the judgment of Mr. Justice Lemieux in the Superior Court, District of St. Francis, dismissing the contestation of the respondent without costs, was affirmed, Charbonneau J. dissenting.\nThe appellants are the representatives of John McDougall who, in 1883, through a series of conveyances, acquired certain lands and the factory, with its running plant and appurtenances, of the insolvent Pioneer Beet-root Sugar Company under a sheriff's sale at the instance of creditors at the time that the company was placed in liquidation. John McDougall thereupon went into possession and continued to operate the factory for his own benefit, and maintained the plant in order. He disposed of certain unnecessary or worn out material and, for a number of years, carried insurances against fire thereon, the policies of insurance being made payable to him personally. A number of suits were pending at the time of the purchase of the factory by him and other suits were instituted and numerous appeals asserted, some of which were prosecuted to final decisions in the Privy Council. After considerable litigation the sheriff's sale, under which McDougall claimed title, was finally set aside and he abandoned the property to the curator of the estate of the company in liquidation. , The property which had thus been preserved by him was sold for the benefit of the creditors generally, and McDougall filed a privileged claim, on the moneys realized, under the provisions of the Civil Code, for necessary and useful expenses alleged to have been incurred by him in the preservation of the property for the creditors generally. This claim was composed of items paid for school and municipal taxes, the expense of guarding the property and keeping it in repair, and also the sum of $10,765.03 paid for the insurance premiums, the whole amounting to $33,373.31. The effect of the judgment appealed from was that the present appellants, as representatives of John McDougall, were ordered to be collocated by privilege out of the proceeds of the estate of the company for $22,610.28 from which were deducted sums received on sales of portions of the. machinery and plant sold by McDougall, leaving a balance of $5,343.16 as the amount to be collocated to the appellants on their op-position5 and their claim for the moneys paid out as premiums for the insurances was disallowed. On an appeal by the present appellants this decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was inscribed ex parte, no factum having been filed by the contestant, La Banque d'Hochelaga, and first came on for hearing on the 15th May, 1907. On the case being called, Mr. Atwater K.C., on behalf of the Eastern Townships Bank (not a party, but a creditor of the insolvent company) by permission of the court suggested that, as the interests of the mass of the company's creditors would be involved in the result of this appeal, on the hearing ex parte there should be some protection afforded in respect to the unrepresented creditors who might be entitled to share in the distribution of the assets. Mr. Brosseau K.C., for the appellants, explained that the Banque d'Hochelaga alone had prosecuted the contestation of the opposition to the report of distribution in the courts below and, although notified of the present appeal, had not filed a factum or appeared at the hearing.\nThe court ordered that the hearing of the appeal should be postponed until the October session and that, in the meantime, the appellants should have an opportunity of serving proper notices of the present appeal upon all interested parties. On 9th October, 1907, the appeal again came on for hearing ex parte after all interested persons had been duly notified\nBrosseau K.C., for the appellants. The insurances were both necessary and useful expenses, and the premiums were paid under the obligations resulting from the care required of a prudent administrator. The appellants should be collocated by special privilege for the amounts thus expended. Had the insurance been paid and turned in to the estate, there could not be any question as to a privileged charge. The position is not altered by the fact that the insurances ceased when McDougall ceased to pay the premiums, nor by the fact that it is not the proceeds of the insurance policies on a fire loss which are now being distributed, but merely the proceeds of a sheriff's sale held at a time when the insurance policies had ceased to be in force. We refer to Marcad\u00e9, on art. 1375 C.N.; Mass\u00e9 & Verg\u00e9 (Zachariae), vol. 4, p. 5, n. 3; Dalloz, R\u00e9p. \"Obligations,\" No. 5395; Demolombe, vol. 31, No. 378; Colmet-Santerre, vol. 5, No. 362 (bis) ; Arts. 1994 (1) 1996 and 2001, 2009 (1) CO.\nThe judgments of the Superior Court and of the Court of Review should be reversed and the appellants should be restored to the position, both as to rank and amount, given them by the prothonotary in the report of distribution.\nBrosseau K.C., for the appellants.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGirouard J.\u2014This appeal, which was heard ex parte, after due notice being given to all parties interested, should be dismissed with costs. In the first place, there is no legal proof of the insurance having been effected by the late Mr. McDougall, as the policies are not produced, which is the best evidence that could be adduced. The trial judge o found and I quite agree with him. Even if such proof was in the record, can it be contended seriously that at any time the creditors could claim the indemnity either from McDougall or the insurance company? The trial judge was of the opinion that they could not and I think he was right.\nIf McDougall was not the legal proprietor of the immovable in question, as all the courts ultimately decided, he was admittedly a creditor having an insurable interest, and that alone would be sufficient to prevent the creditors from recovering the amounts of the policies under article 1201 of the Civil Code.\nMcDougall was so clearly the sole and legal holder of the policies, in his own exclusive interest, that immediately after the setting aside of the judicial sale by the courts in favour of the creditors, the latter could not claim the above policies or the indemnity they covered. Such is also the well settled jurisprudence in France. Sirey, Recueil, 1890, 2, 173, especially note 1.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brosseau & Holt.\n"}

On one occasion, while attempting to use this portable lamp, he sustained an electric shock which caused his death. In an action by his widow to recover damages from the company for negligently allowing dangerous currents of electricity to escape from a defective transformer through which the current was passed into the dwelling:\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that there was no duty owing by the company towards deceased in respect of the installation so made by him without their knowledge and in breach of his contract and that, as the accident occurred through contact with the wiring which he had so connected without their permission, the company could not be held liable in damages. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, whereby the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, entered by Doherty J., upon the verdict of the jury at the trial, was affirmed and the plaintiff's action maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and questions at issue on this appeal are sufficiently stated in the head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nArcher K.C. and G. H. Montgomery for the appellants.\nHenry J. Elliott and H. R. Bisaillon for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal must be allowed with costs. I agree in the opinion stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGirouard J.\u2014It seems to me there was an entire misconception of the legal relations existing between the electric company, appellants, and the late Joseph Jean Paquette. The jury and the two courts below found that the company was alone responsible for the accident. Mr. Justice Trenholme, dissenting, saw in the circumstances of the case one of contributory negligence or faute commune.\nAs I understand the evidence, the electric company owed no duty to this man Paquette. It was under no special obligation whatever to him with regard to the wire which caused his death. The company undertook to safely supply him with electric light in his residence, being No. 1580 Saint Lawrence Street, but never undertook to do the same thing for the store, No. 1584, next to it, where the accident took place, by touching one of the wires which he had himself surreptitiously placed, by illegally connecting it with the wires in his residence, without notice to the company or their knowledge. In fact, Paquette was a trespasser, to use a mild expression.\nIn the written contract which he signed, it is expressly stipulated that the electric system put in his residence\nshall be used by the consumer only, upon the said premises only, and for the purposes hereinafter specified only,\nand that,\nno new connection shall be made by which the current could be used, except with the written consent of the company.\nHe finally agreed to\nprovide all lines on the premises or connecting same with the point of delivery, and maintain the same in efficient condition, with proper protective devices, the whole according to Fire Underwriters' requirements.\nThe wires which he put in the back-store and oil-room in the back of his store, No. 1584, and connected with the wires in his residence, No. 1580, it is conceded by the respondent; were not up to the Fire Underwriters' requirements. Had they been, it is probable that the accident could not have happened, as it did not in No. 1580 and fifteen other premises supplied by the same defective transformer.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the respondent's action with costs. Davies J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants applied electric current for lighting purposes to people in Montreal, where the respondent's husband lived. He asked for a supply. He signed a written application therefor which contained an express undertaking that he would provide\nall lines on the premises or connecting same with the point of delivery and maintain same in efficient condition with proper protective devices, the whole according to Fire Underwriters' requirements.\nThe application was made for a supply to be delivered to a dwelling house in Montreal known as No. 1580, Saint Lawrence Street.\nThe installation of the wire and other appliances in the house conformed to the requirements of the condition just quoted. They were inspected and approved of by the company's officers in the usual way before any current was applied. Upon such approval, the current was supplied through these wires, so approved of, to the house. Shortly afterwards, the deceased made, by means of a wire, the connection between these approved wires and a portable lamp he desired to use in the back premises of his shop which adjoined the dwelling and bore another street number. This connection was made without notice to the company or knowledge of the company and did not conform to the condition or provision I have quoted and was used for lighting the shed in rear of the shop. The current thus supplied for the additional portable lamp passed through the meter and, of course, was paid for, monthly, along with that which supplied the dwelling house, as if part thereof.\nThe appellants' transformer became defective. One result of that, coupled as the jury find with the want of a ground-wire, caused a current of a higher tension than the contract provides for entering into the dwelling house. No injury came to any one using the house switches or lamps therein. But the current passed by means of the unauthorized wire connected with the portable lamp to the hand of him who was alone responsible for it being there. As a result the current killed him. The Superior Court of Quebec awarded damages to his widow for the death thus caused of her husband. The Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec upheld this judgment and hence this appeal. The jury find that it was by virtue of this contract that contained the provision I have quoted above that anything was done by the appellants.\nThey find further, however, that the deceased, when he signed the contract containing this provision, did not understand it.\nI am quite unable to understand on what principle a claim for damages thus resulting can rest. The only duty the appellants owed the deceased arose from the contract containing this provision that the deceased violated. If he did not understand that contract and any imprudence could be attached to any such misunderstanding the result would be that there was no contract to create any duty.\nA duty would arise in the absence of a special contract binding a company supplying electricity to take proper means to do it safely. They could not, however, be bound beyond what they understood they were doing, the extent of the contract they were executing.\nCounsel for the respondent, when the difficulties I have suggested were pointed out to them, sought to avoid the consequences by suggesting that there was a possibility of discarding the part of the contract that the deceased himself misunderstood or misapprehended and that there still remained a common understanding which would be possible to constitute as a contract. No such case was presented to the jury. No such case was made by the pleadings. No such case appears in evidence and, consequently, no such contract has been found as would entitle the respondent to hold the appellants liable under.\nThe relation of the deceased to the results of what is alleged to have been negligence on the part of the appellants was something entirely of his own creation. He chose to conduct to himself, without any authority from the appellants, the results of what is called their negligence.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nWhether the trial was so conducted as to involve expenses of issues of fact not necessary to be raised in the view we take and issues of fact that are found against the appellants, was not discussed. If there are any such, the appellants should not get costs thereof as against the respondent.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Girouard J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Montgomery & Lacoste.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bisaillon & Brossard.\n"}

The Montreal Rolling Mills Go. v. Corcoran (26 Can. S.C.R. 595), and Tooke v. Bergeron (27 Can: S.C.R. 567) distinguished.\nThe plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence and damages apportioned according to the practice in the Province of Quebec.\nAPPEAL from the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe plaintiff was a skilled miner employed by the defendant to use dynamite in blasting rock excavations on a contract for the construction of a railway. The place where he was working at the time of the accident being at a distance from the electric battery generally used for igniting the fuses attached to the charges of dynamite to explode them, the system adopted was to ignite these fuses with a red-hot poker supplied for that purpose. At the time when the accident occurred, the defendant's foreman permitted the plaintiff to light the fuses by means of torches made of birch bark without protesting against the danger of such a method. When he had lighted one of the fuses, the plaintiff threw the torch away, as he ran off to take shelter and, by this means, another fuse in close proximity became ignited without his knowledge. On his return to set off the charge to which the last fuse was attached, he was injured by a premature explosion.\nIn an action for damages His Lordship Mr. Justice Langelier found, at the trial, that the accident was the result of common fault; that of the defendant in failing to supply a safe means of carrying on dangerous work and that of the plaintiff by imprudence in negligently using the torch. By the judgment the damages assessed by him were apportioned, the plaintiff being held responsible for a share thereof and the defendant condemned for the amount of the balance, $2,000, with costs. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from.\nL. P. Pelletier K.C. and Bernier for the appellant.\nFiset and Grenier for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In this case the two courts below find that the accident was caused by the negligence of the appellant in respect of the appliances supplied for the purpose of carrying on what was, under the circumstances, a dangerous operation, and I see no sufficient reason to depart from that finding. Girouard J.\u2014This case involves questions of fact found by two courts and I think the evidence adduced far from supporting the appellant's view justifies their conclusion.\nHe contends that the cases of The Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran[1], and Tooke v. Bergeron[2], are parallel.\nOf course, every case of this kind must be decided according to the proof, whether direct or derived from presumptions. The Corcoran Case1 is certainly not a similar one, for we held, in that case, that the cause of the accident was a mystery and left to mere conjectures.\nLikewise it may be said that the Tooke-Bergeron Case2 differs essentially from the present one, as Ave there held that the negligence of the victim of the accident was the principal and immediate cause of the injury, and that she had acted contrary to the regulations of the establishment.\nHere, on the contrary, the work done by the respondent which caused the accident was expressly sanctioned by Tremblay, the foreman of the appellant. True, he denies this, but he is contradicted, not only by the plaintiff, but also by George Gagnon and Adjutor Lavoie. Not only the trial judge but the judges of the court of appeal believed the story of these three men instead of that of Tremblay and we should not interfere with their finding.\nBefore closing, I wish to point out a consid\u00e9rant of the trial judge to which I cannot subscribe:\nConsid\u00e9rant que la dite explosion ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par de la dynamite dont le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire et dont il avait la garde, il doit \u00eatre tenu responsable des dommages qui en sont r\u00e9sult\u00e9s pour le demandeur, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait prouv\u00e9 qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de l'\u00e9viter.\nWe have so often decided in our court that proof of fault, whether by direct evidence or by presumptions, rests upon the plaintiff, that it is not necessary to quote authorities.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alphonse Bernier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.

He was a guest of the hotel, at the time, and was using the elevator, in the usual manner, to pass from one part of the hotel to another. At the trial, in answer to questions submitted to them, the jury found, among other things, that the accident was not due to any fault of the plaintiff that it was due to the fault of the defendants, owing to the practice of not closing the door of the elevator before putting it in motion, and they assessed the damages at $11,067, for which the judge entered a verdict for the plaintiff with costs.\nThis judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from.\nHeneker K.C. and Mar\u00e9chal K.C. for the appellants.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and G. H. Montgomery for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I adopt the reasons given in the court below.\nGirouard J.\u2014I think this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nThe question is not whether the verdict is the best one that could have been arrived at, but whether it is one which twelve reasonable men would have rendered.\nIt is admitted that the appellants were guilty of negligence in moving their elevator before its door was closed. They say, it is true, in answer, that Mr. Odell forced his way out when the elevator boy was in the act of closing the door and moving the elevator down, and there is some evidence to that effect. Mr. Odell swears positively the door was wide open when he attempted to move out. The jury have believed him and I am not prepared to say that their finding is unreasonable.\nDavies J.\u2014The question before us is not whether the verdict is, in our opinion, a right or just one, under the evidence, but simply, whether it is one which a jury could, under all the circumstances, fairly find. While, if acting as a juryman, I might not have agreed with the conclusion reached by the majority of the jury, I am not, sitting here in a court of appeal, able to say that the verdict is one which reasonable men might not fairly, under the evidence, have found. I agree, therefore, in dismissing the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree to dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The principle which we have to apply here is, for the purposes of this case, aptly put by the language of Lord FitzGerald, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, in The Commissioner for Railways v. Brown[1] at page 134;\u2014\nWhere the question is one of fact and there is evidence on both sides properly submitted to the jury, the verdict of the jury, once found, ought to stand; and the setting aside of such a verdict should be of rare and exceptional occurrence.\nThere is nothing rare or exceptional about this case; it is the common case of a conflict of evidence which the jury, having the witnesses before them, have resolved by accepting the story of one side and rejecting that of the other.\nWe could not allow this appeal without disregarding this rule and adopting a principle of decision which would open for examination, as res nova in a court of appeal, every issue of fact tried and passed upon by a jury.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Heneker & Duff.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] 13 App. Cas. 133.\n"}

Barrett v. The Associated Newspapers (23 Times L.R. 666), distinguished.\nThe judgment appealed from (16 Man. R. 619) was affirmed, the Chief Justice dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Macdonald J. at the trial and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought the action to recover damages for slander of title, alleging that the defendants recklessly, falsely and maliciously printed and published concerning her property in the City of Winnipeg, in the \"Manitoba Morning Free Press\" the \"Free Press Evening News Bulletin,\" and the \"Manitoba Weekly Free Press\" respectively, the words following:\u2014 \"A NORTH END GHOST.\"\n\"There is a ghost in the north end of the city that is causing a lot of trouble to the inhabitants. His chief haunt is in a vacant house on St. John Avenue, near to Main. He appears late at night and performs strange antics, so that timid people give the place a-wide berth. A number of men have lately made a stand against ghosts in general, and at night they rendezvous in the basement and close around the haunted house to await his ghostship, but so far he still remains at large.\"\nThe house and premises said to be alluded to were untenanted at the time and, after the publication of the article complained of, continued to be untenanted for several months, until the property was sold for a price less than plaintiff had expected from some other purchasers in \"treaty for the purchase of the property whom she lost through the publication of the report in disparagement of the premises.\nThe plaintiff claimed damages for depreciation in the value of the property, loss of rent and expenses she was obliged to incur in protecting the premises from being damaged by crowds of persons who, in consequence of the report, nightly congregated about the premises.\nAt the trial, before Mr. Justice Macdonald, without a jury, there was no evidence adduced to shew actual malice and the action was dismissed with costs, His Lordship holding that the publication complained of was not actionable and that no special damages had been proved to have been suffered by the plaintiff.\nBy the judgment appealed from, this judgment was reversed, Perdue J. dissenting, and a verdict ordered to be entered for the plaintiff for $1,000 and costs. Ewart K.C. and Hudson for the appellants. Our grounds of appeal, shortly stated, are (1) that no action could be brought for the slander of real property; (2) the onus was on the plaintiff to establish that the words complained of were false and she failed to establish this; (3) that, if such an action could be brought, malice must be proved, and this was not done; (4) that, in any event, it was necessary to prove special damage arising from the publication in question and from it alone, and that there was no evidence of such special damage; (5) that any damages which could be awarded must be for such loss as might reasonably be apprehended from the publication in question, and that no reasonable person could apprehend any damage from such publication; (6) that the evidence shewed that the plaintiff was not the real owner of the property, and (7) that the court of appeal, in allowing damages, had no jurisdiction to make an order as they did, and that, in any event, the amount of their verdict is a mere guess and cannot be upheld.\nWe refer to Odgers on Libel and Slander (4 ed.) pages 75 and 102; Burnett v. Tak[2], and Pater v. Baker[3], at page 869; Clerk & Lindsell on Torts (last ed.) pages 601, 602; Pollock on Torts (11 ed.) pages 301, 302; Hasley v. Brotherhood[4], per Jessel M.R. at page 523 ; and on appeal[5], by Coleridge L.J. at page 388, and Lindley L.J. at page 393; Ratcliffe v. Evans[6], per Bowen L.J. at page 527; Alcott v. Millar's Karri and Jarrah Forests[7]; and Barrett v. The Associated Newspapers[8]. As to proof of special damages being necessary, see Hatchard v. M\u00e8ge[9]; Evans v. Harlow[10]; White v. Mellin[11]; Odgers, Libel and Slander (4 ed.) pages 102, 384 and 560; Brook v. Rawl[12], per Parke B. at page 524, and Vicars v. Wilcocks[13], per Ellenborough C.J. at page 3.\nThe findings of the trial judge on disputed questions of fact should stand, and it is not credible that a probable purchaser, having read the report, should. have refused to buy only because it was in the \"Free Press,\" although other newspapers also published it. The plaintiff had the evidence in her own hands, but did not negative a binding contract to sell which might have been enforced. If there was such a contract the defendants should not be held responsible. Burkett v. Griffith [14]; Brentman v. Note[15].\nMr. Justice Richards and Mr. Justice Phippen admit that there is no evidence enabling them to fix definitely the amount of damages which should be awarded. They merely say that it is evident the plaintiff suffered some damage, that this damage was occasioned in part by the publication in the \"Free Press\" and they guess the amount to be $1,000. The case of Williams v. Stephenson[16] is directly in point. There, as here, the evidence was insufficient to enable the trial judge to ascertain the damages, he guessed at the amount and this court allowed the appeal and refused to grant a new trial. There is no evidence of the amount of depreciation in value suffered in consequence of the rumour. It appears that there were mortgages against the property to amounts aggregating nearly its value. The action is for alleged injury to its value and it is submitted that the mortgagees should have been parties to the action, and were in fact the only persons who had a right to sue.\nWe also rely upon the remarks of Eldon C.J. in Morris v. Langdale[17], at page 289, and on Ashley v. Harrison[18].\nJ. Edward' O'Connor for the respondent. The falsity of the report has been proved in evidence, the defendants must have been aware of its falsity at the time, and such reckless publication gives rise to a presumption of malice and a careless disregard of consequences. There cannot be excuse on the ground that they merely intended the article to be humourous. We might cite AEsop's fable of the boys throwing stones at the frogs. We suffered actual damages for their amusement, and they must be held responsible for the consequences of their reckless indifference, their neglect to verify the truth of the rumour before publication, their bad faith and injustifiable, officious and unnecessary meddling in affairs that did not concern them. This is not a case of fair comment on a matter of public interest, but an unwarranted and harmful intrusion into private affairs.\nThe evidence as to special damages is full and complete. We have an action on the case as designed by the Statute of Westminster (13 Edw. I. ch. 24) to give a remedy where a man suffered a wrong (1 Comyn's Digest, p. 278). It seems to have as wide a scope as articles 1053 and 1054 of the Code Civil of Quebec in question in Cossette v. Dun[19]. This action is brought for a false statement made maliciously or negligently or fraudulently of and concerning the real property of the plaintiff and resulting in special damage. See Green v. Button[20] ; also remarks by Powys J. in Ashby v. White[21], at page 248. This objection did not prevail. See also Chapman v. Pickersgill[22], per Pratt C.J. in answer to the same objection; Langridge v. Levy[23], at page 522, and on appeal[24]; Pasley v. Freeman[25], at page 63, also in 2 Smith's Leading Cases[26], at page 79, per Ashurst J.; Allen v. Flood[27], at page 73; Winsmore v. Greenbank[28], per Willes C.J. at page 581. In all these, and in many other cases which, like this case, were of first impression, this objection had been noticed only to be repelled. And see Pavesich v. New England Life Insurance Co.[29]; Lynch v. Knight[30]; Smith v. Kaye[31] ; Lumley v. Gye[32]; South Wales Miners' Federation v. Glamorgan Coal Co.[33]; Sheppard Publishing Co. v. Press Publishing Co.[34]; Hatchard v. M\u00e8ge[35]; Alcott v. Millar's Karri and Jarrah Forests[36].\nIf false and malicious statements as to goods resulting in special damage be actionable, why not false and malicious statements as to land? See Levet's Case[37] quoted by Cave J. in Allen v. Flood[38], at page 30; Paull v. Halferty[39]; Bruce v. J. M. Smith, Limited[40] Barrett v. Associated Newspapers[41]; Bowen v. Hall[42], per Brett L.J. at pages 337 and 338. This action lies as the statement is false, malicious and has occasioned damage. Odger's Libel and Slander (4 ed.) pages 73, 74, 75, 89, 102.\nIn cases like the present \"malicious\" need not mean actual malice in the sense of spite or ill-will, but legal malice, or doing, intentionally, the act complained of without just cause or excuse, and also that one is presumed to intend the natural or probable consequences of his own acts. South Wales Miners' Federation v. Glamorgan Coal Co.[43]; Odgers on Libel (4 ed.) pages 319 et seq.; Wilkinson v. Downton[44]; Ludlow v. Batson[45]; Bromage v. Prosser[46].\nThe means were at hand for ascertaining the truth, the defendants purposely neglected to avail themselves of it and chose to remain in ignorance when they might have obtained full information. This is evidence of such wilful blindness as amounts to malice. Odgers (4 ed.) pages 323, 331; Elliott v. Garrett[47]; Gott v. Pulsifer[48]; Green v. Miller[49]; White & Co. v. Credit Reform Association[50]; Plymouth Mutual Co-operative and Industrial Society v. Traders' Publishing Association[51]; Thomas v. Bradbury, Agnew & Co.[52]. To constitute actual malice it is not necessary that the defendant should be actuated by any special feeling against plaintiff in particular. He need not even be personally acquainted with him; Odgers (4 ed.) page 322 ; and it is no excuse for the publication, even of a correct copy of an entry, in the police register or other official document which does not relate to a judicial proceeding, that such register or document is open to the public; Reiss v. Perry[53]; one who makes a statement recklessly, careless whether it be true or false, can have no belief in the truth of what he speaks ; per Herschell L.J. in Derry v. Peek[54].\nAs to liability on the ground of negligent publication, it is submitted that the defendants owed a duty to the respondent to take at least ordinary care to prevent any article being published in the newspapers owned by it that would or might result in damage to the respondent or her property. Bevan on Negligence (2 ed.) vol. 1, pp. 97, 100; Vaughan v. Menlove[55]. The doer of a negligent act is responsible for the consequences flowing from it, in fact, even though antecedently the consequences that do flow from it seemed neither natural nor probable. Bevan, vol. 1, 97; vol. 2, 1601; Vaughan v. Taff Vale Railway Go.[56]; Dulieu v. White & Sons[57].\nAs to damages. Special damage was proved in the loss of the sale as a result of reading the article in question, and, as an actual injury has followed the slander, it is no answer to shew that the third person would probably have acted in the same way had the slander not been used; Knight v. Gibbs[58]. It is the same, also, as to the expense of protecting the house and of moving into it for that purpose.\nJ. Edward' O'Connor for the respondent.\nEwart K.C. and Hudson for the appellants.\nIf this action lies for a negligent publication special damage is not necessary to constitute a cause of action.\nThe Chief Justice dissented from the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nDavies- J.\u2014The only doubt I had at the close of the argument in this case was one on the question of the sufficiency of the proof of the ingredient of malice.\nA more careful examination of the authorities and of the evidence has removed that doubt. The wrong complained of was the publication by appellants of an untruth respecting the plaintiff's property calculated to depreciate and which did as a fact depreciate its value.\nThe plaintiff was bound to prove malice. But malice in this connection is a question of mala fides or bona fides. If the absence of bona fides is shewn or may fairly and reasonably be inferred from the facts proved then I take it that the ingredient of malice is sufficiently proved. It is laid down by Mr. Pollock in his work on Torts, page 301, that in actions of this kind.\nthe wrong is a malicious one in the only proper sense of the word, that is, the absence of good faith is an essential condition of liability. As put by Lord Coleridge in Hasley v. Brotherhood[59], at page 388, speaking of the publications which sustain actions\nbesides its untruth and besides its injury express malice must he proved, that is to say, want of bona fides or the presence of mala fides.\nThe question of honesty or dishonesty in the publication' so far from being immaterial may be the determining factor as to whether the action lies. The very essence of the case is the falsity of the publication complained of and the want of good faith in publishing it.\nAs said by Baron Parke in Brook v. Rawl[60]:\nTo support this action it ought to be shewn that the false statement is made mala fide and that the special damage ensues from it.\nSee also Wren v. Weild[61], approved in the case of Hasley v. Brotherhood59, above cited.\nGiven therefore the three ingredients of the publication of a false statement respecting plaintiff's property, the absence of bona fides in the publication and special damage following as the result I cannot doubt that an action lies.\nIn the case at bar I think the evidence only admits of one conclusion and that is that the article complained of was false and was published by defendant recklessly without regard to consequences, and that in this may be found the absence of good faith which imports the malice which is an essential condition of liability.\nActual malice in the sense of a predetermined intention to injure plaintiff or his property cannot be necessary to be proved. If it was there would be practically no restraint upon false publications by newspapers, causing the most serious damages to the property of others. The reckless publication by a defendant of an untruth respecting the complainant's property the natural result of which is to produce and where it does produce actual damage is sufficient evidence of the absence of bona fides and of the malice required by law.\nSome remarks made by the Master of the Rolls in the late case of Barrett v. The Associated Newspapers[62], at page 667, were relied upon by the appellants as shewing that actual malice must be proved in actions such as this. I do not think, however, the language of the learned Master of the Rolls justifies the inference sought to be drawn from it. The judgment there proceeded upon the ground of the ab-sense of proof of any special damage; and the Master of the Rolls who delivered the judgment of the court said that\nit was not necessary to consider the more difficult question of malice,\nbut that his impression was the appellant was right on that point also. In the case before him that may well have been so. There the newspaper sought to be held liable only purported to publish a statement of what a tenant, who had abandoned his occupancy, made as to his reasons for doing so, which were the hearing and seeing of certain noises, appearances and movements in the house leading to the conclusion it was haunted by ghosts. It did not appear that anything was added to the tenant's statement of what he and his family supposed or believed they had seen and heard. It might well be that under the peculiar facts of that case the court if compelled to determine the point might have declined to imply the absence of good faith. They might well be unable there to find the reckless publication of an untruth which in the case at bar we have no difficulty in finding. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The Court of Appeal for Manitoba, on appeal from the trial judge who had dismissed this action, determined that a publication appearing in the respective morning and evening and weekly editions of the appellants' newspaper, was defamatory of the respondent's property named therein and adjudged appellants should pay $1,000 for damages.\nThe publication was as follows:\nA NORTH END GHOST.\nThere is a ghost in the north end of the city that is causing a lot of trouble to the inhabitants. His chief haunt is in a vacant house on St. John Avenue, near to Main (meaning thereby the property of the plaintiff so described as aforesaid). He appears late at night and performs strange antics, so that timid people give the place a wide berth. A number of men have lately made a stand against ghosts in general, and at night they rendevous in the basement and close around the haunted house (meaning thereby the said property of the plaintiff so described as aforesaid) to await his ghostship, but so far he still remains at large.\nI think it proven beyond doubt that an actual sale of the property had been so far negotiated that but for this publication it would have been sold.\nI think it was further proven that within the principle upon which the decision in the case of Ratcliffe v. Evans[63] proceeds, the property in question had become less saleable than it had been and thus depreciated m value.\nI do not think a person owning property, and suffering from such depreciation as results from disparaging publications such as this, bound to sell the property in order to fix the damages. They can be established by general evidence of the character put before the court here.\nThe falsity of the publication is proven so far as that can be shewn in any such case. The witnesses who were present on the nights between the first and last publication give enough of evidence to satisfy the requirements of the law on that phase of the case.\nWas there such malice as the law requires to be shewn to found such an action? There was not shewn that malice that would be implied in satisfying the demands of a vindictive or wicked spirit solely bent on the specific work of destroying the value of the plaintiff's property. There is abundant evidence of almost every kind of malice short of that.\nAn entry in a book kept in a Winnipeg police station for the guidance of the police is made the basis of the publication.\nIts entry was manifestly designed to suggest that the officers on duty should dissuade people from assembling at the property in question.\nTo pervert its purpose and contrary thereto promote the assembling of crowds at the place in question was evidently what was likely to flow from its publication.\nNo man possessed of right feelings towards his neighbours should have entertained for a moment any thought of its publication.\nYet the appellants' servants and managers for whom it is responsible, regardless of those decent feelings that should have restrained them, dressed up the original entry in such a way as to distort the statements it contained, by making them positive instead of being colourless as they stood, and by expanding, and adding to them so as to render the publication more attractive, more sensational, and more damaging,\u2014and then published it.\nI am, with every respect for those who see otherwise, unable to think that such a case needs under our law more than a bare statement of fact.\nIn the recklessness and indifference these facts display, I find furnished abundant. evidence of malice and hence a legal remedy for such a palpable wrong.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with posts.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hudson, Howell, Ormond & Marlatt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Morice & O'Connor.\n[1] 16 Man.

Bradlaugh v. Newdegate (11 Q.B.D. 1) distinguished; Giegerich v. Fleutot (35 Can. S.C.R. 327) referred to.\nJudgment appealed from (12 B.C. Rep. 272) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Duff, at the trial [2] and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff, appellant, was the defendant in the case of Briggs v. Newswander[3], in which, by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, on an appeal from the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs in all the courts. Subsequently the appellant, Newswander, brought an action against the respondent, Giegerich, to recover from him the cost of his unsuccessful defence, as damages, on the ground that the respondent had unlawfully, for champertous considerations, maintained and assisted Briggs in the prosecution of the above mentioned suit.\nAt the trial of the appellant's action questions were submitted to the jury and, upon the answers given, the trial judge ordered that judgment should be entered in favour of the appellant for the amount so claimed, with costs. This judgment was reversed on an appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia by the judgment from which the present appeal is asserted.\nThe material circumstances of the case and questions at issue on this appeal sufficiently appear from the judgments now reported.\nDavis K.V. for the appellant.\nLewis (Smellie with him) for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is dismissed with costs. I concur in the opinion stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissing an action of maintenance brought by appellant against respondent for having assisted one Briggs, a poor and improvident man, in bringing and maintaining an action against him (appellant) for the recovery of a fourth interest in a mining claim. Briggs's action was ultimately successful, this court having held him entitled to the one-fourth interest, and awarded him the costs in all the courts[4].\nThe present respondent after the successful termination of the proceedings in Briggs's suit against Newswander, attempted to enforce an agreement he had made with Briggs for an interest in the fruits of the litigation but, the claim being resisted, it was properly held that such an agreement was champertous and that the courts would not lend their aid to enforce it. That case came also by way of appeal to this court sub nom. Giegerich v. Fleutot[5], and, in delivering the judgment, Mr. Justice Killam said that\nNewswander had a right of action against Giegerich for maintenance. The transaction was wrongful towards him.\nAfterwards Newswander brought his action and claimed as damages all the costs he had been made liable for between party and party of the suit he had wrongfully and unsuccessfully defended and also those between solicitor and client in the same suit.\nThe jury found in answer to questions put to them that respondent did supply funds to enable Briggs to carry on his action against Newswander and also his appeal to this court; that Briggs agreed to give him a share in the property recovered, and that Giegerich supplied funds to Briggs in accordance with the agreement. In answer to the further question,\nWas Briggs induced to carry on the action by his agreement with Giegerich and the assistance supplied by him? the jury ignored the question of inducement and answered:\nBriggs was enabled to bring action through the financial assistance of Giegerich.\nThey further answered that Giegerich did not enter into the litigation for the purpose of stirring up strife and litigation; and that he did not solicit Briggs to enter into any agreement to commence or carry on the action and appeals; and that Briggs would not have sued Newswander or prosecuted the appeals but for the agreement and assistance referred to unless he was able to obtain financial assistance from other sources.\nThe last answer as I construe it simply means that Briggs was too poor a man financially to have been able successfully to maintain his legal rights against Newswander in the courts unless Giegerich or some other rich person had aided him.\nThe result of the other answers to my mind is to negative malice or officious interference or desire to stir up strife or litigation.\nThe question arises right on the threshold of the argument whether under such findings of fact an unsuccessful litigant who has improperly withheld property, moneys or rights of any kind from a person entitled to them, but who was unable without extrinsic assistance to vindicate his legal rights in the courts can if the necessary financial assistance is rendered to enable a suit to be prosecuted with effect after judgment in the highest court of the land compelling him to do what the law said was his duty and obligation to have done without suit, turn round and recover from the person assisting the successful liti- gant as damages not only the costs of the suit which the courts have ordered him to pay because of his own wrong but also all other costs he may have incurred in connection with the litigation.\nIt does seem to me that there can be only one answer to such a question, and that a negative one.\nMuch reliance was placed upon the general statement of Killam J. before referred to, but apart from the statement being obiter only it will be observed that nothing was said about the damages recoverable and the whole assumed that which I think has been negatived by the findings of the jury in the case before us now. The only question argued in that appeal was whether the agreement was a champertous one and the court held that it was. Nothing was ever suggested on the argument as to the right of the present appellant who was not a party to that appeal, to recover back from Giegerich the costs he had been condemned to pay as a consequence of the wrongful with holding by him of Briggs's interest in the mining claims, and the judgment was not intended to determine the point.\nThe law on the subject is formulated in Pollock on Torts (6 ed.) pages 321-2, and Addison on Torts (8 ed.) page 30, as follows:'\nMr. Pollock says, page 321:\nThe wrong of maintenance or aiding a party in litigation without either interest in the suit or lawful cause of kindred affection or charity for aiding him is likewise akin to malicious prosecutions and other abuses of legal process * * * . Actions for maintenance are in modern times rare though possible, and the decision of the Court of Appeal that mere charity with or without reasonable ground is an excuse for maintaining the suit of a stranger does not tend to encourage them. And Addison states the law to be that:\nIf one person from motives which the law does not approve induces and assists another, who is to his knowledge insolvent and unable to pay costs, to prosecute an action without reasonable or probable cause against a third person, that person, if he gets an award of costs in his favour and cannot recover them from the insolvent plaintiff in the action, may recover them against the promoter in an action of maintenance * * * . But the notice must be malicious or the action does not lie. A man may maintain a suit of his near kinsman, servant or poor neighbour out of charity and compassion, with impunity, and a common interest in the matter of the suit negatives malice.\nBut neither text book or decision can be found supporting the proposition contended for by appellant that without malice, and without any desire to stir up strife or litigation, or officiously to interfere in the business of others, a man who assists another to recover his legal rights and is successful in doing so can be punished by being compelled to pay back as damages to the unsuccessful litigant the very costs the courts compelled him to pay for the wrongful withholding of his neighbour's rights.\nThat costs of defending a suit which has been improperly maintained may be recovered in an action of maintenance is true; Alabaster v. Harness[6]; but that the costs of such a suit as has been properly maintained can be so recovered is without authority.\nSo far back as the year 1843, Lord Abinger C.B., in the case of Findon v. Parker[7], at page 682, in delivering judgment said:\nThe law of maintenance, as I understand it upon the modern constructions, is confined to cases where a man improperly and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife encourages others to bring actions or to make defences which they have no right to make. In 1860 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in delivering judgment in the case of Fischer v. Kamala Naicher[8], said, at page 187, with reference to the qualities attributed to champerty or maintenance by the English law:\nit must be something against good policy and justice, something tending to promote unnecessary litigation, something that in a legal sense is immoral and to the constitution of which a bad motive in the same sense is necessary.\nIn the later case of The Metropolitan Bank v. Pooley[9], Lord Chancellor Selborne says, at page 218:\nI apprehend it to be clear that the civil action for maintenance would not lie except against a person who was guilty of the criminal act.\nSurely in the \"criminal act,\" the mens rea must be found before the accused is adjudged guilty. In the face of the facts of this case and the findings of the jury is it conceivable that the appellant could be found guilty of the criminal Act? I think not.\nIt may well be that so far as the agreement in the case at bar to share in the fruits of the litigation, if successful, was concerned, that was against good policy, and our courts so held and refused to enforce it. But where was the \"something tending to promote unnecessary litigation\" and as I understand the judgment of the Privy Council, the something that in a legal sense was immoral, and to the constitution of which a bad motive was necessary.\nThere can be but one answer. The litigation complained of was held by this court to have been just, proper and necessary, and the jury's answers in the present case which I have before quoted remove any doubt as to the existence of malice or the desire to stir up litigation or strife on the part of the respondent.\nThe only authority outside the dictum of Killam J. before referred to relied upon by the appellant was the judgment of Lord Coleridge sitting as trial judge in Bradlaugh v. Newdegate[10]. That judgment is not when examined a controlling authority in support of this appeal. It is the judgment of a single judge only. Before that judgment was delivered the House of Lords had on appeal dismissed with costs the several actions brought in the name of Clarke and maintained by Newdegate, and the judgment of Lord Coleridge awarding as damages to Bradlaugh practically the costs of the suits for penalties he had been improperly compelled to defend as well between party and party as between solicitor and client may be defensible on the ground that the House of Lords having finally disposed of the maintained suits and dismissed them, the action before Lord Coleridge could be disposed of and the damages awarded as if such final disposition had been made before the suit began against New-degate instead of before judgment was delivered. The judge seems to have taken judicial notice of the House of Lords judgment and acted upon it. Inasmuch as he explicitly says on page 12 in referring to the judgment of Abinger C.B., in Findon v. Parker[11], that:\nIt is full of the strong sense characteristic of Lord Abinger, and I venture to adopt the language of Lord Blackburn in Hubley v. Hubley[12] and say that I incline to agree with and to adopt everyword of it. And with reference to the judgment of the Privy Council which I have quoted that\nhe, at least, was not prepared to say that he should hold the conduct or the motives of Mr. Newdegate as proved before him to be such as within the words of that judgment taken even in the sense contended for to relieve him from the character of a maintainer,\nit seems to me his judgment must be based on the conclusion at least that the maintainor's motives in bringing the action were bad within the meaning of the phrase as used in the judgment of the Privy Council, even if it was not upon the conclusion that the litigation complained of had been finally disposed of adversely to the maintainor.\nThe case is entirely different from the present and the above quotation shews that Lord Coleridge was not prepared to dissent from the statements of the Judicial Committee as to the essential elements of maintenance while he explicitly stood by every word of Lord Abinger's judgment on the point. Clarke was a mere puppet put forward by Newdegate to bring the action for statutory penalties and indemnified by him for doing so. The latter's motives were bad with in the meaning of the rule.\nIt would indeed at the present day be a startling proposition to put forward that every one was guilty of the crime of maintenance who assisted another in bringing or maintaining an action, irrespective of the results or merits of such action and whether the courts sustained it or not. Many grasping, rich men and soulless corporations would greedily welcome such a determination of the law, because it would enable them successfully to ignore and refuse the claims of every poor man who had not sufficient means himself to prosecute his case in the courts, conscious that if any third person except from charity gave the necessary financial assistance to have justice enforced, as soon as it was enforced the denier of justice could turn round and compel the good Samaritan to pay him all the costs he had incurred in attempting to defeat justice.\nSuch a condition of things is repugnant to our common sense and the courts have from time to time found it necessary to engraft exceptions upon the law of maintenance making such things and relations as kindred affection or charity, with or without reasonable ground, a lawful excuse for maintaining an action and confining the law to cases where a man improperly and for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife encourages others to bring actions or to make defences which they had no right to bring or make.\nUnder these circumstances I have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal with costs, basing my judgment upon both grounds, the absence of essential ingredients necessary to maintain the action, and the absence of any evidence of damage necessarily sustained by plaintiff as a result of the maintenance found.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant sued in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to recover damages alleged to have been suffered by him by reason of the respondent having (wrongfully moved by champertous considerations) maintained an action brought by one Briggs against him, the appellant. Briggs succeeded in his action and the appellant was adjudged to pay costs.\nAssuming the offences of champerty and mainten- ance rightly charged against the respondent, I am unable to see how he can be held liable in a form of action in which damages, in law, must, as an essential element for success, be shewn to have been wrongfully suffered by him who brings the action.\nThe damages he complains of flowed, not from the wrongful act of the respondent but from what must be assumed to have been the righteous judgment of this court.\nWe cannot assume, even if that would help the appellant, that, if the respondent had not intermeddled, the man Briggs would have failed to get that justice with costs. Nor does the answer of the jury to a question bearing on this point help much.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis, Marshall & Macneill.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taylor & O'Shea.\n[1] 12 B.C.

In an action by his widow for damages, questions were submitted to the jury without objection by the parties and no objection was raised to the judge's charge, at the trial. The jury were not asked to specify the particular negligence which caused the injury and, by their answers, found that deceased was acting under the instruction and guidance of the company's officers, who were his superiors at the time of the accident; that he had control of the work to be done but had not full charge, control and management of the machinery generally; that there was fault on the part of the company, and that he had not unnecessarily or negligently assumed any risk.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, Davies J. dissenting, that as there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably draw inferences and come to these conclusions, as to the facts, and, as no objection was made to the questions put to them and to the charge of the judge, at the trial, their findings ought not to be interfered with on appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at the City of Montreal (Taschereau J. dissenting), by which the judgment in favour of the plaintiff entered by Hutchinson J., on the findings of the jury, at the trial, was affirmed with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought the action, in her own name and as tutrix to her two minor children, to recover damages from the company, appellants, in consequence of the death of her husband which was alleged to have been caused by their negligent omission to protect dangerous machinery in their paper mill, at East Angus, Que.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated and the questions at issue on this appeal are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. said Fraser K.C. (Howard with them) for the appellants.\nLafleur K.C. and Gate K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The deceased Cameron, husband of the respondent, was employed by the appellants in their mill at East Angus, Que., as master mechanic continuously for over fifteen years previous to the happenings complained of.\nOn the 10th of January, 1905, Cameron was ordered, owing to a shortage of water, to disconnect one of the water-wheels and remove it from the wheel-pit, a work of some danger when carried out while the mill was in operation. This work had been done by Cameron many times during his long period of service and he had the choice of his assistants, etc., and was perfectly familiar with all the risks which he assumed. It was apparently his invariable practice to do some preliminary work such as to prepare ropes, blocks and other tackle required to lift the wheel before shutting down the mill and thus save time. On the occasion in question he followed his usual custom, and after the preliminary work was almost completed, Cameron, in attempting to reach a rope being let down from the ceiling by one of his assistants, lost his balance, fell over on the shaft and thence was thrown on the rapidly revolving crown-gear and crushed to death.\nThe negligence complained of is that the crown-gear was improperly left uncovered and it is charged that if the defendants had done their duty in this respect the accident would not have happened. On the other hand the appellants allege that the deceased was an experienced, highly paid mechanic, who had complete control of all the machinery in the mill ; that it was his duty to take such precautions as in his judgment might have been necessary to protect the machinery at this place ; that he was familiar with the work in the doing of which he had the choice of his assistants; that it was within his power to stop the mill at any time, and that he negligently and unnecessarily assumed a risk which resulted in the accident.\nThe issues of fact were found by a jury on questions which were not objected to or complained of so far as the record shews, and no objection appears to have been made to the summing up, and in answer to these questions the jury found:\n1st. That the deceased was acting under the instructions and guidance of officers of the company who were superior to him at the time of the accident;\n2ndly. That while he had control as to the manner in which the work was to be done he had not full charge, control and management of the gearings, shafts and machinery generally; 3rdly. That the death was due to the fault and negligence of the company (appellants) and that Cameron had not unnecessarily or negligently assumed any risk.\nThe jury should, in my opinion, in such a case as this have been asked specifically what the negligence of the plaintiffs was which caused the injury. But this was not apparently suggested by either party. On the facts as proved the jury came to the conclusion that negligence ought to be inferred and that all reasonable precautions had not been taken; Metropolitan Railway. Co. v. Jackson[1]; Mader v. Halifax Electric Tramway Go[2]; and I am not prepared to say that the verdict is one which the jury viewing the whole of the evidence could not reasonably find. There was some evidence to justify it. In my opinion the law applicable is well expressed in Dal. Jur. G\u00e9n. 1884,2,89:\nAinsi, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour que le patron n'est pas responsable de l'accident survenu \u00e0 son ouvrier quand celui-ci, laiss\u00e9 ma\u00eetre de ses d\u00e9terminations, a entrepris, imprudemment et sans y \u00eatre oblig\u00e9, un travail dangereux, dans des conditions ou avec des moyens qui n'offrent pas de suffisantes garanties pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9, ou lorsque le travail pr\u00e9sentant des risques in\u00e9vitables que l'ouvrier a d\u00fb pr\u00e9voir, celui-ci vient \u00e0 \u00eatre bless\u00e9 dans l'ex\u00e9cution par suite d'un cas fortuit ou de sa propre n\u00e9gligence. Les risques qu'il court en ces divers cas ne peuvent \u00eatre couverts que par un contrat d'assurance; la responsabilit\u00e9 du patron ne saurait alors \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e, parce qu'il n'a commis aucune faute. (V. Jur. G\u00e9n., vo. \"Ouvriers,\" nos. 93 et suiv.; 103 et suiv.; Aubry et Rau, Droit civil fran\u00e7ais, 4 \u00e9dit. t. 4, par. 446, p. 755; Req. 15 nov., 1881, D.P. 83, 1. 159; Req. 13 f\u00e9vr. 1882, D.P. 82, 1. 419).\nIn view of the finding of the jury that there was no negligence on the part of Cameron, and that the gearings and shafts at the place where the accident occurred were negligently left unguarded and in a dangerous condition by the company, we must conclude that possibly the employers did not do all their duty towards the deceased.\nDal. Jur. G\u00e9n. 1870, 3, 63\/ Under this arr\u00eat there is the following note:\nToutefois, cette r\u00e8gle ne doit pas \u00eatre pouss\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame; et dans l'arr\u00eat pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la cour de Metz ajoute avec raison : \"A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la responsabilit\u00e9 du chef de l'usine est toujours engag\u00e9e pour le cas o\u00f9 l'accident aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par sa faute, c'est-\u00e0-dire, s'il \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9 qu'au danger ins\u00e9parable de l'\u0153uvre il eut ajout\u00e9 une autre cause de danger r\u00e9sultant de son propre fait.\" Il faut aller plus loin, croyons-nous, et imposer au patron, avec le pr\u00e9sent jugement, l'obligation de recourir, pour att\u00e9nuer ce danger, \u00e0 toutes les pr\u00e9cautions conseill\u00e9es par la pratique et par la science. A cet \u00e9gard, le patron ne doit pas s'en rapporter \u00e0 l'usage, ni attendre que ces pr\u00e9cautions soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es obligatoires par des r\u00e8glements. C'est ce qu'ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 un arr\u00eat de la cour de Paris du 12 mai, 1866, et un jugement du tribunal de Mulhouse du 18 janv., 1867, reproduits l'un et l'autre Jur. g\u00e9n., v. \"Ouvriers,\" no. 96.\nSome reference was made to insurance received by respondent. I would adopt the rule laid down in Grand Trunk Railway Go. V. Jennings[3], at page 803.\nThere is authority for the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Mathieu in the Court of Review, that the amount of the insurance should not have been deducted from the amount of the damages. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Beckett[4]; Laurent, vol. 20, No. 580. But that question is not before us in this appeal.\nGirouard J. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Davies J. (dissenting).\u2014If the decision of this case rested solely upon the question as to whether or not the deceased, who was the master mechanic of the appellants' paper mills, was the \"author of his own wrong,\" and whether his death was occasioned by his own fault, negligence and unnecessary assumption of risk, in reaching out as he did to catch the rope depending from the floor above, I should have felt great diffidence in dissenting from the view which prevailed with the majority of the court, supported as it is by the finding of the jury and the judgment of the majority of the court below.\nIn the view I take of the case, however, it is not necessary for me to argue the point at length because, I am of the opinion that the deceased* came to his death by his own fault and negligence in failing to carry out the explicit instructions given to him by the general manager of the defendants' mills. These instructions were given to Cameron by the general manager at a. time when the former was the master mechanic of the paper mill in which he afterwards. met his death. They were given to him after an accident had happened to one of the workmen employed in one of the appellants' mills adjoining that of which Cameron was the master mechanic. They were given to him personally by the general manager of the company's mills in the presence of the company's secretary and were to the effect\nthat he was to go over all the machinery in the mill and make everything safe.\nThe instructions are sworn to specifically by the general manager and by the secretary. They stand uncontradicted and the only possible doubt which could be raised regarding them was suggested by Mr. Lafleur as arising out of a single answer, said to be of doubtful meaning, given by the general manager to a question put to him in cross-examination. I think the answer referred to, when read in connection with the witness's other answers, means that while the witness could not swear to every identical word he used in giving the instructions, he did instruct him clearly and definitely to go over the machinery and see that everything was made safe. But Mr. Palmer's evidence, the general secretary, unattacked and uncontradicted, mates everything relating to those instructions plain and clear. The attention of the jury does not seem to have been specifically directed, as it ought to have been, to this point, nor was any question asked them concerning it.\nI think the case comes within the principle of the decision of this court in the case of Davidson v. Stuart[5], where it was held, as I think properly, that there was no breach of duty on the part of defendant towards deceased, who had undertaken to remedy the very defects which caused his death and the failure to discover them or provide against them must be attributed to him.\nAt the worst there should be a new trial in order that this crucial point might be submitted to and passed upon by the jury.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants have been condemned by the Superior Court in Quebec to pay damages caused by their neglect to safeguard their machinery whereby the husband of the plaintiff, now respondent, met his death, whilst in the employment of the appellants as a master mechanic.\nThe Court of Review confirmed this judgment, and hence this appeal.\nThe case was tried with a jury and all their findings of fact are against the appellants.\nIt is not, I think, seriously contended at this stage, that the machinery was properly safeguarded as required by \"The Quebec Factories Act\"[6] which contains the following general provision:\n3021. The industrial establishments mentioned in the preceding article must be built and kept in such manner as to secure the safety of all employed in them; and, in those which contain mechanical apparatus, the machinery, mechanism, gearing, tools and engines shall be so placed and kept, as to afford every possible security for the employees.\nAs has been pointed out by my brother Girouard, in more than one case, section 3053(a) of the same Act which is as follows:\n3053(a). The provisions of the civil laws of this province, concerning the responsibility of the employer towards his employees, are in no manner considered as being modified or changed by the provisions of this Act,\nmay reduce this section 3021 to being part of a police regulation.\nNevertheless, this section 3021 may yet, as Mr. Lafleur argued, be an embodiment of the law which bound appellants in their relations with the deceased in the absence of an express contracting out of the law.\nWithout deciding that or going quite as far as the last words of section 3021, that is \"to afford every possible security for the employees\" and keeping well within what I gather from the decisions in Quebec to be the jurisprudence of that province on the subject, I think it was fairly open to the jury to find as they have done, in this case, that leaving the machinery in question without being safeguarded, either by handrail or by covering, as suggested by some of the witnesses, was a fault within the meaning of the article 1053 of the Civil Code.\nIt seems to me impossible to hold that the law in Quebec in this regard, as laid down in many cases, was complied with by the appellants. It seems equally impossible to me, to hold, in this case, that if the safeguarding required\u2014I do not say by the statute just cited, but within the comprehensive language of the Code\u2014had been observed, that the accident in question could have happened.\nIt is said, however, that the deceased, by virtue of his employment as a master mechanic, had cast upon him the duty of providing that safeguarding required.\nIt seems to me that this contention is quite unfounded. There is not implied in the words \"master\" mechanic\" any such duty. Nor is there in the evidence of those witnesses attempting to define his duties or to give a history of his conduct in such employment anything to permit us to infer that such duty was cast upon him.\nThe design of the proprietors in the whole planning and construction of their mills evidently was to have the machinery in question exposed.\nWhen the deceased was employed as master mechanic, it was to run and superintend the running of the machinery thus intentionally designed, and not to re-construct, as was evidently needed\u2014at least in part\u2014or to add to the structural arrangements he thus found completed.\nIt cannot be said that the word \"repairs,\" even if he had much wider authority in that behalf than I think he had, could be extended to cover such additional expense in a mill that was new when he came to it to discharge the duties assigned him.\nIt is said, however, that at one time, just after an accident, six or seven years before the one now in question, the deceased was told to see that all steps needed to safeguard the machinery should be taken.\nThe evidence of this is, to my mind, most unsatisfactory.\nWas anything done in pursuance of such direction? It would seem not. Was any explanation ever asked, any report ever requested, any further regard had to it, by him who is alleged to have given such loose sort of directions as sworn to? It seems not. Surely, he could not have imagined his mill, was perfect, and if he did not, he, in default of hearing anything or seeing anything done, would surely have reverted again to the subject. And yet, he never breathes another word, so far as I can see, on the subject, and cannot tell us what language he used so that we may judge the true import of it.\nThe new manager in charge, when the accident now in question occurred, had gone through the form of re-engaging each employee, including deceased, and I think it may well be that this new engagement put an end in law to all that had preceded it.\nThe jury, however, have, I think, rightly found against the contention and thus put an end to it as far as we are concerned, unless we meddle in a way this court has repeatedly refused to do as in the case of The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard[7], and go far beyond what it did in the case of Dominion Cartridge Go. v. McArthur[8], when its interference with a jury's verdict was set aside by the Privy Council.\nMere knowledge by the employed of the conditions, unless coupled with something more, will not of itself relieve the employer.\nThe appellants claim, however, that because the deceased was engaged at the time of the accident in that which was, as the jury have found, wholly entrusted to him, he must be held to have assumed the risk or at all events, contributed to his own destruction in such a way as to deprive his widow of any right in law to complain.\nThe order was given him to disconnect a water-wheel.\nThere seems a confusion of ideas in the argument at this stage. The appellants' counsel allege he should have stopped the mill. No one pretends he was going to execute this order without stopping the mill. No one pretends in giving evidence, whatever counsel may argue, that he would have acted properly in stopping the mill whilst he was engaged in the mere preliminary work of getting things ready to execute this order. It would have been most improper for him to have stopped the mill at any time during these preparations up to the moment before the accident, when as he expressed it,\nwe won't attempt to do any more before the wheel is stopped, before the wheel is closed.\nEven if he should have stopped the mill whilst so engaged, the preparatory work was successfully accomplished and no evil results flowed therefrom or from anything authorized by the deceased to be done in that regard.\nOne of the men, on a floor above deceased, for some reason, I cannot quite clearly understand, just at this juncture, let a rope drop down and it seemed in danger of going into the machinery. The man was not told by the deceased to do this and he, evidently fearing some one blundered, reached out to grasp the rope and save ill results. In his effort, he tried to do what a taller man could have done successfully, but proved beyond him and for want of a hand rail or cover protecting the place, he stepped to destruction.\nThe impulsive act was natural and in line of his duty which was, amongst other things, to avert injury to the machinery or those about it. It was not a wise thing to do. He erred in judgment. Was he negligent in doing it? Fidelity to his employers was the basis of his act. I am not surprised that the jury have concluded he was not negligent. I will not disturb their finding and help to impose upon men similarly situated a legal duty to sacrifice others and take care of themselves, without an effort to save.\nSome question was raised as to the form of the question put to the jury, as to whether the death of the late John E. Cameron was due to the fault and negligence of the company defendant.\nIt was alleged that the question was a mixed one of law and of fact and improper for the jury to be called on to answer.\nIt is not a model to be followed, but as there was only one kind of negligence imputed to the defendants by the plaintiffs, and it is to be presumed, in the absence of any objection to the learned trial judge's charge, that, as to the element of law involved in the question, he properly directed the jury and they, thus guided, dealt with the facts only.\nMoreover, no objection so far as can be seen, was taken by the defendants at the proper time to the form of question.\nIt would never do to have in such a state of things trials and verdicts set aside on such a ground alone.\nWe must remember that for centuries juries had, when confined to \u00e0 general verdict properly directed as to the law, to deal with the law and the facts in much more complex cases and issues than the very simple one here.\nAt the trial everybody seems to have been satisfied with the charge, the verdict, and the judgment, and no one objected to the charge or objects now, nor did they to the verdict, until they appealed.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaClennan J. agreed to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree that, as regards the form in which the issues of fact were submitted to the jury, no question is before us. The sole point, consequently, is whether the appellant company has successfully impugned the verdict as against the weight of evidence. On this point I agree with the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice and have nothing to add to it.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hurd, Fraser, Macdonald & Rugg.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Cate, Wells & White.\n[1] 3 App. Cas. 193.\n[2] 37 Can.

(1897), c. 135, ss. 50, 130.\nWhere B., acting as principal and for himself only, signed a document containing the following provision: \"We hereby agree to give F. one-half (1\/2) non-assessable interest in the following claims\" (describing three located mineral claims), in the name of \"J. B. & Sons,\" without authority from the locatees of two of the claims which had been staked in the names of other persons, and without their knowledge or consent.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (13 B.C. Rep. 20) that, although no such firm existed and notwithstanding that two of the claims had been located in the names of the other persons, who, while disclaiming any interest therein, had afterwards transferred them to B., the latter was personally bound by the agreement in respect to all three claims and F. was entitled to the half interest therein.\nA subsequent agreement for the reduction of the interest of F. from one-half to one\u2014fifth, which had been drawn up in writing, but was not signed by F., was held void under the Statute of Frauds. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia [1] which allowed, with costs, an appeal from the judgment of Hunter C.J., at the trial[2], and ordered that the said judgment should be varied.\nThe action was brought by the appellant, Mc-Meekin, against the other parties to this appeal, for a declaration of the interests of all parties to certain mineral claims, known as the \"Empress,\" the \"Victoria,\" the \"Queen\" and the \"Barbara Fraction,\" and for the partition and sale of the same. It was tried before His Lordship Chief Justice Hunter, who rendered a judgment declaring that the defendant, appellant, Leopold J. Boscowitz, was the owner of the said claims and that the other parties were interested only in the net proceeds thereof, to wit, the plaintiff to 17 1\/2%, the defendant Furry (administrator of the estate of Oliver Furry, deceased), to 20%, the defendant Thomas T. Turner, to 12 1\/2%, the defendant D. A. Boscowitz to 20%, and the defendant F. M. Leonard, to 17 1\/2%, respectively.\nFrom this judgment the defendant Furry appealed to the full court where his appeal was allowed with costs by the majority of that court, Martin J. dissenting, and it was declared that the defendant Furry, as administrator of the deceased Oliver Furry, was entitled to a one-half interest in the \"Empress,\" \"Victoria,\" and \"Queen\" mineral claims. From this judgment the present appeal is asserted by the plaintiff and the defendant Leopold J. Boscowitz.\nThe questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington, now reported. Davis K.C. for the appellants.\nJos. Martin K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. also agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. \u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington.\nIDINGTON J. \u2014The late Oliver Furry located three several mining claims under the \"Mineral Act,\" as follows: one called \"The Queen\" in the name of Joseph Boscowitz, the father of Leopold J. Boscowitz and D. A. Boscowitz and two others called \"The Empress\" and \"The Victoria\" respectively in each of the names of these two sons. This was done by Furry and without the knowledge of any of these parties. And the claims were recorded on the 30th of September, 1898.\nHe could not have them entered by law in his own name and they could have entered only one in each of their names as he did.\nThese locations were made at the instance of Turner, a fur trader, who was in the employment of the elder Boscowitz and paid for recording and surveying them but the labour of locating was done by Furry.\nHe had performed similar service for Turner previously on the basis of a fifty per cent, non-assessable interest being his own by way of compensation for his labour, skill and knowledge, and the remainder being Turner's, as his share for advancing the moneys for these fees and promotion of sale or development.\nI infer that when Furry at Turner's request made these locations in question herein he did so on the understanding that he would be given the same terms by the locatees named or whoever should assume their ownership or accept the fruits of his labour.\nNo one did so except Leopold Boscowitz.\nNeither the father nor David would for them-selves have anything to do with them. Leopold makes it quite clear that they did not accept and that he alone intended to accept for all these results of Turner's effort for their welfare and adopt Furry's labours in accordance therewith.\nIt would manifestly be a gross wrong to deprive Furry's heirs or representatives of what was at one time so clearly intended to have been his.\nThe substance of the transaction is that Leopold having deliberately accepted and adopted the three. locations as his own dealt with Oliver Furry on that basis, and intending to bind himself in such form as would best carry out this purpose and secure to Furry the fifty per cent. he was entitled to as the reward of his labour, first signed, to carry out this purpose, and gave on the 10th November, 1898, the following :\u2014\nVANCOUVER, B.C., November 10th, 1898.\nWe, J. Boscowitz & Sons, do give to Oliver Furry one-half (1\/2) non-assessable interest in any or all claims which he has or may locate for us.\nJ. Boscowitz & Sons.\nand on the 20th May, 1899, gave the following:\u2014 We hereby agree to give to Oliver Furry one-half (1\/2) non-assessable interest in the following claims on Howe Sound, known as \"Queen,\" \"Empress,\" and \"Victoria.\"\nJ. Boscowitz & Sons.\nThe first document was never recorded and save to throw light on the intention of the parties in the second, which was recorded, is now of no avail.\nThe first question raised is that this recorded document is not in compliance with the Statute of Frauds.\nThe agreement between the parties, apart from this document, was that the benefit of these locations should, to the extent of a half interest therein, belong to Oliver Furry whose money and labour had secured them.\nThe father was a fur trader and though wealthy never took part in such a business as mining or speculation in mining.\nLeopold had done so. David, I infer, had not, and at all events expressly says in his evidence as follows:\u2014\nQ. And subsequently you conveyed them to Leopold? A. Yes.\nQ. And all the time the claims were his, from the start? A. Yes.\nQ. You never had any interest in them, and so far as you know, your father had not? A. He gave him 20%.\nQ. I am speaking of up to the declaration of trust was made. That is the time you claim? A. Yes.\nQ. July 11th, 1900.\nIt was necessary that some one should represent all these interests and become bound to Furry and Leopold was willing to stand good for them all and so adopted this crude method. Ignorant of it when location effected he says he ratified it when he came to know of it.\nIs his undertaking in this form good?\nHe admits that he adopted this firm name and was in fact the \"J. Boscowitz & Sons\" who signed intending to be bound for the purposes of this transaction. And this is reiterated time and again in the following evidence:\u2014\nQ. Where was it you signed the papers? A. For what?\nQ. This paper, \"A.\" A. He came to me \u2014 Turner \u2014 and said, \"You sign this paper for Furry, and you get these claims.\"\nQ. It is not signed by you ? A. Certainly, that is my writing.\n* * * * * *\nQ. And all the arrangements between Furry and Turner, which were afterwards adopted by you, were with regard to you alone? A. Only me.\nQ. And although Turner worked for your father, any mining deals he had with regard to either the \"Britannia,\" or the \"Empress\" were entirely with you? A. Absolutely all mine.\nQ. So when you signed J. Boscowitz & Sons to these documents, \"A\" and \"B\" you intended it for your own signature ? A. Yes; Furry wanted it that way.\nQ. You intended that for your own signature? A. Yes; they would not go in.\n* * * * * *\nQ. About having signed \"A\" (J. Boscowitz & Sons) at the instance of Furry? A. I don't say that I am wrong.\nQ. I mean, so far as Furry himself was concerned, it may have been at Turner's instance. A. No, he came to me and said, \"That is what Furry wants.\" As I told you before, Turner did all this.\nQ. Furry could not have told you that? A. Turner told me.\nQ. In Vancouver, before you went up there. And Turner understood, of course, you were binding yourself, only, by that? A. That is right.\n* * * * * *\nQ. But the difficulty, Mr. Boscowitz, is in knowing what impression to accept? A. I am very sorry, my lord, but Turner can explain that to you very much better than I.\nQ. (Mr. Martin). Here is question 72;\nThat signature \"J. Boscowitz & Sons\" was your signature, and was intended to be you only ? A. That is all. My father never had an interest.\n* * * * * *\nQ. How was it that you came to execute the second document, exhibit \"B\" of May 20th, '99 ? A. I don't know, except that he wanted it that way. Furry wanted it that way.\nQ. Why? A. To shew his partnership with me.\nQ. To shew that he was in partnership with you? A. Yes.\nQ. The original document shewed that, didn't it? A. That was practically the original, wasn't it? Q. Exhibit \"A\" executed on the 10th of November?\nCourt. Shew him the document.\nMr. Martin. Exhibit \"A.\" That shewed you were in partnership, that each was to have half? A. Yes.\nQ. Then it could not have been for that reason that he wanted \"B\" executed ? I mean by \"B\" the document of the 20th of May, '99?\nA. You see those names do not appear there. I suppose he wanted those three names.\n* * * * * *\nQ. Under the original arrangement between Furry and you, shewn in these two documents, signed \"J. Boscowitz & Sons,\" he was not to go to any expense at all? A. No.\nQ. No. The expenses in the way of surveying the ground, granting commissions to brokers, and everything of that kind, were to be paid by you. A. All fell on me.\nQ. And he was to get one-half. So, naturally, when it came to making a survey you were \u2014 you employed\nMcGregor ? A. I did.\n* * * * * *\nQ. He found those three claims ? A. Yes.\nQ. And the bargain between you was he would give you a half interest if you would pay all the costs of the survey? A. Of the three claims.\nQ. That was part of the consideration on which you got the claims. A. Yes; I had to keep them up; I didn't have to keep them up, I could let them run out, if I wanted to, and could have had them re-staked.\nQ. You think that would have been honest ? . A. No; that would not have. been a square deal.\n* * * * * *\nQ. Signed \"J. Boscowitz & Sons.\" My learned friend made this statement to you, although in the form of a question, but you intended that \"J. Boscowitz & Sons,\" merely for your own signature, and you said yes. Will you explain what you meant when you told him you intended that, that is, J. Boscowitz & Sons, merely for your own signature? A. Because I was the only one that was doing the business, they hadn't any interest in mining, and they didn't want any.\nQ. What did you mean by the signature ? A. As my own signature.\n* * * * * *\nMr. Martin (to witness). The \"J. Boscowitz & Sons\" which is at the foot of these documents, \"A\" and \"B,\" you know those documents, one of the 10th of November, '98, and the other of the 20th of May, '99. Whose signature did you intend that for ? A. I intended it for my own.\nMr. Davis. What did you mean by that? A. Because he wanted the name of J. Boscowitz & Sons. I said, \"There you are; I will sign it.\" Q. That is not your signature? A. No, that is not mine.\nQ. What did you mean by saying you intended it as your signature? A. Because he wanted it that way.\nQ. When you say \"sign\" you mean \"write\"? A. Yes, he wanted it that way, and I wrote it that way.\"\nAssuming a firm name, though in fact it represents only one man, is much too common a device in use for business purposes to say that a man cannot be bound by any such name he chooses to adopt.\nUsually the man doing so carries on for a longer or shorter period as the case may be his business in that way. But is length of time in the use thereof the measure of its efficacy in binding him who uses such a business name?\nYet we are asked to discard the manifest purpose of the parties and hold that this adopted name cannot in any way bind him who used it, and cannot bind him at all events as to two of the parcels of property that were in the minds of the parties from the inception as, and formed, part of the basis of their bargain. And why? They evidently both intended the bargain to cover all three parcels.\nThey as clearly expected the father and brother of him who was thus binding himself to surrender to him and that he was to acquire whatever legal interest they or either had and make it as completely subject to the domination of him who signed as was that he had already over one parcel.\nIt is said, however, that two of these interests stood in the names of others and that we must look at them as respectively owning them and that agency must be shewn on Leopold's part to enable him to thus bind their several interests even when they come to his hands.\nBut is that so? They made no claim to them, on the contrary disclaimed any and transferred to Leopold. They stood as respective trustees of them. True the trust as such was possibly not enforceable.\nEven if they could not be looked upon as holding property purchased by Furry and procured by him to be conveyed to each of them for him in such a way that they were bound to account to him as in case of a resulting trust, and that they could not for want of a declaration in writing be held to an execution of the crust were they bound by law to commit a fraud?\nIf they did not choose to do so but had conveyed to Leopold (at his request and in good, faith desiring to execute the purpose of his undertaking) the next day after the execution of this document of the 20th of May, '99, for the express purpose of carrying out the intention of Furry and himself could Leopold have refused to implement the undertaking it stands for?\nIt would rather shock one to find that such a thing could be argued as possible. Yet every argument adduced in support of this contention of the bearing of the Statute of Frauds on this part of the case is just as complete and strong in the case I put as in that.\nNow what did happen is that, after a longer time than a day the property became absolutely vested in Leopold and whilst it was so vested, the document was registered. It does not seem to me that all the happenings between the 20th May, 1899, and the 10th of April, 1901, when the registration took place affected or could affect the neat legal point of whether or not Leopold was bound by virtue of the document to carry out his bargain so far as he could.\nIt was his duty to acquire with reasonable effort the legal title that would enable him to carry it out. It was he who was bound. It was he who undertook to hold for or to give Furry the specified interest.\nThe statute requires that the\nagreement upon which such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, etc., etc.\nLeopold was the only party to be charged therewith. He admits it. He was enabled by what had transpired and which clearly (apart from the unexplained dealings) was within the contemplation of himself and Furry, as likely to transpire, to discharge the duty cast upon him. What right has he to say \"I was not possessed when I signed though I am now of the entire title or enough to answer my obligation to Furry?\" It is not the case of selling a pretended title in violation of a statute. No such thing is pleaded. Nor is it the case of having by acquisition for valuable consideration another's interest that he is by law entitled to set up as beyond the purview of his agreement.\nThe objection is taken that the registration was, for want of the written authority of the principals required by section 50 of \"The Mineral Act,\" void.\nIn the view I have just expressed, that it is not a case of agency at all but of one man using as his own a firm name, this objection falls to the ground.\nThe claim is made that this interest of one-half was reduced to twenty per cent. by a later agreement.\nThe objection is taken that this agreement for a reduction of this interest from one-half to one-fifth is not evidenced by the necessary writing under the Statute of Frauds. I agree that the objection is fatal to this claim. A clear case may be made by oral evidence of accord and satisfaction or even of a substituted agreement in some such cases. I cannot find either here.\nElaborate and able argument on either side has left so far as I am concerned the deepest distrust. I am glad there was a small writing, however unsatisfactory in some respects, to guide us in the part of the case I have been thus far enabled to form an opinion. upon.\nIt would serve no good purpose now to analyse the mass of contradictions and improbabilities on either side and shew why I am unable to form an opinion; much less one that I ought to feel clearly established before giving effect to it as against the admitted writing.\nA deeper cut than either party chose to take might have opened up a satisfactory solution.\nOne cannot help suspecting the whole trouble arose from evading the mining regulations of the statute but this was not set up and is not perhaps so apparent as to render it incumbent on us to notice it. I have treated the case as if nothing prevented Furry putting each of these properties in the names respectively of three separate persons and that two of them recognized themselves as trustees for him and the other one chose to accept, the terms on which Furry had so placed his properties.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. \u2014 I also agree in the opinion delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Idington.

Deschamps, Trading Together Under The Name and Style Of Blue & Deschamps (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1907: October 14, 15; 1907: November 20.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nOperation of railway\u2014Unnecessary combustibles left on right of way\u2014\"Railway Act, 1903\" secs. 118 (j) and 239\u2014R.S.C.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia [1], affirming the judgment of Morrison J., at the trial, by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nA. H. MacNeill K.C. for the appellants.\nNesbitt K.C. and C. R. Hamilton K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff, although with some hesitation. I wish at the same time to express my regret that it is not possible for us to entertain the application of the respondent to add to the case on appeal a map or plan of the completed railway and of the land taken or obtained for the use thereof, deposited, as alleged, with the Department of Railways and Canals pursuant to the \"Railway Act of 1888,\" 51 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 134.\nThe jurisprudence of the court is well settled by a long line of decisions that an appeal to the Supreme Court must be decided solely upon the evidence contained in the case certified to the registrar by the clerk of the court appealed from. Providence Washington Ins. Co. v. Gerow[2] ; Etna Ins. Co. v. Brodie[3] ; Confederation Life Association v. O'Donnell [4] ; Exchange Bank v. Gilman[5]; City of Montreal v. Hogan[6]. In the Privy Council, Macqueen's Practice, page 765; Banco de Portugal v. Waddell[7].\nIn addition to the above cases I have had the registrar look up the papers in an unreported decision of the court in 1893, in a case of Ross v. Ross, in which I was engaged. This was a petition to the court asking to have added to the case on appeal four certain deeds which the petitioners claimed they had discovered since the judgment given by the court of appeal, and which had, it was claimed, an important bearing upon the matters in controversy. After reserving judgment, the motion having been referred to the full court by the Honourable Mr. Justice Fournier, to whom the application was first made, the court, without calling upon counsel to shew cause against the application, refused to make the order asked for.\nThis jurisprudence is based upon the provisions of section 73 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which reads in part as follows:\u2014\nThe appeal shall be upon a case to be stated by the parties, or, in the event of difference, to be settled by the court appealed from or a judge thereof.\nSection 51 of the Act provides that the Supreme Court may\ngive the judgment and award the process or other proceedings which the court, whose decision is appealed against, should have given or awarded.\nThis section contemplates that the case in the Supreme Court shall be the same case as was under consideration in the court appealed from, for how, otherwise, could this court reverse the court below on the ground that it should have given the judgment which is ultimately given by the Supreme Court, when the court below had not before it the material upon which the judgment of the Supreme Court is founded?\nI do not wish to express any opinion as to the bearing the plan might have upon the case; but I wish to express my regret that we have no authority to receive the plan because it is conceivable that, on the statements made by counsel, both parties might be saved the trouble and expense of another trial. This, however, must be accepted as an expression of opinion personal to myself.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of my brother Mr. Justice Duff.\nAs to the motion to admit plans, they could not properly help us here and, therefore, the motion ought not to be acceded to, even if we had the power which, it is said, has been denied. But, upon that question, I express no opinion.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree with my brother Mr. Justice Duff..\nDUFF J.\u2014I find myself after the careful consideration of the whole of this case unable to resist the conclusion that the appellant company is entitled to a new trial.\nThe plaintiff's claim is a claim for damages caused by a fire which is alleged to have originated on the defendant company's right of way near Rossland, B.C.; and the liability of the defendant company (if any) rests upon this\u2014that the fire in question is attributable to the failure of the company to perform its statutory duty to keep its right of way clear of combustible materials.\nThe enactment imposing this duty[8] (section 297 of the \"Railway Act\") is in the following words:\u2014\n297. The company shall at all times maintain and keep its right of way free from dead or dry grass, weeds and other unnecessary combustible matter.\nThe plaintiffs alleged in their pleadings and at the trial assumed the burden of proving that the fire had its origin in the ignition of some such combustible material on the defendant company's right of way. In regard to this point the controversy turned upon the question whether or not a place ascertained as the place of origin of the fire, is within the limits of the right of way. This question is obviously in part\u2014in so far, that is to say, as it involves a definition of the term the \"right of way\" as used in the enactment quoted\u2014a question of law; and upon that the jury were entitled to the guidance of the court. The learned judge did not explain to the jury the meaning of this term; but told them that if the defendants felled trees on the land adjoining their line and left them or other materials there in a combustible state that would be evidence of negligence. The defendants had by virtue of the enactment corresponding to section 151 (j)[9] the right to fell trees standing within 100 feet of either side of their right of way for the protection of their line; and this the jury was told by the learned judge at the request of the counsel for the defendant company. But the observations of the learned judge at that point in his charge could, I think, leave in the minds of the jury no room for doubt, that if, in exercising this statutory power the defendants left material which was likely to become and which afterwards became ignited by sparks emitted from their locomotives, that would be evidence of actionable negligence to which they might give effect by a verdict in this action for the plaintiff.\nI should not in the least disagree with this statement of the law; but it had no application to the case which the learned judge and the jury were engaged in trying. The plaintiff's action is based, as I have said, upon the allegation that the fire had its commencement in combustible material left by the company (in breach of the statutory duty referred to) within the limits of its right of way; and the issue raised by that allegation was the issue to which the evidence was directed. The defendants were not called upon to meet and made no effort to meet a case of negligent exercise of their powers under section 151 (j). In effect, therefore, the learned trial judge left to the jury a case which was not raised by the pleadings and not tried; while upon the real issue of fact upon the determination of which the plaintiff's case rested the jury were not given the necessary assistance to enable them properly to appreciate what the question was which they were called upon to decide.\nThere was evidence, unquestionably, from which the jury might have found that the defendant company had cleared a continuous strip of land in which they had placed their road\u2014bed and track; and it would I think have been a proper direction that if the jury found that this strip was occupied or appropriated by the defendant company as its way or part of its way then they should, in the absence of better evidence, for the purposes of this action treat it as included within the limits of the defendant company's right of way within the meaning of the enactment I have quoted. But the defendants were clearly. I think, entitled to have the jury pass upon the question whether in point of fact there was a strip so cleared as to lead to the inference that it was occupied or appropriated as a way of the company's railway. And it was their clear right also to have the opinion of the jury whether or not, given such a strip, the place where the fire commenced was within it. In effect the jury were directed that if the fire originated in combustible material left by the defendant company in any space cut or slashed by them whether as part of their way or otherwise they are in this action responsible for the ensuing damage.\nThere is, it is true, in answer to a question put to the jury an express finding that the fire originated within the right of way. But the charge was, I think, calculated to convey to the minds of the jury the impression that any space so cut or slashed might properly be, for the purpose of arriving at an answer to that question, treated as included within the right of way; and thus the very point which it was essential that they should determine in order intelligently to answer the question\u2014the limit of the right of way in relation to a place where the fire originated\u2014was in effect withdrawn from them. The defendant company was not only entitled to a finding upon that question; it was entitled to such a finding arrived at under a proper direction. If one could on the evidence as it stands for one's self come to the conclusion that there was a strip of such a character that in the absence of better evidence of the extent of the right of way the defendant company ought to be held to have appropriated it as such, and that the fire originated within that strip, that would, I think, be a sufficient ground for holding that, there being no substantial prejudice to the appellant, a new trial should be refused; but while the first of these questions would to me present no difficulty, I am unable upon this record to reach a conclusion in favour of the plaintiff on the second. I do not mean to suggest that there is such a lack of evidence as to the exact position of the point of origin of the fire as would have justified the trial judge withdrawing the case from the jury; but in the evidence disclosed by the record I am not able to find sufficient material to enable me to reach a conclusion upon it. In these circumstances the defendant company is, I think, entitled to have the issues in the action submitted to another jury.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of the appeal to this court and the full court. The costs of the abortive trial should abide the event of a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A. H. MacNeill.\nSolicitor for the respondents: C. R.

When it came before the trial judges they held that such order was void as fixing the time beyond the extended period which was a date at which the trial could not be entered upon. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada from this decision and it was there reversed and the judges were directed to proceed with the trial[1]. On application of the petitioners an order was made by the trial judges fixing September 3rd, 1907, as the time for commencing the trial from which order an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada by the respondents to the petition, who claimed that by the effect of the former order of the latter court the trial had been commenced on July 17th, 1906, and as it must proceed from day to day there was no machinery for continuing, also that the petitioners had been guilty of laches in delaying the proceedings so long.\nOn the appeals being called Mr. Justice Girouard, who presided over the court in the absence of the Chief Justice made an announcement as follows:\n\"I observe that these appeals have been placed at the foot of the Maritime List and understand from the registrar that it was done by consent of counsel. Since I have had the honour of a seat on this bench, election cases have invariably been placed by the registrar at the top of the list. In such cases the convenience of counsel alone is not to be considered. The electorate is also interested and this very case shews that counsel for the parties, even for the petitioner, care very little for the public. Speaking for the court, and with the sanction of the Chief Justice, I wish it understood that in the future, as in the past, no election appeal is to be placed anywhere except at the top of the whole list unless otherwise specially ordered by the court or a judge.\"\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents moved to quash the appeals.\nMellish K.C.. for the appellants contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavies J.\u2014These appeals are from interlocutory orders of the trial judges setting down the cases for trial on a particular day. There had been a previous appeal to this court in each of the cases from a judgment or decision of the trial judges, after the hearing: had been begun in each case, to the effect that their jurisdiction had come to an end and that they had no power to proceed further with the trials. The result. practically was to dismiss the petition. This court. held that the jurisdiction of the trial judges had not come to an end and remitted the petitions back with instructions that the trials should be resumed at the stage where they had been stopped.\nIt is from the orders made setting down a day for so resuming the trials of these election petitions that. these appeals are taken.\nIt seems to me perfectly plain that no such appeals lie.\nThe only appeals provided for to this court by the statute outside of those on preliminary objections, are appeals\nfrom the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judges who have tried the petition. In the cases before us no such state of facts as required by the statute exists. The petition has not been tried. The former order of this court that the trial should be resumed and gone on with has not yet been complied with. I do not think it is open to serious argument that every decision given by the trial judges either before or during the progress of the trial is at once and before the end of the trial appealable. Such a conclusion would defeat the object of the statute absolutely, and make election trials a farce.\nWe are all of the opinion that we have no jurisdiction to hear these appeals and that they should both be quashed with costs.\nI fully concur in the remarks of Girouard J. as to the necessity for the strict observance of the rule of this court that all appeals in election cases should be placed at the head of the docket or list of appeals and heard first and before other appeals, unless the court on satisfactory cause shewn, makes an order changing the place on the docket of such appeals.\nThe public is interested in the speedy hearing and disposition of these appeals and this court will not assent to any delay in such hearing unless for good cause shewn.\nAppeals quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: G. Fred. Pearson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John A. McKinnon.\n[1] 37 Can. S.C.R. 601.\n"}

Act, 1867, s. 92(11).\nHeld, per Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ., Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. contra:\u2014That a company incorporated under the authority of a provincial legislature to carry on the business of fire insurance is not inherently incapable of entering outside the boundaries of its province of origin into a valid contract of insurance relating to property also outside of those limits.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J.\u2014Sub-sec. 11 of sec. 92, B.N.A. Act, 1867, empowering a legislature to incorporate \u201ccompanies for provincial objects,\u201d not only creates a limitation as to the objects of a company so incorporated but confines its operations within the geographical area of the province creating it. And the possession by the company of a license from the Dominion Government under 51 Vict. ch. 28 (R.S. 1906, ch. 34, sec. 4) authorizing it to do business throughout Canada is of no avail for the purpose.\nGirouard J. expressed no opinion on this question.\nAn Insurance Company incorporated under the laws of Ontario insured a railway company, a part of whose line ran through the State of Maine, \u201cagainst loss or damage caused by locomotives to property located in the State of Maine not including that of the assured.\u201d By a statute in that state the railway company is made liable for injury so caused and is given an insurable interest in property along its line for which it is so responsible.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (11 Ont. L.R. 465) which maintained the verdict at the trial (9 Ont. L.R. 493) that the policy did not cover standing timber along the line of railway which the charter of the insurance company did not permit it to insure.\nHeld, also, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies J. dissenting, that the policy was not on that account of no effect as there was other property covered by it in which the railway company had an insurable interest; therefore the latter was not entitled to recover back the premiums it had paid.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the verdict at the trial[2], in favour of the defendants.\nThe Ottawa Fire Insurance Co. is incorporated under \u201cThe Ontario Insurance Act.\u201d It issued a policy to the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. insuring the latter in the following terms. \u201cOn all claims for loss or damage caused by locomotives to property located in the State of Maine not including that of the assured or upon land owned, leased or operated by the assured.\u201d The Railway Co., a portion of whose line ran through the State of Maine, had by the law of the state an insurable interest in property along its line for loss of which, by fire from its locomotives, it might be liable.\nThe railway company sued on this policy to recover the amount it had been obliged to pay for loss of standing timber on its line in Maine through fire from its locomotives, claiming, in the alternative, a return of the premiums paid if it was held that the insurance company had no power to insure standing timber. The defendant company pleaded, and the courts below held, that, under its charter, it could not insure standing timber and that the plaintiff could not recover the amount paid for premiums as the policy covered other property in which it had an insurable interest. The plaintiff company appealed to the Supreme Court from the decision of the Court of Appeal to this effect.\nEwart K.C. and MacMurchy, for the appellants. This is not the usual case of insurance on property but is a guarantee or contract of indemnity against liability to property owners.\nIf it is an insurance on property it covers standing timber. See London v. Southwell College[3]; Hamilton Mfg. Co. v. Massachusetts[4].\nThe statute law of the State of Maine does not assist the defendants as the insurance effected was not that contemplated by the statute. See North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co.[5], at pages 581 and 584.\nStanding timber was what the plaintiffs intended to insure and if it is not covered by the policy the parties were never ad idem and the consideration for the contract fails. Therefore the premiums should be returned. See Chand on Consent, pp. 1 and 2; Wilding, v. Sanderson[6]; Pollock on Contracts, 7 ed. p. 486; Burson v. German Union Ins. Co.[7]\nShepley K.C. and F.A. Magee, for the respondents. The word \u201cproperty\u201d used in the policy must be construed with regard to the statutory powers of the respondents, which do not authorize the insurance of standing timber.\nThe policy covered other property in which appellants had an insurable interest and the premiums were earned. See Moran, Galloway & Co. v. Uzielli[8]; Bunyon on Fire Insurance, 4 ed. p. 13.\nThe court reserved judgment and, in the following term (19th Feb., 1907), made an announcement in the following terms:\u2014\n\u201cThe argument in this case at bar raised some important questions as to the power of the provincial legislatures to incorporate companies and as to what, if any, limitations upon that power are contained in the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d in sub-section 11 of section 92 of the British North America Act.\n\u201cIt also raises other questions of public importance as to the effect and meaning of the existing Dominion legislation authorizing licenses to be issued permitting provincial insurance companies to carry on their business throughout Canada.\n\u201cAs these questions involve the powers alike of the Dominion Parliament and provincial legislatures to legislate, we think that the case upon these points should be re-argued and that the Attorney-General of the Dominion and the Attorneys-General of the several provinces should be notified so that such of them as desired might be heard upon the question of the powers of the respective Governments they represent.\n\u201cThe questions to be specially argued are:\n\u201c1st. Is every charter issued by virtue of provincial legislation to be read subject to a constitutional limi- tation that it is prohibited to the company to carry on business beyond the limits of the province within which it is incorporated?\n\u201c2nd. Can an insurance company incorporated by letters patent issued under the authority of a provincial Act carry on extra-provincial or universal insurance business, i.e., make contracts and insure property outside of the province or make contracts within to insure property situate beyond?\n\u201c3rd. Has a province power to prohibit or impose conditions and restrictions upon extra\u2011provincial insurance companies which transact business within its limits?\n\u201c4th. Has Parliament authority to authorize the Governor in Council to permit a company locally incorporated to transact business throughout the Dominion or in foreign countries?\u201d\nPursuant to such direction the case was re-argued in the ensuing May term, counsel appearing as follows:\u2014\nEwart K.C and J.D. Spence for the appellants.\nShepley K.C and F.A. Magee for the respondents,\nNewcombe K.C, Deputy Minister of Justice, for the Dominion of Canada.\nNesbitt K.C., C.H. Ritchie K.C and Mulvey K.C. for the Province of Ontario.\nLanctot K.C., Assistant Attorney-General, and Gervais K.C. for the Province of Quebec.\nJones K.C., Solicitor-General, for the Province of New Brunswick. Nesbitt K.C. for the Province of Manitoba.\nMulvey K.C. for the Province of Saskatchewan.\nBefore any of the counsel were heard, Mr. Justice Girouard stated that as he had not heard the previous argument on the issues between the original parties to the appeal he did not think he should sit unless the whole case was re-opened and the hearing not be confined to the constitutional questions propounded by the court. He was informed by the Chief Justice, that the whole case was open on the present hearing and remained on the bench.\nBy direction of the court the constitutional questions involved in the questions propounded were first argued, counsel for the Dominion of Canada being directed to begin.\nNewcombe K.C. By the construction which the decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have placed on sections 91 and 92 of \u201cThe British North America Act, 1867,\u201d the legislative powers of a province, being restricted to matters of a local and private nature within such province, cannot I submit, extend to legislation the operation of which goes outside of its geographical limits. See Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[9], at pages 359 et seq.; Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[10], at pages 116-7; Dobie v. Temporalities Board[11], at pages 151-2; Colonial Building & Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[12], at page 165. The first question should, therefore, be answered in the affirmative and the second in the negative.\nIn view of the decisions I would answer the third question in the affirmative, subject to the qualification that the conditions and restrictions do not affect the trade or business of such companies beyond the limits of the province which would be an interference with the powers of Parliament to regulate trade and commerce between provinces, or generally throughout Canada. See Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[13].\nThe fourth question should be answered affirmatively.\nC.H. Ritchie K.C. for the Province of Ontario. By section 92 of sub-section 11 of \u201cThe British North America Act, 1867,\u201d the legislature of a province may incorporate companies with \u201cprovincial objects.\u201d The latter words do not constitute a limitation within the geographical area of the province as is contended by counsel for the Dominion and for the appellants, but gives the legislature power to incorporate companies for purposes not assigned to the federal Parliament.\nMoreover the objects of the companies are not, necessarily, to be \u201cprovincial\u201d only. If a company has provincial objects within the scope of its operations this provision of the Act is complied with though other objects may be included. See Bank of Toronto v. St. Lawrence Fire Ins. Co.[14]; Boyle v. Victoria Yukon Trading Co.[15]; Duff v. Canadian Ins. Co.[16] It is submitted, therefore, that the questions pro-pounded should be answered in favour of the power of provincial companies to do business outside the Province in which they are incorporated.\nNesbitt K.C. is heard for the Province of Manitoba.\nMulvey K.C. is heard for the Province of Saskatchewan.\nEwart K.C. is heard for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. for the respondents.\nNewcombe K.C. in reply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Sir Louis Davies. The jurisdiction of the legislature by whose authority the company respondent was brought into existence is limited as to subjects and area. The subjects with respect to which it can legislate are enumerated in section 92 of \u201cThe British North America Act, 1867,\u201d and the area of its legislative jurisdiction is confined to the Province of Ontario. By paragraph 11 of section 92, a provincial legislature is authorized to incorporate companies but not all companies, only those with provincial objects, i.e., such objects as are within the legislative jurisdiction of a province to effect. A company can take no power from the legislature to which it owes its existence which it is not in the power of that legislature to grant. Admittedly the Dominion Parliament has the right to create a corporation to carry on business throughout the Dominion and it appears to me impossible to maintain that a provincial legislature, if it can deal with the incorporation of insurance companies at all, can create a company with powers coextensive with those conferred by the Dominion on a company incorporated for the purpose of carrying on the business of insurance, and this appears to me the necessary logical result of the submission of the provincial Attorneys-General. The Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislature cannot both occupy the same legislative field at the same time.\nMr. Blake, when Minister of Justice, in his report on \u201cThe Act of Incorporation\u201d of the Merchants Marine Insurance Co. said (page 261, Hodgin\u2019s Provincial and Dominion Legislation):\u2014\nBy the second section it is provided that the company shall have power to make with any person or persons contracts of insurance connected with marine risks against loss or damages either by fire or by peril of navigation of or to any vessel, etc., either sea\u2011going or navigating upon the lakes, rivers, or navigable waters. It appears to the undersigned that under the express language of the clause, it is attempted to give the company power to do an insurance business with persons not residents of the province in respect of risks on vessels not touching provincial ports, in a word to do a universal insurance business. The power of provincial legislatures to incorporate insurance companies is to be found, if at all, in the 11th sub-section of the 92nd section of the British North America Act, 1867, which gives to the local legislatures authority to make laws for the incorporation of companies with provincial objects. It appears to the undersigned that the powers attempted to be conferred upon this company are beyond any fair construction of these words, and he recommends that the attention of Prince Edward Island be called to the Act with a view of its amendment by such limitation of the powers of the company as may obviate this objection.\nSubsequently, Sir Oliver Mowat, when Minister of Justice, page 33, Provincial Legislation, 1896-1898, reporting on the status of the Mississquash Marine Company, a company incorporated for the purpose of carrying on certain operations in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and elsewhere, said:\u2014\nThe undersigned construes this authority (that is the incorporation of companies with provincial objects) to mean objects provincial as to the province creating the corporation.\nSir Oliver Mowat, at page 17 of the volume just quoted, said:\u2014.\nThe powers which, in regard to the business of fire and marine insurance, this Act purports to confer upon this company are practically unlimited; and with regard to marine insurance the company is expressly empowered to insure property in any part of the world. The jurisdiction of a provincial legislature to incorporate companies is in the British North America Act expressed to be to incorporate \u201ccompanies\u201d with provincial objects, and this has been construed to mean objects located within the province and to be locally carried on by such companies within the province. In this connection the undersigned begs leave to refer to the remarks of the Honourable Edward Blake upon certain statutes of the Province of Nova Scotia, 38 Victoria, chapters 76, 77, 78 and 79, and upon a statute of the Province of Quebec, intituled \u201cAn Act to incorporate the Atlantic Insurance Company of Montreal,\u201d 38 Vict. ch. 61; also to the observations of the Right Honourable Sir John Thompson upon a statute of the Province of Nova Scotia, intituled \u201cAn Act to incorporate the Fisherman\u2019s Insurance Company of Lunenburg, Limited,\u201d 56 Vict. ch. 167 (approved reports of the Ministers of Justice of 25th October, 1875, 19th September, 1876, and 27th January, 1894, volume of reports upon provincial legislation, 1867-1895, at pages 263, 264, 265, 491 and 635).\nA statute of Nova Scotia incorporating a company for the purpose of running steamers on the coast of the province and elsewhere was disallowed upon the recommendation of the late Mr. Justice Fournier, when Minister of Justice, because there was no limit to the operations of the company within the province, and because of the word \u201celsewhere.\u201d (See his approved report 31st March, 1875, on page 488 of the volume of Dominion and provincial legislation.)\nThe question, however, not being free from doubt, the undersigned is not prepared to recommend the disallowance of the Act now under consideration, but recommends that a copy of this report, if approved, be transmitted to the Lieutenant-Governor of the province.\nA careful examination of the reports made by the Ministers of Justice since Confederation shews that the unanimous opinion held and many times ex- pressed by them was that a provincial legislature has no power to create a company with authority to do business outside of the limits of the incorporating province. I refer to those reports not as authorities binding in any sense on this court but as expressing the opinions of men familiar with the working of our constitution, and more particularly to shew that the attempt made at different times by the provinces to usurp jurisdiction with respect to the incorporation of companies has been resisted by the Dominion authorities, and that there has been no acquiescence in the construction alleged to have been put by the provinces on the words \u201cprovincial objects.\u201d\nDealing with the last question:\u2014\nHas Parliament authority to authorize the Governor in Council to permit a company locally incorporated to transact business throughout the Dominion or in foreign countries?\nIf a company is within the exclusive jurisdiction of a province, then the Dominion Parliament cannot interfere to extend or limit its powers so long as it remains a provincial company. I concede that the Dominion might make the company a Dominion company; but so long as a company is subject to the provincial legislature the Dominion has no authority or power to extend or restrict. The Dominion cannot enlarge the constitution of an Ontario company or limit the powers locally conferred. The same company cannot be subject at the same time to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion and of a provincial legislature with respect to its corporate powers.\nI would allow the appeal.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I agree with the respondent that this is not a case where the great constitutional ques- tions raised by the order for re-hearing can be fairly determined by this court. I do not propose to go over the authorities bearing upon the point which is one more of substantial justice than of procedure; they are all collected by Mr. Shepley K.C. in his factum and his exhaustive re\u2011argument, and it would serve no practical purpose to repeat them here.\nThey satisfy my mind at least that the ultra vires questions cannot be fully considered without proper issues and trial, so as to have definite statements of facts and of law involved in the case, which interest the provincial governments of the Dominion and commercial corporations and the public at large to such an enormous extent that we cannot fully realize the consequences. I quite understand that evidence might be essential with regard to the place of the completion of the policy, whether in Montreal or Ottawa, and also as to the Canadian license which, although not in issue, it is admitted was granted by the Dominion Government, and such other matters as parties might advise.\nI thought first that the record could be remitted to the trial court for the purpose of making amendments, adducing additional evidence and taking such other proceedings as might be necessary to avoid surprise and secure a final adjudication, as was done by the Privy Council in Connolly v. The Consumers Cordage Company and other cases. I am afraid that by so doing we would authorize a fresh and totally different action, and for that reason I believe we have nothing else to do but to dismiss the appeal purely and simply with costs, reserving to the plaintiff such further recourse as he may have in the premises.\nDAVIES. J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent company (defendant) is an Insurance Company incorporated by Letters Patent issued under the provisions of \u201cThe Ontario Insurance Act,\u201d R.S.O. (1897), ch. 203, under which letters patent it is declared to be capable of exercising all the functions of an incorporated company\nfor the transaction of such insurance (fire) as if incorporated by a special Act of the Legislature of Ontario.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company is incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada, and a portion of its line of railway between Montreal and St. John, N.B., passes through the State of Maine.\nThe policy of insurance on which this action was brought purported to have been signed by the president and general manager of the company and to have had its corporate seal affixed at Ottawa, Ontario, and to have been countersigned by Carson Bros., the chief agents of the defendant company at Montreal, in the Province of Quebec.\nThe property or risk insured was stated in the policy to be as follows:\u2014\nOn property as per wording hereto attached Canadian Pacific Railway Company $75,000. On all claims for loss or damage caused by locomotives to property located in the State of Maine not including that of the assured or upon land owned, leased or operated by the assured.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 claim was in the alternative for the recovery of $4,698.94, being the value of certain timber burnt upon lands adjoining the railway by fire caused by locomotive sparks, or in the event of the policy being held invalid as a guarantee policy only and not an insurance policy, a return of all the premiums of insurance they had paid as upon an entire failure of consideration.\nThe defendants contended that the only property in question, the loss of which the plaintiffs had paid for or incurred was standing timber and that their statutory powers of insurance and their policy issued thereunder did not extend to nor cover standing timber and so they were not liable.\nI agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario confirming that of the trial judge that so far as the questions raised before those courts are concerned the action must be dismissed. I do not think it necessary to add any reasons to those given by Mr. Justice Osier speaking for the Court of Appeal on the points there raised.\nOn appeal to this court some quite new and important questions were raised for the first time by the appellants and I confess they have raised doubts and difficulties not by any means easy of solution.\nThe points substantially taken by Mr. Ewart were that this Insurance Company was one incorporated by the Province of Ontario; that there was a constitutional limitation in the British North America Act, 1867, upon the powers of legislation assigned in the 92nd section to the provinces of the Dominion, and that the words of the 11th sub.-sec. of that sec. 92\nthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects,\nmeant a territorial limitation co-extensive with the territory of the province incorporating the company; that this statutory and constitutional limitation confined the powers and operations of the company to insurance on property in Ontario, and that as this policy sued on covered only property located in the State of Maine, United States of America, it was extra vires of the company quite irrespective of the question whether the policy was held to have been executed in Ontario the \u201chome\u201d or habitat of the company, or in Montreal, Province of Quebec, the insur- ance intended to be effected never attached, the policy being void ab initio, and the premiums paid being without any consideration could be recovered back by the railway company. He accompanied his argument with the admission that the insurance company had at the time of its issuance of the policy in question a license from the Dominion Government to carry on the business of fire insurance throughout Canada, but contended that this license and the statute under which it issued in no way validated the policy.\nA question as to the right of the company to raise such a question as this for the first time in this court was raised, but we were of the opinion that as the question was one of law which involved the validity of the contract sued on and sufficiently appeared upon the face of the record and was accompanied by the admission of the Dominion license to carry on its business throughout Canada, so that the defendant could not be prejudiced, the appellant was within his rights, even though the point had not been explicitly argued in the courts below. Devine v. Holloway[17]; McKelvey v. The Le Roi Mining Co.[18]\nWith respect to the legal effect to be given to the Dominion license granted to the defendant insurance company under the Dominion statute, 49 Vict. ch. 45, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting Insurance\u201d as amended by 51 Vict. ch. 28, it is necessary to see just what the Parliament of Canada professed to do. The 3rd section of the \u201cInsurance Act\u201d above referred to, as amended, enacted that its provisions should not apply inter alia:\u2014\n(c) To any company incorporated by an Act of the legislature of the late Province of Canada, or by an Act of the legislature of any province now forming part of Canada, which carries on the business of insurance, wholly within the limits of that province by the legislature of which it was incorporated, and which is within the exclusive control of the legislature of such province; but any such company may, by leave of the Governor in Council, on complying with the provisions of this Act, avail itself of the provisions of this Act, and if it so avails itself, the provisions of this Act shall thereafter apply to it, and such company shall have the power of transacting its business of insurance throughout Canada.\nThe questions to be determined by us therefore are, first, what, if any, are the constitutional limitations upon the powers of the Provincial Legislatures to incorporate companies? And next, are these limitations, if territorial or provincial, removed in the cases of companies so incorporated, which have obtained licenses to carry on business throughout Canada under the Dominion Statute, so as to enable them to carry on such business throughout Canada? And thirdly, if so, can a provincial company, acting under its provincial charter and its Dominion license, carry on business in foreign countries by or under the comity of nations, in the same way and to the same extent as a company incorporated without limitations as to area?\nAt the conclusion of the argument, it being apparent that important constitutional points were involved, and would probably have to be determined in order to reach a decision upon the questions raised, the court ordered that a re-argument should be had, and that the Attorney\u2011General of the Dominion and the Attorneys-General of the several provinces should be notified of such re-argument, and invited to discuss the questions following, should they desire to be heard upon them:\u2014\n1. Is every charter issued by virtue of provincial legislation to be read subject to a constitutional limitation that it is prohibited to the company to carry on business beyond the limits of the province within which it is incorporated?\n2. Can an insurance company incorporated by letters patent issued under the authority of a provincial Act, carry on extra-provincial or universal insurance business, i.e., make contracts and insure property outside of the province or make contracts within to insure property situate beyond?\n3. Has a province power to prohibit or impose conditions and restrictions upon extra\u2011provincial insurance companies which transact business within its limits?\nThe Attorney-General of the Dominion as well as counsel representing the Attorneys-General of most of the provinces, appeared and argued these questions exhaustively. Counsel for the several parties to the cause were also again heard.\nThe distribution of legislative powers between the Dominion Parliament on the one hand and the Provincial Legislatures on the other by \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d is referred to in the judgment of the Privy Council in Citizens Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[19], at page 116, as follows:\u2014\nIn the first place it is not necessary to rest the authority of the Dominion Parliament to incorporate companies on this specific and enumerated power (Trade and Commerce in section 91). The authority would belong to it by its general power over all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, and the only subject on this head assigned to the provincial legislature being the \u201cincorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d it follows that the incorporation of companies for objects other than provincial falls within the general powers of the Parliament of Canada. But it by no means follows * * * that because the Dominion Parliament has alone the right to create a corporation to carry on business throughout the Dominion, that it alone has the right to regulate its contracts in each of the provinces.\nIn the subsequent case of Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[20], their Lordships referring to the case of Citi- zens Insurance Company v. Parsons19, at page 165 say:\u2014\nTheir Lordships adhere to the view then entertained by them as to the respective powers of the Dominion and provincial legislatures in regard to the incorporation of companies.\nNow in what sense did their Lordships use the word \u201cprovincial\u201d in the above extract I have made from their judgment? Did they use it in a territorial sense as embracing the area of the province, or did they use it in a legislative sense as embracing the \u201csubject matters\u201d assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures, irrespective of territorial area? Or did they use it in the double sense of being alike a territorial and a legislative limitation? Reading their judgment as a whole carefully, I should have little hesitation in concluding that they intended to use the word \u201cprovincial\u201d in a territorial sense and as opposed to Dominion in the same sense. If, however, it is held that notwithstanding the observations quoted from the judgment of the Judicial Committee the question of the true meaning of the limitation embodied in the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is still open, my opinion would be that the only reasonable meaning to give to them is a territorial limitation.\nThe constitutional Act itself in which the words are used, which creates a Dominion out of a union of many scattered provinces and divides or apportions complete legislative power between that Dominion and the several provinces, and the section where the words are found specifically assigning to the provinces the subject matters on which they can exclusively legislate, and defining those subject matters, leaving the residuum of legislative power not so assigned with the Dominion, the fact that the phrase used by way of limitation \u201cprovincial objects\u201d was used in the assignment of subject matters to the provinces, to distinguish it from Dominion objects which latter were embodied in the phrase \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d of Canada, generally, combine with the plain natural meaning of the words to convince me that the Imperial Parliament intended to assign to the provincial government the exclusive right to incorporate companies to carry on or out, business or objects within the province only, and no others. The addition of the word \u201conly\u201d or the words \u201cno others\u201d would not, it seems to me, alter or change the nature or extent of the limitation. The power is an exclusive one. The limitation is as to area. It must be provincial as distinguished from Dominion or general, and as the residue of legislative power is given to the Dominion, and this power to legislate for provincial objects is exclusive, it seems to follow that it must mean for provincial objects only, or for provincial objects and no others. This view is much strengthened by a critical examination of the 16th sub-section of section 92 assigning legislative powers to the provinces. These several subject matters are either so clearly provincial as not to require additional words of limitation, or in those cases where not so clearly provincial, have the necessary words of limitation \u201cwithin the province\u201d or \u201cin the province\u201d attached to them. The one case before us, sub-sec. 11, was of a class in which these words of limitation used in the other sub sections would not suffice. The incorporation of companies \u201cwithin\u201d or \u201cin the province\u201d would not have made the limitation sufficiently clear. They would leave the meaning ambiguous and doubtful, and so the draftsman properly introduced other and more definite words, \u201ccompanies for provincial objects,\u201d not companies for provincial subjects which would be meaningless, or companies on subjects within its legislative jurisdiction, which was not intended, but companies for provincial objects only, as I construe it. If the limitation has not a territorial meaning what does it mean? Two suggestions were made, one that it was merely surplusage and meant substantially nothing. The other that it meant provincial subject matters or matters which have been exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures as their own, within and over which they alone could legislate, and that this limitation of provincial subject matters had nothing to do with territorial area.\nNow the first thing which strikes one with reference to this suggestion is that if the framers and draftsmen of the Act had any such intention as is ascribed to them, they would have used apt language to express it.\nAlike in section 91 as in section 92, the phrase \u201cclasses of subjects\u201d is used several times over. If it was intended that the incorporation of companies should be limited to the \u201cclasses of subjects\u201d assigned to the provinces one would have imagined that so favourite a phrase would have been repeated and all doubt set at rest.\nMr. Nesbitt in supporting the substitution of the phrases, provincial subjects or subjects over which the province had legislative jurisdiction, for \u201cprovincial objects\u201d invoked the specific power given in the 15th sub-section of section 91 to the Dominion Parliament to incorporate banks, as authority in support of the argument that by assigning to the Dominion Par- liament the power to incorporate banks under sub-section 15 of section 91, but not any other kind of company or corporation, it must be assumed that it was intended to give the provincial legislatures the power to incorporate all other companies under the 13th sub-section of section 92 \u201cProperty and civil rights in the province,\u201d leaving to the Dominion the power to incorporate companies under the peace, order and good government clause of section 91 alone.\nBut the obvious reason why the incorporation of banks was assigned to the Dominion and not left with the provinces was that the whole subject of banking and its adjuncts was being assigned to the Dominion, and if the provinces were allowed to incorporate provincial banks with the right properly and necessarily belonging to a bank the whole subject of banking would have been left in inextricable confusion. And so far from having a national banking system to-day of which we are justly proud, we would have a series of systems some conservative and others more in accordance with what western ideas are popularly supposed to advocate. So far from affording weight to the argument for the most extended provincial jurisdiction, I am inclined to think that the assignment to the Dominion of the power to incorporate all banks, Dominion as well as provincial in their object or character, is evidence that with regard to all other provincial companies or companies limited in the object or business to the province, the jurisdiction of the province is exclusive. And so with respect to the very next subject of savings banks, the exclusive power to incorporate provincial saving banks remains intact with the provinces, while the general jurisdiction over saving banks remains with the Dominion. Then again this object-subject theory so strenuously pressed by Mr. Nesbitt, is open to the serious objection that it would, if adopted, open the sluice gates to doubt and confusion.\nIf the dividing line between the two legislative jurisdictions was well marked so that, as Mr. Ewart put it in his argument, the subject matter of legislation could in each case, as it arose, be assigned to one or the other, the difficulties would not be so great. We know, however, that this is not so, that the jurisdiction of Parliament trenches upon that of the provinces and vice vers\u00e2, so that we have what counsel aptly called a checker-board constitution.\nA subject matter that in some aspects and for some purposes comes under Dominion legislation, in other aspects and for other purposes comes under provincial. I need not elaborate the point. I think the contention called the object-subject theory, if adopted, calculated to introduce endless trouble and confusion.\nThe powers granted the Dominion and the provinces are frequently found to interweave and overlap and one need only read the carefully considered and acute analysis of the two sections 91 and 92 of \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d to be found in the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Watson in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney\u2011General for the Dominion[21], to satisfy himself how uncertain and unstable would be the results if this object-subject theory was adopted.\nMr. Nesbitt argued that inasmuch as the older provinces before joining in Confederation had an absolute unlimited right to create an artificial person or corporation, so after Confederation these rights remained intact except upon such subject matters as were expressly assigned to the Dominion Parliament. And as the only subject matter relating to the incorporation of companies expressly assigned to the Dominion was that of banks, and the special classes of works and undertakings connecting one province with another or with a foreign country or extending beyond the limits of a province or declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or two or more provinces as specified in the exceptions to sub-section 10 of section 92, the field was left clear for provincial legislation to take possession of.\nWith the subject of banks I have already dealt, and I was quite unable to follow Mr. Nesbitt in his argument arising out of the place in the Act where these exceptions to sub-section 10 of section 92 are found. I think the true answer was given to his argument on this point by Mr. Ewart who called our attention to the fact that these three exceptions attached to sub\u2011section 10 of section 92 were placed in the \u201cQuebec Resolutions,\u201d if we might look at them in construing the Act, amongst the subject matters specifically assigned to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and that their transfer from their original place in these resolutions to their present place as exceptions to sub-section 10 of section 92 by no means altered their character or meaning. It was really a bit of inartistic drafting made doubtless with the object of removing doubts as to whether a work or undertaking lying beyond a province or, if wholly situate within a province were declared by the Parliament of Canada at any time to be for the general advantage of Canada, might not be contended nevertheless to be or continue to be a provincial work. With regard to the questions as to the place where this contract of insurance was made, whether in the Province of Quebec or in the Province of Ontario, I do not think it of any importance on the questions before us, if the view I have already presented of the meaning of the limitation contained in the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is correct. If the defendant company had no power at all to enter into an insurance contract with respect to property in the State of Maine, it matters little whether their contract was made in Ontario or Quebec.\nI understood it to be conceded at the argument that it made no difference whatever whether the limitation upon the powers of the company was contained in the charter of the company or in the constitution or powers of legislation of the legislature granting the charter. And of course that is obviously so. Once the position is reached that the limitation contained in the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is geographical or territorial, then it must be given effect to just the same if contained in the constitution of the province which grants the charter as if expressly incorporated in the charter itself. That being so, I take it that it is not open to argument since the decision by the House of Lords in the case of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[22], that a company incorporated by special Act of Parliament or under a \u201cGeneral Companies Act,\u201d is not thereby created a corporation with inherent common law rights, but is controlled and limited by and within the express powers granted and those necessary and incidental powers which flow from them, and that a contract made by such a company upon a matter not within its powers is not binding upon the company nor can it be rendered so binding, though afterwards expressly assented to at a general meeting of shareholders. The question is not one as to the legality of the contract but as to the power and competency of the company to make it. As Mr. Justice Blackburn said in the judgment there appealed from, quoted with approval by Lord Chancellor Cairns, and which saying Lord Cairns observed \u201csums up and exhausts the whole case\u201d:\u2014\nI do not entertain any doubt that if upon the true construction of a statute creating a corporation it appears to me to be the intention of the legislature expressed or implied that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every court, whether of law or equity is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal and therefore wholly void, and to hold that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified.\nAnd Lord Selborne in his speech says:\u2014\nI only repeat what Lord Cransworth, in Hawkes v. Eastern Counties Railway Company[23], (when moving the judgment of this House) stated to be settled law, when I say that a statutory corporation, created by Act of Parliament for a particular purpose, is limited, as to all its powers, by the purposes of its incorporation as defined in that Act. The present and all other companies incorporated by virtue of the \u201cCompanies Act of 1862,\u201d appears to me to be statutory corporations within this principle.\nAnd again at page 694:\u2014\nI think that contracts for objects and purposes foreign to, or inconsistent with, the memorandum of association, are ultra vires of the corporation itself. And it seems to me far more accurate to say that the inability of such companies to make such contracts rests on an original limitation and circumscription of their powers by the law, and for the purposes of their incorporation, than that it depends upon some express or implied prohibition, making acts unlawful which otherwise they would have had a legal capacity to do.\nIf therefore my conclusion as to the meaning of the limitation \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is correct, if the legislature of Ontario could only incorporate companies to do insurance business within the province, it seems to me to follow as a consequence that any contract made by them insuring property out of the province was wholly void, and that neither the place where the contract was made nor the ratification of the shareholders, had such been given, nor any comity or consent or license given by any foreign state or province could inject vitality into that which in its substance and essence was void and dead.\nA great deal was said about the comity of nations and the right of a company to do business in a foreign state by virtue of that comity. But it does not to me seem arguable that any comity of nations could enlarge the powers of a limited corporation or enable such corporation to do that abroad which would be illegal and ultra vires if done at home, or extend the area within which even unlimited powers were to be exercised.\nThe true rule with respect to a company created by the legislature of one country attempting to carry on the business for which its charter created it in another country is that while acting within the scope of its statutory powers it may by the permission or comity of the state where it attempts to do business legally carry on such business. Its right to do so does not depend upon the law of the state creating the corporation, but on the extent to which the foreign country chooses to recognize the law creating the corporation. (See Lindley\u2019s Law of Companies, (6 ed.) Appendix No. 1, page 1222).\nBut I take it no permission or comity of any foreign state would enable a corporation specifically limited in its powers either with regard to the nature or class of business it may carry on or otherwise, to carry on business or enter into contracts which were either expressly prohibited or by implication necessarily prohibited by its charter. Such increase of power would require legislative authority, and practically amount to the creation of a new charter. Mere permission or comity certainly could not suffice to invest the company with powers beyond those of its charter.\nIt by no means follows from this, however, that everything the company does beyond the area of the province within which it is limited to do business, in furtherance of or ancillary or incidental to its main objects or purposes, is necessarily ultra vires. On the contrary applying the principles frequently stated by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to the question, it would seem to me that while the objects and purposes of the company must be confined to the province, things might be legally done outside of the province strictly in furtherance of those Objects. For instance, a company chartered for the manufacture of any article, cotton, tobacco, woollen goods, iron, steel, etc., might well, in order to carry out the very purpose for which it was chartered, purchase outside of the province in England or elsewhere, the machinery necessary to enable it so to manufacture, and it may be, though it is not necessary for me to express an opinion on the point, that for the same purpose it might be alike necessary and legal for it to purchase abroad its raw material required to manufacture the articles for which it was incorporated. I put it upon the principle that everything necessary to enable a company to carry out properly and efficiently the purposes for which it was incorporated is impliedly granted to them, and that if it is necessary for a provincial company in order fully and effectively to carry out the object and purposes for which it was incorporated, to purchase abroad the machinery or other articles necessary to enable it to manufacture, including in such the raw material, it could legally do so. But I squarely challenge the proposition that a provincial manufacturing or trading or insurance company has the world for its market or business or that it can carry on its business at all beyond the province excepting to the extent and for the legitimate purpose of enabling it efficiently to carry out the functional purposes of its incorporation within the province by which it was incorporated.\nA good deal was said at the bar as to the general practice which has prevailed since Confederation and the general construction put upon the statute by provincial authorities, and acted upon by the commercial and financial communities in taking out provincial charters, and the evils which may follow if it was to be held that these provincial charters limited the companies chartered by them in the exercise of their functional powers to the areas of the province. From much of what was said I dissent. My experience in the House of Commons for many years led me to form quite other impressions as to what the general belief and practice was, and I am confirmed in these impressions by the continuous and practically unbroken series of opinions officially expressed by a long line of Ministers of Justice when reporting year by year upon the legislation of the several provinces. The plain, obvious and simple course, if I am right in my construction of the Act, is for a corporation desirous of carrying on its business outside of the province and throughout the Dominion and elsewhere, to obtain its charter from the Dominion. There remains yet to be considered the effect of the license obtained by the defendant company under the Dominion Statute, 51 Vict. ch. 28, which authorizes provincial companies by leave of the Governor in Council and on complying with certain provisions of the Act\nto have the power of transacting its business throughout Canada.\nSo far as the Dominion is concerned it must be considered in some respects at least, with respect to the provinces, as a foreign state. I am quite unable to understand where the Dominion Parliament obtains its power to add to, or supplement, or take from the powers granted to any company incorporated by any province. Such legislation is practically either an amendment of the charter of the provincial company extending its powers far beyond those given to it by the province, or a legislative declaration of the extent to which it desires to extend what is known as the comity of nations. I cannot see how, or by what authority, the Dominion Parliament could alter, extend or abridge a provincial company\u2019s charter. \u201cThe Imperial Act\u201d divides legislative power between the Parliament of the Dominion and the legislatures of the provinces. Whatever powers the latter have are exclusive. The Dominion Parliament cannot amend that Imperial statute, and without amending it I cannot see how they can add to the powers or objects of a provincial company which have been defined and circumscribed by the Imperial statute. It seems to me that only by the creation of a new entity or corporation could the object sought for be achieved. Comity cannot extend the circumscribed powers of an incorporated company, nor can a foreign legislature by any legislation or system of licensing enlarge such powers or make that legal which the charter did not warrant or authorize. It would not be argued that assuming the powers of this company to be confined to the Province of Ontario that the State of Maine could by any possible legislation enlarge those powers short of creating a new company. Nor can I see how the Dominion Parliament has any other or greater power to enlarge a provincial company\u2019s charter than one of the States of the United States would have.\nLastly, it was submitted by Mr. Shepley with great force that it was not open to the plaintiff company to recover back the premiums it had paid, on the ground that the policy was void, because outside of the contention that the point was not now open to them with which I have previously dealt, the contract was one already completed and performed at the time the action was brought and so the case was brought within the principle of the decision of Lowry v. Bourdieu[24] that it was not open to an insured party \u201cafter the risk had been completely run\u201d to use the words of Mr. Justice Buller, to recover back premiums paid on the ground that the policy was void. It does not seem to me that this case comes within that principle. This was a continuing policy on certain property in the State of Maine renewed from time to time, and at the time the action was brought the risk was not completely run, but was then actually running. So far from the event or contingency having happened, which would, if the policy insured upon had been a valid one, have created a liability, the contention of the defendants, and on which they succeeded in the court below, was not that the risk had never attached, or that the risk had once attached and had at the time of the loss ceased to do so, but that while the risk or contingency insured against was a continuous one at the time of the alleged loss it did not attach to the particular kind of property lost. In other words, that the contract was an executory not an executed one, but the special event or risk insured against had not occurred. Under no circumstances can I understand how the contract could be said to be an executed contract so far as the year or period is concerned when the fire took place and which period was covered by the premium paid. In my opinion the rule appealed to in order to prevent the plaintiff recovering back the premiums paid cannot be held to apply. On the assumption that I am correct in my holding that there never was any binding contract between the parties,, that the contract entered into was ultra vires, then under those assumptions there never was anything done by the insurance company or any liability incurred by them under it, and the event contemplated on which the moneys insured might become payable, never did happen and never could happen. Hermann v. Charlesworth[25].\nThis case stands just as if the plaintiff company had not sued to recover for a loss upon the property at all, but had sued alone on the alternative claim made by it for the recovery back of the premiums while the policy, if it had been good, was actually running.\nThe appeal, therefore should be allowed and judgment entered for the plaintiff on its alternative claim for the premiums paid on the policy. IDINGTON J.\u2014I accept the reasoning of Mr. Justice Osier on all the questions argued herein, in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Nothing need be added thereto. However, for the first time in the case, counsel for appellants formulated and claimed the benefit of, the proposition of law, that no insurance company, only incorporated, as this one, by virtue of provincial legislative authority can insure against risks beyond, or enter into a contract therefor beyond the limits of the province incorporating it. I fear we erred in allowing this ground to be argued on such pleadings as appear, but in view of all the circumstances, including our direction for a re-argument, I reluctantly conclude the effect thereof to be as if we had under section 54 of \u201cThe Supreme Court Act\u201d given leave to amend.\nAs to this new ground, I assume the contract to have been entered into by the insurance company at Ottawa, where the insurance company had its head office, and its chief officers, and where its seal was kept, and affixed to the contract, which was also signed there by these executive officers.\nEven if the counter-signing in Quebec were void, which I do not think, that would not so impair the contract as to render it a nullity and thereby entitle appellants to claim as here a return of the premiums. If insured and insurer had both been domiciled in the same province, the question raised, would not, I think, have been open to appellants. But the head-office of the insured being here in one province, whilst the contract was executed in another province, entitles the appellants to have the broader question raised squarely decided, if considered at all.\nI therefore deal with the issues thus raised in their widest sense. As such, they turn upon the interpretation of \u201cThe British North America Act.\u201d I do not think we must, in disposing of them, look only at sub-section 11 of section 92 thereof, and try to determine the exact grammatical meaning of the words thereof which are as follows:\u2014\u201c11. The incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d\nIt is conceded on all hands that this phrase was not intended to apply to, or have any relation to the executive powers of the government, or of the institutions relative to the carrying on of the government of the province, as distinct from the usual commercial or industrial business of the inhabitants of the province.\nYet what can the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d in their strict grammatical sense, mean, if not of that first class? Coupled with the word \u201ccompanies\u201d they can, as is properly conceded, mean nothing of the kind.\nIt is thus shewn to be an ambiguous phrase, that cannot be properly construed here, by what is the strictly grammatical rule of construction.\nWe are driven by that to look at the whole purview of the Act. We are, in order to properly comprehend that, again driven to resort to the history that preceded this legislation, in order that we may be placed just where we can, as nearly as possible, look at it from the like point of view that its framers had to consider it from.\nMoreover, we must never forget what kind of instrument this is which we are called upon to interpret.\nIn trying to do so, I would like ever to abide by the following language, attributed to Vattel, as quoted with approval by the late Chief Justice Spragge in the case of The Queen v. Hodge[26], at page 253, as follows:\u2014\nHe says, Book 2, ch. 17, secs. 285, 6: The most important rule in cases of this nature, is that a constitution of government does not and cannot, from its nature, depend in any great degree upon verbal criticism, or upon the import of single words. Such criticism may not be wholly without use; it may sometimes illustrate or unfold the appropriate sense; but unless it stand well with the context and subject matters it must yield to the latter. While then we may well resort to the meaning of single words to assist our inquiries, we should never forget that it is an instrument of government we are to construe; and as has been already stated, that must be the truest exposition which best harmonizes with its designs, its objects, and its general structure.\nThe present Province of Ontario, when named Upper Canada, had by virtue of the simple words \u201cpeace, welfare and good government\u201d from 1792 to 1840 the power to incorporate for any purpose that any of its citizens might desire to venture upon.\nThat power was, from the year 1840 to the coming into effect in 1867, of the Act now under consideration, merged in the united power of Upper and Lower Canada, but existent in the joint legislature of these provinces, under and by virtue of the same comprehensive words \u201cpeace, welfare and good government.\u201d\nA similar history was true of the powers of the Province of Quebec in that regard. I need not dwell on details. I need not enlarge as to the Maritime Provinces respecting which the details differ from those.\nConfederation was begotten of the intense desire, perhaps need, of Upper and Lower Canada, for provincial autonomy.\nUnder such conditions it is hardly likely, that representatives of either intended lightly to surrender the right to incorporate any of their citizens, for any purpose that incorporation might serve.\nWhat reason is there to suppose it was intended to exclude from any legislative treatment by a provincial legislature of any of the subject matters assigned to the provinces, the right to use in such treatment the power or any part of the power of incorporation so far as hitherto enjoyed and so far as the exercise of that power might by any of the provinces be deemed expedient?\nThis contention, if it means anything, means that the provincial corporate bodies cannot, if of farmers, carry their crops across a line to market them; or if of merchants, step across the line to buy; or if of miners, import their machinery; or export their ores, for refining them; or if of manufacturers, send abroad their agents to buy, any of the raw materials they need; and that if they or any of them venture in any such case to do so, their securities as creditors or debtors would be worthless.\nI cannot believe that such paralysing isolation was ever dreamt of by those who framed this Act.\nNor can I conceive that they intended, as within the scope and purpose of such a decentralizing scheme, of the functions of government, as this federal conception implies, that each and all of those possible corporate bodies I have mentioned, and all others of a like kind, should seek for their authority something emanating from the Dominion Parliament, to give them that capacity and efficiency the like bodies had before then enjoyed. Moreover, how can anything to recreate or to help them emanate from that Parliament when the whole subject matter is by being exclusively assigned elsewhere excluded from the jurisdiction of the Dominion? To those who reply \u201cit matters not what was intended or may reasonably be supposed to have been intended it is not expressed\u201d I venture to say it is clearly expressed. It is only, I respectfully submit, by trying to extract, from an ambiguous phrase, something even it won\u2019t bear, and discarding all else in the Act that this clear expression is missed.\nBlot sub-section 11, I have quoted, out of section 92, is the language that remains not quite as comprehensive as and effective for conferring the power of incorporation in relation to anything pertaining to any of the several subject matters exclusively assigned to the provinces and in regard to which such a power might be appropriately and serviceably exercised, as had been the simple words \u201cpeace, welfare and good government\u201d that had hitherto alone endowed the respective legislatures therewith in regard to the more numerous subject matters?\nWe have this exemplified in many ways in the Act. Sub-section 8 of section 92 merely reads \u201cmunicipal institutions in the province.\u201d\nWe do not find anything in the Act referring to the incorporation of any such institutions.\nSub-section 11 only relates to \u201ccompanies\u201d and obviously has no relation to municipal corporations.\nIt may be said that of necessity municipal institutions must be corporations. I answer, not at all municipal institutions might be conducted by a province, or by means devised by a province, other than by means of a corporation. Indeed their management by commissioners is now advocated in many quarters. Ontario boards of health are possessed of wide municipal powers yet once were not and, possibly, still are not corporations. But if it be that the nature of the subject matter thus assigned implies the power of incorporation, I say then that illustrates and emphasizes my argument. For if the assignment of property and civil rights is to be the basis of the measure of the power there surely then must be an end to the contention.\nAgain, section 98 gives, save in one thing, exclusive control of education to the provinces by using language quite as remote from touching upon the power to incorporate as can well be. Yet does anyone for a moment suppose that the common every day creations by provincial legislative authority of corporations, to carry out the \u201claws in relation to education,\u201d are unauthorized? If either municipal or school corporations, directly authorized, as they respectively are, by the Ontario Legislature, to buy supplies (without any direction where) claim by virtue thereof to cross a street, a river, or a line, into a foreign State to contract respectively for these big and little things, can we deny them the right to do so? Why? What foundation can there be for distinguishing any of them from other corporations in regard to the right to buy where they choose?\nWhy should these corporations be discriminated against? Why should they be restricted in the marketing of their securities for borrowed money or buying supplies?\nAgain, hospitals, asylums, charities and eleemosynary institutions in and for the province, other than marine hospitals, are assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. Nothing is said of their incorporation.\nYet knowing how many of them stood in need of and got incorporation before, are we to suppose that mode of dealing ceased at Confederation? Were such corporations, if created at all, thereafter to be crip- ples? Why should these incorporated institutions not get supplies abroad? Were any of these corporations intended to be confined for the supply of their respective needs within the limits of a province? They or some of them daily go beyond the province of their domicile for some such purpose. Have they erred in law? Are they liable when so persistently offending to have their charter attacked for violating the law of their being? Must they limp along with their usefulness impaired? Or must they become re-incorporated by the Dominion. And how can that be done for they and all concerning them are exclusively assigned to the legislative authority of the province?\nSub-section 11, I repeat, has nothing to do with municipal or public school or public charitable corporations; neither endows nor restricts them.\nIf by virtue only of these several texts relating respectively to each of these subjects, this right of contracting abroad must be conceded to each of such corporations, what of the corporation that the business men require?\nIs it not part and parcel of the ordinary civil rights of men to form such alliances? Could incorporating power necessary therefor springing from the exclusive control \u201cof property and civil rights in the province\u201d not have been exercised, if sub-section 11 of section 92 had never existed?\nBlot all direct references to incorporating powers out of the Act and what would be the proper interpretation of it in this regard?\nCan any one deny that it would when bereft of any such express authority, still carry in it ample power and authority to incorporate? Can anyone suppose that where authority over a subject matter was exclusively assigned to one or other legislative author- ity, that the plenary corporating power in relation to everything within that subject matter, did not inherently exist also there? Without a word expressing it? Without a word restricting it? It is or would be clearly implied. It is part and parcel of the power granted by exclusive authority.\nThe constitution of the United States of America never gave the Federal Government express authority to incorporate or any wider power than the words \u201cexclusive authority over\u201d * * * \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province\u201d import. Yet the corporations created by that power have developed extensively. The language of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of McCulloch v. State of Maryland[27], is so apposite thereto and to what we have in hand that I cannot forbear quoting it:\u2014\nThe creation of a corporation, it is said, appertains to sovereignty. This is admitted. But to what portion of sovereignty does it appertain? Does it belong to one more than to another? In America the powers of sovereignty are divided between the government of the Union and those of the States. They are each sovereign with respect to the objects committed to it, and neither sovereign with respect to the objects committed to the other. * * * * The power of creating a corporation, though appertaining to sovereignty, is not like the power of making war, or levying taxes, or of regulating commerce, a great substantive and independent power, which cannot be implied as incidental to other powers, or used as a means of executing them. It is never the end for which other powers are exercised, but means by which their objects are accomplished. No contributions are made to charity for the sake of an incorporation, but a corporation is created to administer the charity; no seminary of learning is instituted in order to be incorporated, but the corporate character is conferred to subserve the purposes of education. No city was ever built with the sole object of being incorporated but is incorporated as affording the best means of being well governed. The power of creating a corporation is never used for its own sake, but for the purpose of effecting something else. No sufficient reason is therefore perceived why it may not pass as incidental to those powers which are expressly given, if it be a direct mode of executing them. The range of authority of a provincial legislature was said in the case of Hodge v. The Queen[28], at page 132, to be within the limits prescribed by the statute which created it\nan authority as plenary and as ample * * * as the Imperial Parliament in the plentitude of its power possessed and could bestow.\nThis language is quoted with approval in the recent case of The Attorney-General of Canada v. Cain[29], at page 547.\nThis striking language uttered in 1883 and reiterated in 1906 seems to apply to such cases of trading corporations as must be admitted to fall within the lines of the subject matters assigned exclusively to the provinces.\nCan effect be given to such language by the creation of a lot of low grade corporations? Is not the very idea that such limited creations were intended, repugnant to this language and the principle it enunciates?\nIf the Act, without sub-section 11, would have carried with each of the other sub-sections of section 92, where and when needed the power of incorporating, if and so far as corporations might serve any purpose in relation thereto, is there anything in sub-section 11 to restrict that power in the manner now claimed?\nI have shewn that the phrase \u201cprovincial objects\u201d cannot relate to, or be confined within what its strict literal meaning might require.\nIt seems difficult and I would have said impossible, but for the contention here set up and heed given to it, to extract from such a phrase any restric- tive meaning save that involved in distinguishing the subjects exclusively assigned to the provinces, from those assigned to the Dominion as the line of incorporating power given. That restriction may reasonably be found in the phrase. It may even have been one of the purposes of using it, to save possibility of conflict with or embarrassment, in that regard, in the Dominion\u2019s exercise of the power of incorporating.\nIn view of the civil rights and property (which are the essential elements to be controlled in creating any company) within the provinces being exclusively assigned to the provinces it might have been but for sub-section 11 said that the Dominion had to look to the provinces for incorporating power to subserve its exercise of its powers.\nThe exclusive legislative control over property and civil rights in the province is of such a sweeping and comprehensive character that even the final part of section 91 might not have sufficed for its restrictive purpose unless the corporating power of section 92 were thus restricted by something to indicate that when the province undertook to incorporate it should keep to that field that was provincial in its character.\nBut how does that affect the question of the quality of power inherent in a corporation? Sub\u2011section 11 clearly was pointed at something in the nature of a partition of the sovereign legislative powers between the Dominion and the provinces.\nBut how could that help in regard to a power that neither of them possessed, neither of them could acquire, neither of them modify, but which either of them might without consulting the other exclude from their corporate creatures the right to exercise? I refer to the power to enjoy rights given by virtue of the comity of nations which I refer to hereafter. Such restriction as I have indicated of subject matter is, however, an entirely different thing from a restriction upon the kind of incorporating power that is assigned to the province to give. Why should the provinces be restrained thus in regard to trading corporations needing the use of such power, and in dealing with others of the subject matters assigned to it be not restricted though less urgently needing the power? The phrase is presented by the argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel as restricting all provincial corporations to acts within the province. It is said, if I understand the argument, because a province implies a certain territorial area, therefore its objects must be confined within that area, therefore the concerns of any of its people when they become incorporated as a company must not relate to anything of a mercantile or contractual nature that can by any possibility extend beyond the confines of the province. The province has to go abroad to borrow. It may so contract. But none of its creatures dare venture to do so. Its corporate creatures must be of a kind rarely met in the business world, and of little use therein, to their corporators or to anybody else. And no one discovered that restrictive meaning hidden in these words until forty years after their adoption and first use, when the hard necessities of this appeal has arisen. And to be consistent, saving banks, marine hospitals and other corporations for subject matters exclusively assigned to the Dominion, save banks, etc., in sub-section 15 of section 91, may, it is argued, if confined within a province be incorporated by it. I cannot assent to these propositions. To state them is to refute them.\nMuch as sub-section 11 of section 92 has been dwelt upon in argument, I have come to the conclu- sion that it is for present purposes after all, if not the least, at all events, not the most important part, of the two sections calling for consideration in the adjudication of this case. The substance of what gives vitality to the incorporating power in question must be sought elsewhere in section 92 and this subsection 11 is but the confirmation thereof, and an index finger that points the way where we can find the limits of that power.\nSome of the other sub-sections might without subsection 11 confer the incorporating power, but subsection 11 alone would be hopelessly ineffective in a statute that did not otherwise assign exclusive powers of legislation to a province.\nThe phrase \u201cprovincial objects\u201d as an apt substitute for the old one of \u201cpeace, welfare and good government,\u201d may, I submit, comprehend the well being of each inhabitant of the province; the promotion of the business prosperity of the inhabitants, or of any number or class of such inhabitants, as a means to the end of that well being; the incorporation of any two or more of such inhabitants, to carry on business, and thus become conducive to the successful development of such desired business prosperity, and hence also, the business of fire insurance. How does all that, however, confer the power on a provincial corporation of contracting abroad? It does not. It merely shews that there are things within the scope of the phrase in one of its natural meanings that so far from restricting the corporate power in the way contended for, demand, if possible, its widest operation. If there is no restriction by virtue of this phrase, there is no doubt of the right of a provincial corporation to contract abroad.\nWhat, happens, once the corporation is thus created, is, that other provinces and foreign states either by the comity of nations, or perchance, in case of treaty, by force thereof, recognize the existence of such a corporate body as a legal entity, doing the like kind of business for the carrying on of which it was created.\nIts contracts are thus recognized, when made beyond, or in relation to property beyond, the bounds of its parent province. It may plead and be impleaded beyond such bounds, as effectually as in its home.\nIt may, however, by the laws of the foreign province, or state, where it attempts to carry on business, be prohibited in whole, or in part, or conditionally.\nThe organic law which brings it into being, may also prohibit it from contracting abroad, or impose any limits desired; restricting its power of contracting abroad.\nSuch limits of a restrictive nature imposed by the parent province or state must be observed. That province or state may, in this regard, disable, but cannot enable. Its express enactment, to enable its corporate creation to carry on business abroad, would be futile.\nOnce incorporation, for some specific purpose, within the field or sphere of subjects assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of a province, has been effected, the comity of nations may and generally does all that is required, beyond the province.\nThis doctrine of the comity of nations, carrying with it, subject to those limitations I have mentioned, this recognition of a foreign corporation, is as firmly embedded in, and an ever growing part of, international law as anything can well be.\nShort of treaties, securing a more definite basis, these legal entities, of the greatest nation, and the humblest province, stand on the same level, and receive but the same sort of recognition from a foreign state.\nThis comity is but an extension of the earlier recognition of the individual foreigner.\nThe corporation is but a combination of individuals.\nThe recognition abroad of either the individual or the corporation, is begotten of the needs of civilized men. The alien individual or corporation formerly had no rights abroad.\nThe lines upon which recognition now proceeds, doubtless differentiate in the details, applicable to individuals and corporations respectively. Yet, we must never forget, in trying to ascertain the law, in relation to the rights either may have, springing out of what is contracted for, or suffered abroad, and the remedies properly applicable for enforcing such rights that this recognition is subject to many and varying limitations, which have arisen from the needs I have referred to; and grown with the growth thereof.\nThe lines within which it had, in 1867 or has since become operative, may not be so apparent, as to be easy of definition in every case that arises, and the policy of some states may be backward in that regard. The United States are not. The United Kingdom is not.\nLest it may be said that the present prevalent recognition by a foreign state of the corporate creations of another state did not obtain at the time of the passing of \u201cThe British North America Act,\u201d I would refer to the case of Howe Machine Co. v. Walker[30], wherein is to be found the able and exhaustive judgment of the first Chief Justice of this court, then Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Ontario.\nThe judgment was delivered in 1873. It contains a review of all the leading authorities, including that of Bank of Augusta v. Earle[31], which stands prominently forth in the historical development of the principle, and had been decided in the Supreme Court of the United States in the year 1839.\nPrinciples as well recognized (long before, and immediately after, the enactment of \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d) as these cases and the respective authorities upon which they rest shew, must have formed part of the common knowledge of the statesmen who framed the Act in question, and the language used must be read in light thereof.\nAre we to impute to these men the intention of prohibiting the operation of this principle in regard to provincial corporations? If we can conceive them possessed of such an intention, so fraught with the absurdities I have pointed out, then we must suppose them to have been stricken with a strange poverty of the power of expression.\nAssuredly we do not find such intention in the words. The legal implications are all against it.\nI venture to add that so much has been done ever since, both by legislators and representative men of business, on the faith of the power of provincial corporations to assert their right to act upon the principle, that if the expression be doubtful in this regard, which I deny, we ought not to accept lightly such disturbing propositions as are here presented to us. A distinction was sought to be drawn between the powers of the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislature, in regard to this status of their corporate creations abroad.\nI have not been able to find any reason for such distinction, save that which may spring from the nature of the subject matter over which their respective powers may have such control as to enable either to form a corporate body in respect thereof.\nThe Dominion Parliament has, by virtue of its exclusive powers, and reservation to it of all powers not expressly conceded to the provinces, impliedly the power of creating corporations within such sphere of action. Many of those possible creations may be extra-provincial or inter-provincial, and thus of necessity, requiring a wider scope than it would be possible for any legislature of a province to confer upon a corporation, even of a like character. Railway and telegraph and ferry company charters exemplify these cases very well, and as each is intra or extra-provincial, so may be their respective powers.\nThat does not, however, confer, or necessarily imply, relatively greater power beyond the confines of the Dominion, as part of the domain of the Dominion Parliament, in contradistinction to the jurisdiction of the legislature of a province.\nEither Dominion or provincial corporation stands upon the same footing in a foreign state.\nThe proposition of distinction when it goes beyond this, is, I am convinced, destitute not only of judicial authority but also of legal principle to support it.\nThat which is assigned exclusively either to the domain of the Dominion or province, must in the last resort be measured by the powers of the Dominion or the province respectively over the subject matter so assigned, and can only receive recognition to the extent of such respective limitations and not beyond.\nAlong the line of the history of the comity of nations, ever since the contractual rights of corporations abroad have been recognized, I have not been able to find a single instance in a country where the doctrine prevailed, that any question was raised of the nature of the constating power that created the corporation claiming recognition.\nThe sole questions are; is it a corporation? Was it given power to carry on this kind of business; to form this kind of contract in question? If so, and given it at home then it is always presumed to be implied as given elsewhere, wherever the comity of nations prevails.\nNor has the recognition abroad and force of that recognition depended on a provision, express or implied, in the charter or Act creating the corporation anticipating its going abroad to do business.\nIt simply depends on the kind of business it was incorporated to do. If that business can be done abroad as well as at home in addition to or as part of the home business, the right is inherent in the corporation to go there to do it unless recognition there is denied it.\nThe very word corporation implies and implied in England at the passing of \u201cThe British North America Act,\u201d a right to trade abroad for the purposes for which the corporation was created, unless restricted, just as much as the words \u201cfree citizen\u201d implies in modern times his right to go abroad.\nIt is not that the comity adds to the power of the corporation as some seem to suggest this theory implies. It is that any state creating a corporation without restricting its power is supposed to know as a matter of international law that the same kind of business it enables it to do can then legally be done abroad by this creation, in states that choose to accord it recognition.\nWhen statesmen frame a law, its language must be read in light of that international law and unless clearly repugnant thereto or expressly excluding its operation both must be read together.\nIt becomes more imperative to do so in the case of a piece of legislation that itself is in its fundamental nature akin to what is commonly known as international law. An instrument such as \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d is essentially of this character. In attempting as it does to define the relations of former independent provinces, and the relations of these thenceforward, to the inhabitants thereof, and those of each of the others, and of all to the common central power being created, regard ought to be had, and I venture to think, was had, to the former relations between each provincial legislature and the people of its province and the manifold relations of every kind then had with foreign neighbours whether as individuals or as states.\nThe assignment of residual power to the Dominion instead of to the provinces as in the United States federation suggested the argument that therefore the corporations created by the former have more inherent capacity for foreign business than those created by the provinces.\nYet strangely enough the converse case of the United States has never suggested to any one that the corporate creation of a State had greater power in this regard than the Federal Government. In conclusion, I think, that the lowly origin of a provincial corporation is of itself no more reason in law for excluding it from the benefits of international trade than for distinguishing between the rights in the same regard of a Liliputian and a Brobdingnagian freeman and discriminating against the former.\nI have tried to confine my reasoning to the single issue of the presumptive right of a provincial corporation, properly constituted, for the purpose of endowing it with the right to execute any one or more of the purposes comprehended in the several subject matters assigned by \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of each of the provinces, to go abroad to do that kind of business it was incorporated to do, so far as permitted by a foreign state.\nI am not oblivious of the possibility of many more or less intricate questions arising, before the relations of the Dominion and the provinces and they with each other are finally settled; as to the rights of the corporate creation of either.\nI desire to abstain from going further than I think absolutely necessary.\nIn this case there was no law of Quebec relied upon as prohibitive of its people or corporations contracting in the way these appellants contracted. Invited as their counsel were to press such a point if open, they refrained from doing so.\nNevertheless the contract being as stated already between two corporations domiciled in different provinces, it seems to me it raises the broad issue I have discussed, just as much as if the appellant company had entirely belonged to a foreign State where there existed no prohibitive law against such a contract. In the 91st number of The Law Quarterly Review at page 296 et seq. is to be found the most complete collection I have seen of decisions bearing upon the position of foreign juridical persons in England.\nBesides bearing out what I have urged as the law, I notice also the significant statement that to provide for the fulfilment of the several conventions concluded by England with almost every power in Europe for the mutual admission of commercial associations to civil rights, no legislation had been found necessary in England.\nThe spontaneous operation thus evinced of English law, confirms my impression and argument of there being presumed to be inherent in every corporation created under that law, a capacity to do such business abroad as consistent with the purposes of its creation.\n\u201cThe British North America Act\u201d ought, therefore, to be interpreted in the light of that and the nature of a corporation to be created thereunder be viewed in accord therewith unless expressly restricted.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with all the costs incurred not only by the respondents, but by the Dominion and provinces taking part in the second argument.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014On the merits of this case as presented and argued in the court below, I agree with the reasons and conclusions of Mr. Justice Osler, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nWhen the case came before us an additional argument was made, viz.: that the defendants as a company incorporated under a provincial statute, could not insure against a risk on property in the State of Maine, inasmuch as the power of the provincial legislature to incorporate companies is confined to companies with provincial objects. \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d section 92 (11).\nI do not find this objection mentioned or referred to in the courts below, either in the pleadings or proceedings, or in the judgment at the trial, or in the reasons of appeal, or in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and it is not mentioned or referred to in the appellant\u2019s factum in this court.\nOn the contrary the action is founded on the policy and it is pleaded and relied upon, from first to last, as a valid instrument, and as an instrument which in terms insured the plaintiffs in respect of their losses upon property, in the State of Maine.\nIt is true that the plaintiffs did plead and contend that if the policy was, as the defendants contended;, confined to buildings, etc., and did not cover standing timber, it ought to be held invalid, on the ground of mutual mistake, and that they were in that case entitled to recover the premiums which they had paid. But that is a very different thing from pleading that the policy was void in toto, as ultra vires, by reason of \u201cThe British North America Act,\u201d and of the insured property being in a foreign country.\nThis new contention is inconsistent with the record, and with all subsequent proceedings down to the argument before us, and for that reason cannot in my opinion have effect given to it, even if we thought it well founded. The Queen v. Poirier[32], at pages 38-9, and other cases cited in Coutlee\u2019s Digest, at pages 118, 119; Cameron\u2019s Supreme Court Practice, pages 310\u201118. But if this point be regarded as open, I am of opinion that it cannot prevail.\nIf the construction contended for of the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d is well founded, then it follows that while an individual or a partnership in Ontario may contract to do many things in a foreign country, a provincial corporation could do none of them; as for instance, the making of promissory notes, or the acceptance of bills of exchange payable in England or France, or in another Canadian province. A business corporation in Ottawa, on that interpretation, could not, unless incorporated by Parliament, make a valid contract for the purchase of goods in Montreal, or Hull; or give promissory notes for the price, payable in either place.\nI think such a result as that never could have been intended, and that the words used do not require or admit of such a construction.\nI think all that was intended was that as between the Dominion and the provinces the powers of the latter in incorporating companies should be analogous to those of independent countries; and that if a corporation desired to acquire extraordinary rights or powers of any kind, to be exercised in more than one province, those rights and powers must be obtained from Parliament, instead of from the other province or provinces, as would be required to be done in the case of independent countries.\nI think the expression provincial objects is used in contradistinction to Dominion objects, and means no more than this: that just as Parliament in incorporating companies must confine itself to Dominion objects as between the Dominion and other countries, so each province not only as between itself and other countries, but between itself and the provinces, must confine itself to provincial objects; and as Parliament cannot empower a company to go into another country and there construct a railway or canal or a telegraph or telephone line, so neither can a provincial legislature confer any such powers on a company incorporated by it. And as a Dominion company, desiring to exercise such powers in Maine or Michigan, must obtain them from those states, so a company desiring to exercise such powers in more than one province must be incorporated by Parliament, instead of being first incorporated by a province and then applying for the required powers to the other province or provinces.\nIt is not questioned that the defendants were lawfully incorporated, and capable of making lawful and valid contracts of insurance, and their charter contains no limitation or restriction as to the locality or situs of the property to be insured. That being so, I do not see what possible difference it can make where the subject to which the contract relates was situated.\nAt common law an individual or a partnership could make such contracts, and in such cases it must be clear that the situs of the property is altogether immaterial.\nIn insuring property in Maine the defendants were not assuming any power or jurisdiction in that country. They simply made a contract with the plaintiffs to pay them a sum of money on a certain event.\nThe confusion arises from treating the property to which the contract relates as the subject of it, whereas the subject of the contract is the risk, or more exactly, the possible loss, which the assured may happen to suffer by injury to his property by fire. More than a century and a half ago Lord Hardwicke said: It cannot properly be called insuring the thing, for there is no possibility of doing it, and therefore must mean insuring the person from damage. Sadlers Co. v. Badcock[33].\nAnd in Rayner v. Preston[34], Cotton L.J. said the contract of insurance was not a contract, in the event of a fire, to repair the insured buildings, but a contract, in that event, to pay a sum of money which the assured might apply as they thought fit.\nAt common law, in my opinion, an individual, or a company of individuals, in one country, could insure a person in another country, against loss by fire to property in a third country, and in the absence of legislation, to property anywhere in the world. And I think there is nothing in \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d which would prevent an individual or a partnership in any province of the Dominion from making insurance contracts with the same freedom and scope as before, and it would be a strange thing if it were enacted that a company incorporated by a province simply for doing such business should be restricted to property within the province while individuals and partnerships were left free.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The question to be determined on this appeal is whether or not a company incorporated under the authority of a provincial legislature to carry on the business of fire insurance is inherently incapacitated from entering into, outside the boundaries of its province of origin, a valid contract of insurance relating to property also outside those limits. For the reasons I shall presently mention I think the answer to this question depends upon the construction of sub-section 11 of section 92 of \u201cThe British North America Act\u201d which is in these words:\n\u201cThe incorporation of companies with provincial objects.\u201d Admittedly, indeed, the appellant company cannot succeed unless it can make good its contention that no company is within the description \u201ccompanies with provincial objects\u201d whose constitution permits it to enter into such contracts.\nIn this sub-section the word \u201cobjects\u201d seems to be used in the sense in which it is commonly used in relation to the subject dealt with\u2014the incorporation of companies; the sense in which, for example, it is used in \u201cThe Companies Act of 1862\u201d (Imperial); and to denote the purposes for? which a company is established, or its undertaking as defined by its constitution. The substantial controversy turns therefore upon the meaning of the word \u201cprovincial.\u201d\nAs we are, I think, relieved from the examination of some points elaborately discussed during the argument by a decision of the Judicial Committee, (Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[35]), it will be convenient, first to state what I conceive to be the effect of that decision. In the discussion of that topic a preliminary observation or two on the enactments of section 92, relating to the subject of the creation of corporations will, I think, be conducive to clearness. Sub-section 11 of that section, which I have already quoted does not, it is obvious, define exhaustively the legislative authority of the provinces in relation to that subject. The power to create corporations of a special character is plainly, I think, conferred upon them by sub-sections 7 and 8; Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada[36], at page 364. To them is also committed (with certain exceptions) by sub-section 10, legislative control over local works and undertakings; and although not expressly, it may be that\u2014I express no opinion upon it\u2014by a necessary implication, the provinces derive from the sub-section last mentioned (independently of any other provision of section 92) authority to constitute corporations for the purposes of such works and undertakings\u2014including the authority to endow such corporations with such powers as may be necessary or incidental to such purposes. The authority to create corporations for educational purposes is also, I think, implied in the enactments of sec. 93. See Re Christian Brothers\u2019 Schools[37].\nBut sub-section 11 professes to deal with the subject of the incorporation of companies generally; and in so far as that subject\u2014the creation of that species of corporations which the enactment describes as \u201ccompanies\u201d\u2014is not encroached upon by the sub-sections (7, 8 and 10) to which I have just referred, nor by sec. 93, sub-section 11 must, I think, be taken to define the powers of the local legislatures in relation to it. There may be other classes of corporations\u2014not within the scope of sub-sections 7, 8 and 10 or of sec. 93\u2014which, as not within the term \u201ccompanies,\u201d are also outside the scope of subsection 11; ecclesiastical corporations sole for example. With regard to such corporations the province must resort for its legislative authority to sub-section 13 of section 92 relating to property and civil rights generally, or to sub-section 16 of that section, relating to matters merely local and private within the province. But with respect to the creation of corporations which are \u201ccompanies\u201d within the meaning of sub-section 11 these last mentioned subsections cannot, I think, be resorted to. The authority in relation to the creation of such corporations having been made by the legislature the subject of a special provision of section 92, it would, I think, be a departure from elementary principles of statutory construction, to hold that in relation to that subject, a broader authority is conferred by other more general provisions of the same section.\nIt is not open to dispute that the defendant company does not belong to any of the classes of corporations assigned to the legislative control of the Dominion, by the enumerative clauses of section 91, or that it is a company of the class which is the subject of legislation in sub\u2011section 11; and consequently, if the view I have just expressed be correct, the measure of legislative authority of the province respecting its status and powers must be found in that sub-section. Of the corporations under discussion in The Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[38] and in the earlier decision therein referred to (The Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[39]), it may also be said that they were corporations of the species which the Act\u2014in that sub-section\u2014describes as companies; it is to such companies that the observations I shall quote from these cases must I think be taken to be confined, and it is in that sense that I wish the word \u201ccompany,\u201d when used in what follows, to be understood.\nTo come then to The Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec38; the appeal which led to that decision arose out of an action brought in the Province of Quebec in the name of the Attorney-General of that province praying a declaration that the defendant company\u2019s \u201cAct of Incorporation\u201d was ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. That Act professes to incorporate the company for the purpose of carrying on various kinds of business and provides (inter alia) section 11.\nThat the chief office of the association shall be in the City of Montreal, and that branch offices or agencies may be established in London, England, in New York, in United States of America, and in any city or town in the Dominion of Canada, for such purposes as the directors may determine, in accordance with the Act, and that bonds, coupons, dividends or other payments of the association may be made payable at any of the said offices or agencies.\nSir Montague E. Smith delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee said, at page 164:\u2014\nTheir Lordships cannot doubt that the majority of the court was right in refusing to hold that the association was not lawfully incorporated. Although the observations of this Board in The Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons, referred to by the Chief Justice, put a hypothetical case by way of illustration only, and cannot be regarded as a decision on the case there supposed, their Lordships adhere to the view then entertained by them as to the respective powers of the Dominion and provincial legislatures in regard to the incorporation of companies.\nAnd at page 165:\u2014\nThe company was incorporated with powers to carry on its business consisting of various kinds throughout the Dominion. The Parliament of Canada could alone constitute a corporation with these powers. The observations of the Board in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[40], thus made a part of its judgment in The Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[41], indicated very clearly the ground upon which it was held that the incorporation of such a society is within the legislative powers of the Dominion.\nThe authority would belong to it (it is said) by its general power over all matters not coming within the class of its subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces and the only subject on this head assigned to the provincial legislatures being the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, it follows that the incorporation of provincial companies for objects other than provincial falls within the general powers of the Parliament of Canada.\nThis decision then would appear to establish that the words \u201cprovincial objects\u201d imply a territorial restriction; and that, by reason of that restriction, incorporated companies (of the species under consideration) which derive their corporate status and powers from a provincial legislature under the authority of sub-section 11 of section 92, are constitutionally incapable of \u201ccarrying on their business\u201d (in the sense in which Sir M.E. Smith uses the words) \u201cthroughout the Dominion.\u201d\nThis view of the effect of The Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney\u2011General of Quebec41 was during the argument assailed on two grounds. First, it was said that the passage I have quoted from the judgment of the Board was a dictum only. This objection is I think without foundation. The subject of the appeal before their Lordships was a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench containing a declaration that the defendant company had no legal right to act as a cor- poration in the Province of Quebec in respect of any of the kinds of business which by its \u201cAct of Incorporation\u201d it was authorized to engage in; a judgment pronounced upon a petition claiming (inter alia) a declaration that the \u201cAct of Incorporation\u201d was a nullity as being ultra vires of the legislature which had enacted it. Their Lordships allowed the appeal and reversed the judgment. This would hardly have been possible if their Lordships held the view that the legislation was ultra vires. It was necessary to consider, and their Lordships accordingly did consider\u2014as a question to be determined for the purpose of arriving at their decision\u2014whether the Dominion Parliament had power to incorporate such a company. They proceeded on a well-settled principle that if the incorporation of such a company were not within the power of the provincial legislatures it must be within the powers of Parliament, and their conclusion was the necessary result of the opinion they expressed that the legislative authority of the provinces does not include the power to incorporate a company endowed with such powers. The judicial committee having selected this as the principle of their judgment, it would hardly seem to be doubtful that we are not entitled to disregard that principle as unnecessary to their decision.\nThe second ground of attack is that the decision has no bearing upon any question of corporate capacity; that, in other words, the scope of the decision in-so-far as it affects provincial corporations is limited to this\u2014that the law of its province cannot ex pro-prio vigore confer upon a provincial corporation a corporate status or any civil right outside the limits of the province. It is true that the judgment of the Quebec court, while denying it the legal right to exercise its corporate powers in that province, acknowledged the legal existence of the corporation. But the judgment of the Judicial Committee, as we have seen, is based expressly upon the proposition that \u201cThe Act of Incorporation,\u201d which is treated by the Committee as in its essence an Act conferring certain corporate capacities, was intra vires of the Dominion Parliament because it was of such a character as to be ultra vires of a province. This \u201cAct of Incorporation,\u201d so held to be beyond the legislative powers of a province, is thus described in the judgment, at page 166:\u2014\nWhat the Act of Incorporation has done is to create a legal and artificial person with capacity to carry on certain kinds of business, which are defined, within a defined area, viz.: throughout the Dominion. Among other things, it has given to the association power to deal in land and buildings, but the capacity so given only enables it to acquire and hold land in any province consistently with the laws of that province relating to the acquisition and tenure of land. If the company can so acquire and hold it, the Act of Incorporation gives it capacity to do so.\nHence I conclude that the last mentioned objection is untenable also.\nIt is, however, important not to attribute to the language of the Judicial Committee a meaning more far reaching than that which it fairly conveys. And I do not think we can deduce from the judgment any broader principle than this\u2014that a company authorized by its constitution to establish itself in any or all of the provinces of the Dominion, and in any of those provinces to carry on the whole of its business or as much of it as it shall see fit, is not a company of the class to which the authority of the provincial legislatures, under the sub-section referred to, (No. 11), can be held to extend. The company, whose Act of Incorporation was under consideration, was, as we have seen, endowed with just such powers, and it was with reference to those powers that the expressions were used which I have quoted from the judgment. Those expressions must therefore be read and construed with reference to that circumstance. We are not to seize upon the statement that only companies incorporated by the Parliament of Canada have the capacity to carry on their business throughout the Dominion, detach it from its context, from the subject matter under discussion, and imputing to it the broadest signification which it will bear, give effect to it in that sense as expounding a binding rule of law. Some observations made by Lord Herschell in the course of the argument in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada[42], are so apt here that (although not authoritative) I take the liberty of quoting them.\nThe language that this Board used is used secundum subjectam materiem, and to detach a phrase that in a concrete case is used with reference to a particular matter, and which it may be perfectly proper to treat in that way, as a sort of phrase that determines something with reference to another matter, I rather protest against.\n(See the stenographer\u2019s note of the argument on the \u201cLiquor Prohibition Appeal,\u201d page 239.)\nIt would, I think, be a misapplication of the passages I have quoted from their Lordships\u2019 judgment to treat them as decisive of the question whether an insurance company incorporated by a provincial legislature can by an agent enter into a valid contract of insurance outside the boundaries of its province. Their Lordships had before them no such question. The actual decision was that Parliament only can endow a company with capacity to carry on its busi- ness throughout the Dominion in the unlimited way I have just described. And it is in that sense and in that sense only, I think, that the phrase \u201ccarry on its business\u201d is used by Sir M.E. Smith in the passages I have quoted.\nIt may be material to observe that the use of that phrase with reference to a given area as implying the maintenance of a fixed place of business within that area is a use very familiar to lawyers. It is commonly said, for example, that corporations carrying on business in England are subject to service of process as persons within the jurisdiction. Eminent judges have said that in such cases the test of liability to service is the answer to the question; Does it carry on its business in England? (See Haggin v. Comptoir D\u2019Escompte De Paris[43],:at page 522, per Cotton L.J.; L\u2019Honeux, Limon & Co. v. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation[44], at page 448, per Bacon V.C.)\nEverybody knows that by this language is meant, that the liability to service depends upon the result of the inquiry whether the corporation is resident, in the only way in which it can be resident, by having within the jurisdiction a fixed place at which it carries on its own business. See \u201cLa Bourgogne\u201d[45]. And in a case recently decided in this court an Ontario company which consigned its goods to a dealer in Halifax who, under his agreement had the sole right to sell them as the agent of the company and did sell them as such, but did this in the course of carrying on his own business and as a part of it, was held not thereby to be \u201cdoing busi ness\u201d in Halifax within the meaning of the statute authorizing the Municipal Council to impose license fees. See City of Halifax v. McLaughlin Carriage Co.[46]\nThe company whose powers are in question on this appeal was incorporated under the authority of the Legislature of Ontario, and is not by its constitution expressly empowered or forbidden to engage in business beyond the boundaries of that province; and it is therefore subject in that regard only to the disabilities affecting it, ipso facto, as a corporation owing its existence to a provincial legislature.\nTo support the validity of the contract in question it is not necessary to maintain the view that such a company is permitted to carry on business throughout the Dominion in the manner authorized by the constitution of The Colonial Building Society; it is not even necessary to hold that such a company may maintain any fixed place of business without the Province of Ontario or in any manner establish itself outside that province. It is sufficient if, given that as a provincial corporation it is disabled from so carrying on its business or maintaining any such fixed place of business, and that as such a corporation it is, as to its local habitation, confined to the province where it originated\u2014it is sufficient if such a corporation so disabled and confined may nevertheless be empowered to enter into such a contract of insurance abroad without thereby becoming excluded from the class of corporations described by sub-section 11 as \u201ccompany with provincial objects.\u201d\nThe characteristic \u201cprovincial\u201d which is to mark the objects of such a company is not necessarily, I think, to be found in every act or transaction of the company\u2014but in the undertaking of the company viewed as a whole. If the company is one formed for gain, then the \u201cobjects of the company\u201d is only another expression for the business of the company\u2014the business by means of which the company, under its constitution, is permitted to acquire that gain; and the question;\u2014Are such and such objects\u2014regarded as the objects of a \u201ccompany\u201d as these words are used in sub-section 11\u2014\u201dprovincial objects\u201d? is another form of the question;\u2014Would the business of a company constituted with such objects, regarded as a whole, fairly come within the description \u201cprovincial\u201d? If, taken as a whole, a given undertaking would fall within the description \u201cprovincial,\u201d I do not know on what ground one could challenge the competence of the legislature to constitute a company having such an undertaking, or to invest its creature with such capacities and faculties as. it should see fit\u2014not of course incompatible with the character of its under-taking as a provincial undertaking.\nThere is I think a very real distinction between a company whose undertaking is limited in the manner I have indicated and a Dominion company having power to establish itself and conduct its business to any extent in any one or more of the provinces it may select. And the distinction is important in two aspects. It affects not only the company and the shareholders or corporators of it. The constitution and powers of such a corporation might well be regarded as constituting a single subject of Dominion concern which would be fitly reserved as a subject of legislation to the Dominion. It may well too have been thought that the legislative control of Canadian com- panies having authority without restriction to carry on business abroad, should for the same reason be a single control vested in the Dominion. Not only is the undertaking of such a company outside the description \u201cprovincial\u201d in the territorial sense, but I find it difficult to fasten upon any characteristic of such a company appertaining to its corporate capacity which permits the application of that description.\nOn the other hand, the constitution and powers of a corporation restricted as to its residence or places of business to one province are mainly the concern of that province; and it seems impossible to find any ground upon which to deny the character \u201cprovincial\u201d to such a company, confined in its administration and as to its residence to the province of its origin; elsewhere always a foreigner and a non-resident foreigner; whose business in fact originates in that province and as an organization must always be in substance a \u201cprovincial\u201d undertaking\u2014and such a company seems, consequently, to satisfy the description \u201ccompany with provincial objects.\u201d\nIf I am right in this view, it is plain that the power to incorporate such a company resides in the province; and it is a question for the legislature creating it whether any and what restrictions shall be imposed upon it respecting the places where its contracts may be entered into. Sub\u2011section 11 does not in terms touch that subject; and to read the word \u201cprovincial\u201d as imposing a limitation respecting it is I think unnecessarily, and therefore wrongly, to enlarge the application of that word.\nThe opposite view\u2014which Mr. Ewart in his supplementary factum abandoned\u2014the view that a provincial company cannot in the prosecution of its undertaking enter into contracts abroad leads to results which I think it is most unlikely that the framers of \u201cThe Confederation Act\u201d could have contemplated. As regards a very numerous class of such companies, hitherto in Canada, in the vast majority of cases, incorporated under the authority of provincial legislatures\u2014companies I mean engaged in mercantile business\u2014the results may fairly be summed by saying that this view would, for practical purposes, so curtail the powers of the provinces with respect to the incorporation of such companies as to deprive the exercise of that power almost wholly of any practical utility. The charter of a mercantile company handicapped by its incapacity to contract abroad either for buying or selling would, I should think, seldom be worth the cost of obtaining it. Certainly any form of association known to result in such disabilities would rarely be resorted to by persons engaging in mercantile enterprises. In point of fact it is well known that a very considerable part of the internal trade of the Dominion is carried on by companies organized under \u201cThe General Companies Acts\u201d of the various provinces; and when one considers the circumstances in which \u201cThe Confederation Act\u201d was passed it is difficult to believe that this is contrary to the intentions of the authors of that Act. It is to be remembered that that Act provided not only for the union of the four original provinces but for the entry into the Union of British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Having regard to the remote situation of the first and last of those colonies with the relation to the seat of the Government of the Dominion and recalling the imperfect means of communication it seems unlikely that Parliament intended, while conferring the power to create companies, to deprive the legislatures of provinces so situated of authority to constitute corporations having full power to carry on business of an ordinary mercantile or commercial character in the ordinary way. If that authority was withheld, one naturally asks why a power which it was thought worth while to confer upon the provinces in any degree was so limited as to be for practical purposes so largely futile?\nFor the reasons I have given I do not think that the language of the clause in question effects such a limitation.\nNor do I think there is any sufficient reason for holding that a provincial insurance company is inherently incapable of engaging in contracts of insurance relating to extra provincial property. The contract of fire insurance is a contract of indemnity under which one party assumes an obligation to pay a sum of money on the happening of a specified event. The fact that the event so specified in some of the contracts of such a corporation will happen if it happen at all outside the province where its business is carried on is a circumstance which does not, I think, for the purpose in hand, determine the essential character of that business\u2014the character, that is to say, of the objects of the corporation as \u201cprovincial\u201d or non-provincial within the meaning of subsection 11. To test the point let us assume a corporation empowered to make contracts of insurance within the province of its origin only. That this is a fair test is not denied. Indeed on the second argument it was candidly conceded by Mr. Ewart that he must in order to succeed on this branch of his argument maintain that such a contract, wherever made, is ultra vires of a provincial company. Now it seems to me too clear for argument that the business of such a cor- poration is aptly described as provincial. Can it be said that such a business suffers a loss of its provincial character in cases where by the constitution of the corporation such contracts may relate to property not within the province? If so it must be upon the principle that in determining the character of a company\u2019s undertaking for this purpose you are to ascertain as the governing factor in the inquiry whether the company may in the prosecution of its undertaking engage in contracts under which its rights or its liabilities depend upon the happening of an event outside the province; for it is obvious that no sensible distinction can in this regard be drawn between rights and liabilities. That I cannot accept because, as I have already said, you are for this purpose to look at the character of the undertaking as a whole. And the practical results of this view, I think, condemn it. Consistently with it, no provincial life insurance company could insure against a death, no accident company against an accident occurring outside the province; a similar disability would attach to companies carrying on the business of marine insurance. In effect no provincial company could engage in the business of life, accident or marine insurance except upon conditions which would in practice make it impossible or almost impossible for it to obtain any business to do. The results become more startling still when one attempts to apply such a rule to companies engaged in trading, shipping or financial business.\nThe contention has, moreover, no support from authority. In the case of Bank of Toronto v. St. Lawrence Fire Ins. Co.[47], an insurance company incor- porated under the legislation of the Province of Quebec, sought to resist a claim under one of its policies relating to property in Toronto on the ground that such a policy was ultra vires. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, though dismissing the action on another ground, rejected this defence. On appeal to the Privy Council, where the plaintiffs succeeded, the defence does not appear to have been abandoned; but is referred to apparently in the judgment of the Privy Council as one of a number of defences not \u201cseriously argued at the bar.\u201d Conceding that this case ought not upon this point to be regarded as a decision of the Privy Council, it would at least seem that the eminent counsel who appeared for the insurance company did not think it worth while seriously to challenge the view of the Quebec courts upon it; and it is obvious that the action must have been dismissed if the defence could have been maintained. This seems to be the only case in which the point has ever been raised.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Angus MacMurchy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hogg & Magee.\n[1] 11 Ont.

C.\nThe appellants, plaintiffs, are the grantees of the lands in question, part of the Seigniory of Metapedia, the former proprietors of which had an agent resident in the seigniory, who administered their affairs there. It had been customary, on applications by intending settlers for the purchase of their wild lands, for this agent to take memoranda of their names and permit them to enter upon the lands, and this was done in respect to the lots in question and the applicants were allowed to hold possession and make improvements thereon without notice of any special conditions limiting the titles which might, subsequently, be granted to them by the owners. The defendants, respondents, acquired the rights of these applicants and, when the plaintiffs tendered deeds of the said lots to them, they refused to accept them on the ground that conditions were inserted which had not been stipulated for at the time of the original entries upon the lots and of which no notice had been given. In actions, au p\u00e9titoire, the defendants pleaded that their possession had been in good faith in expectation of eventually receiving titles without such restrictive conditions as were sought to be imposed and that, in the event of eviction, they were entitled to full compensation for the value of all necessary improvements made on the lands without deductions in respect of rents, issues and profits.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, the Chief Justice and Duff J. dissenting, (1) that the memoranda made by the agent were commencements de preuve par \u00e9crit and, having been followed by possession of the lots, were equivalent to a binding promise of sale without unusual conditions in limitation of any titles which might be granted; (2) that the entries made upon the lands, the possession thereof held by the defendants and their auteurs and the works done by them thereon could not be held to be in bad faith nor with knowledge of defective title; (3) that, under the circumstances and notwithstanding that the defendants had actual notice of prior title, the plaintiffs could not maintain actions au p\u00e9titoire, although they might be entitled to declarations in confirmation of the deeds tendered, if approved, and to recover the price of the lots ; and ( 4 ) that the defendants could not be evicted without compensation for the full value of the necessary and useful improvements so made upon the lands with the knowledge and consent of the agsnt, and subject to being retained by the proprietors, without any deductions in respect of the rents, issues and profits derivable from the lands. Price v. Neault (12 App. Cas. 110) followed; Lajoie v. Dean (3 Dor, Q.B. 69) discussed.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014Under article 412 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, the good faith of a possessor of land is dependent upon a grant sufficient to convey real estate or transmit an interest therein.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgments of the Superior Court, District of Rimouski, in two petitory actions for the recovery of two lots of land in the Seigniory of Metapedia, whereby it was declared that the plaintiffs, appellants, were owners thereof but that the defendants, respondents, had made entries thereon and held possession thereof in good faith and that, before eviction therefrom, the defendants were entitled to compensation for the value of certain necessary and useful improvements made by them, respectively, upon the lots in question and which the plaintiffs were entitled to retain, and ordering that the plaintiffs should pay the costs of the actions.\nThe circumstances in each case are stated and the questions at issue on the present appeals are discussed in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Peers Davidson K.C. for the appellants.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and Fiset for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014This (Hall\u00e9's case) is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Quebec, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court (Carroll J.) rendered in a petitory action brought to recover possession of a lot of land containing about 99 acres, and described in the declaration as lot 103 in the first range west of the plan of the Seigniory of Metapedia.\nThe lot in question forms a part of the Seigniory of Lake Metapedia at one time the property of King Bros, lumber merchants, who exploited it for the purposes of their business. The seigniory contained about forty thousand acres.\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Carroll in the first court proceeds upon the principle that the respondent and his two predecessors B\u00e9langer and Otis had been in possession of the lot from 1895, and had made substantial improvements to the knowledge of the then Owners and on a promise that a deed of sale would be given. I can find no evidence after a most careful examination of the record to support the finding that any promise was ever given to consent to a deed of sale except in so far as such a promise may be inferred from the conversation between Otis and Nolin, to which I shall refer at length hereafter, or that King Bros, had any knowledge of the fact that defendant or his auteurs were in possession of the lot in question.\nAppellants say in their declaration that the respondent wrongfully and without any title took and obtained possession of the lot and has kept illegal possession of it, and pray deliverance of the land.\nRespondent at first attempted by his plea to put in issue the validity of the appellants' title asserting a title in himself, but from this untenable position he was compelled to recede and he now relies upon the allegation that about 1895 one Otis having acquired, for the sum of $7, certain improvements made by one Laberge a squatter on the lot in question entered into possession and made substantial improvements with the consent of Nolin, the authorized agent of King Bros., and upon his undertaking that a deed would be given by his principal. From Otis through one B\u00e9langer respondent claims to hold his title.\nThe appellants in October, 1902, bought the seigniory from King Bros., including the lot in question, by notarial deed duly registered. The respondent on the issues as we now have them claims no title to the land, but asserts that as possessor in good faith he has acquired the fruits and in addition is entitled to be reimbursed the value of the necessary improvements made by him. The judgment of the court below maintains the respondent's position and fixes the value of these improvements at $800. On this appeal there is no dispute as to this amount.\nThe only question to be determined here is as to whether or not the defendant, now respondent, has in the circumstances acquired the fruits and is entitled to retain possession of the property until reimbursed the value of the improvements made by him, he having been, as he pretends, a possessor in good faith; (arts. 411, 412 and 417, C.C.).\nThe solution of this question depends upon the character of the title under which the respondent possessed.\nThe Civil Code, art. 411, says:\nA mere possessor only acquires the fruits in the case of his possession being in good faith * * *\nAnd art. 417:\nWhen improvements have been made by a possessor with his own materials, the right of the proprietor to such improvements depends on their nature and the good or lad faith of such possessor.\nArt. 412:\u2014\nA possessor is in good faith when he possesses in virtue of a title the defects of which are unknown to him.\nI would observe that these articles are only cited in part and at the same time draw attention to what must evidently be an omission in art. 412. The word title is used alone and not titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 as in the corresponding article of the C. N, 550. Title which answers to \"titre? means here a written or express grant which would convey property otherwise it would not be reasonably possible to assume it as the basis of good faith ; e.g., a deed of lease or of usufruct would be a title but not such as is contemplated by this article.\nWhat is the character of the title required to enable the defendant to retain the fruits of the land and justify his claim to remain in possession of a property of which he is admittedly not the owner until paid the value of the improvements made by him.\nMarcad\u00e9, (code civil), vol. 2, No. 550, art. 418 :\nLe possesseur de bonne foi est celui qui se croit propri\u00e9taire, et qui a un juste motif de se croire tel, parce que sa possession repose sur un titre qui lui aurait r\u00e9ellement transmis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entach\u00e9 d'un vice que ce possesseur ne conna\u00eet pas.\nLaurent, vol. 6, No. 208:\nL'article 550 porte : \"Le possesseur est de bonne foi quand il poss\u00e8de comme propri\u00e9taire, en vertue d'un titre translatif de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il ignore les vices. Il cesse d'\u00eatre de bonne foi du moment o\u00f9 ces vices lui sont connus.\" De l\u00e0 suit que la bonne foi du possesseur doit \u00eatre absolue, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il ne suffit pas de la croyance que l'auteur du possesseur \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la chose qu'il lui a transmise, il faut qu'il ignore tous les vices du titre en virtu duquel il poss\u00e8de. La loi ne distingue pas, et il n'y avait pas lieu de distinguer. Pourquoi le possesseur gagne-t-il les fruits? Le motif juridique est qu'il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire du fonds et par cons\u00e9quent des fruits. Or, un propri\u00e9taire est certain de son droit, il le fait valoir contre tous. Le possesseur doit avoir cette m\u00eame certitude; si non il ne peut \u00eatre mis sur la m\u00eame ligne que le propri\u00e9taire. D\u00e8s qu'il y a lieu \u00e0 doute, l'incertitude existe, et par cons\u00e9quent la bonne foi l\u00e9gale cesser Nous disons la bonne foi l\u00e9gale, car la loi la d\u00e9finit; il faut donc laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la notion ordinaire de la bonne foi, qui pourrait varier beaucoup d'apr\u00e8s les sentiments et les id\u00e9es, pour s'en tenir \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du code.\nLet us now examine the respondent's title which. is printed at length on pages 13 and 14 of the case, and from which I make this extract:\nAu vendeur (Belanger) appartenant ce que dessus vendu pour l'avoir acquis d'Eug\u00e8ne Otis suivant acte de vente devant Mtre. M.P. Laberge, notaire, le vingt-six d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent quatre-vingt-dix-huit, enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 Matane, sous No. 7447, Reg. A. vol. 8, l'acqu\u00e9reur devant s'acquitter envers les seigneurs de la dite seigneurie de tout ce qui pourrait leur \u00eatre d\u00fb pour la concession de la dite terre.\nThe vendor Belanger's title is printed on pages 14 and 15 of the case and there it is declared by Otis that he acquired \"par conventions verbales\" from King Bros. I quote the words:\nLe dit immeuble appartient au vendeur pour l'avoir acquis de messieurs King Brothers par conventions verbales et l'acqu\u00e9reur devra prendre \u00e0 ses frais, un titre authentique des dits messieurs King Brothers, mais le vendeur ne sera pas tenu de payer aucuns arr\u00e9rages d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur le prix de vente d\u00fb aux dits messieurs King Brothers, s'il en existe.\nCan it be seriously argued in the presence of these deeds that he, Hall\u00e9, was not aware from the day he purchased of a defect in his title (412 C. C.)? Did not elementary prudence suggest that he should then have approached the landlord to inquire about the verbal title which Otis claimed to have?\nDefendant as witness, page 98, line 30, says:\nQ. Vous avez dit que vous saviez que les MM. King attachaient certaines conditions \u00e0 la vente, mais que vous ne saviez pas au juste quelles \u00e9taient ces conditions?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Vous \u00eates-vous jamais inform\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient ces conditions?\nR. Non.\nQ. Jamais?\nR. Non.\nQ. Vous n'\u00eates jamais all\u00e9 voir les MM. King ni monsieur Nolin pour demander quelles \u00e9taient ces conditions?\nR. Non.\nQ. Vous avez pris possession du lot sans demander \u00e0 personne?\nR. Non, d'apr\u00e8s l'achat de mon contrat.\nQ. Vous n'\u00eates pas all\u00e9 plus loin?\nR. Non.\nIt is contended that the question of good or bad faith is one of fact and having been decided by two courts we should not disturb their finding. It is not a pure question of fact, but is a legal inference to be drawn from facts in evidence. In the case of Mayrand v. Dussault[1] we reversed the concurrent finding of two courts on a question of fact, and as was staed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in the very recent case of Barrette v. Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke, even if a mere question of fact, although the natural inclination of the court is to be guided largely by the opinion of the learned judge who tried the case there may be circumstances which justify this court in departing from it.\nI might here observe that the question we are now considering has not been before this court to my knowledge for judicial determination, although the subject of many conflicting decisions in the Province of Quebec. The case gathers importance not only because the judgment to be rendered affects some twenty other cases which are depending upon it, in the Superior Court at Rimouski, but also because it will determine the rights of many large property owners in the Province of Quebec who are in the same position as the appellants. The conditions existing under the old seignorial system in that province has left the impression that large areas of land formerly held under seignorial tenure are still open for settlement to be occupied by any one who chooses to enter into possession and make the necessary improvements and pay rent as appears by defendant's evidence, page 93, line 6:\nQ. Lorsque vous \u00eates all\u00e9 vous \u00e9tablir \u00e0 Cedar Hall et que vous avez achet\u00e9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de monsieur B\u00e9langer saviez vous quels \u00e9taient les seigneurs de cette siegneurie-l\u00e0? R. J'avais toujours entendu dire que c'\u00e9taient les messieurs King.\nQ. Pouvez-vous dire \u00e0 quelles obligations vous vous croyiez tenu envers les MM. King?\nR. Non, monsieur, je croyais qu'on pouvait avoir des obligations comme on peut en avoir dans les seigneuries ordinaires, payer les rentes de terre, c'est la seule chose que je pouvais croire,\nQ. Si d'autres conditions que celles que vous venez d'indiquer et que vous croyiez \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0 \u00eatre vos obligations vis-\u00e0-vis les MM. King, avaient exist\u00e9es, des obligations comme celles du contrat qu'on a voulu vous faire signer, quel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, l'effet de ces conditions additionelles, si vous les aviez connues ?\nR. Si j'aurais achet\u00e9? Je n'aurais pas achet\u00e9 si je les avais connues.\nWhat are the facts? Broadly stated the respondent's contention is that his auteur, Otis, by verbal agreement conventions verbales acquired the property in question from the then owners, King Bros., in 1895 represented by their agent Nolin and through B\u00e9langer he is in Otis's right. It is, therefore, important to examine the exact nature of the agreement which is said to have been entered into between Otis and Nolin, for, although the respondent has, by reason of the sale by King Bros, to the appellants, lost his right to get a title, nevertheless the question of good or bad faith depends as to him on what occurred at that time. His title can be no better and he can put his case on no higher ground than Otis could if he was the respondent. It is not contended and there is certainly no evidence in the record to support such a contention that King Bros, were parties to or were ever in any way either before or after made aware of the alleged conventions verbales except in so far as they were bound by what Nolin did.\nFirst, as to the character of Nolin's agency. Can it be said that he was empowered to bind his principal by a contract of alienation. Article 1703 of the Civil Code, last par.: For the purpose of alienation and hypothecation, and for all acts of ownership other than acts of administration, the mandate must be express.\nNo attempt was made to prove that Nolin was expressly authorized to sell property. It was not contended at the argument and no reference to any such power is to be found in the respondent's factum. The only evidence on this subject is to be found in the case at pages 65-66, when Nolin was examined by the defendant as his witness:\nQ. C'est vous qui les repr\u00e9sentiez (les MM. King) \u00e2 Cedar Hall?\nR. C'est moi qui \u00e9tais g\u00e9rant.\nQ. C'est vous qui aviez l'administration absolue des affaires, en bas?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Vous ne voyiez jamais les MM. King en bas?\nR. Oui, quelque fois, une fois ou deux par ann\u00e9e.\nQ. Ils ne demeuraient pas l\u00e0?\nR. Non. Lorsqu'il s'agissait de vendre les terres c'est eux autres qui d\u00e9cidaient \u00e7a.\nIt should be quite unnecessary to quote authorities to support the elementary proposition that an agent with the most general powers of administration cannot validly consent to a deed of sale. In a few lines Laurent, vol. 27, No. 426, states the doctrine:\nLe. mandataire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne peut jamais ali\u00e9ner les immeubles; les auteurs m\u00eames qui donnent le plus d'extension au pouvoir de l'administrateur lui refusent ce droit; cel\u00e0 est d\u00e9cisif.\nHere we have the positive uncontradicted evidence of Nolin to the effect that he had no power to sell. He says, at pages 66-67\nQ. Le. fait d'entrer son nom sur cette feuille voulait dire seulement que si les MM. King se d\u00e9cidaient \u00e0 vendre le lot, \u00e7a donnerait un droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence ?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Ca n'obligeait les MM. King \u00e0 rien? R. Non, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 eux \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cela. Ca c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par eux.\nQ. Vous n'avaiez pas le droit de vendre le lot?\nR. Non.\nQ. Lorsque vous entriez le nom comme \u00e7a est-ce que celui d'ont le nom \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 savait qu'il avait \u00e0 prendre un titre des MM. King et \u00e0 payer?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Il ne payait rien pour faire entrer son nom?\nR. Non.\nQ. Etait-il entendu que ce titre devait \u00eatre satisfaisant pour les MM. King?\nR. Oui, ils devaient prendre un titre comme tous les autres.\nNo attempt was made to prove his authority aliunde and there is not a word of evidence that I have read to the contrary.\nThe respondent in his factum at page 6 says :\nWhile it may be that in consequence of the respondent having no registered title derived from King Brothers he was unable to set up the defence, which proved successful in the case of .Price v. Neault[2], as against the present appellant, it does not admit of doubt that he was a possessor in good faith, if against the previous proprietors,. namely, King Brothers, he would have been entitled to compel them to give him a title to the land.\nCan it be seriously argued that on the evidence just quoted Otis could force King Bros, on a direct issue between them to grant him a title ?\nAdmitting that article 1703 is to be ignored and that article 1730 would apply,\nthe mandator is liable to third parties who in good faith contract with a person not his mandatary, under the belief that he is so, when the mandator has given reasonable cause for such belief,\non the evidence in this record can it be said that the respondent comes within the meaning of that article and that King Bros. gave Otis reasonable cause to believe that Nolin had authority to make a contract of alienation. Price v. Neault(1) was relied on. In that case the respondent did not appear on the appeal and we therefore have the assurance that in accordance with the traditions of the Privy Council nothing was overlooked that could be invoked in the interest of the absent litigant. The facts in Price v. Neault[3] bearing upon the question of Beaudry's agency and his relation with his principal Price are stated by their Lordships at page 115 :\nBut on a careful examination of the evidence, their Lordships think that Beaudry was empowered to bind his principal by a contract of alienation. In the letter of November, 1865, Beaudry is directed by David Price to inform the. local public of the terms of sales, and Mongraine's letter of May, 1870, shews that this was done by notice at the church door. In the same letter David Price tells Beaudry that certain persons have applied to him for plots, and that he has referred them to Beaudry as his agent. The letter of Mongraine is an appeal to David Price to give him one of the plots on which he had entered and worked, in preference to a rival claimant, and David Price gives no answer except that Beaudry will do what is just. In his letter of the 5th of September, 1870, David Price instructs Beaudry to insert certain conditions \"in all the sales that you effect.\"\nIn his letter of the 21st of September, 1872, David Price tells Beaudry not to sell land in range B without taking a specified sum at once, and gives him discretion to make other arrangements, it is not easy to say what, while the lots are unsold. Magnan, the municipal secretary and treasurer, who himself settled on a plot, improved it, and afterwards purchased it, being asked how the plaintiff proceeded to sell his plots says that it was through his agent Beaudry. This gentleman's evidence is of much weight as regards the course of business on the estate, because few of the neighbors could write, and he was chosen to write to Beaudry on their behalf. The postscript to Beaudry's letter of the 4th of August, 1876, is an illustration of what passed between them, and both Magnan and Beaudry say that communications in the same sense frequently took place. In view of these letters from David Price and Beaudry's action upon them, which must have been known to his employers, their Lordships have no hesitation in holding that Beaudry had authority to contract for alienation, though it is true that of the powers of attorney executed by the plaintiff, that which was given to David Price in January, 1866, expressly mentions sales, and that given to Beaudry in September, 1872, speaks only of general regulation and management. Where is the evidence in this case that at any time or on any occasion Nolin was held out by King as having authority to sell? Where is the letter from King; where is the conversation; what is the public act of Nolin or King which would justify such a conclusion? If such facts existed they should have been proved so as to bring this case within the rule of Price v. Neault[4].\nIn my opinion the case fails here because Nolin is not proved to have been an agent with power to make such a contract as that alleged to have been entered into with Otis, and the latter had no reasonable cause to believe that he had any such power.\nAssuming that Nolin had some authority express or implied, let us now see what actually occurred in 1895 when Otis went to see him as he says to get permission to enter into possession of the lot, and as Nolin says to give his name so that he might have the preference if King decided to sell. There were three persons present at the interview, Otis, father and son, and Nolin. Here I give what occurred in their own words. Abel Otis, the father, at page 55, line 14:\nQ. Apr\u00e8s cela avez-vous fait quelque'autre d\u00e9marche quelque part, avec votre fils ?\nR. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 chez monsieur Nolin,\u2014mon fils \u00e9tait jeune, il n'\u00e9tait pas bien vieux,\/ j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 avec lui apr\u00e8s qu'il achet\u00e9 pour faire mettre son nom, pour pas que personne ne vint \u00e0 le d\u00e9ranger de son ouvrage.\nQ. Vous \u00eates all\u00e9 chez monsieur Nolin?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il faisait monsieur Nolin?\nR. C'\u00e9tait l'agent des messieurs King, de Cedar Hall.\nQ. Vous \u00e9tiez pr\u00e9sent avec votre fils chez monsieur Nolin?\nR. Oui, j'\u00eatais pr\u00e9sent avec lui pour faire mettre son nom, mon gar\u00e7on a demand\u00e9 de son nom dans le livre; de ce que j'ai pu comprendre il a mis son nom dans le livre. Q. Combien y a-t-il d'ann\u00e9es de cela?\nR. Entre huit ans \u00e0 neuf ans.\nBeing questioned later on as to the sale by his son to Belanger from whom the respondent bought he makes it clear that, as he understood what occurred, his son had not acquired the ownership of the property, page. 58 of case:\nQ. Ce que votre gar\u00e7on a vendu c'est son travail?\nR. Comme de raison, il n'a pas vendu la terre, elle ne lui appartenait pas.\nEugene Otis, the alleged purchaser, page 58, line 30, et seq.\nQ. Avez-vous eu affaire \u00e0 monsieur Nolin au sujet de cette affaire-l\u00e0 ?\nR,. J'ai eu affaire lorsque j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 pour mettre mon nom, c'est tout; \u00e0 part de cela je n'ai pas eu affaire.\nQ. Vous \u00eates all\u00e9 l\u00e0 avec votre p\u00e8re?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Que s'est-il pass\u00e9?\nR. J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Nolin de mettre mon nom sur la terre, il repondu oui, devant moi il ne l'a pas rentr\u00e9 ce n'est pas de ma faute.\nQ. Que vous a-t-il r\u00e9pondu?\nR. Il ma r\u00e9pondu que oui, qu'il le mettrait, mon nom.\nQ. A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 dit autre chose que cela?\nR. Non, c'est tout ce que il m'a dit.\nAgain page 59, line 25:\nQ. Lui avez-vous expliqu\u00e9 ce que vous aviez l'intention de faire?\nR. J'avais l'intention de me mettre sur la terre pour y rester, pour me mettre habitant.\nQ. Que vous a-t-il r\u00e9pondu?\nR. Il a dit il ne m'a pas dit que je faisais bien, il n'a pas parl\u00e9, il s'est mis \u00e0 sourir, il n'avait pas grand discours \u00e0 faire avec moi.\nQ. Qu'avez-vous conclu des paroles de M. Nolin ?\nR. Il m'a dit qu'il allait mettre mon nom, et, c'est tout.\nQ. Vous avez pris possession du lot apr\u00e8s \u00e7a?\nR. Oui, je me suis b\u00e2ti, j'ai travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 la terre, j'ai b\u00e2ti une grange, j'ai fait un d\u00e9frich\u00e9, j'ai fait du serp\u00e9. And on page 61, line 36:\nQ. Ce que vous avez vendu \u00e0 B\u00e9langer, c'est la m\u00eame chose?\nR. Oui, j'ai vendu mon travail seulement.\nQ. Lorsque vous avez fait entrer votre nom comme \u00e7a vous saviez qu'il fallait prendre un titre des MM. King?\nR. Oui, je le savais.\nAnd on page 62, lines 5 and 6.\nQ. Vous n'avez jamais r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de titre de MM. King?\nR. Non, je ne l'ai pas demand\u00e9, ils ne m'en ont pas donn\u00e9 non plus.\nRaphael Nolin examined as defendant's witness, page 63, line 37 :\nQ. Est-ce que vous avez conc\u00e9d\u00e9 le lot \u00e0 Otis?\nR. J'ai entr\u00e9 son nom dans mon petit livre pour qu'il vint \u00e2 avoir la .pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de prendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lorsque les MM. King se d\u00e9cideraient de vendre,\nQ. Que'est-ce que Otis vous a demand\u00e9 en allant chez vous? Pourquoi allait-il chez vous?\nR. Pour me demander \u00e0 inscrire son nom sur ce lot l\u00e0.\nQ. Une fois leur nom inscrit dans le livre, pouvez-vous dire s'ils prenaient possession de leur lot?\nR. Il y avait des fois qu'ils le prenaient; lorsqu'on s'apercevait de cela on leur disait de ne pas travailler sur le lot.\nAnd on cross-examination at pages 66 and 67 he referred again to this interview:\nQ. Le fait d'entrer, son nom sur cette feuille voulait dire seulement que si les MM. King se d\u00e9cidaient \u00e0 vendre le lot, \u00e7a donnerait un droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence?\nR. Oui.\nQ. \u00c7a n'obligeait les MM. King \u00e0 rien?\nR. Non c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 eux \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cela. \u00c7a c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par eux.\nQ. Vous n'aviez pas le droit de vendre le lot?\nR. Non.\nQ. Lorsque vous entriez le nom, comme \u00e7a est-ce que celui dont le nom \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 savait qu'il avait \u00e0 prendre un titre des MM. King et \u00e0 payer?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Il ne payait rien pour faire entrer son nom?\nR. Non. Q. Etait-il entendu que ce titre devait \u00eatre satisfaisant pour les MM. King?\nR. Oui, ils devaient prendre un titre comme tous les autres.\nFrom all that occurred on this occasion and assuming Nolin to have been the owner of the property in question, could he be obliged to grant Otis a title? I hold not.\nIt is impossible to find in what occurred the elements necessary to constitute a contract of sale, Object, price, consent (art. 1472, C.C.), or a promise of sale. All that can be inferred was that Otis asked for permission to enter into possession of the lot, but that Nolin gave no formal consent to his doing so. It is in my opinion abundantly clear that both parties Otis and Nolin expected Otis would get a preference if the lot was sold, but that the Seigneurs King Bros. alone could decide whether or not the lot was to be sold, and they alone could give a title. It has been argued that because, following on the conversation, Otis's name was entered in a book improperly described as a livre terrier that he took possession of the lot and made improvements and paid the taxes he was entitled to a deed. In my opinion it is somewhat difficult to infer a contract to sell from the mere entry of Otis's name in such a book as the one produced here and described by Nolin as a mere memorandum book, and it is to be observed that Nolin denies all knowledge of Otis's possession, improvements or payment of taxes (page 64) and asserts that had he known Otis had any such intention he would have prevented him from giving effect to it.\nIn Price v. Neault[5] their Lordships at page 113 say: The ground laid by the court for their decree is that the defendant and Perron were put into possession of the land, had possessed it for more than ten years, and had made substantial improvements within the sight and knowledge and with the consent of the plain- tiff by means of his agents, and on a promise that he would consent to a deed of sale for the price of $150.\nTheir Lordships cannot find their way to the whole of the conclusion thus expressed. The transactions between Beaudry on the one hand and Ludger Neault and his successors on the other, rest . entirely on Perron's evidence. It has been shewn under what circumstances Perron entered and made improvements. Translating his language freely, he proceeds thus: \"I did not ask to buy the plot of Beaudry. I only asked him if I might work and build a flour-mill. I had bought the plot of Neault. I was bound to observe the conditions under which the plot had been sold to him, that is to say, Beaudry had to notify to Neault to come in and take up his contract. I never asked Neault what price he was to pay to the plaintiff for the land. I did not exactly know the price at which the plaintiff was then selling those lands. I did not know that there was a price fixed for all the lots of land of the said range B. north. I do not think that the price was the same for each of the lots. I expected to pay for the ground the price for which the plaintiff was selling his lands in that range. I thought that price was $1 per arpent. I never heard tell of it. I did not know it.\" On that evidence it is difficult to say that there was any promise or contract as regards the purchase money. The book kept by Beaudry has not been produced, nor does he give any such description of it as would justify their Lordships in inferring a contract to sell from the entry of a name. And there is even greater difficulty in fixing $150 as the price.\nFor over eight years Otis, Belanger and the respondent remained in possession of the property now in question with the full knowledge that they had no title, and without at any time during all that period making an attempt to get a title or making any inquiry as to the conditions of sale. They do not appear to have at any time inquired as to the price they were expected to pay. As each successive occupant acquired the improvements of his predecessor he got by his deed formal notice of the fact that he had no title, but now that it suits the respondent to give up the property of which he has been for all these years in illegal possession, he asks to be paid for his improvements made with timber cut on the defendant's property. Pages 97 and 98:\nQ. La partie principale de vos constructions a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sur le lot?\nR. A part celui qui demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre varlope et embouvet\u00e9, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 chez MM. Fenderson et chez M. Price \u00e0 Amqui.\nQ. Le reste est de votre lot?\nR. Le reste a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris sur la terre.\nIn their factum the appellants conclude as follows :\nThe appellant on the other hand is not anxious to acquire the fruits of this man's toil either at a just valuation or for nothing. His chief aim is to keep his title clear and his lumbering interests free from molestation.\nThere can be no- doubt that in\" the Province of Quebec because of the conditions existing there the courts have been astute, I do not say improperly, to construe article 412 broadly, but there has been considerable diversity of judicial opinion as the respondent makes abundantly clear by the numerous cases which he cites. Ellice v. Courtemanche[6]; Chinic Hardware Co. v. Laurent[7]; Galarneau v. Chr\u00e9tien[8]. Hard cases make bad law.\nAfter they entered into possession the appellants on inquiry found that a large number of persons, about one hundred in all, were in possession of different lots in the seigniory without title from King Bros. They then offered to give titles to these different persons in all respects similar to those which their pre- decessors had been in the habit of granting and this has been made a grievance against them in this case, the contention being that they would not offer to give a title if they were not bound to do so as a result of what occurred between Otis and Nolin. The fact that Nolin was not the appellants' agent in any sense and that they could not be bound by what he did is of course overlooked.\nI am disposed to take a different view of the appellants' conduct in the premises. Anxious to avoid litigation and assuming that the occupants had entered into possession as they alleged on the faith of an undertaking that a title would be given to them, although the respondent and his auteurs allowed some eight years to go by without as he admits having ever asked for a title, they offer to give him a deed in all respects similar to the one generally in use in the seigniory. This was refused on the ground that the condition were too onerous.\nHall\u00e9, page 100, line 30:\nQ. La pens\u00e9e de r\u00e9clamer vos am\u00e9liorations vous est venue seulement apr\u00e8s l'action lorsque vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi?\nR. J'ai pens\u00e9e lorsqu'il ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me parler de signer un contrat, j'ai dit \u00e0 ma femme et \u00e0 n'importe quel autre, j'ai dit que plut\u00f4t que de signer ce titre ils me paieraient mon ouvrage.\nIn Ainsworth v. Bentley[9], Wood V.O. said:\nA person might be willing to forego his rights and so avoid litigation; but, after the litigation, which he had shewn himself anxious to avoid, had begun the circumstances were altered and he surely should be allowed to insist on his rights to the utmost.\nI fail to understand the principle upon which it is to be assumed that King Bros. were under any obligation to part with any portion of their property except upon such terms and conditions as they thought proper. This is not a case of expropriation, or compulsory purchase, and the question of reasonable or unreasonable terms has no place here and should not have been considered. It is not alleged and I have not heard it suggested by any one that at any time the terms and conditions of the deed of sale which it is assumed Otis expected to get as the result of his conversation with Nolin were settled. Assuming an agreement to sell, a most violent assumption in the circumstances, if both parties were silent as to the conditions of sale then the legal inference is that the conditions would at most be such as were generally in force in the locality for lands similarly situated.\nIt has been suggested here, but not in the courts below, that the deeds offered by the appellants to the respondent is not in terms similar to those generally granted by the Kings. From this I most emphatically dissent. The undoubted indisputable facts are that previous to the bringing of the suit a deed was tendered to the defendant for signature as appears by protest on page 16 of the case where it is said that the deed contained the usual conditions admitted to be those generally found in all deeds in the seigniory. This deed the defendant refused to sign, not because the terms were different from those generally in force, but because these conditions were not satisfactory to him.\nThe same thing flows from the pleas to the action as appears by paragraphs 14, 15 and 16, where it is admitted that a deed was offered and the alleged ground for defendant's refusal to sign or accept was that the conditions were exorbitant. The witnesses Nolin, case page 53, and French, case page 42, both say that the deed offered to the defendant is in effect the same as those granted by King Bros. The defendant examined as a witness in his own behalf is questioned closely as to the conditions of the deed at pages 99 and 100 and did not even remotely suggest that the deed offered him in any way differed from that granted all the other censitaires by King Bros. And finally the judge who tried the case in his reasons for judgment at page 109 says :\nCe document endoss\u00e9 \"vente,\" et qui, suivant les assertions de la demanderesse et la preuve, serait analogue \u00e0 tous les titres qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sign\u00e9s comporte vente du lot avec entr'autres les restrictions suivantes.\nSo that in my opinion this point is conclusively settled and at the argument here I assumed that this was admitted by counsel.\nIn my view the refusal of the respondent to accept the title offered to him greatly weakens his position.\nIf King Bros. were still the owners of the seigniory and had offered Hall\u00e9, the respondent, a title such as was generally used in the seigniory in 1895, at the time Otis took possession after his conversation with Nolin, could he, Hall\u00e9, refuse to take such a deed and say, \"No, I will not take this deed, the conditions are too onerous. You must pay me for my improvements before you can get possession of your land.\" I can hardly conceive that such a position would receive the sanction of any court in this country. In effect that is what happened here. The plaintiffs are in a stronger position than King Bros., for as against them the respondent cannot claim a title as is admitted in his factum.\nIn the absence of an express agreement the most that Hall\u00e9 was entitled to was such a title as was generally in use in the seigniory at the time Otis had his conversation with Nolin, and if he refused to take such a title, as he undoubtedly did, then he must be considered to be illegally in possession without a title and consequently in bad faith. Are the appellants to be penalized for having in the interest of peace agreed to give effect to an arrangement alleged by the respondent to have been made by their auteurs, but by which they were not legally bound? If it is urged that his case is a hard one to be ejected after all these years, the answer is that the fault is with himself as he might at the very outset before going into possession have made his position clear and certain by applying to the seignior to know what were the obligations towards them which he was assuming by the deed which he then signed, instead of taking for granted that he was merely obliged to pay rents, etc, as appears by his evidence already quoted. Having failed to do so he cannot now complain if he is made to suffer the consequences of his own negligence.\nIn the case of Lajoie v. Dean[10], page 71, Lajoie and his auteurs had been in possession of their property, made improvements and were entered on the valuation roll and paid taxes. The land was Government land intended for settlement, and those in possession were bona fide settlers; nevertheless Dorion C.J., found that in the absence of title they had not that good faith required by article 412 of the Civil Code, and while he declared they were entitled to be compensated for the improvements, obliged them to account for the rents and profits. That case is not, I admit, on all fours with this, but in view of the declaration made by the appellants in their factum that their sole desire is to settle the question of title and the conflicting jurisprudence in the Province of Quebec I would be disposed in this case to follow that precedent, and while holding that the defendant does not come within the rule laid down in article 412, allow him compensation for his improvements to the extent of $800, and hold him accountable for the rents, issues and profits, and I would allow the appeal, each party paying his own costs.\n(This opinion applies also to the appeal in Rioux's case. )\nGirouard J.\u2014This (Hall\u00e9's case,) is a petitory action, which, as I understand it, involves a mere question of fact decided by the district judge, Carroll J., and the court of appeal, Boss\u00e9, Blanchet and Lavergne J J., and Lemieux and Cannon J J., both ad hoc, and I would require a very clear case of error on their part to reverse their unanimous finding.\nBy his defence, the defendant admits the prior title of the plaintiffs, and consents that they be declared proprietors of the lot in question. But he claims that, as a possessor in good faith, before he can be forced to quit, he is entitled to the value of his necessary and useful improvements on the property, which have been allowed by both courts to the extent of $800, without any deduction for rents and revenues, art 417 C.C. Mr. Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice Cannon have gone fully into all the details of this case, and the reasons they advance fully convince me that the judgment which is now attacked was the only one which could be rendered. As, however, we are far from being unanimous, and the case is an important one and affects many settlers of this same locality, I will give the grounds which induce me to concur in that judgment. The whole case turns upon the application of art. 412 of the Civil Code:\nA possessor is in good faith when he possesses in virtue of a title the defects of which are unknown to him.\nThe appellants contend that the respondent, admitting that he has no title, that is, as he explains, no notarial or authentic title, transferring the land, cannot be considered to be in good faith. In fact they look upon him in no more favourable position than a squatter. What are the facts?\nRespondent purchased this lot of land on the 7th September, 1900, from one B\u00e9langer, by deed of sale before Gagnon, notary public, duly registered in the registry office of the County of Rimouski, where the land is situated. He purchased not only the rights of said B\u00e9langer, but the said lot\u2014\"une terre contenant trois arpents,\" etc., with all the buildings thereon erected. The vendor declares that he acquired the said land from one Otis by a notarial deed of sale of the 26th December, 1898, also duly registered. The only reference to the seigneurs, King Bros., is that the said purchaser undertook to pay everything that could be due to them for the grant of the said land, \"la concession de la dite terre\"\nAnd if we refer to the deed of sale to Otis, we find that it was a complete sale that was intended of the said piece of land\u2014\"une terre situ\u00e9e en la dite paroisse\" etc., and the vendor declares that the said land belongs to him for having acquired the same from Messrs. King Bros. \"par conventions verbales\" and the purchaser agreed to obtain an authentic title from Messrs. King Bros. at his cost.\nAs stated in the latter deed, Otis knew that he had no authentic title, but he considered that he had some title, and I believe he had, defective it is true, as it was not authentic and could not transfer the land against a third party having a title duly registered; but he had reason to expect that authenticity would some time follow.\nAbout the year 1896 or 1897, Otis went to one Nolin, agent of the then seigneurs, King Bros., at Cedar Hall in the seigniory and near where the lot of land in question was situated, and according to the custom prevailing at the time, and authorized by the seigneurs, requested Nolin to put his name upon the said lot in the land-register, which he calls livre-terrier, and kept by him for the purpose of recording all applicants for lots of land, which had been properly surveyed. The book is produced and shews that the title of hundreds of settlers in that seigniory originated in that manner. The reason was very simple. There was no notary in the place, as explained by Nolin himself, and it might take several years, even as many as eight or nine, before one of the Messrs. King would go down with a notary to complete the title deeds.\nNolin says that until this deed was obtained no work could be done on the lots. The learned trial judge throws some suspicion upon this statement of Nolin. He calls it \"chose \u00e9tonnante\" and he is right in his appreciation. Nolin is contradicted by every witness who knows something about these transactions, and by the facts. Nolin does not recollect that he gave any warning to Otis, and the latter and also his father, who was with him, both affirm that Nolin did not make any prohibition; that if he had Otis would not have entered his name. And this is plain common sense. How could a settler wait seven or eight or nine years for a notarial title deed to work on his lot, if in the meantime he has to pay all the taxes, school and municipal, church assessments, the opening of roads and all municipal charges, as was done in this case and in all the cases? Nolin is also contradicted by the facts.\nOtis and all the other settlers took possession immediately of their respective lots, their names were entered upon the municipal assessment rolls as proprietors, they built houses, some of them even two, erected barns and\" out-buildings, cleared the lands, put up fences, opened roads and ditches, and this to the knowledge of Nolin, who, as he says, never took the trouble to inquire who were so acting.\nI look upon the entry in the land-register, followed by a complete possession with the knowledge and under the eyes of the local agent, as establishing between the seigneurs and the applicants for lots not only a commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, but an implied promise of sale, which the seigneurs were bound to -carry out whenever requested by the settlers. In such a case, as was decided by the Privy Council in Price v. Neault[11], if the settler refuses or neglects to come and pay the purchase money and take a title, the remedy of the seigneur is not a petitory action, but an action to have a title offered by him confirmed by the competent court of justice, and a condemnation for the payment of the purchase money.\nThe respondent, however, has decided not to take that position. He says to the appellants, \"If you want your land, take it; you may be in the position of a third party who has acquired under a perfect title duly registered ; but pay me fully my improvements.\" Is he going to be deprived of such payment?\nThe respondent when he bought the lot was not moved by any spirit of speculation; he says he had made up his mind to become \"habitant\" ; he took possession of the said piece of land immediately, commenced the enlargement and construction of buildings, the clearing of the land, building of fences, and making of other improvements ; in fact, at the time of the institution of the present action, he had sixteen acres under cultivation and in consequence the said land had increased in value to the extent of the said $800, as found by the said courts.\nThe respondent never applied for a title from Messrs. King Bros. or their successors, but on the 16th June, 1905, the appellants tendered to him a notarial deed or title which he refused to sign because it contained conditions which he had not agreed to. These conditions appear on the face of the deed tendered; but it is sufficient to quote the summary which the trial judge made and which is translated in appellant's factum as follows:\n\"a. Prohibition to cut merchantable timber or pay $2 per arpent.\n\"b. A reserve in favour of the appellants of all land bordering on Lake Metapedia to a depth of 300 feet, and of all land bordering any river, stream or watercourse passing through the lot to a depth of 100 feet on each side.\n\"c. Reserve of all falls and water-powers with a right to the seller to take at any time any land necessary for the exploitation of such water-powers, at a price of $2 per arpent for cleared land, and of $10 per arpent for cleared land. \"d. Reserve of all merchantable timber except such as was necessary for the buildings and fencing and fire-wood of the purchaser.\n\"e. Eight of the vendors to explore the land at any time without indemnity.\n\"f. Obligation of the purchaser to conform to the conditions and fulfil the obligations stipulated in the letters patent granting the seigniory. These are unspecified.\n\"g. Obligation on part of the purchaser to do all fencing between him and the vendor.\n\"h. Right of the vendors to assess on all lands sold by him in the seigniory all sums which he should be called upon to pay for municipal or school taxes or road work, pro rata, to the extent of land sold to each purchaser.\n\"i. Payment by the purchaser of all costs of survey, and obligation of the purchaser to furnish a registered copy of the deed of sale.\n\"j. Dissolution of the sale in the event of the purchaser failing to pay two consecutive instalments of the price, or if he should cut or remove any merchantable timber with the right in such event to the Vendors to retake the land with all buildings and improvements without indemnity.\nIf King Bros. had never promised a title of the said land to the respondent, I cannot understand why the appellants, as their successors and without being asked to do so, should have made the said tender of a deed at $l per acre or, in fact, of any deed. If they considered themselves bound to make a tender why did they not take an action to have the same declared good and valid, and force the defendant to take the title they offered him and pay the price, that is $1 per acre? There is no dispute as to the price.\nNolin admits that that was the amount. At page 65 of the case, line 27, speaking of the lot in question, he says:\nC'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu une piastre de l'arpent, je suppose, comme les autres.\nFrench, at pages 43, 45 and 46, says the same thing. At page 45 he says:\nOui, nous vendons le fonds de la terre pour une piastre de l'arpent; c'est comme cela qu'on fait les contrats, on vend une piastre de l'arpent et nous r\u00e9servons le bois.\nWere the said conditions reasonable? Are such conditions generally imposed by seigneurs granting concessions of land? Were they known generally in the seigniory of Metapedia owned by King Bros? Were they known especially to the respondent?\nThe appellants in their factum say that all the settlers accepted them with the exception of some 22, who have resisted and are to-day defendants in the Superior Court of the district to answer to petitory actions like the one in question in this cause. Moreover, that is only the saying of their agents, Nolin and French, and perhaps also their notary Laberge, but none of the settlers were examined to shew that they accepted those conditions because they understood that they existed from the beginning, or that, as a fact, any such form of deed with such conditions had been adopted by King Bros, at the time Otis entered into possession of the land. Judging from what the respondent swears, and his statement is not contradicted, they were all afraid of these new seigneurs. He says : \"Iis ont peur des seigneurs\" And no wonder when we see that, instead of making one test case which would afford only one appeal, we have before us two appeals entirely similar, and the counsel for the appellants admitted before us that there were many other cases pending in the first court. It is even not impossible that the present appeals will reach the Privy Council. No wonder, I say again, that these poor settlers were frightened.\nThe above officials, Nolin, Laberge and French, do not say that the above conditions were those imposed during the time of King Bros. French, at page 42 of the case, relied upon by the appellants, says that these conditions are to be found in all the titles which have been given for the lands in the seigniory, but he evidently refers only to the time that the appellants were landlords, because he knew nothing of what happened before. The same thing is to be said of Notary Laberge who received many deeds in favour of the settlers who submitted to the exactions of the Terminal Company ; these deeds are all to the same effect, in the same form, and having the same conditions. In fact the notary had a printed form to that effect. Nolin, who should have known what form of deed was given in the time of King Bros., before Laberge was employed, and before the latter resided in the locality, who never mentioned to applicants for entries in the livre-terrier the conditions which regulated the grants, after looking at the form of deed tendered by the appellants to the respondent, says that it looks very much like the deeds granted by King Bros., but he is not sure.\nApr\u00e8s examen (he says) je d\u00e9clare que ce document, exhibit D du d\u00e9fendeur, m'a bien l'air pareil au titre que donnaient les messieurs King. This statement was made by Nolin when he was recalled specially for the purpose, and was the strongest and only piece of evidence given by appellants on the point.\nBut suppose that Nolin had been positive that the deed offered to the respondent was just the same as those granted to settlers by King Bros., will that proof be sufficient? Will it be legal? Is it the best proof of which the case in its nature is susceptible, as required by article 1204 of the Civil Code? Why not produce one of the numerous deeds made by King Bros. to some of the settlers under similar circum-stances, for instance, that of the 8th November, 1894, before B\u00e9rub\u00e9, notary, in favour of one Lefran\u00e7ois, and duly registered as the registry certificate produced shews? It was easy for the appellants to get a copy of the said deed. The onus was upon them to shew that the conditions were the same. For these reasons I attach no importance to the testimony of Nolin, French and Laberge on the point now being discussed as to whether the deed tendered substantially conformed to those used on the seigniory in the time of King Bros.\nBut suppose we had such a proof before us, is it established that the respondent knew or ought to have known, or must be held to have known, anything of the said conditions? He swears he knew nothing about them, except one, that the seigneurs reserved to themselves the merchantable timber beyond the quantity required by the settler for his own use; but that did not trouble him as that timber had been already removed by King Bros., less a small quantity which he had a right to use. His ignorance of a condition would not, it is true, of itself justify his refusal of a deed, but the fact that such a condition was a usual and customary condition must be proved. If no evidence of any special conditions having been customary in the deeds given by King Bros. was given, then the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that there were no such special conditions.\nNolin says that all these conditions were known in the seigniory, but I am afraid his statement in this respect is still more astonishing than the other one . that he prohibited all settlers from working on their lots until they got a deed. It is absurd to suppose that uneducated farmers would be able to recollect and talk among themselves of twelve complicated reservations, some obscure and contradictory, the effect of which would be almost to destroy their right of proprietorship. It is not surprising, therefore, that none of the settlers knew anything of those conditions except about the merchantable timber. That is all that the two Otis and the respondent knew. In fact the latter adds that when he bought the farm in question from his uncle B\u00e9langer, he thought that he was buying the lots subject to the usual conditions in the ordinary seigniories, that is to say, that it was subject to the payment of such dues as might be payable to the seigneurs, or such additional conditions as may have been customary or expressly proved. The former is exactly what the deeds from B\u00e9langer and Otis provide for and nothing else.\nTo resume, I have not a doubt in my mind that the respondent is a possessor in good faith by virtue of a title, the defects of which were unknown to him. These defects consisted in not having an authentic title, which is not the same as being without any title; so much so, that I believe the respondent having regard to the evidence in this case, could at any time have taken an action against the seigneurs King Bros. based upon the promise of sale, that is the livre-terrier and his possession, and demand that they be condemned to give him a title upon the tender of the purchase money, $ 1 an acre, and that in default of so doing, the judgment of the court should stand in lieu of the said title[12]; a fortiori, he can demand the payment of the value of his improvements on the land before he can be evicted, without any deduction for the revenues he derived from the land, having made les fruits siens in consequence of his good faith[13].\nI think this conclusion is supported by the decision of the Privy Council in Price v. Neault[14], and also by many other decisions of the highest courts of the Province of Quebec: Stuart v. Eaton[15]; Ellice v. Courtemanche[16]; Joyal v. Deslauriers[17]; Savoie v. Gastonguay[18]; St. Pierre v. Sirois[19]; Montgomery v. McKenzie[20]. In some of these cases, it was held that even a squatter was entitled to his necessary or useful improvements, if they were made to the knowledge, express or implied, of the local agent of the seigneurs, a point not, however,, involved in this case.\nThe decision of the court of appeal, delivered by Dorion C.J., in Lajoie v. Dean[21], is cited as being contrary to this jurisprudence. I think that this case is entirely different. The possessor or defendant was not the settler who had obtained a permit or location ticket or applied for one or for an entry in the livre-terrier of the seigneur; he had done nothing to give him some reasonable expectation that he will one day have a perfect title; he was in fact a mere squatter, and was allowed his useful improvements, less the fruits and revenues. Had he been, as in this case, a recorded settler upon the lot in question, Chief Justice Dorion would no doubt have arrived at a different conclusion, as he did in Neault v. Price[22], where he held that the seigneur was not entitled to the land, but only to compel the possessor to pass title to it and pay the price for it, a conclusion which the Privy Council approved of.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe same reasons for judgment apply to the appeal taken by the same appellants against Rioux.\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, I express no opinion on the point of jurisdiction raised by the respondent.\nDavies, Idington and Maclennan JJ. concurred with Girouard J.\nDuff J. (dissenting) concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Davidson & Wainwright.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tessier, Fiset & Tessier.\n[1] 38 Can.

This section so amended enacts as follows:\n2. Any person who shall either directly or indirectly, personally or through any servant, employee or agent\u2014\n(a) Kindle a fire and let it run at large on any land not his own property;\n* * * *\nshall be guilty of an offence and shall on summary conviction there-of be liable to a penalty of not less than $25 and not more than $200 and in addition to such penalty shall be liable to civil action for damages at the suit of any person whose property has been injured or destroyed by any such fire. (2) If a fire shall be caused by the escape of sparks or any other matter from any engine or other thing it shall be deemed to have been kindled by the person in charge or who should be in charge of such engine or other thing but such person or his employer shall not be liable to the penalties imposed by this section, if, in the case of stationary engines, the precautions required by section 12 have been complied with and there has been no negligence in any other respect, or in the case of railway or other locomotive engines such engine is equipped with a suitable smoke stack netting and ash pan netting in good repair and kept closed and in proper place and in the case of railway engines where the line of railway passes through prairie country there is maintained, for a distance of at least three miles continuously in each direction from the point at which the fire starts on each side of such line of railway and not less than two hundred or more than four hundred feet therefrom a good and sufficient fire-guard of ploughed land not less than sixteen feet in width kept free from weeds and other inflammable matter and the space between such fire-guard and such line of railway is kept burned or otherwise freed from the danger of spreading fire and there has been no negligence in any other respect.\n(3) For the purpose of ploughing any fire-guard as in the next preceding sub-section provided and of freeing from inflammable matter the land between such fire-guard and the line of railway any railway company is hereby authorized to enter upon any un-cultivated or unoccupied land without incurring any liability therefor provided that no unnecessary damage shall be done.\nAn objection in the nature of an objection in limine which was raised on behalf of the Crown can be more conveniently dealt with after discussing the substantial question presented by the appeal.\nThat question is: Was the Legislature of the North-West Territories competent to pass the enactments of sub-section 2 in so far as they relate to fires caused by the escape of sparks from railway locomotives?\nIt must, I think, be answered in a sense favourable to the contention of the appellant company on the short ground that the enactment of legislation professing to regulate a Dominion railway qua railway was ultra vires of a Legislature, whose powers, it is conceded, were not greater than those of the legislature of a province. That such legislation is by the combined effect of sub-section 29, of section 91, and of sub-section 10, of section 92, of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" ultra vires of a province is, I conceive, not open to dispute. In The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours ([1]), at pages 372 and 373, Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, used these words:\nThe British North America Act whilst it gives the legislative control of the appellants' railway qua railway to the Parliament of the Dominion, does not declare that the railway shall cease to 'be part of the provinces in which it is situated, or that it shall, in other respects, be exempted from the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures. Accordingly, the Parliament of Canada has, in the opinion of their Lordships, exclusive rights to prescribe regulations for the construction, repair, and alteration of the railway, and for its management, and to dictate the constitution and powers of the company; but it is, inter alia, reserved to the provincial parliament to impose direct taxation upon those portions of it which are within the province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes. It was obviously in the contemplation of the Act of 1867 that the \"railway legislation,\" strictly so-called, appli-cable to those lines which were placed under its charge should be-long to the Dominion Parliament. It therefore appears to their Lordships that any attempt by the Legislature of Quebec to regulate by enactment, whether described as municipal or not, the structure of a ditch forming part of the appellant company's authorized works would be legislation in excess of its powers.\nThe principle thus enunciated was applied by the Judicial Committee in the subsequent case of Mad-den v. Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Co. ([2]), at page 628.\nThe real controversy is, therefore, whether or not the legislation in question falls within the category of \"railway legislation\" strictly so-called. It is argued that as the aim of the ordinance is not the regulation of railways, but the preven- tion of prairie fires, it cannot justly be described as \"railway legislation.\" Having regard to the immediate purpose and effect of the enactment it is, I think, not very profitable to dwell upon the ultimate aim of the legislature in passing it. Obviously those parts of it which especially apply to railways\u2014 those that is to say with which we are here concerned \u2014were designed with the object of preventing the spread of fire in consequence of the emission of sparks from locomotive engines. But if the legislature has sought to attain this end by passing measures applicable to Dominion railways, which if effective would in substance be \"railway legislation,\" that Avas plainly, under the authorities referred to, in excess of its powers.\nIt cannot be disputed that the sub-section in question was intended to and does apply to Dominion railways. The legislative authority of the Legislature of the North-West Territories relating to railways, as such, extended to no railways but street railways and tramways, and having regard to the objects of the ordinance, it is plain that the scope of the term \"railways\" as used in it cannot be so narrowed as to exclude railways outside those classes.\nWhat then is it that the legislature has enacted respecting Dominion railways?\nThe section quoted creates an offence which is made up of two elements; the kindling a fire and the letting it run at large on land not the property of the person kindling it. Whether, to constitute the offence, the kindling must be upon such land is immaterial. It is at all events clear that the offence is constituted if it is upon such land that the kindling and the letting the fire run at large both take place. Then the section proceeds to enact in effect that where a fire is caused by the escape of sparks from a locomotive engine it shall be deemed to be kindled by the person in charge or who should have been in charge of the locomotive; that is to say (where the locomotive is on a railway), by the railway company. The net result of these provisions as they effect a Dominion railway company is, that if by the escape of sparks from a locomotive on its line a fire is caused on land not its own and it allows that fire to run at large upon such land, such a company is guilty of an offence, punishable in the manner pre-scribed by the ordinance.\nBut the ordinance proceeds to provide a possible defence for railway companies; and it declares that no railway company shall, although a fire has been caused by such an escape of sparks, be subject to any of the penalties imposed by the section if such company shall shew that the locomotive was supplied with certain specified appliances; that (where the fire has occurred in a \"prairie country\") the land adjoining the railway line was protected by fire-guards of a pre-scribed character on both sides of the line at a prescribed distance from it; and that there was no other negligence.\nNow it will not, I suppose, be doubted that in the absence of negligence or the breach of some specific duty the fact that a fire is caused by the escape of sparks from a locomotive engine in the course of the normal operation of a railway under the authority of Parliament does not render those responsible for the operation of it liable to legal proceedings as for a wrongful or unlawful act.\nThey are in such circumstances not so liable because they have done nothing wrongful or unlawful; and in the case of a fire so caused occurring upon land which is not their property there can plainly, apart from some special enactment, be no duty incumbent upon them to prevent it running at large. Since there is no Dominion enactment imposing such a duty upon companies operating railways under the legislative control of the Dominion it would appear to follow that legislation by a province professing (in the absence of negligence or the breach of some duty imposed by competent authority) to subject such companies to an obligation to prevent the spread of such fires is, as plainly repugnant to the law of Canada permitting the use of steam locomotives upon such railways, ultra vires. And, subject to the effect of the provisions relating to the defences which I have just mentioned, that seems very clearly to be what, on its fair construction, the ordinance in question enacts.\nWhat then is the effect of these last mentioned provisions? Obviously a company having failed to prevent such a fire, occurring in a prairie country, from running at large could not under those provisions escape the penalty imposed by satisfying the tribunal of the faultlessness of its equipment or even by going further and satisfying the tribunal of the entire absence of all negligence in the operation of its line; it must, in order to avail itself of the defence afforded by the ordinance, having shewn these things, still shew, in addition, that it had maintained fire-guards of the character described.\nIn effect, that is to say, the failure to maintain such fire-guards coupled with the failure to do some-thing which the legislature was incompetent to require it to do is made (in the case of a fire arising without blame on the part of the company from the lawful use of equipments sanctioned by law) to consti- tute on its part a punishable offence. I own that such an enactment appears very plainly to me to be an enactment prescribing the maintenance of such fire-guards as adjuncts to Dominion railway lines as a condition of the lawful operation of them in the localities to which it applies; and, therefore, to be an enactment professing to regulate the working (if not the construction) of such lines; and, consequently, to be within Lord Watson's words \"railway legislation strictly so-called\" as used by him in the passage I have quoted.\nThe provision relating to appliances for locomotives is, I think, affected by the same vice; and an examination of the provision relating to \"other negligence\" is, I think, unnecessary. The ordinance authorizes a single defence comprising three elements. It is impossible to eliminate from that defence the requirements relating to fire-guards or to the equipment of locomotives without wholly altering the character of the defence and substituting for that authorized by the legislature one which the legislature has not authorized. That is in effect to substitute for the enactment which the legislature has passed something to which it has not given its sanction and to give effect to this latter as the law of the land\u2014not, I think, a course which a court of law can legitimately take.\nThese considerations would seem also to meet the objection mentioned at the outset. In substance it was argued that, eliminating as ultra vires the pro-visions of the ordinance prescribing regulations upon the subjects of locomotives and fire-guards, the remains of the enactment (that is of sub-section 2), are sufficient to support the conviction. In the view I have just expressed this objection must obviously fail. Another possible objection not taken before us or in the court below, ought perhaps to be noticed. The conviction, being a conviction under the leading enactment of section 2, does not, it might be argued, at all depend upon sub-section 2 for its validity; and cannot, therefore, be invalidated as a result, of the conclusion that the provisions of that sub-section relating to railways are inopera-tive. Since, however, there is an entire absence of the particularity required by law from both the information and the conviction, Smith v. Moody ([3]), we must, I think, before giving effect to such an objection, look at the proceedings to ascertain whether there was before the magistrate any charge or any evidence of an offence of which the appellants could be legally convicted. He could not legally convict them of an offence or legally try them upon a charge under an ultra vires enactment; and, the proceedings shew plainly, that not only there was no evidence of an offence other than an offence under sub-section 2, but, that, otherwise than under it, no charge was, in point of fact, either tried or preferred.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014These are two appeals from the judgments of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, dismissing motions to make absolute rules nisi for writs of certiorari for the purpose of quashing convictions of the appellants for breaches of the Prairie Fires Ordinance of the said Territories as amended by the addition of sub-section 2, in the first session of 1903, and sub-section 3, in the second session of the same year, and of which the material parts are set out below.\nBy section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" we are given jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari, etc. * * * not arising out of a criminal charge.\nI assume, for the reasons hereafter appearing as incident to the main argument, the nature of these regulations is such that they are not an invasion of the field of criminal law.\nThe writ of certiorari issues, unless when applied for by the Crown, only in the discretion of the court. If the writ has been refused in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court section 45 of the same Act denies the right of appeal.\nIf we assume that the judgment was not an exercise of judicial discretion, though it might be said of necessity to be such, and then proceed to consider the appeal, we are confined to ascertaining whether or not on the law and facts the magistrate had jurisdiction to convict. If ultra vires legislation has been found side by side with that intra vires and the latter suffice to maintain, on the facts, jurisdiction, we cannot because erroneous views were put before the magistrates, or the court below needlessly gave a wrong reason, quash the conviction. This is not the possible case of a magistrate failing to weigh the evidence because of his sole reliance on an ultra vires provision.\nThe judgment of the court below is right (though some reasons may or may not be erroneous) if the magistrates had jurisdiction to try the charge. The case of The Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan ([4]), has long been the ruling case upon the subject. Assuming the law to be as expressed at pages 442 et seq. thereof, or even going so far as in the Ontario cases cited to us, to look at the evidence to find if any in support of the conviction, we are confined here to very narrow ground. If we can conclude as a matter of law that a rail-way company incorporated by the Dominion Parliament, pursuant to the powers about to be referred to, is entirely free from liability to submit to anything a local legislature by its enactments may prohibit, and fix a penalty for breach of, then the objection to the magistrate's jurisdiction, involved in these motions, may be arguable.\nThe real questions the appellants desire us to solve may not be involved in this proposition, but they can only be solved in the appellants' favour on this appeal, in case we can so determine.\nI propose therefore to consider the case from that fundamental point of view. The ordinances in question are as follows, and the information is laid, and conviction is, under the original section 2, though argument was addressed to us as to the amendments only:\n2. Any person who shall either directly or indirectly, person-ally or through any servant, employee or agent\u2014(a) kindle a fire and let it run at large on any land not his own property; * * * shall, be guilty of an offence and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable to a penalty of not less than $25 and not more than $200 and in addition to such penalty shall be liable to civil action for damages at the suit of any person whose property has been injured or destroyed by such fire.\n(2) If a fire shall be caused by the escape of sparks or any other matter from an engine or other thing it shall be deemed to have been kindled by the person in charge or who should be in charge of such engine or other thing but such person or his employee shall not be liable to the penalties imposed by this section if in the case of stationary engines the precautions required by section 12 have been complied with and there has been no negligence in any other respect, or in the case of railway or other locomotive engines such engine is equipped with a suitable smoke stack netting and ash pan netting in good repair and kept closed and in proper, place and in the case of railway engines where the line of railway passes through prairie country there is maintained for a distance of at least three miles continuously in each direction from the point at which the fire starts on each side of such line of railway and not less than two hundred nor more than four hundred feet therefrom a good and sufficient fire-guard of ploughed land not less than sixteen feet in width kept free from weeds and other inflammable matter and the space between such fire-guards and such line of railway is kept burned or otherwise freed from the danger of spreading fire and there has been no negligence in any other respect.\n(3) For the purpose of ploughing any fire-guard as in the next preceding sub-section provided and of freeing from inflammable matter the land between such fire-guard and the line of railway any railway company is hereby authorized to enter upon any uncultivated or unoccupied land without incurring any liability therefor provided that no unnecessary damage shall be done.\nThe first question raised by these enactments is as to the power of a local legislature to impose such penalties as are provided for by section 2 as it originally stood.\nThis power, if it exist, rests upon section 92, sub-section 15, of the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" operating within the scope of sub-section 16.\nIf anything in physical conditions confined to or peculiar to a province constitutes any matter, one of a local nature, within the meaning of this sub-section 16, then the danger from prairie fires, (so destructive and so little understood elsewhere in Canada, than in the prairie provinces), surely is one of and needs the application of some legal provisions of a local character, to provide and protect against such dangers.\nThis was not in itself questioned in argument. It was argued, however, in general terms that this legislation was ultra vires. In section 2 as it stood originally there would seem to have been, unless (for the present at all events assumed not to be), trenching upon criminal jurisdiction, an unassailable enactment; and the amending sub-sections 2 and 3, if properly applied and limited to such acts and parties as would be amenable to provincial legislation seem equally unassailable. It was contended, however, that the appellants were, by reason of their incorporation, within the exclusive powers of the Dominion, by virtue of subsection (a) of sub-section 10, of section 92, and section 91, sub-section 29, of the said Act to build and run a line of railway propelled by steam power, freed from any obligation to observe any legislation, on the part of the local legislature, upon the subject of prairie fires.\nIs this broad proposition tenable? If not how far is such a railway company free from anything a local legislature can enact?\nIt cannot disregard any of the license laws of a province, or by-laws of a municipality created by, and so empowered by, a province to pass such by-laws. At least none of such companies have tried to do so, as yet.\nCan it disregard, so as to endanger the existence of towns or of great cities, the ordinary fire limits by-laws thereof, prohibiting the erection, within such limits, of buildings, of forbidden inflammable materials?\nCan it refuse to submit to the inspection by municipal or provincial authorities, acting within the meaning of mere municipal regulations in that regard, of the chimneys in its buildings?\nCan it refuse to conform to the public health requirements demanded by pressing need, to prevent the spread of disease merely because these requirements have been enacted, as they usually are, by local legislatures or some local body constituted by a local legislature for the purpose?\nIn a word, can it, in the negligent doing of the work of building and running or both, befoul the streams, pollute the air, endanger life and property and destroy everything in its path, regardless of all those local regulations that bind every person and every other corporate body in a province?\nIs it a sufficient plea, in answer to such acts and breaches of local regulations, that it has had conferred upon it by the Dominion the corporate power to build a line of railway?\nCould an individual, so empowered, so escape? It is quite competent for the Dominion Parliament to confer upon a single individual the power of building any such railways as in question. What greater rights than any one else could he have, apart from those he might be specifically endowed with, for that purpose? What exemptions from the common burthens can his property, when he has thus acquired it, have, or he from the duties of citizenship, incidental to such ownership, unless such exceptions are expressly given or are necessarily incidental to the due exercise of the powers given him?\nIf a person or corporation so authorized to construct and run a railway can do none of these several, locally forbidden, things, how can he or it rightfully kindle fire by means of improperly running an engine that is built and run, quite regardless of any -care in structure or handling, to provide against such escape of fire, and kindling of fire, as must inevitably follow its use in such a way?\nIf he or it run a road in such a manner surely the power the Dominion has conferred has been exceeded.\nCan it be said, in the absence of any regulation of the Dominion, express or implied, that one so far exceeding the express powers given and so acting has, in some implied way, the high authority of the Dominion Parliament to sanction such acts? In the absence of such sanction how can it be said that such conduct, when carried on within a province, is entirely beyond its legislative control? That without legislative sanction of any sort, such a person or such a corporation, merely by reason of a limited authority given, can run riot and do that which no one else can do is rather a broad proposition.\nIt seems to me, all to resolve itself into a question of the right of the local legislature to enact laws, tending to protect property against the dangers of a local nature, arising from that negligence which the Dominion Parliament never sanctioned nor intended to sanction nor legislated as to.\nCan it be said that because the Dominion has entirely omitted (and I think its delegation of power in that regard until acted on leaves it omitted) any provision in the way of regulating such a mode of exercise of power, it has conferred a right to indulge in unqualified recklessness? Or can it be said that though it has not done so, yet there never can be any legislative effort made elsewhere to prevent such wrong?\nMust it be taken that the right of action each sufferer may or must as a legal result have for the damages sustained be the only legal remedy against such a state of things?\nI think not, and that unquestionably the acts of a local legislature properly providing due and reasonable means for the preservation of property, in the province, from fire, are within the scope of sub-section 16, and in the absence of any legislation by the Dominion Parliament, are enforceable to punish offenders, personal or corporate, that may by his or its, un-authorized acts, endanger such property. The negligent setting of fire on the part of a rail-way run by Dominion authority and letting it run at large, which is the gist of the offence, would be in excess of its power and thus unlawful and has not any colour of Dominion sanction.\nThe accused in order to meet these charges had only to come into court and say that what was done, and is charged, was done by virtue of this high authority, and acting within it, and prove such fact and claim discharge.\nDo the recognized exceptions of the ordinance at-tempt to prevent that? To my mind clearly not.\nThe issues raised were much and needlessly obscured by confusing the validity of the legislation itself which may be intra vires as to almost every line of it properly applied; with the persons or corporations to which it might be applicable in given circumstances, and the different ways in which they might come within its range so far as to render them respectively amenable to the several provisions.\nI think section 2 as it originally stood is quite wide enough, when due regard is had to the word \"indirectly\" (and so reading it as necessarily including negligently), to cover such an offence as is charged against the appellants herein.\nThe word \"indirectly\" can indeed hardly have any meaning here unless so read.\nIt comes then, thus looked at, to a question of the onus of proof at the trial. Can we say that such onus is by any general principle of law made to rest upon him who accuses a railway company of a breach of law to shew that it was beyond all peradventure of excuse or justification, and anticipate the defence possibly existing under the same or another Act, or must not the matter stand as in all other cases that where men prima facie are made to appear, to have offended against law, they must plead and prove such justification or excuse as law and fact may give.\nIt seems to me the prima facie case was made when the company's servant in the course of his employment dropped the coal or hot cinders that kindled the fire which was neglected and that by neglect was let run at large on land not the company's own; and it then devolved on the company to excuse or justify.\nAnd I am of opinion that, whilst it may be optional for a Dominion railway company to avail itself of the exculpatory part of the amending sub-sections and the powers given thereby, there is nothing in them commanding this Dominion railway company or any other railway company to rely for its justification or exculpation on these sub-sections or any of them.\nTo imply otherwise, as to these sub-sections, is to read into them what is not expressed and what would not be imputed to them if used by a sovereign legislature whose powers were unlimited upon trial of a charge laid thereunder for breach thereof.\nTry to frame an indictment on such a supposed Act, and charge that the accused had run an engine without a smoke stack equipped as mentioned; and another count that the company had not constructed fire-guards yet had run engines on its road; and another count combining both such offences.\nCould such an indictment escape being quashed as to every count?\nOr try an indictment thereon for setting a fire by means of so running an engine without a proper smoke stack and without fire-guard and without other negligence. The combination would be fatal.\nAssuming an indictment on such a statute, maintainable by alleging the substance of the offence, and accompanying that with an allegation of such a specific act of negligence as the defective smoke stack or want of fire-guard how could it be claimed that in the absence of offence in regard to defective smoke stacks or want of fire-guard, the accusation of some other offence, for some form of negligence, other than and in the absence of either of these, would not lie? Thus we are brought back face to face with and cannot escape the broad question of negligence.\nThat negligence which I find within section 2 remains also within sub-section 2 as well, when, as here and thus, the moot questions are eliminated.\nA by-law may be attacked by impeaching a conviction thereunder, but because some of its provisions are ultra vires that would not render the whole void, or conviction bad, if a severable part applicable to the offence could be upheld.\nRevenue laws have been found impracticable of uniform application, when sometimes some persons or things and not others, come within their respective range, as the cases of Thomson v. Advocate General (1842) ([5]); Blackwood v. The Queen (1882) ([6]), and others cited in Hardcastle's chapter on \"Territorial effect of Statutes,\" illustrate.\nIn English law we cannot easily find many apt illustrations arising from the need of differentiating in this way so as to apply distributively the words of a statute to meet varying conditions of person or things or places. Sutherland on Statutory Construction (2 ed.), in chapter 9, on \"Statutes void in part\" is replete with that class, of American cases, forming partial illustrations and some strikingly in point as at pages 584 et seq.\nEnglish law when extended to a colony and superseding some local law of the colony no doubt would raise the same sort of question which also must continually arise under the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" as interpreted in the case of The Attorney-General of Ontario v. The Attorney-General for Canada. ([7])\nWhat may be intra vires today may in its application to or range of objects, be found in whole or in part inoperative tomorrow.\nI therefore think even if we assume, without deciding, the smoke stack provision, as an enactment, (though merely a superfluous substitution for, and mere repetition of the common law) to be void, and the fire-guard provision to be also void, and thus discarded, that their elimination of law or fact, from the case only renders the case of negligence the clearer.\nThere are many operations of Dominion companies, either, a steam railway, or banking, or ship-ping, or ferry, or interurban and interprovincial, company, as well as use of a smoke stack or engine, by the first, that may render the wrongful setting of fire and its spread a subject for local legislation.\nIn either of the ways I have suggested the ordinance should be read, and treated, unless I can say as I cannot, that there was no evidence of negligence and hence no jurisdiction, the appeal should fail. The \"Ernfold\" case is, I assume, so entirely within this view of negligence that the court below is unanimous, though, in the way Mr. Justice Wetmore puts it, needlessly resting the onus on the requirements of the ordinance as to smoke stack. The common law required independently of this ordinance an engine of the sort in question to have, as matter of reasonable care,\nsuitable smoke stack netting and ash pan netting in good repair and in proper place.\nI hardly see how unauthorized enactments can change the common law so as to entitle a railway company to dispense with a proper smoke stack, etc. The onus rested upon the company to meet the prima facie case of negligence.\nI confess, however, that the want of knowledge of the localities and points referred to in the evidence in this \"Ernfold\" case renders it to me less clear than it evidently was to those in the court below. I would not, however, interfere as apart from the reason given, resting upon ordinance instead of common law, as to negligence, there seems in substance no ground of complaint.\nThere seems, at first blush, by reason of the way the matter has been treated, more in the \"Mortlach\" case, to reduce that case to a question of the right to impose upon a Dominion railway company the duty of making fire-guards. But, on the evidence the appellants' servants for twenty minutes or half an hour saw the smoke yet failed to move, until the fire kindled in a neglected spot of dry grass on the right of way had spread for half a mile, on other than the company's land and the terror stricken people had gathered to extinguish it.\nAssuming it optional with the company to disregard the provisions for fire-guards, the doing so ren- dered it all the more incumbent upon it to have the section men on the watch, for the setting of fire which sometimes, it is said, is inevitable with the most carefully constructed and managed engine.\nI cannot assent to the suggestion that when fire escapes in such a case and kindles the grass on the company's own ground and spreads therefrom through neglect it cannot be made amenable, in the absence of Dominion legislation, to local legislation, for such neglect.\nNo attack is made upon the form of conviction, in either case, in the grounds taken by the rule nisi, or in argument, and no argument was made on the facts that would enable me to say that the evident negligence was not in either case sufficient in itself, if negligence ever can be the basis of local prohibition in relation to anything a Dominion corporation can do. That it could be so seemed strenuously denied. Indeed that is to my mind the sole issue here.\nI am inclined to hold the opinion that some cases have shewn an undesirable tendency on the part of superior courts, in discharging their duty of keeping, by virtue of the writ of certiorari, magistrates within their jurisdiction, to act as an appellate court.\nWe ought not, I conceive, to encourage such a tendency.\nWe ought only to entertain an appeal of this kind upon the plainest error of the court below, indeed a something clearly indicating usurpation of authority by the magistrate, upheld by the superior court of a province.\nThere are or can be brought about, with a little patience, much ampler means of effectively and authoritatively, defining the constitutional limitations of provincial legislative authority than generally lies within the scope afforded for quashing a conviction upon the return of a writ of certiorari. The issue attempted to be raised by the denial of any power of legislative prohibition, by a local legislature, on the subject of negligence that might include what a Do-minion company may be guilty of, is far more import-ant than it seems at first sight.\nThe fire-guard provision, treated as optional, may be of a beneficent nature, especially in view of section 298 of \"The Railway Act,\" and not objectionable as an attempt at widening the powers of a Dominion corporation to acquire real estate. Possibly, though repudiated in this argument, Dominion companies may have the right, in common with others, to avail them-selves of local regulations to even pull down neighbouring buildings to protect their own from spread of fire.\nI refrain from expressing any unnecessary opinions upon these or other points of law presented for solution, further than that which appears in my dissent from the broad proposition I have set forth above and combatted throughout.\nI call attention to The Canada Southern Railway Company v. Jackson ([8]), in which this court upheld the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of Ontario as binding upon Dominion railway companies as well as other parties in respect of acts of negligence, for which they had not been theretofore liable.\nI have assumed that the exercise of the penalizing power that is given the provinces by the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" is applicable, in proper cases, to negligence, and that it is no greater stretch of authority to apply it to companies deriving their corporate existence from the Dominion Parliament, than to apply the civil remedy acted upon in that case.\nThe exercise of any such power must not exceed any of the recognized limitations, such as criminal law, or come in conflict with the Dominion legislation properly and authoritatively enacted.\nThe Bonsecours Case ([9]) also lends countenance to this way of looking at the matter.\nThe Madden Case ([10]), when the legislation there in question is examined closely, has nothing I can see to do with the matter. It was an attempt to conflict with Dominion legislation and enforce fence building where impliedly, if not expressly, this latter had freed the company from so doing.\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

C.R. 378) affirmed.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding the plaintiff's patent void for non-manufacture and sale as required, by \"The Patent Act.\"\nThe plaintiff patented an invention for pulling candy and brought an action against defendants for infringement. The defence to the action was that plaintiff had, after the expiration of two years from the date of the patent, refused to sell the patented machine, and claimed the right only to lease it or license its use. This defence was maintained by the judgment of the Exchequer Court and the patent declared void, but the court gave judgment for the plaintiff for infringement during the two years the patent was in force, assessing the damages at $125. Both parties appealed to this court.\nOn the case being called counsel for both parties agreed that the cross-appeal should stand over and only the main appeal be argued at this time.\nWalter Cassels K.C, and Anglin for the appellant.\nGibbons K.C. and Haverson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. concurred with the reasons stated by Maclennan J.\nIdington J.\u2014The only question raised by this appeal is whether or not a patentee has, under and by virtue of section 38 of \"The Patent Act,\" forfeited his patent by a refusal to sell any one of his machines made in accordance with his patent.\nThis depends upon the interpretation of sections 21 and 38, sub-section.(a), of \"The Patent Act,\" which read as follows :\u2014\n21. Every patent granted under this Act shall contain the title or name of the invention, with a reference to the specification, and shall grant to the patentee and his legal representatives for. the term therein mentioned, from the granting of the same, the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using and vending to others to be used, the said invention, subject to adjudication in respect thereof before any court of competent jurisdiction.\n2. In cases of joint applications, the patents shall be granted in the names of all the applicants.\n38. Every patent shall, unless otherwise ordered by the commissioner as hereinafter provided, be subject, and expressed to be subject, to the following conditions:\u2014\n(a) Such patent and all the rights and privileges thereby granted shall cease and determine, and the patent shall be null and void at the end of two years from the date thereof, unless the patentee or his legal representatives, within that period or an authorized extension thereof, commence, and after such commencement, continuously carry on in Canada, the construction or manufacture of the invention patented, in such a manner that any person desiring to use it may obtain it, or cause it to be made for him at a reasonable price, at some manufactory or establishment for making or constructing it in Canada.\nIt is contended that the patentee having\nthe exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention\nwould, by selling the machine, transfer that absolute dominion over it that would enable his vendee to resell the same, and by virtue thereof, carry with such re-sale, the right to the use of the same as patented.\nIs that necessarily so?\nIf the patentee has the exclusive right of \"vending to others to be used,\" is there, on the sale of the article, to comply with section 38, not a right to reserve, in the event of a re-sale of the article, the use of the invention?\nThe article may, for what it is worth for any other purpose than to serve the use of the invention as a piece of, say metal or other chattel property, be re-salable, without a transfer of the invention.\nI do not pass any opinion upon this, more than to say, it is, I think, a fairly arguable question.\nI merely refer to the question for the purpose of indicating that a sale may not mean more than a property in the article plus the right to use it as long as the vendee from the patentee should retain it, absolutely as to the material, qualified perhaps as to the quality of usefulness derived from the invention.\nAnother consideration occurs to me and that is it may well be intended within the purview of the statute that the patentee may have a right to adjust the price according as he sells in the one way or in the other. Subject to this, in construing the 38th section, I am unable to come to any other conclusion than that it requires, on the part of the patentee, something more than a mere license to use the invention or mere hiring of a machine made in accordance with the invention to fulfil the terms of the section.\nI cannot read the section as if the words \"or cause it to be made for him\" were out of it. And I cannot see how we can, without putting on them an unusual meaning, give effect to them save as meaning a sale; especially when it is to be observed that it is \"to be made for him at a reasonable price\"\nNeedless to repeat that the meaning to be given , ought not to be an unusual one but the plain ordinary meaning, unless we are constrained by the context to do otherwise.\nNor do I see that the words\nany person desiring to use it may obtain it * * * at a reasonable price are, in their plain ordinary sense, to be interpreted otherwise than as implying a sale.\nIt is the article that is to be obtained and not merely its use, if we read this in the strictly grammatical sense.\nThen, turning to section 21, there is provided therein\nthe exclusive right * * * of making * * * and using and vending to other to be used.\nTo vend means to sell and, except in a strained sense, cannot be made to refer to a licensing or hiring.\nThe using may easily be referred to the personal use or use by a substitute, The \"vending to others to be used\" are words that lend themselves to the purpose I have indicated as within the scope of section 38.\nAnd, when I read the whole, apart from this perhaps too minute and needless dissection of sentences, I cannot help arriving at the same conclusion, that a sale is clearly contemplated by the statute.\nIf one wished an illustration of the need of such provision, it is pretty clearly furnished by the exorbitant rental demanded in this instance.\nObviously an ownership whereby a man could use or refrain from using, from time to time, just as his will' and circumstances or either, free from the inconvenience of a possibly harrassing over-lord's demands for royalty, might require, is what the scope and purpose of these sections and all in the statute aiding in their interpretation required.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff, and a cross-appeal by the defendant, from a judgment of the Exchequer Court, in an action for the infringement of a patent.\nIt was, however, agreed by counsel that the argument should be restricted to the appeal.\nThe defendant denied the validity of the patent, and pleaded that, if originally valid, it had become null and void, at the end of two years from its date, by virtue of section 37 of the former \"Patent Act,\" R.S.C. 1886, ch. 61, afterwards 3 Edw. VII. ch. 46, sec. 4(a), and now R.S.C. 1906, ch. 69, sec. 38(a), because the plaintiff refused to sell the invention, and was willing only to lease it.\nThe learned judge upheld the original validity of the patent; but found infringement by the defendant within two years from its date, and for the infringement he assessed the plaintiff's damages at $125.\nThe learned judge, however, found that the plaintiff refused to sell the patented machine, which was a machine for pulling candy, at any price, thinking he was not bound to do so, but was only bound to lease it; and he declared that the patent had become null and void at the end of two years from its date.\nThe plaintiff now appeals, contending that according to the true construction of the section 37, now section 38, R.S.C. ch. 69, when read in connection with section 20, now section 21, R.S.C. 1906, ch. 69, a patentee is not bound to sell the invention out and out, but only to sell the use of it, or in other words, to lease it.\nI think, however, the language of the two sections does not admit of such a construction.\nThe patent, according to section 20, gives the patentee the exclusive right of making and using, and '\"vending to others to be used, the said invention.\"\nThen section 37 declares that every patent is subject to a condition to be null and void at the end of two years, unless the patentee\nwithin that period or any extension thereof, commence and carry on in Canada, the manufacture of the invention, so that any person desiring to use it may obtain it, or cause it to be made for him, at a reasonable price, at some manufactory or establishment for making or constructing it in Canada.\nThe patented article in question here was a machine for pulling candy.\nI think it is too plain for argument that the obligation here imposed is an obligation to sell, if required, and that the right given to the public is to buy, to acquire the absolute property in the invention. Of course, if any one is content to take a lease, he may, but his right is to acquire the article for his own use, and as his absolute property.\nMr. Cassels asked how the sections could upon that construction be made to apply to a patent for a process. I see no difficulty even in that case, for even there the person desiring to use the invention, is entitled to acquire it absolutely, and not merely to take a lease of it.\nI therefore think the plaintiff's appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blake, Lash and Cassels.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gibbons, Harper and Gibbons.\n[1] 10 Ex.

Amendments by subsequent railway legislation.\nThe legislation by the late. Province of Canada and the Parliament of Canada since the enactment of section 3 of the statute of Canada, 16 Vict. ch. 37, in 1852, has not expressly or by implication repealed the provisions of that section requiring third-class passenger carriages to be run every day upon the line of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, between Toronto and Montreal, on which the fare or charge for each third-class passenger shall not exceed one penny currency for each mile travelled.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada directing that the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada should run every day throughout the length of its line, between the City of Toronto, in the Province of Ontario, and the City of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, at least one passenger train having in it third-class carriages for passenger traffic, and that the fare or charge for each third-class passenger by such train on said portion of the company's railway should not exceed two cents for each mile travelled, and that the company should, forthwith, file passenger tariffs for that portion of its railway embodying said rate.\nSpecial leave for the appeal was granted, in the order appealed from, by the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe circumstances of the case are fully stated by the learned Chief Commissioner Killam in his judgment delivered at the time of the making of the order appealed from, as follows:\nThe Chief Commissioner.\u2014\"This is an application for an order directing the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada to issue third-class tickets at the rate of one penny per mile for each mile travelled, and directing the company to provide at least one train having in it third-class carriages which shall run every day throughout the length of its line.\n\"The application is based upon a clause in the original Act of incorporation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, 16 Vict. ch. 37, passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada in the year 1852. Section 3 of that Act was as follows :\n3. And be it enacted, that the gauge of the said railway shall be five feet six inches and the fare or charge for each first-class passenger by any train on the said railway, shall not exceed two pence currency for each mile travelled, the fare or charge for each second-class passenger by any train on the said railway shall not exceed one penny and one half penny currency for each mile travelled, and the fare or charge for each third-class passenger by any train on the said railway, shall not exceed one penny currency for each mile travelled, and that, at least, one train having in it third-class carriages shall run every day throughout the length of the line.\n\"The portion dealing with the gauge of the railway was repealed by Act of the Parliament of Canada, 36 Vict. ch. 18, sec. 23. None of the remainder of the section has ever been expressly repealed; and, if it still remains in force, the Board is bound, under the general jurisdiction given by section 26 of The Rail-way Act to order and require a railway, company to do any act, matter or thing which such company is or may be required to do under its special Act, to make the order applied for.\n\"The contention on the part of the company is that the provisions in question have been impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation. Section 2 of the special Act was as follows:\nAnd be it enacted, That the several clauses of the \"Railway Clauses'- Consolidation Act,\" with respect to the first, second, third and fourth clauses thereof, and also the several clauses of the said Act with respect to \"Interpretation,\" \"Incorporation,\" \"Powers,\" \"Plans and Surveys,\" \"Lands and their valuation,\" \"Highways and Bridges,\" \"Fences,\" \"Tolls,\" \"General Meetings,\" \"Directors\u2014their Election and Duties,\" \"Shares and their Transfer,\" \"Municipalities,\" \"Shareholders,\" \"Actions for indemnity and fines and penalties and their prosecutions,\" \"Working of the Railway,\" and \"General Provisions,\" shall be incorporated in this Act with the following modification for the ninth provision in the clause of the said Act, with respect to \"Plans and Surveys\" \u2022 * * * and with the further exception of any enactments in the said clauses which may be inconsistent with the express provisions and enactments of this Act, in like matters: And the expression \"this Act\" when used herein shall be understood to include all the clauses of \"The Railway Clauses' Consolidation Act\" which are incorporated with this Act.\n\"The clauses with respect to 'tolls' in the 'Railway Clauses' Consolidation Act 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, were contained in section 14 of that Act, and were, so far as of present importance, as follows:\nTolls shall be from time to time fixed and regulated by the bylaws of the company or by the directors if thereunto authorized by the by-laws or by the shareholders at any general meeting, and shall and may be demanded and received for all passengers and goods transported upon the railway or in the steam vessels to the undertaking belonging * * * \"And all or any of the said tolls may by any by-law be lowered and reduced and again raised as often as it shall be deemed necessary for the interests of the undertaking: Provided that the same tolls \"shall be payable at the same time and under the same circumstances upon all goods and persons so that no undue advantage, privilege or monopoly may be afforded to any person or class of persons by any by-laws relating to the tolls.\" * * * No tolls shall be levied or taken until approved of by the Governor in Council nor till after two weekly publications in the Canada Gazette of the by-law establishing such tolls and of the Order in Council approving thereof. * * * Every by-law fixing and regulating tolls shall be subject to revision by the Governor in Council from time to time after approval thereof as aforesaid.\n\"The same provisions respecting tolls appeared in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 66; and by section 2 of that Act,\nwhen not otherwise expressed, this and the following sections to the one hundred and twenty-fifth shall apply to every railway authorized to be constructed by any Act passed since the thirtieth day of August, 1851; * * * and this Act shall be incorporated with every such Act, and all the clauses and provisions of this Act, unless they are expressly varied or excepted by any such Act, shall apply to the undertaking authorized thereby so far as applicable to the undertaking and shall, as well as the clauses and provisions of every other Act incorporated with such Act, form part of such Act and be construed together therewith as forming one Act.\n\"This legislation of the Province of Canada remained in force until the formation of the Dominion of Canada.\n\"In 1868, in the first session of the first Parliament of the Dominion, was passed 'The Railway Act, 1868,\u2019 in section 12 of which were embodied the provisions just mentioned respecting tolls, with the following addition:\n12. No by-law of any railway company by which any tolls are to be imposed or altered, or by which any party other than the members, officers and servants of the company are intended to be bound, shall have any force or effect until the same has been approved and sanctioned by the Governor in Council.\n\"The last mentioned Act did not in terms repeal the previous railway legislation of the Province of Canada, and it does not appear to have had any application to the Grand Trunk Railway, as the clauses dealing with its application made it apply to railways thereafter to be constructed under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada.\n\"The Act of 1868 remained in force until 1879, when it was replaced by 'The Consolidated Railway Act, 1879.' That Act provided that the provisions of the Act from section 5 to section 34, both inclusive, should\napply to every railway constructed or to be constructed under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, and shall, so far as they are applicable to the undertaking, and, unless they are expressly varied or excepted by the special Act, be incorporated with the special Act, form part thereof, and be construed therewith as forming one Act.\n\"By section 102 of the Act of 1879, the 'Railway Act, 1868,' and various Acts amending it, were expressly repealed; but, again, no mention was made of the Act contained in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada.\n\"In section 17 of the Act of 1879 were again embodied the before mentioned provisions respecting tolls, including the addition made in 1868. By subsection 6,\nAll or any of the tolls may, by any by-law, be reduced and again raised as often as deemed necessary for the interests of the undertaking; but the same tolls shall be payable at the same time and under the same circumstances upon all goods and by all persons, so that no undue advantage, privilege or monopoly may be afforded to any person or class of persons by any by-law relating to the tolls.\n\"By the Act of 1883, 46 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 12, subsection 6 of section 17, of 'The Consolidated Railway Act, 1879\/ was repealed and the following substituted therefor:\nAnd whereas, it is expedient that a railway company should be enabled to vary the tolls upon the railway so as to accommodate them to the circumstances of the traffic, but that such power of varying should not be used for the purpose of prejudicing or favouring particular persons, or for the purpose of collusively and unfairly creating a monopoly, either in the hands of the company or of particular persons, therefore it shall be lawful for the company, subject to the provisions and limitations herein and in their special Act contained, from time to time to alter or vary the tolls by the special Act authorized to be taken, either upon the whole or upon any particular portions of the railway as they shall think fit: provided that all such tolls be, at all times and under the same circumstances, charged equally to all persons, and after the same rate, whether per ton, per mile or otherwise, in respect of all passengers and of all goods or carriages of the same description, and conveyed or propelled by a like carriage or engine, passing only over the same portion of the line of railway; and no reduction or advance in any such tolls shall be made, either directly or indirectly, in favour of or against any particular company or person travelling upon or using the railway.\n\"While section 6 of the Act of 1883 declared certain lines of railway, among others the Grand Trunk Railway, to be works for the general advantage of Canada, and provided that :\n3. Railway companies by this Act brought within the legislative authority of Parliament shall have one year from the passing hereof within which to comply with the provisions of sub-section 5, section 15 of \"The Consolidated Railway Act, 1879.\"\nand section 1 of the Act of 1883, made sections 48 and 49 of 'Consolidated Railway Act, 1879\/ applicable\nto every railway (except Government railways) and railway company subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nthe Act of 1879 was not otherwise made generally applicable to the Grand Trunk Railway or to railways constructed under authority of the Parliament of Canada.\n\"In 1886, upon the coming into force of the Revised Statutes of Canada, another Act, chapter 109, known as \"The Railway Act,' was substituted for the previous general railway Acts of the Dominion. By section 3 of that Act, part one, containing the sections numbered from 4 to 39 inclusive, was made applicable\nto every railway constructed or to be constructed under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada.\npart two was made applicable\nto all railway companies and railways within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, except Government railways;\nand part three\nto all railway companies operating a line or lines of railway in Canada, whether otherwise within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada or not.\n\"In section 16 (included in part one) of that Act were embodied the previous provisions respecting tolls, with the amendment made by the Act of 1883. The general railway Act of the Province of Canada[1] was not among the Acts repealed upon the coming into force of the revised statutes.\n\"In 1888 another Act, known as 'The Railway Act\/ 51 Vict. ch. 29, was substituted for R.S.C. ch. 109, which was then repealed. By section 2, subsection (t), the expression \"Special Act\" means any Act under which the company has authority to construct or operate a railway, or which is enacted with special reference to such railway, and includes all such Acts.\n\"By section 3:\nThis Act, subject to any express provisions of the special Act, and to the exception hereinafter mentioned, applies to all persons, companies and railways within. the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, except Government railways.\n\"By section 6: If in any special Act it is provided that any provisions of any general Railway Act in force at the time of the passing of the special Act is excepted from incorporation therewith, or if the application of any such provision is extended, limited or qualified, the corresponding provision of this Act shall be excepted, extended, limited or qualified in like manner.\n\"By section 223:\nSubject to the provisions and restrictions in this and in the special Act contained, the company may, by by-laws, or the directors, if thereunto authorized by the by-laws, may from time to time, fix and regulate the tolls to be demanded and taken for all passengers and goods transported upon the railway, or in steam vessels belonging to the company.\n\"By section 227:\nNo tolls shall be levied or taken until the by-law fixing such tolls has' been approved of by the Governor in' Council, nor until after two weekly publications in the Canada Gazette of such by-law and of the Order in Council approving thereof; nor shall any company levy or collect any money for services as a common carrier except subject to the provisions of this Act.\n\"By section 228:\nEvery by-law fixing and regulating tolls shall be subject to revision by the Governor in Council, from time to time, after approval thereof; and after an Order in Council altering the tolls fixed and regulated by any by-law, has been twice published in the Canada Gazette, the tolls mentioned in such Order in Council shall be substituted for those mentioned in the by-law, so long as the Order in Council remains unrevoked.\n\"The Act of 1888 was repealed upon the coming into force of the 'Railway Act, 1903 which substituted the Board of Railway Commissioners for the Governor General in Council as the authority having jurisdiction to approve and revise the tolls of railway companies, and which made important changes in regard to railway tariffs. The following provisions of that Act are important:\n3. This Act shall apply to all persons, companies and railways (other than Government railways) within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and shall be incorporated and construed, as one Act, with the special Act subject as herein provided.\n4. Any section of this Act may, by any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, be excepted from incorporation therewith, or may thereby be extended, limited or qualified. It shall be sufficient, for the purposes of this section, to refer to any section of this Act by its number merely.\n5. If in any special Act heretofore passed by the Parliament of Canada it is enacted that any provision of the general railway Act in force at the time of the passing of such special Act, is excepted from incorporation therewith, or if the application of any such provision is, by such special Act, extended, limited or qualified, the corresponding provision of this Act shall be taken to be excepted, extended, limited or qualified in like manner; and, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Act, where the provisions of this Act and of any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada relate to the same subject-matter, the provisions of the special Act shall be taken to override the provisions of this Act in so far as is necessary to give effect to such special Act.\n6. Where any railway, the. construction or operation of which is authorized by a special Act passed by the legislature of any province, is declared, by any special Act of the Parliament of Canada, to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, this Act shall apply to such railway, and to the company constructing or operating the same, to the exclusion of such of the provisions of the special Act of the provincial legislature as are inconsistent with this Act, and in lieu of any general railway Act of the province.\n251. The company or the directors of the company, by by-law, or any such officer or officers of the company as are thereunto authorized by by-law of the company or directors, may from time to time prepare and issue tariffs of the tolls to be charged, as hereinafter provided, for all traffic carried by the company upon the railway, or in vessels, and may specify the persons to whom, the place where, and the manner in which, such tolls shall be paid.\n2. All such by-laws shall be submitted to and approved by the Board.\n3. The Board may approve such by-laws in whole or in part, or may change, alter or vary any of the provisions therein.\n4. No tolls shall be charged by the company until a by-law authorizing the preparation and issue of tariffs of such tolls has been approved by the Board, nor shall the company charge, levy or collect any money for any services as a common carrier, except under the provisions of this Act.\n256. All tariff by-laws and tariffs of tolls shall be in such form, size and style, and give such information, particulars and details, as the Board may, by regulation, or in any case, prescribe. 257. The Board may disallow any tariff or any portion thereof which it considers to be unjust or unreasonable, or contrary to any of the provisions of this Act, and may require the company, within a prescribed time, to substitute a tariff satisfactory to the Board in lieu thereof, or may prescribe other tolls in lieu of the tolls so disallowed, and may designate the date at which any tariff shall come into force.\n2. Any tariff in force (except standard tariffs, hereinafter mentioned) may, subject to disallowance or change by the Board, be amended or supplemented by the company, by tariffs, in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n263. The tariffs of tolls which the company shall be authorized to issue under this Act for the carriage of passengers between points on the railway shall be divided into two classes, namely:\nThe maximum mileage tariff, herein referred to as the \"Standard Passenger Tariff\";\nAnd reduced passenger tariffs, herein referred to as \"Special Passenger Tariffs.\"\n2. The \"Standard Passenger Tariff\" shall specify the maximum mileage tolls to be charged for passengers for all distances covered by the company's railway; such distances may be expressed in like manner as provided herein in respect of \"Standard Freight Tariffs.\"\n3. \"Special Passenger Tariffs\" shall specify the toll or tolls to be charged by the company for passengers in every case where such tolls are lower than the tolls specified in the company's \"Standard Passenger Tariff.\"\n264. A \"Standard Passenger Tariff\" shall be filed, approved and published in the same manner as required by this Act in the case of a \"Freight Standard Tariff.\"\n2. Until the company files its \"Standard Passenger Tariff\" and such tariff is so approved and published in the Canada Gazette, no tolls shall be charged by the company.\n3. When the provisions of this section have been complied with, and except in the case of special passenger tariffs, the tolls in the \"Standard Passenger Tariff\" shall be the only tolls which the company is authorized to charge for the carriage of passengers.\n265. All special passenger tariffs shall be filed by the company with the Board, and published as required by section 274, three days before any such tariff is intended to take effect, or within such time, or in such manner as the Board, owing to the exigencies of competition or otherwise, may require.\nThe date of the issue and the date on which, and the period, if any, during which, any such tariff is intended to take effect, shall be specified thereon.\n2. Upon any such tariff being so duly filed the company shall until such tariff is superseded or is disallowed by the Board, charge the toll or tolls as specified therein, and such tariff shall supersede any preceding tariff or tariffs, or any portion or portions thereof, in so far as it reduces or advances the tolls therein, but until such tariff is so duly filed, no such toll or tolls shall be charged by the company.\n\"Section 214 required every railway company to furnish adequate and suitable accommodation for receiving, loading, carrying, unloading and delivering traffic, and to furnish and use all proper appliances, accommodation and means necessary therefor; and section 253 required it to afford to all persons all reasonable and proper facilities for the receiving, forwarding and delivering of traffic. Section 14, also, gave to the Board power, where the required accommodation was not furnished, to order the company to furnish the same; and an amending Act, passed in 1906, 6 Edw. VII. ch. 42, sec. 23, gave the Board power to order that specific works be constructed or carried on, or specified steps, systems, or methods taken. Section 212, sub-section 2, of the Act of 1903, empowered the Board to make regulations.\nproviding for the protection and safety of the public, of property, and of the employees of the company with respect to the running. and operation of trains by the company,\nwhich provision was amended by the Act of 1906, sec. 18, so as to authorize the Board to make regulations\ngenerally for the protection of property and the protection, safety, accommodation and comfort of the public and the employees of the company in the running and operation of trains by the company.\n\"All of the before mentioned provisions of the Act of 1903, with the amendments, are embodied in the present 'Railway Act,' R.S.C. ch. 37.\n\"It appears to me that neither the Act of 1868, nor that of 1879, nor part one of the Act in the revised statutes, nor the amendments of either except in some particulars not material to the present application) applied to the Grand Trunk Railway Company. By the terms of the principal Acts, they were to apply only to railways constructed under the authority of an Act passed by the Parliament of Canada; and I agree with Mr. Nesbitt's contention that the Parliament of the former Province of Canada was not included. Some amendments extended the application of particular provisions. See. 38 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 4 (1875), and 46 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 12 (1883). This view appears to be supported by the decisions in Scott v. Great Western Railway Co.[2]; Allan v. Great Western Railway Co.[3]; Re St. Catharines and Niagara Central Railway Co. v. Barbeau[4]; Toronto Belt Line Railway Co. v. Lauder[5]; and by the language of Burton J., in Bowen v. Canada Southern Railway Co.[6].\n\"The Act of 1888, was, by its terms, applicable to all persons, companies, and railways within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, except Government railways. These terms clearly included the Grand Trunk Eailway Company and its lines of railway; but this was 'subject to any express provisions of the special Act'; and section 6 further indicated that the special Act was to govern. Further, section 223, which authorized the company or the directors to fix and regulate the tolls, did so subject to. the provisions and restrictions in this and in the special Act contained.'\n\"What I have said is sufficient to dispose of the contention that the amending Act of 1883 affected the limitation imposed by the company's special Act, but it is to be noticed that the powers of the company were, under that Act, to be exercised\nsubject to the provisions and limitation hereinafter and in their special Act contained.\n\"While not material to the construction of the amendment, it is interesting to not\u00e9 that, as shewn by the Hansard report of the discussion in Parliament, the amendment of 1883 was introduced by Mr. McCarthy, M.P., for the purpose of making the provision against discrimination more clear. See Hansard, vol. 13, pp. 141, 558 et seq.\n\"In my opinion, therefore, the clause requiring the running of third-class carriages and limiting third-class fares was not affected by any legislation prior to the Act of 1903.\n\"As has been said, the provisions of the special Act have not been expressly repealed. None of the enactments in The Railway Act, 1903\/ or in the present 'Railway Act.' are explicitly inconsistent with those provisions. The contention on the part of the railway company is that, in effect, those enactments, and particularly the portions relating to tolls and those giving the Board jurisdiction respecting the accommodation, etc., to be furnished by the company, are so inconsistent as impliedly to repeal the provisions of the special Act.\nIf two inconsistent Acts be passed at different times, the last is to be obeyed; and if obedience cannot be observed without derogating from the first, it is the first which must give way.\n\"Per Lord Langdale, M.R., in Dean and Chapter of Ely v. Bliss[7] at page 582. But a 'repeal by implication is never to be favoured.' Per Field J. in Dobbs v. Grand Junction Waterworks Co.[8], at page 158. We ought not to hold a sufficient Act repealed, not expressly as it might have been, but by implication, without some strong reason.\n\"Per Lord Bramwell, in Great Western Railway Co. v. Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway Co.[9], at page 809.\nA later Act of Parliament hath never been construed to repeal a prior Act, without words of repeal, unless there be a contrariety and repugnancy between them, or at least some notice taken of the former law in the subsequent one, so as to indicate an intention in the law-makers to repeal it.\n\"Per Lord Hardwicke L.C. in Middleton v. Crofts[10].\nThe court must be satisfied that the two enactments are inconsistent before they can from the language of the later imply a repeal of an express prior enactment.\n\"Per Byles J. in Conservators of the River Thames v. Hall[11], at page 419; and in the same case Keating J. said (at page 420) :\nI entirely agree with my brother Byles, that, before we come to that conclusion, we are bound to satisfy ourselves that it is a necessary implication.\nWhen the repeal is not express, the burden is on those who assert that there is an implied repeal to shew that the two statutes cannot stand consistently the one with the other.\n\"Per Chitty J. in Lybbe v. Hart[12].\nThe intention to repeal must appear even more strongly where the first provision is contained in a statute of a private or special nature, in which case the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant usually prevails.\nA later statute in the affirmative shall not take away a former Act, and eo potius if the former be particular and the latter be general.\n\"Gregory's Case[13]. The law will not allow the exposition to revoke or alter, by construction of general words, any particular statute, where the words may have their proper operation without it.\n\"Lyn v. Wyn[14].\nThe general principle * * * is that a general Act is not to be construed to repeal a previous particular Act unless there is some express reference to the previous legislation on the subject or unless there is a necessary inconsistency in the two Acts standing together.\n\"Per Bovill C.J. in Thorpe v. Adams[15], at page 135.\nUnless two Acts are so plainly repugnant to each other than effect cannot be given to both at the same time, a repeal will not be implied, and special Acts are not repealed by general Acts unless there is some express reference to the previous legislation or unless there is a necessary inconsistency in the two Acts standing together.\n\"Per A. L. Smith J. in Kutner v. Phillips[16].\nIt is a fundamental rule in the construction of statutes that a subsequent statute in general terms is not to be construed to repeal a previous particular statute unless there are express words to indicate that such is the intention, or unless such an intention appears by necessary implication.\n\"Per Bovill C.J. in The Queen v.. Champneys[17], at page 394.\nIn order to shew that, a particular Act is repealed by a general Act by implication, it is not enough to shew . * * * that the particular Act may have become useless or futile, that is to say, that the subject-matter of the particular Act comes within the terms of the general Act; it must be shewn, as it seems to me, that there are enactments in the general Act, when rightly construed, inconsistent with the maintenance of the particular Act.\n\"Per Brett J. in The Queen v. Champneys17, at page 404.\nNow, if anything be certain it is this, that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special\nlegislation indirectly repealed, altered or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any indication of a particular intention to do so.\n\u201dPer Lord Selborne L.C. in Seward v. The \"Vera Cruz\"[18], at page 68.\n\"See also, the enunciation of similar principles by Sir W. Page Wood V.C., Fitzgerald v. Champneys[19], at pages 53-61.\n\"But all of these statements admit that if the intention of Parliament to that effect sufficiently appears, the later Act should be construed as repealing or varying the former Act, whether special or general, and several cases have been cited in which the courts have adopted such construction. In most of these the circumstances and the nature of the enactments vary so much from those with which we have now to deal, that they do not appear to afford us any material assistance.\n\"In these cases the principles before stated are not contravened; in some they are expressly acceded to. Usually, the decisions turned upon the view taken by the court of particular language or of the scope and intention of the legislation as understood by the court. I will cite from but two of them. In Daw v. Metropolitan Board of Works[20], Willes J. said.\nThe rule of construction of Acts of Parliament as laid down by Vice-Chancellor Wood in The London and Blackwall Railway Company v. Board of Works for the Limehouse District[21], is no doubt a very wholesome one. A subsequent general enactment will not derogate from a prior special enactment. When, as the learned judge says, the legislature has had a special cas\u00e9 in view, and has specially legislated upon it the inference necessary is that it does not intend by a subsequent general enactment not referring to the former to deal with those matters which have already been specially provided for. The rule generalia specialibus non derogant is properly appli- cable to such a case. * * * In the present case, however, the rule cannot apply. * * * The powers conferred by the two (Acts) are substantially, if not strictly, the same. So soon as you find that the legislature is dealing with the same subject-matter in both Acts, so far as the later statute derogates from and is inconsistent with the earlier one, you are under the necessity of saying that the legislature did intend in the latter statute to deal with the very case to which the former statute applied.\n\"And in Great Central Gas Consumers' Company v. Clarke[22], Keating J. said:\nI agree that, where we find in an Act of Parliament a prohibition against a public company exacting more than a prescribed rate, we should require a very clear enactment in a subsequent Act to remove the restriction. But it is equally clear, that if we find in a later Act of Parliament provisions which are utterly inconsistent with.those of an earlier Act, we are bound to give effect to the later provisions.\n\"And in the same case, in error,[23], Pollock C.B. said:\nAlthough that section. is not in terms repealed, yet it becomes a clause in a private Act of Parliament quite inconsistent with a clause in a subsequent public Act. That is sufficient to get rid of the clause in the private Act. Looking at the 19 th section of the general Act, we think it is impossible to read it otherwise than as repealing the 24th section of the private Act. We are bound as well by the plain words of the Act as by the general scope and object of it, and also by the justice of the case.\n\"By section 3 of the Act of 1903, that Act was to be incorporated with and construed as one Act with the special Act, subject as in the general Act provided; and by section 5, in the event of inconsistency between the general Act and any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada relating to the same subject matter, the provisions of the special Act were to be taken to override the provisions of the general Act in so far as should be necessary to give effect to the special Act. These provisions are combined in section 3 of the present 'Railway Act.' This would settle the matter if the special Act had been one passed by the Parliament of Canada, in which case, although earlier than the general Acts, the provisions of the special Act would prevail. But the portion of the Grand Trunk Railway to which the present application refers was constructed under a special Act of the late Parliament of Canada. I have some doubt whether section 6 of the Act of 1903, and the similar section of the present 'Railway Act\/ under which the general Act is to apply to the exclusion of such of the provisions of a special Act of a provincial legislature as are inconsistent with the general Act, were intended to cover the case of a special Act passed by a Parliament of a province before the Union. The definition of the terms 'Legislature of any Province,' and 'Provincial Legislature,' in section 2, sub-section (r) of the Act of 1903, and section 2, sub-section 20, of the present Act, is probably wide enough to include such Parliaments; and the Grand Trunk Railway was declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. That declaration was included in an Act amending the general railway Act, which, though referring specifically to the Grand Trunk Railway and other named railways, may not come within the definition of a 'Special Act.' The Grand Trunk Railway was a railway connecting one province with another, and thus became ipso facto, upon the formation of the Dominion, subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada without a declaration that it was a work for the general advantage of Canada. Section 6 was probably intended to apply to railways constructed under special Acts of provincial legislatures passed after Confederation.\n\"Possibly, however, this may not be important, since section 6 embodies the most important of the before-mentioned. principles, that the prior special Act is repealed or affected by the general Act only where there is inconsistency between them ; and I take it that, under either view, the burden is upon the party asserting it to point out the inconsistency, and that this should be made clear.\n\"The clause in the special Act is two-fold; it limits the fares for different classes of passengers, and it requires the running of third-class carriages. Necessarily, under the latter portion, there was some obligation upon the company to furnish reasonable accommodation; some obligation to give some attention to the comfort and convenience of third-class passengers, even though this accommodation and attention should not be of the same character as required for the other classes. The legislation requiring the furnishing of adequate and suitable accommodation, and the affording of reasonable and proper facilities, could certainly not effect a repeal of the provision for running third-class carriages, nor; in my opinion, can the legislation empowering the Board of Railway Commissioners to make regulations providing for the protection, safety, accommodation and comfort of the public. Whatever the obligations under the present Act or the former Acts, these could not satisfactorily be enforced by the ordinary methods in the ordinary tribunals. The Board of Railway Commissioners was created to be the tribunal for the settling of these and other matters affecting railways and railway companies. It does not appear to me that the creation of such a tribunal was in any way inconsistent with the continuance of the obligation imposed by the special Act, or could effect its repeal or evidence an intention of Parliament that the obligation should be no longer effective.\n\"Under the 'Railway Clauses Consolidation Act' and all the succeeding legislation, down to the Act of 1903, railway tolls were subject to the approval of, and to be altered by, the Governor in Council. This limitation upon the company's powers was embodied in the special Act by reference to the general Act. The jurisdiction of the Governor in Council could exist, therefore, consistently with the limitation as to fares imposed by the special Act, and it does not appear to me that the substitution of the Board of Railway Commissioners as the body which is to ap prove, and which has the jurisdiction to alter, railway tolls, makes any change in this respect. Under the former legislation, all the railway tolls required the approval of the Governor in Council; under the present, it is only the standard or maximum tariffs which must be approved by the Board; and railway companies are authorized to make special tariffs imposing tolls lower than those in the standard tariffs. The practice has been for the companies to obtain approval of standard passenger tariffs, not distinguishing between classes, and to provide for second-class fares by special tariffs. Third-class fares could be provided for in the same way. I do not think that the provisions authorizing special tariffs are necessarily inconsistent with the limitations imposed by the special Act or that they are sufficient to indicate the intention of Parliament that the company, in framing special tariffs, was to be free from such limitations.\n\"I am not informed whether the third-class carriages were at any time used upon the company's railway. To my mind it is clear that the obligation to use them, and to carry at fares limited as in the special Act, continued up to the coming into force of the Act of 1903. I am unable to find in the subsequent legislation any sufficient indication of the intention of Parliament to abolish the system originally imposed upon the company, as having become obsolete or unnecessary.\n\"The imposition of this system was one of the terms and conditions upon which the company was granted its franchise, and it should not readily be presumed that Parliament intended to relieve the company from such terms and conditions.\n\"The application is limited to the portion of the Grand Trunk Railway between Toronto and Montreal, and it is unnecessary to consider whether the obligation ever extended to any other portion of the company's lines.\n\"In my opinion there should be an order requiring the company to run every day, throughout the length of its line between Montreal and Toronto, at least one train having in it third-class carriages, and forbidding it to charge third-class passenger fares at more than two cents per mile, and directing it to amend its special tariffs accordingly.\n\"The operation of this order, however, should be stayed a sufficient time to enable the company to appeal.\"\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and D. L. McCarthy for the appellants. We submit that section 3 of 16 Vict. ch. 37, has been repealed by 46 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 12, which substitues a new provision in the place of sub-section 6, of section 17, of \"The Consolidated Railway Act, 1879,\" expressly authorizing the alteration and variation of the tolls by the special Act authorized to be taken. The words \"subject to the provisions and limitations in the special Act contained\" evidently refer to the requirements of the special Act relating to machinery. They cannot refer to the tolls themselves, as otherwise they would nullify the whole section. Quite apart from the section the railway company could have varied their tolls within the range set by the special Act. The only object of the section must have been to enlarge this range. The learned Chief Commissioner suggests that the Act of 1879 does not apply to the appellants and that, consequently, 46 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 12, being an amendment to that Act, likewise failed of such application. Section 2 of the Act of 1879, provided that, amongst others, the section amended by this section (12) should apply to every railway constructed \"under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada,\" which may, perhaps, be said to exclude the appellants, but, by section 6 of the same Act, their railway was declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and sub-section 2 of this section goes somewhat farther and seems to amount to an enactment bringing the railways mentioned in sub-section 1 within the railway legislation of the Dominion. Sub-section 3 of the section certainly bears out that conclusion and is difficult to explain on any other basis. See also 47 Vict. (D.) ch. 11, sec. 1.\nThe sections which then follow relate to a large number of details of the general railway legislation, and amend a number of the sections of the \"Consolidated Railway Act, 1879,\" which originally applied only to railways \"constructed or to be constructed under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada\" ; so that, apparently, the understanding of the Dominion Parliament, in 1884, was that the application of these sections had then become extended to include all railways within the legislative authority of the Dominion. It is true that the section introduced in 1883 by 46 Vict. (D.) ch. 24, sec. 12, was modified and its application changed. But if the effect of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, was thus annulled, the repeal of the later statute would not again give effect to the earlier one. Hardcastle on Statutes (3 ed.), p. 319, and R.S.C. (1906), ch. 1, sec. 19.\nIn the second place we contend that the operation of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, is excluded by the operation of section 6 of the present \"Railway Act\"[24].\nThe appellants' railway is declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada by 46 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 6. As to 16 Vict. ch. 37, being a \"special Act,\" see R.S.C. (1906), ch. 37, sec. 2, sub-sec. 28, and as to its being passed by the legislature of a province, see R.S.C. (1906), ch. 37, sec. 2, sub-sec. 20. To see the full force of section 6, R.S.C. (1906), ch. 37, compare it with section 3 of the same Act, under which where the railway is incorporated by special Act of the Parliament of Canada, precisely the contrary rule is to prevail.\nIn the third place we contend that the operation of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, is likewise excluded by the operation of the present \"Railway Act,\" taken as a whole; that, in other words, there is a repeal by implication of the provisions of the earlier special Act by those of the later general Act.\nFor the authorities bearing on the question of the repeal of a special Act by implication, see Bramston v. The Mayor of Colchester[25]; Great Central Gas Co. v. , Clarke[26]; Daw v. Metropolitan Board of Works[27]; Duncan v. Scottish North Eastern Ry. Co.[28]; Charnock v. Merchant[29]; In re The Duke of Marlborough's Parliamentary Estates[30]; Brown v. McMillan[31]; Luckraft v. Pridham[32]; Re Cuckfield Burial Board[33] ; Stuart v. Jones[34]; Reg. v. Bridge[35]; Goodwin v. Sheffield Corporation[36]; Parry v. Croydon Commercial Gas Co.[37]; Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Lucas[38], at page 116.\nWhen the present \"Railway Act,\" is examined, provisions are found quite inconsistent with the provisions of the earlier statute. An elaborate scheme for the regulation of the tolls of all railways is set forth in sections 314 to 339. Sections 269 and 284 also provide for the regulation of the accommodation to passengers. Sections 26 and 30 amongst others give the widest powers to the Board to enforce the provisions of the Act. We find in the Act a general uniform system of regulation of tolls and accommodation and complete machinery provided for enforcing the same. This is surely inconsistent in intention and in fact with the rigid special requirements of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3. We submit most strongly that the present case falls within the principle of the authorities above cited and that the earlier special Act must be taken to be impliedly repealed by the later general provisions. As regards the requirement in 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, with regard to the running of third-class carriages, it is to be observed that, if the requirement as to tolls falls, the requirement as to third-class carriages necessarily falls also. The classes are distinguishable, under the statute, only by the tolls. There is nothing in the statute requiring them to be labelled in any particular way. It is quite open to the appellants, once the difficulty as to tolls is removed, to say: \"We regard our 'Pullman' cars as first-class, our first-class as second-class, and our second-class or our smokers as third-class carriages.\"\nWe submit that that portion of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, is no longer in force, which requires that the fare or charge for each third-class passenger by any train on our railway shall not exceed one penny currency for each mile travelled and that at least one train having in it third-class carriages shall run every day throughout the length of the line of the said railway; and that the decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada is wrong and should be set aside.\nCurry K.C. for the respondent, and Bayly K.C. for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nThe portion of section 3 of 16 Vict. ch. 37, dealing with the gauge of the railway was expressly repealed by Act of the Parliament of Canada, 36 Vict. ch. 18, sec. 23. The remainder of the section has never been expressly repealed, and it still remains in force, and it has not been impliedly repealed by the provisions of 46 Vict. ch. 24, sec. 12.\nThe clauses with respect to \"tolls\" in the \"Railway Clauses' Consolidation Act,\" 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, were, by section 2 of the special Act made a part of that Act, and the learned Chief Commissioner finds that the clause requiring the running of third-class carriages and limiting third-class fares, was not affected by any legislation prior to the Act of 1903.\nThe contentions that the operation of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, is excluded by the operation of section 6 of the present \"Railway Act\u201d and by the operation of that Act, taken as a whole, and that there is a repeal by implication of the provisions of the earlier special Act by those of the later general Act are fully answered by the learned Chief Commissioner.\nWe therefore submit that that portion of 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, which requires that the fare or charge for each third-class passenger by any train on the railway of the appellants shall not exceed one penny currency for each mile travelled, and that at least one train having in it third-class carriages shall run every day throughout the length of the line of railway is still in force.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is dismissed for the reasons given by Chief Commissioner Killam in the judgment appealed from.\nGirouard J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree with the reasoning of the learned Chief Commissioner. It seems to me impregnable. I desire only to add one or two observations arising out of new ground taken by the appellants.\nIt is claimed before us that the statute, 18 Vict. ch. 33, of the late Province of Canada, and not 16 Vict. ch. 37, is to be looked to as the incorporating Act of the appellant company. It is said, section 4 of that incorporated the \"Railway Clauses' Consolidation Act\" as part and parcel of the Act of this later incorporation and, thus, the special tariff of passenger tolls fixed by 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, is got rid of.\nA careful consideration of the whole of 18 Vict. ch. 33, and even section four thereof relied on itself, does not support this contention.\nThe general scope and purpose of that Act was to amalgamate a great many lines with that of the main Grand Trunk line, now in question, and the respective companies owning them with the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, incorporated by 16 Vict. ch. 37, and all are to be called The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada.\nThe old order of things remains, in all other respects, unchanged. There is the old corporate body, the old corporate name, the old main line extended, and all under the same old charter with some new powers and properties, but with the old right to provincial subsidy and the corresponding duty to discharge which was imposed as consideration for granting the subsidy.\nAgain, it is contended here that the Board of Railway Commissioners have, by virtue of the \"Railway Act of 1903,\" obtained greater powers over the tolls than had the Governor in Council, under the \"General Railway Clauses' Consolidation Act,\" 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 15, in force when the appellants became incorporated.\nI think a comparison of sub-section 5, of section 14, of that Act with section 251 of the Act of 1903 will shew there is not much ground for this contention.\nEven if clearly so, as I think it is not, what would there be in such a state of things so inconsistent with as to repeal the obligations created by 16 Vict. ch. 37, sec. 3, on which the Board has proceeded to make the order complained of?\nStill less argument, if possible, as against the order in question, is there in the new powers of the Board over the kind of cars and accommodation generally to be furnished by the company in operating its lines. Is it to be supposed that the company, if free from any supervision whatsoever, would have persisted to the present hour in using only tallow dips, such as obtainable in A.D. 1852, and insisted in depriving third-class cars of all the decencies and utilities for preserving some of the decencies of life, in travelling?\nIf such be held by the company to be part of its inalienable right, I fear it cannot maintain that precious right in face of this new statute, but, all the same, I have no doubt the Commissioners can and will, if it become clearly part of their duty to give directions as to third-class cars, properly discriminate between the several classes of cars each class of fare may entitle a passenger to enter. They may possibly improve them all a bit as compared with 1852 without hurting any one or even the company.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014After a very full and careful consideration of the legislation enacted during the many years which have elapsed since the passing of the special Act of 1852, and the reasons and arguments which were addressed to us on behalf of the appellants, I am of opinion that the appellants have failed to shew that the enactment in question has been repealed either expressly or by implication.\nI agree with the statement of reasons for judgment given by the Chief Commissioner of the Railway Board, and cannot usefully add anything thereto.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDuff J. concurred in the reasons stated by Chief Commissioner Killam for the judgment appealed from.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

Judgment appealed from (11 Ex. C.R. 103) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action was brought for infringement of letters patent of invention granted to one Perry for making electrically welded wire fabric, such as is commonly used for fencing, which the defendants were alleged to have infringed, and claimed an injunction and damages. The defendants had caused to be made for themselves and had used a machine for making wire fences, the wires being automatically welded at their intersections by electric currents. In a number of details, this machine was different from the machine described in the plaintiffs' patent, but it produced the same products in a similar manner with devices of a similar character.\nBy the judgment appealed from, it was held that, giving a broad construction to the plaintiffs' patent as being the first in which a successful method was devised and pointed, out for the manufacture of wire fences and other like products in the manner described therein, the defendants had been guilty or infringement, and an order was granted for the injunction and the confiscation of the machine used in the infringement.\nJ. B. Clarke E.G. for the appellants. In addition to the cases cited in the report of the case in the court below, we refer to Harrison v. The Anderston Foundry Co.[2]; Tyrell on Patents (4 ed.), 284-6; Bunge v. Higginbottom[3]. As to what constitutes invention, see 22 Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law (2 ed.), pages 279 to 281. Simple and obvious modification of a former device is not invention, 22 Am. & Eng. Encyc, of Law, page 303. As to what constitutes novelty, see same volume at page 306, and, as to mechanical equivalents, see same volume, pages 289, 291 and 292.\nA patent must be construed with reference to the prior state of the art to which the invention belongs and limited to that which is new: Am. & Eng. Encyc. of Law, pages 300 and 410.\nWalter Cassels K.C. and A. W. Anglin for the respondents. There is no difference in substance bell tween the two claims, a machine responding to one necessarily responds to the other, and, inasmuch as the defendants' machine embodies claim. 35 of their patent, it likewise embodies and infringes claim 40 of the plaintiffs' patent.\nIt is clear that no anticipation, of the plaintiffs' patent has been shewn; there are vital differences between it and the previously patented machines, all of which proved inoperative and were never put in practice for manufactures such as are now in question. No skilled mechanic could, in view of the previous patents, have manufactured such products without invention.\nWe refer to Smith v. Goldie[4]; Proctor v. Bennis[5]. As to what constitutes a combination, see Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[6], at pages 574-577; Proctor v. Bennis5. Novelty is defined by Lord Hatherly in Cannington v. Nuttall[7], at page 216. See also Saxby v. Gloucester Waggon Co.[8], and Bischoff v. Wethered[9].\nA prior inoperative patent, one which does not disclose a practical machine, and which has never been brought into actual operation cannot anticipate or invalidate a subsequent patent: Betts v.

Anglin for the respondents The judgment of the court was delivered by\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants seek relief from a judgment of the Exchequer Court declaring they had infringed a number of claims in a patent and restraining further like infringement.\nIt seems that the patentee under whom respondents' claim had invented and patented in the United States a wire fence of longitudinal wires crossed at right angles by stay wires at regular distances apart and that these crossing wires had been welded by some electric process of welding at each of the crossing intersections.\nThis product never was, even if in itself patentable, patented in Canada and hence cannot be claimed as covered here by any patent.\nSome time afterwards the same patentee constructed and had patented a machine for making the said wire fence.\nIt is urged that it must be inferred that this was disclosed by the product in question.\nI cannot see how that necessarily follows. The original product may have been the result of the use of one or more crude appliances that implied nothing requiring inventive faculties to produce.\nNothing is disclosed to shew that anything at all like the machine.now in question was used in making that product.\nThen the patented machine, now in question and under which respondents claim, is attacked here, on the grounds that Perry the patentee was not the true inventor, that there was no novelty in it, that it was not useful, and that there was no invention or subject matter. The mode of attack is this. It is shewn that many of the parts of the machine were, in some other ways, used as machines or parts of machines used in welding processes. It is not pretended that any of them ever were used to construct such a wire fence as that produced by this machine. It is not pretended that they ever were all combined to form any single machine for any purpose. Nor can I find that any such combination of the major or substantial parts were ever before combined for any similar process of any kind.\nIt is urged, however, that each part having been in use and well known to ordinary men skilled in electric welding as having been in use for some purpose or other therefore any such man having his attention turned that way by seeing the wire fence product would have been able to and without any further knowledge could have framed such a machine as that now in question.\nIt is not at all self-evident or even probable to my mind that such is the case.\nIt may have been quite susceptible of proof by some such ordinary man saying so, but none has said so.\nMr. Bain, the only witness for the defence, says a great deal, but does not touch this point or vouch his belief that looking at the matter as an ordinary man might he could construct such a machine. This seems fatal to the contention.\nMoreover, it is pretty evident that even Mr. Perry, who does not seem to have been an ordinary man, did not find it quite so easy a task as the argument implies, or he would have done so long before.\nThe grounds of the objection taken seem on this evidence utterly to fail. The specifications and claims do not in words specifically claim the invention, as a combination, but as at present advised I think enough is expressed to shew that such is the nature of the invention.\nIt is not pleaded that the specification or claims therein were insufficient, and besides there are some things that enter into this combination that I am not quite clear were anticipated in any prior invention.\nI think the attack on the respondents' patent has upon the evidence and within the pleadings before us failed.\nAs to the appellants' machine, it seems on the evidence to be as a whole substantially the same as that of the respondents. It seems rather an unsuccessful attempt to differentiate but only, unfortunately for the attempt, by means of mechanical equivalents.\nI think the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs,\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Clarke, Bowes & Swabey.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Blake, Lash & Cassels.\n[1] 11 Ex.

At the same time each maker signed an application for ten shares. The payee and T., the assignee of his patent of invention, induced W. to discount these notes and received a portion of the proceeds, part being retained by W. in payment of debts due him from these two parties. On the trial of actions by W. on the notes the evidence of T., who had absconded, was taken under commission and he swore that the form of application signed by the respective defendants had been shewn to W. before the notes were discounted. W. denied this and swore that he had been told that the notes were given in payment of stock held by the payee.\nHeld, that the evidence of W., on whom the onus of proof rested, could not be accepted; that the whole testimony and attendant circumstances shewed that W. suspected that the proceeds of the notes belonged to the company; and, having discounted them without inquiry as to the right of the payee and T. to receive these proceeds, he was not in good faith and could not recover.\nAPPEAL from decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff\u2019s several actions were dismissed.\nThe plaintiff took action on eleven promissory notes procured and discounted as stated in the above head note. The trial judge dismissed all the actions and in every case but one his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. Each of the other ten defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBlackstock K.C. and McMullen for the appellant.\nShepley K.C. and Peter McDonald for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent brought eleven actions, each founded upon a promissory note of one thousand dollars, or several such notes to that amount, made by the respective defendants and indorsed by one Tree, the payee, to the respondent, who claimed to have thus become the holder in due course within the meaning of section 56 of the \u201cBills of Exchange Act.\u201d\nThe defendants respectively set up the several defences that the notes were obtained by fraud, and upon an agreement or agreements in fraud of which they were negotiated and, that the respondent had notice or knowledge thereof, and, indeed, was a party to the fraud, and that he was not a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value.\nThese actions were all tried together and Mr. Justice Clute, the learned trial judge, found the alleged fraud, and that the notes obtained thereby were put off in fraud of the understanding upon which they had been made.\nThe learned trial judge expressly finds he could not give credit to the evidence of the respondent; and, not having other evidence on which to rely for the proof of respondent\u2019s good faith necessary to support his actions, dismissed them.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario, by a majority from whom Mr. Justice Meredith dissented, reversed this latter finding of the learned judge, but did not disturb the findings of fraud, and allowed the appeals, except in one case. The other defendants have each appealed and these appeals were heard together.\nThe counsel for the appellants was stopped by this court from fully elaborating his argument as to the fraud, counsel for respondent conceding that it seemed hopeless to expect to reverse the findings of the courts below in this regard, though reserving his right to make some remarks upon that branch of the case in his argument, as I understood him, necessarily incidental to the questions of notice and of good faith.\nI am content to say, therefore, in that regard, that I have not heard or read anything to shake the findings of the learned trial judge on the first branch of the case.\nI think the results arrived at by the learned trial judge on the other branch are also correct and the conclusions of the Court of Appeal erroneous.\nTree, the payee, held patents as the inventor of a rotary engine or improvements thereon or both and induced, in 1897, or thereabouts, the appellants and the respondent, with numerous others, to join him in forming an incorporated company, of which respondent was the vice\u2011president, to experiment with and place on the market, if possible, the engine manufactured in accordance with these patents. The venture failed hopelessly. Notwithstanding this, in March, 1901, a Dr. Taylor, seemingly impressed with the future possibilities of these patents, anticipating their acquisition from the company and the formation of a new company, agreed with the respondent that if he would help him by advancing him $900, he would return on or before the 1st of May, then next, or so soon thereafter as certain parties or a company to be formed had acquired said Tree patents, $1,800 to him, Wilson. As part of this agreement, Taylor also agreed to secure the re-payment of two certain notes made by said Tree to Wilson, due in October, 1898, for $200 and $1,000, with interest thereon at the time of transference of the said \u201cTree patents\u201d to said parties.\nThis is interesting as part of the history of the dealings in question and of the light it sheds on the respondent\u2019s relations with Tree and Taylor, when consideration has to be directed to the question of good faith and the price paid them for the notes, of which price a goodly part springs out of this agreement.\nOn the 9th October, 1901, by another agreement of that date, purporting to be between Taylor of the first part and the several persons whose names were subscribed thereto, being directors in the Tree Rotary Engine Company, of the second part, but only executed by Taylor, and respondent signing as vice-president, there seems anticipated some exchanging of stock in the old company for some in the expected new company. And Dr. Taylor agrees to pay $500 at the expiration of two months and $15,500 within a year from date, with interest at 6% until paid. The Tree Company wanted but could not get security from Taylor and, as their secretary puts it, to make best of a bad bargain, were content to take his own notes. Perhaps the best evidence of his financial standing was the enormous price he agreed to pay for an advance of $900 as shewn above. The secretary swears he was worthless. I infer that if the patents were no good, no one expected him to pay. If the patents were any good he could easily pay. Wilson throughout these dealings shews his gambling spirit in pursuit of gain.\nA new company, named the Imperial Engine Company, with Dr. Taylor as president, was incorporated shortly after this, and had a secretary and head office or seat at Brantford. Its alleged capital was $600,000. A good deal of this was given to Tree and Taylor, or Tree, for nothing, unless I assume the interest in the patents. There were other generous allotments or donations of stock that left stock of the company to the amount of $185,000 to be disposed of to get cash to carry on business with, if any one would buy. I cannot find that any one did so though canvassing therefor had taken place. One thousand shares of this stock for disposal were in the hands of the company\u2019s solicitor in Brantford as trustee for the company. He, quite properly, drew up a form of application to be used in canvassing purchasers for such shares.\nThen Tree and Taylor, being directors, after this state of helplessness had continued for four years, got some of these forms supplied by the solicitor and, without authority, ventured amongst the farmers of Oxford, near to the Village of Tavistock, and, on the one hand, it is said, tried to sell stock, and, on the other hand, it is said, made these forms of sale a blind to procure notes by fraud, but, in either cases, in doing so, made the statements and proposals found false and fraudulent upon which and by means of which the notes in question were got.\nThe notes of Rowe, T. Pearson, S. Pearson, Bollert, and Palliser, for a total of $5,000, were supposed, theoretically, to have been given, and if given at all, on any basis of honest business, so far as respondent is concerned, were given for stock in the Imperial Engine Company to be issued by the company to them in response to the following form of application:\u2014\nNov. 29th, 1905.\u2014I hereby apply for ten shares of stock of the Imperial Engine Company, Limited, of a par value of $100 each, at $100 per share.\nI hereby agree to accept the shares and to pay for them as follows:\u2014A promissory note dated Nov. 29th, 1905, payable four months after date for $1,000.\nI hereby appoint W.H. Hammond of Brantford, Ont., my attorney to subscribe my name in the stock book of said company and to accept the shares which may be allotted to me and to register me therein as holder of such shares.\nIt is alleged by appellants, however, that this application was, in each case, a something that followed a giving of the note which was supposed to be for entirely another purpose.\nI assume, however, for the present, for the sake of argument so far as this respondent\u2019s good faith is concerned, each note founded on this form of application and the obvious design of the instruments.\nThese five thousand dollars\u2019 worth of promissory notes of absolutely solvent men, well known to and old neighbours of respondent, were, on the evening of the 1st of December, 1905, a day or two after their dates, taken by Tree and Taylor to respondent and offered by Tree to him for sale. At first he demurred by saying he had no money. But when Tree suggested to him he could keep out of the proceeds part of the old indebtedness of Tree and Taylor, due to him, his cupidity induced him to entertain the proposal and stretch a point. They agreed on the basis of $2,000 cash and the balance of $3,000 made up of old notes or credits on old notes and agreements for which Tree or Taylor or both were liable, and $250 discount charged on $5,000 for four months. The greater part of this old stuff was absolutely worthless. As to the other part of it, the securities may have been good in part or indifferent. If good, one is disposed to ask, why so long lying uncollected, overdue in the hands of a gentleman who seems to have had a proper appreciation of the earning power of money? Noting that, I pass to what happened anent the basis upon which the new notes rested.\nThe above set out form of application for stock, drawn by the company\u2019s solicitor, was shewn to the respondent who understood that the notes were given for such stock or sales of stock. He made the remark that, having seen the notes with the other information Mr. Tree had given him, his position was different than if he had seen the notes only.\nIt is quite clear that men selling as agents of the company, stock to be issued by the company, were bound to account to the company, and had no right to sell the notes given for such stock as if it had been their own, and, if any shadow of authority existed by reason of their directorship to realize on the notes for the company, they had no colour of right to appropriate the notes to pay their own debts. The transaction, on its face, was such as no honest man should have or, unless unusually dense, could have entertained for a moment. Even the respondent squirmed at it.\nIt seems idle to talk of good faith in such a con- nection. We are invited to accept his denial as conclusive or to suppose that the man Tree, in reply to his observation, said: \u201cOh, well, it is of no consequence for we (Tree and Taylor) have stock of our own allotted to us from which we can satisfy them, and will, and the form of application is a matter of no consequence from that point of view.\u201d\nThere is not a title of evidence directly to support this supposition. The respondent and his solicitor, by their evidence, have swept away any respectable chance to rest on such a work of imagination, if one felt inclined to do it. There appears, speaking of the first batch of notes, in one of respondent\u2019s examinations for discovery, the following:\u2014\n80. Q.\u2014What did he say? A.\u2014He asked me if I would discount all these notes. I told him I had not enough money to discount all these notes, at the time. He talked on; he told me these people had been in Cassel and he had a Tree engine running there and they were pleased with the way it worked and that they had taken stock in the Imperial Engine Co. As a matter of fact, he said he sold them part of his stock which he had acquired from the engine company and he told me these notes were given in payment of stock.\n81. Q.\u2014Did you make any inquiry yourself; did you ask him any questions? A.\u2014No. I did not. He simply told me these people gave these notes in payment of some stock.\n82. Q.\u2014From first to last, during your negotiations with Tree for the purchase of these eleven notes, did you make any inquiry as to the circumstances under which the notes were given? A.\u2014No. I did not.\n83. Q.\u2014From any person? A.\u2014No.\nIn another examination for discovery, the following appears, relative to the first batch of notes:\u2014\n94. Q.\u2014Did Taylor shew you any papers? A.\u2014No.\n95. Q.\u2014Did you see any applications for stock? A.\u2014No.\n96. Q.\u2014What did they tell you? You were a little suspicious about the notes and asked him how he came to get them? A.\u2014I don\u2019t know whether I asked them. It strikes me I asked them if these people owed this money and they said they did.\n* * * * *\n140. Q.\u2014Did you ask them if these men owed Tree the money? A.\u2014I think I asked them if they had been selling these people some stock. That is the recollection I have of it;\u2014if they had been selling some more stock;\u2014I don\u2019t just remember the exact words.\n141. Q.\u2014Apart from that, did you make any further inquiry in regard to these notes; this second batch of notes on the 18th? A.\u2014No.\nAnd in the same examination, is the following:\u2014\n289. Q.\u2014You understood the proceeds of the $11,000 of notes was not to go in the company? A.\u2014I didn\u2019t know where it was going.\nOn the trial he said, as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Did you know what steps were being taken in regard to the stock of the Imperial Engine Company, in December, 1905?\nA.\u2014No. I had no knowledge of the stock of the Imperial Engine Company.\n* * * * *\nQ.\u2014What did you say when he shewed you these notes?\nA.\u2014I looked at them and came to the conclusion that these people had been investing some money in the engine, and I asked him if they had, and he told me that they had, that they had bought some stock in the company\u2014some of his stock\u2014and these notes were given in payment of it; that is about the extent of it.\nAnd, as to the second batch:\u2014\nQ.\u2014When you and Tree and Taylor went up, what did you do?\nA.\u2014He produced the notes and I looked at them, and he told me he was agreeable to discount them as he had others\u2014practically the same thing; I asked him if these people had been buying stock, or if he had been disposing of some stock, and he said that he had, and that these people had given him the notes to pay for it.\nIs it possible to draw any inference such as we are asked from these varied statements? If he never heard of nor saw any certificates of stock or application therefor, how does he, instinctively, as it were, bend his statements as to whose stock was being sold? Passing meantime this from Wilson to that from Taylor, and let us see which of them is telling the truth.\nOf course, the question of the credibility of Taylor and of Taylor\u2019s story are vital points here. Counsel for the respondent wisely abstained from any general attack on him.\nSo far as one can judge from reading the depositions, Taylor, though possibly to be looked on as if (whether so or not in fact), a fugitive from justice, in his manner of speech, even making due allowance for the educated man\u2019s greater power than the other of discriminating expression seems to be inherently a more truthful witness than the respondent.\nTaylor was examined under a commission in New York and his story is that, on the 1st December, 1905 a form of application for a stock certificate, amongst other things, was exhibited by Tree to Wilson, of which the\noriginal form was prepared by Mr. Sweet of Harley & Sweet, Brantford, the form of which that one was a copy.\nCan there be any mistake on such a point? One man says there was nothing said relative to the stock business but mere loose expressions about selling stock or taking stock. The other says this was thus explained.\nHis examination was led on after that for a page or so by the counsel to the next day\u2019s happenings in the solicitor, Mr. McDonald\u2019s office, when the witness was asked, in reference to Wilson being present, and the following takes place:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Who spoke first; who was talking; what did Mr. Wilson, the plaintiff, say? A.\u2014Well, in order to understand that, it would be necessary to go back to the evening before.\nQ.\u2014As to something the plaintiff said? A.\u2014As to something the plaintiff said, because that was the object of my being there. Q.\u2014Let us hear what he said then? A.\u2014That, having seen the notes, with the other information Mr. Tree had given him, his position was different than if he had seen the notes only.\nQ.\u2014That was said on the night of the 1st? A.\u2014The night of the 1st. \u201cNow then, Mr. Wilson said, it would be necessary to have proper applications which would be legally holding on the parties making the notes.\u201d\nThe witness may be right or wrong as to Wilson being present on the 2nd of December, in Mr. McDonald\u2019s office. He may be right or wrong as to the date when there. In this sense the Court of Appeal is clearly right, I think, in treating this sort of discrepancies as of no consequence.\nBut there is a significant part of this story interjected, so to speak, which I have underlined above, that is of the very utmost importance. Yet, I say with respect, the Court of Appeal overlooked it and that was the source of radical error in that court.\n\u201cAs to something the plaintiff said because that was the object of my being there\u201d\u2014means what? It means, as clearly as noon-day can make it, that what took them to Mr. McDonald\u2019s office was the remark of respondent the night before, when he pointed out the unfortunate mistake he, Tree, had made, in using a form that clearly implied he was selling stock for the company and not his own stock. It is impossible, on the evidence before us, to find any plausible reason for going to Mr. McDonald, or any one else, at that time anent the form of the application, unless what sprang from respondent, or from the conversation with him, on the evening of the 1st of December. The solicitor, McDonald, on his evidence says, as follows:\nQ.\u2014Did they both come to see you\u2014Tree and Taylor?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014What did Tree say to you? A.\u2014That he wanted me to draw up some applications for stock, and laid a blank form before me and asked me what I thought of that. I said \u201cI think this is an application for stock in the Imperial Engine Company.\u201d Then he said, \u201cIs it right?\u201d and I said \u201cIt is all right as an application to the Imperial Engine Company.\u201d He said, \u201cIs it all right for me?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat have you to do with it? I understood you were in the Tree Engine Company,\u201d and he told me that the Imperial had taken the place of the old Tree Rotary Engine Company, and also told me he was selling his own stock in the Imperial Engine Company.\nEvery word of this bears the mark of a recent impression that had dawned on Tree. How did it come to him, if not in the way Taylor\u2019s story tells? Taylor does not try to account for it or attach importance to it. Yet it is there. And how does Taylor come to tell it? Counsel did not seem to see the import of it at the moment. Nor had it the import then that it came to have months later, when McDonald swore to that which fitted into it exactly as if made to do so and thus confirms this story of Taylor. Yet Taylor is not a prophet. The impression he had of Wilson being present when the document was laid before McDonald is possibly correct. It matters, in one way, little whether so or not, but there is this to be observed, that, if he is, as Wilson and McDonald positively swear, in error, then there is removed the last vestige of reason for supposing that he can have imported into his story what Wilson said in McDonald\u2019s office and confused what happened after the dealing was completed with what had happened before in Wilson\u2019s house.\nThe incident of consulting on the very point, and at the very time noted, a new solicitor on such a point is confirmatory of Taylor\u2019s story and must stay so till some explanation not yet forthcoming is found.\nThe story of respondent has, interjected into it twice, an alternative or amended form so as to represent Tree as saying he was selling his own stock. By the time respondent is thus reciting these variorum editions of the story, he had, I infer, no doubt learned what was done anent the change of form and supposed ratification of what was done under the first form.\nIn light of a knowledge of that curious history one can see reasons for the changes of expression used by respondent in his evidence.\nIf the story had been the simple one of Tree selling his own stock and getting notes for the price thereof what need for the use of a form of application? All he had to say was,\u2014here is a transfer of my certificate of stock.\nIf that in truth had been all that ever was presented to the respondent\u2019s mind as the fact, then his amended and amending mode of expression would not have appeared. The many ways it is expressed are, I conclude, but ways of getting away from what he had found an uncomfortable mental position.\nIt was because the story had not the native simplicity he would have us believe that his mind and expression thereof vary so very much.\nIt might need an application form, for use in selling stock to be issued by a company, but if a man only offered his own stock for sale to such well-known, absolutely solvent people as in question, it puzzles one to know its honest use. Tree and Taylor had the actual power to command the present issue to them out of that allotted to themselves.\nIf Wilson for whose benefit, at least in part, the supposed ratification was done knew of it, so much the worse for him.\nIt was one thing to subscribe for stock and pay therefor money that would find, if not stolen in pass- ing, its way into the treasury of a company to erect a factory or promote its business, and quite another to pay for wind or water, money that would inevitably go into the pockets of Tree or Taylor or Wilson.\nIt is not of the slightest consequence whether the meeting leading up to this took place on the 2nd or on the 6th December, nor of who paid or was charged the fee.\nCan one, in face of these facts and this train of reasoning, find it possible to say that what Wilson, on whom, as is conceded, the onus of proof rests, has said, satisfies or ought to satisfy us that he acted in good faith?\nCan we believe him when he swears or tries to swear or lead us to believe that the unsecured debts of Tree and Taylor were of any substantial value? Can we believe that he who held between $6,000 and $7,000 against such financially worthless people did not constantly keep an eye on their exploiting the engine business on which his only hopes of recovery depended? Can we believe that he who put up $900, 12th March, 1901, and took an agreement from Taylor for that consideration to have returned to him $3,000 (and interest on part of that in arrear for years before) lost all interest in the hopes he had of receiving the balance of this $3,000 (on which only $400 paid at expected time), and interest, so completely, that he was as ignorant of the fortunes of the rotary machine and its patrons, corporate or otherwise, as he would lead us to believe, though his entire hopes in regard to the balance of that $3,000 and interest as well as other large sums clearly rested on their efforts to make a success of the engine?\nHis call on Tree, in London, at Easter, 1905, was not followed up but is indicative of some interest in him and his engine. Parson\u2019s case also gave him reason to be reminded.\nCan anybody believe his pretence of faith, in 1905, in the engine as a successful piece of mechanism, apart from faith in it as a basis for the flotation of stock? His own language on seeing the first notes expresses the source of his hopes. If he believed in the engine company, why did he not subscribe for stock? What became of the anticipatory provision for such being allotted him and fellow directors is not clear.\nThen, it is said, that if he did see the application and say what Taylor imputes to him, how can one suppose he would discount the notes? How can any one say he would not? How can any one imagine he would be stayed thereby? It all depended upon the chances of gain, and the amount of gain, proportioned to the risk; and that loomed large in his eye, whilst this seemed trifling; especially if he knew of the plan of ratification, and had faith in it.\nIf his oath is worth anything, he could not suppose he ran any legal risk. He might not care to have the old neighbours know he was getting for himself their money or credit, that was to have built a factory. Indeed, when he did refer later to the subject, he said to one of them he had paid $10,000 for these notes, when he had only paid $5,000. As to his notions of the law on the subject, this is what he says:\u2014\n229. Q.\u2014You knew a man in purchasing notes, although he might give value, unless he dealt in good faith could not acquire a good title to the notes as against people who had been defrauded?\nA.\u2014I didn\u2019t know that.\n230. Q.\u2014You thought If you gave value for the notes it didn\u2019t matter whether you took them in good faith or not? A.\u2014That is the impression I had.\n* * * * * 317. Q.\u2014Your idea of the law was that it didn\u2019t matter what you gave for these notes as long as you bought them and paid something for them? A.\u2014No. I didn\u2019t know; I had no idea of the law; I supposed that, when I bought these notes and paid for them, they were mine.\n318. Q.\u2014It didn\u2019t matter what you gave for them? A.\u2014I didn\u2019t know as. I had that in my head.\n318. Q.\u2014You never gave that a thought at all? A.\u2014Just a question as between myself and Tree what I paid for them.\n319. Q.\u2014The question of amount had nothing to do with the nature of the transaction? A.\u2014It didn\u2019t strike me that way.\nNot much trouble for one holding such opinions to go far astray.\nIt occurred to me as possible that the second and third transactions might be severable from the first. I cannot, on consideration, see how.\nThe law is laid down in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[1], as follows:\u2014\nOf course; if there is anything to arouse suspicion, to lead to a doubt whether the person purporting to transfer them is justified in entering into the contemplated transaction, the. case would be different, the existence of such suspicion or doubt would be inconsistent with good faith. And, if no inquiry were made, or if, on inquiry, the doubt were not removed and the suspicion dissipated, I should have no hesitation in holding that good faith was wanting in a person thus acting.\nThe suspicion once aroused, remained unremoved, I have no doubt, and respondent\u2019s eyes and ears shut, did not prevent the suspicion from continuing. The remarkable exclusion of all knowledge entering his mind on the subject may, under the circumstances, be attributable to a recognition of its danger even though he asserts, as he does, as to his idea of the law.\nThere have been a good many things pressed upon us to shew the remarkable conduct of the respondent in this regard. Some of them were of trifling import, some of none at all, but others and a great many taken together form an unpleasant picture of a man bent on getting gain, no matter at whose expense, and constitute some proof that he purposely abstained from making inquiry.\nI think the appeals should be all allowed with costs, here and in the court below, of each to the respective appellants, and the learned trial judge\u2019s judgments dismissing the actions with costs be restored.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.T. McMullen.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Peter McDonald.\n[1] [1892] A.C. 201, at p. 223.\n"}

The water in a pipe connected with the system froze and, the pipe having burst, damage was caused by the consequent escape of water.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (14 Ont. L.R. 166) Davies J. dissenting, that the damage did not result from freezing and the insured could recover on the policy.\nIn the Hawthorne case the majority of the court dismissed the appeal on the same grounds. The policy in that case was sent to the brokers who had applied for it on behalf of the assured shortly before, and the latter did not see it until the loss occurred. Held, per Davies J. that the contract of insurance was not contained in the policy, which the assured had no opportunity to accept, but in what took place between the brokers and the agent of the insurers on applying for it and, as the latter informed the brokers that damage by frost was insured against, the insured could recover.\nAPPEALS from the decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgments at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs in each case.\nBOULTER CASE.\nThe plaintiffs, Boulter, Davies & Co., applied for and obtained a policy insuring property in their business premises as follows:\u2014\n\u201cThe Canadian Casualty and Boiler Insurance Company does insure Boulter, Davies & Co. * * * against all immediate loss or damage to the property of the assured * * * situate in that part of the premises occupied by the assured as described hereafter and caused during the term of this insurance by the accidental discharge or leakage of water from the automatic sprinkler system now erected in or upon the entire building at 24 Front Street West, Toronto, occupied by the assured.\u201d\nAmong the conditions of the policy was the following:\u2014\n\u201cThis policy of insurance does not cover loss or damage resulting from the explosion, rupture, collapse or leakage of steam pipes or steam boilers; nor resulting from any interruption of business or stoppage of any work or plant, nor resulting from freezing.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs claimed for a loss under this policy resulting from the discharge of water from a pipe connected with the sprinkler system which had burst after the water in it had frozen. The sole question to be decided on this appeal was whether or not the loss had resulted \u201cfrom freezing\u201d under the above condition. The trial judge held that it did not, and the Court of Appeal was of opinion that the exception as to freezing was not expressed in terms clear enough to relieve the insurers from liability.\nWatson K.C. for the appellants. Both clauses of the policy must be given effect to if possible and there is certainly no repugnancy. See German Fire Ins. Co. v. Roost[2].\nThe loss clearly resulted from freezing within the terms of the condition. German Fire Ins. Co. v. Roost2; Cole v. Accident Ins. Co.[3]\nBlackstock K.C. and Rose for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I think this appeal must be dismissed for the reasons given in my judgment in the appeal of the same company against Hawthorne[4].\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014At the close of the argument of this case I was strongly of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the true construction of the contract of insurance upon which the action was brought being that damage resulting from frost causing the bursting of the pipes was not insured against. I agree in the conclusions of Mr. Justice Maclaren of the Appeal Court and in his reasons for them.\nAs I understood my view was not in accordance with that of the majority of the court, I have gone carefully over the policy and considered its meaning from every standpoint presented by the judgment appealed from and by counsel at bar. The result has been strongly to confirm my first impressions. I shall state very shortly the reasons.\nThe policy in its formal or insuring part professes to insure the plaintiffs against\nall immediate loss or damage to the property of the assured and described in the schedule herein given * * * and caused during the term of this insurance by the accidental discharge or leakage of water from the automatic sprinkler system now erected in or upon, etc.\nIf these words formed the contract without limitations I should not suppose any one would entertain a doubt that they covered losses occasioned by the accidental discharge of water from the sprinkler system whether resulting from frost or otherwise.\nThere, however, follow a number of \u201cconditions and agreements\u201d which are as much a part of the policy and the contract as the insuring clause quoted above.\nThe one material to this appeal reads:\u2014\nThis policy of insurance does not cover loss or damage resulting from the explosion, rupture, collapse or leakage of steam pipes or steam boilers, nor resulting from freezing, etc., etc.\nThe construction put upon the policy by the court below seems to me to add to the words of the insuring part of the policy\nloss or damage caused by the accidental discharge or leakage of water from the automatic sprinkler system\nthe words \u201cwhether caused by freezing or otherwise\u201d instead of reading into such insuring clause the very words of the condition itself\nthis policy does not cover loss or damage resulting from freezing. If the words of the condition relating to freezing are transferred bodily from the conditions where they appear to the insuring clause of the policy and read with it as in order to construe it properly must be done there would seem to be less danger of going astray as to the real meaning.\nTo my mind the construction adopted places a liability upon the company which they have expressly contracted against. How it can be held that the loss or damage to plaintiffs\u2019 goods did not \u201cresult from freezing\u201d where it is admitted that the bursting of the pipes and the consequent discharge of water upon the goods was directly caused by frost is more than I can understand.\nIt was urged, I thought somewhat faintly, that the provision\nthis policy does not cover loss or damage * * * resulting from freezing\nwas ambiguous and might be intended to provide against loss or damage not caused to the goods insured by the accidental discharge or leakage of water from the sprinkler system as expressed in the policy but which might be caused subsequently to the goods in the contingency of the water freezing on them after they had been soaked by the accidental discharge or leakage insured against.\nSuch a construction does not commend itself to my mind as a reasonable, fair or just one, but seems somewhat forced and unreasonable.\nIt was not the extent or character of the damage which might be caused by the accidental discharge of the water which the provision in the condition contemplated but the exclusion of any liability arising from frost: \u201cThis policy shall not cover loss or damage resulting from freezing.\u201d The policy itself expressly provided in its insuring clause only for the immediate loss or damage to the property insured. Not for any remote loss caused by the happening of some subsequent event and which had no necessary relation to the accident insured against. When it said the policy did not cover loss or damage resulting from freezing I understand it to mean that while it did cover all immediate damages or loss caused by any accidental discharge or leakage of water it did not cover any damage or loss caused by such discharge or leakage if such discharge or leakage was the result of frost. The insurance was against the accidental bursting of the pipes. They were to be liable for all damages caused by that unless such accidental bursting was caused by frost. If so caused the company was not to be liable.\nTo hold that the words of this exemption exclusively apply to some additional damage which frost might cause to the wetted goods after they had been so wetted by the accidental discharge of water from the pipes and that they do not apply to frost causing such accidental discharge does not commend itself to my mind as a fair, reasonable construction of the contract or one which the parties to it contemplated.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nHAWTHORNE CASE.\nIn this case a policy issued similar to that in the former appeal and a claim was made for a loss resulting from the same accident. The policy, however, which was procured through a broker, was not de- livered to Hawthorne & Co. until after the loss, though the broker had received it before, and the former claimed that they were not bound by its terms and relied on a verbal contract with the agent of the defendant company when the insurance was applied for.\nThe broker instructed to procure the insurance went to the head office of the company where he found in charge the accountant to whom he made the application. He asked the accountant if the policy would cover \u201cfrost damage\u201d and was told that it would. The accountant gave him an interim receipt in the following terms:\u2014\nNo. 3568. Premium, $30.00.\nSPRINKLER LEAKAGE INSURANCE INTERIM RECEIPT OF THE, CANADIANCASUALTY AND BOILER INSURANCE COMPANY, HEAD OFFICE,TORONTO, CANADA.\nReceived from D.D. Hawthorne & Co., of Toronto, the sum of thirty dollars, being the premium for 12 months from date, for Insurance to the extent of five thousand dollars on merchandise,... dollars on machinery,... dollars on buildings at 24 Front St. West, Toronto, against loss or damage to the property of the assured in consequence of the accidental discharge or leakage of water from the Automatic Sprinkler system erected in or upon the premises above named.\nThe application for this insurance is subject to the approval of the Directors, and if same be rejected the above premium will be returned to the address given on the application, less the proportion for the time the risk has been in force.\nDated twenty-third day of December, 1905.\nCountersigned by A.G.C. DINNICK,\nJ.M. GOUINLOCK, Managing Director.\nAcct.\nThe formal application was delayed for some days but the policy was eventually issued though it did not reach the plaintiffs until after the loss.\nAt the trial judgment was given for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal affirmed such judgment and held that the plaintiffs could recover on the verbal contract. The defendants appealed. Watson K.C. for the appellants.\nBlackstock K.C. and Rose for the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014In this case I agree that the contract of insurance is to be found in the verbal application of the plaintiffs and the receipt issued in pursuance thereof to them. The policy containing the clause exempting the company from liability for damages resulting from frost was not in accordance with the terms of the application and receipt. Under the circumstances in which the policy came to the hands of the plaintiffs just before the loss occurred, I agree that they cannot be held as having accepted it or as being bound by its terms. I concur in dismissing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J. concurred with Maclennan J.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal fails.\nI agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the question of the payment of the premium.\nIn my opinion the policy ought to be construed according to the contention of the respondents.\nThe operative part of the policy and the condition must be read together.\nThe insurance is against all immediate damage to the property of the assured, whether their own or in trust, in a certain warehouse, caused by the accidental discharge or leakage of water from the sprinkler system.\nIt is clear that the damage which occurred is expressly within this language. It was caused by water resulting from accidental discharge or leakage from the system. That discharge or leakage of water was the immediate cause of the damage.\nThen the condition declares that the policy is not to cover damage, that is, having regard to the operative words, immediate damage, resulting from various things, and among others resulting from freezing. Now while in a certain sense the damage did result from freezing, the immediate damage arose, not from freezing at all but from the accidental discharge or leakage of water. There was no immediate damage to the goods from freezing. The freezing was a remote, not the immediate cause of the damage to the goods. The frost congealed the water in the pipe leading to the sprinklers. The expansion of the water at the moment of freezing opened the seam of the pipe, and allowed the discharge or leakage of the water which did the damage, but the frost or ice never came near the goods and did them no immediate damage. The only immediate damage done by the frost was the bursting of the pipe.\nIn expressing this opinion, I do not desire to be understood as dissenting from the other grounds upon which the judgment is rested in the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. concurred with Maclennan J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Watson, Smoke & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Beatty, Blackstock & Fasken.\n[1] 14 Ont.

The lease to S. extended only until 1st May, 1907; it gave him no right to a renewal, and he had no other interest in the building. He sold a half interest in the lease to two persons with whom he formed a partnership in the hotel business, which was carried on till 1904, when the partnership terminated by his death, and the defendants were appointed administrators of his intestate estate. The affairs of the partnership were settled between the defendants and the surviving partners who became transferees of the business, exclusive owners of the lease and sole occupants of the hotel for the unexpired term. The defendants gave notice to the plaintiffs to cancel the agreement on 1st May, 1907, and, on that date, the surviving partner\u2019s obtained a new lease of the premises from the owners of the building under which they continued in occupation and possession.\nHeld, that, after 1st May, 1907, the new tenants of the hotel were not assigns of S. and, consequently, the defendants were entitled to cancel the agreement for electric lighting by notice according to the proviso. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, in the result, affirmed the judgment by Anglin J., at the trial, dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs.\nThe action was for damages for anticipatory breach of a contract entered into between the plaintiffs and the late F.X. St. Jacques, (in his lifetime the lessee of the \u201cRussell House\u201d in the City of Ottawa), providing for the supply of electric light and power to that hotel, the respondents being sued as his administrators. The agreement in question is dated May 10th, 1902, and provides for a supply of electrical energy for ten years. A clause of the agreement was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cProvided that if after the expiration of five years from the first day of May, 1902, the said party of the second part (St. Jacques) his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns is neither owner nor tenant nor occupier of the said hotel whether by himself or together with another or others, then either party shall be at liberty to cancel this contract by giving notice in writing to the other party.\u201d\nOn 1st March, 1904, St. Jacques entered into partnership with two persons named Mulligan, under the firm name of \u201cSt. Jacques & Mulligan,\u201d and assigned to his two co-partners a one-half interest in his lease of the hotel, his liquor license, and the furniture, supplies and tenant\u2019s fixtures in the hotel. No assignment of the lighting contract was made to the partnership, but the electric company continued to supply electricity to the \u201cRussell House,\u201d and the rental therefor was paid by the partnership until St. Jacques\u2019s death, and for some time afterwards by the Mulligans. On 21st December, 1904, St. Jacques died, and the respondents were appointed administrators of his estate. The partnership between St. Jacques and the Mulligans terminated with St. Jacques\u2019s death, and the winding up of the partnership affairs resulted in litigation and an arbitration between his administrators and the Mulligans; but all matters in dispute between them were settled by an agreement dated the 16th May, 1906.\nOn the 5th June, 1906, respondents, as administrators, gave notice to the electric company, in accordance with the proviso for cancellation contained in the lighting contract, to cancel the contract at the expiration of the five years from the 1st May, 1902, (i.e., on the 1st May, 1907).\nThe lease of the hotel expired on 1st May, 1907, and the Mulligans obtained a new lease to themselves from the owners of the building.\nThe result of the appeal depended upon whether or not the Mulligans were \u201cassigns\u201d within the meaning of the clause quoted, as the respondents, claiming that they were not, assumed to cancel the agreement at the expiration of the five years. The appellants claimed that they were entitled to have the agreement run on for its full period of ten years, or to have damages equivalent to their loss of profit for the latter five years.\nGeo. F. Henderson for the appellants. The word \u201cassigns\u201d must have one of three meanings:\u2014(a) Assigns of the business generally; (b) or of the lease; (c) or of the lighting agreement. The appellants contend that the Mulligans were and are \u201cassigns\u201d of the agreement. It was a business asset of St. Jacques, and a very important one, and when the Mulligans paid him for a half interest in his business, they clearly purchased one-half of all his business assets.\nThe word \u201cassigns\u201d comprehends all those who take either immediately or remotely from or under the assignor in whatever manner. It includes the assignee of an assignee in perpetuum, the heir of an assignee or the assignee of an heir. It also includes executors and administrators. Am. and Eng. Ency. (2 ed.) vol. 3, tit. \u201cAssigns.\u201d It follows, therefore, that even if St. Jacques did not himself assign an interest in the agreement to the Mulligans, the assignment to them by his administrators made them his \u201cassigns.\u201d\nThe attempted partial assignment by the administrators is ineffective to cut down the rights of the appellants for two reasons. In the first place the contract is not a separable one, and in the second place, the intention being frankly to endeavour to evade the lighting agreement, it was in fraud of the rights of the appellants and to that extent ineffective. De Mattos v. Gibson[1].\nThe agreement in question makes no attempt to discriminate between assigns of the whole agreement and assigns of a part of it. The Mulligans are certainly assigns of the agreement, whether in whole or in part. They became entitled to all its benefits, and incurred all its liabilities, though they protected themselves as to the disputed five years by taking an indemnity from the respondents. It seems obvious that if the parties had contemplated the possibility of St. Jacques being able to cancel the contract by executing a partial assignment of it, their purpose might have been set out in much more simple language. All that would have been necessary would be a contract between the appellants and St. Jacques personally, without reference to his personal representatives or his assigns.\nJ.F. Orde and Powell for the respondents. There are only two possible constructions to be placed on the word \u201cassigns\u201d in the clause in question; either (a) \u201cassigns\u201d of the lighting contract and of St. Jacques\u2019s rights thereunder; or (b) of the term granted by the lease to St. Jacques of the \u201cRussell House.\u201d The judges of the courts below all agree that, in either case, the respondents were entitled to cancel the lighting agreement at the expiration of five years from 1st May, 1902.\nThe Mulligans are not and never were \u201cassigns\u201d of the lighting contract within the strict meaning of the term. Friary Holroyd and Healey\u2019s Breweries v. Singleton[2]; Grove v. Portal[3]; Bryant v. Hancock[4]; South of England Dairies v. Baker[5]; Leys v. Fishing[6].\nEven if, prior to the 1st May, 1907, they might be regarded as \u201cassigns,\u201d the assignment to them was only of a partial interest, and after that date they ceased to be \u201cassigns,\u201d having no further interest whatever in the contract. If the word \u201cassigns\u201d refers to the lease, then, since the 1st May, 1907, no \u201cassigns\u201d of St. Jacques are tenants of the hotel. His lease expired on the 1st May, 1907, and the Mulligans occupy the hotel under a new lease.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by MACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI think the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Osier admit of no answer.\nThe appellants had an agreement with St. Jacques, lessee of the \u201cRussell House,\u201d to supply him with electric lighting and power for use by him in the \u201cRussell House,\u201d for ten years from the 1st of May, 1902.\nSt. Jacques\u2019s lease extended only to the first of May, 1907, and he had no right of renewal, or any interest in the hotel beyond that period. And unless he, or his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, acquired some further interest in the hotel, either in fee or for a term subsequent to the 1st of May, 1907 the lighting agreement would, after that date, be a burden, instead of a benefit, to him or his estate.\nTo meet that contingency, a proviso was inserted in the agreement, that if, after the expiration of five years from the first of May, 1902, that is after the expiration of the St. Jacques lease, which was to expire on that day, St. Jacques, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, is neither owner nor tenant nor occupier of the hotel, by himself or together with another or others, then either party might cancel the agreement by a notice in writing.\nSt. Jacques might have purchased the hotel in fee, or he might have got a new term; and, in either case, might have held it or might have sold or assigned it, or in the event of his death, his heirs or executors or administrators might have taken possession of the hotel or have assigned it. In any one of these cases, St. Jacques, or his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, might have been owner, tenant or occupier after the expiration of five years. None of those things happened. St. Jacques sold a half interest in his lease, and the whole, with a small exception, of the hotel furniture, to two persons named Mulligan, and formed a partnership with them in the hotel business, which was carried on until 1904 when St. Jacques died intestate, and the respondents were appointed administrators of his estate.\nThe death of St. Jacques terminated the partnership, and its affairs were all settled between the Messrs. Mulligan and the defendants, the Messrs. Mulligan becoming the exclusive owners of the lease and the sole occupants of the hotel, for the remainder of. St. Jacques\u2019s term.\nThe St. Jacques lease expired on the 1st day of May, 1907, when the Messrs. Mulligan, in their own names, and for their own sole benefit, obtained a new lease from the owners of the hotel, and have continued the occupation and possession thereof ever since.\nThe argument for the appellant is that the Messrs. Mulligan are in possession since the 1st of May, 1907 as the assigns of St. Jacques, within the meaning of the proviso.\nTo me it seems too clear for any argument that this is not so.\nThey are tenants and occupiers after the 1st of May, 1907, but by a title entirely independent of St. Jacques, or his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, and not otherwise.\nSome observations were made upon the use of the word heirs in the proviso, as being useless or inappropriate. But I think the word was neither useless nor inappropriate. St. Jacques might have purchased the hotel absolutely, before the expiration of his term, and in that case he or his heirs or executors, admin- istrators or assigns might have been in possession at the expiration of five years from the first of May, 1902, in which case the notice terminating the agreement could not have been given.\nI think the use of the word heirs makes the meaning of the proviso absolutely clear, in the sense which I have attributed to it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacCraken, Henderson, McDougal & Greene.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gormully, Orde & Powell.\n[1] 4 DeG. & J. 276.\n[2] (1899) l Ch. 86; 2 Ch. 261.\n[3] (1902) 1 Ch. 727.\n[4] (1898) 1 Q.B.716; (1899) A.C. 442.\n[5] (1906) 2 Ch. 631.\n[6] 12 U.C.Q.B. 604.\n"}

Corbin (Defendant).Appellant;\nand\nEvan Thompson, Andrew P., Horne and Charlotte G., Musgrave (Plaintiffs) Respondents\n1907: November 20; 1907: December 13.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nBreach of contract\u2014Measure of damages\u2014Notice of special circumstances\u2014Collateral enterprises\u2014Loss of primary and secondary profits\u2014Costs.\nThe plaintiffs sold defendant a boiler to be used in a mill to be set up in connection with his lumbering operations and guaranteed its efficiency for that purpose. When delivered, it proved inefficient, and, while necessary alterations and repairs were being made two months elapsed during which the defendant was deprived of the use of his mill, was obliged to keep a gang of men idle and under expense for wages and board, and, in unsuccessfully attempting to carry on his operations, temporarily hired another boiler. On being sued for the price of the boiler, the defendant counterclaimed for damages and, at the trial, was awarded $427.11, being $277.11 for wages, board and expenses incurred in consequence of the failure of the boiler to satisfy the guarantee, and also $150 for damages for the \"loss of the use of the mill.\" By the judgment appealed from the first item for wages, etc., was rejected and the item for \"loss of the use of the mill\" only allowed.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies and Maclennan JJ., Idington J. contra, that, as the loss of primary profits directly resulting from the breach of the contract only should have been allowed, the item of $150 for loss of anticipated profits should be rejected as being merely secondary, speculative and uncertain; but that the item assessed by the trial judge in respect of the wages, board and other expenses should be allowed, as they were direct and immediate results of such breach. Duff J. was of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment by the trial judge restored.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed with costs and the judgment at the trial restored to the extent of $277.11, but, in the special circumstances of the case, no costs were allowed in respect of the appeal to the court below.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia which varied the judgment at the trial and ordered judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiffs for the balance of their claim, after setting-off certain damages, with costs.\nThe special circumstances of the case, in so far as they are material on this appeal, are stated in the judgments now reported.\nMellish K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice concurred with Davies J.\nDavies J.\u2014The dispute in this appeal arises out of a certain claim for damages made by the defendant. He had bought an engine and boiler from plaintiffs with a guarantee or assurance that they should be complete and in running order for the purpose of cutting lath-wood at his camp in the woods a few miles from one of the stations of the Intercolonial Railway.\nIt is admitted that the engine as delivered was out of repair and unfit for use when delivered, and the sole question is the measure of damages for the breach of the contract.\nIt seems clear that the plaintiffs knew the purposes for which the defendant wanted the engine and boiler, and also clear that a suitable engine could at any time have been hired by defendant to take the place of the unsuitable engine delivered at from $40 to $50 a month.\nAbout the 16th November when the engine and boiler were set up it was found that the engine would not work and some time afterwards plaintiffs were informed of the fact, and, later on, the engine was sent by plaintiffs' instructions to Truro, N.S., to be repaired. It was not returned to defendant so as to enable him to have it set up and running until the 16th January. The exact dates of these events, with the exception of the last one, are not, in the circumstances, important. Soon after the defendant found the engine would not work he temporarily hired a second-hand engine from one Crease at $20 a month. This did not work satisfactorily either, being too large for the boiler, and was returned by defendant on the 20th. When the plaintiffs instructed defendant to send the engine to Truro for repairs, they were at the same time (5th December) informed by defendant of the hiring by him of the Crease engine. Defendant says:\nI went to Halifax the next morning to tell Musgrave about it. I saw Mr. Musgrave. I told him exactly what happened, and I also told him in order to get to work that I had hired an engine from Crease to fill my orders and to get my mill to work. He made the remark that there will be no hurry about getting our engine in repair. I said, \"Yes there is, because I have hired this engine and I want to get her returned as soon as I can.\"\nThe plaintiffs told defendant that their Truro workmen had informed them the engine would be repaired in three or four days, and the expectation of getting the engine back every few days is submitted by defendants as good grounds for their not hiring another engine and for keeping on the gang of men at the camp. The trial judge allowed him \"$150 for the loss of the use of his mill\" owing to the non-delivery of the engine contracted for, and in addition to that $277 for wages paid by him to his men whom he retained in camp, for part of the time so retained, and board for the remainder of such time, with sundry other small expenditures, making in all $427.00.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Russell J. dissenting, reduced these damages to $150 for the loss of the use of the mill rejecting the $277 for wages and board of the men and other disbursements. Russell J. held that the 150 allowed for the \"loss of the use of the mill\" by the trial judge was recoverable if allowed on the ground that it was a\nfair estimate of the profits which would have been derived from the use of the machinery,\nand that they could be added to the outlay required to produce these profits, but if it was put as a correct assessment of the damages for \"the loss of the use of the mill\" there could not, possibly be any other damages awarded. He, however, awarded them, as fair profits, together with the outlay required to produce them and so sustained the trial judge's findings as to the amount of the damages.\nAll the difficulties of the case arose from the special facts. I agree fully with Russell J. that if the plaintiffs could have hired another engine at $40 or $50 a month and should have done so that expense would have been the full amount of the damages he should be awarded.\nI think, however, the statements made to defendant by the plaintiffs justified the former in assuming that the engine would be returned to him complete and efficient almost any day after the three or four days he was told it would take to repair, and that, therefore, he was fully entitled to keep his gang of men on awaiting such return ready to proceed with his work, instead of discharging them and leaving himself in the awkward position of being without men for his camp if and when the engine came back.\nIt seems under the circumstances a reasonable and proper thing to have done, and, if I am right, I can not see any ground on which the necessary expenses of doing it should be disallowed. They were reasonable and fair damages resulting directly from defendant's breach of contract and their subsequent representations as to when they would have repaired that breach. They were really the damages he actually and directly sustained from the loss of the use of his mill arising out of plaintiffs' breach of contract.\nMy doubts however have been as to allowing the $150 additional. I am not satisfied that this is a case where loss of anticipated profits can be allowed. If the trial judge had found under the peculiar circumstances of this case the full sum he awarded of $427 as damages for the loss of the use of the mill, I should not have been disposed, in the light of the language used by Blackburn J. in Elbinger Actien-Gesellschafft, etc. v. Armstrong[1] at page 477, to quarrel with the finding as a reasonable compensation for the loss of the use of the mill. But I am not able to follow him when he finds $150 as such compensation, and then adds to it the actual expenses of wages and board of the men. The damages whatever they were found to be for the \"loss of the use of the mill\" covered everything recoverable. Nor am I able to follow Russell J. in allowing these damages as anticipated profits. Such profits are only recoverable when they can be held to be what are called primary profits, such as would have occurred and grown out of the contract itself as the direct and immediate result of its fulfilment. Then they are part and parcel of the contract itself and must have been in contemplation of the parties when the agreement was entered into. But if they are such as would have been realized from other independent and collateral undertakings although entered into in consequence and on the faith of the principal contract, then they are too uncertain and remote to be taken into consideration as part of the damages occasioned by the breach of the contract in suit, unless indeed the defaulting contractor has expressly contracted to be bound for such consequences or the special circumstances are such that he may be held to have impliedly contracted to be so bound.\nSee per Bigelow J. in Fox v. Harding in 1851[2].\nSee also British Columbia Saw Mill Go. v. Nettleship in 1868[3]; Home v. Midland Ry. Co.[4].\nIn determining the question of liability to pay anticipated or probable profits as damages the distinction between primary and secondary profits must always be borne in mind. In Mayne on Damages (6 ed.) pages 55-56 there is a discussion of the cases and the author cites the judgment in the case of Masterton & Smith v. Mayor of Brooklyn[5] as furnishing the key to the English cases in which profits have been admitted and rejected as an element in the damages allowed. Nelson C.J. in delivering the judgment of the court said:\nWhen the books and cases speak of the profits anticipated from a good bargain as matters too remote and uncertain to be taken into the account in ascertaining the true measure of damages they usually have reference to dependent and collateral engagements entered into on the faith and in expectation of the performance of the principal contract. * * * But profits or advantages which are the direct and immediate fruits of the contract entered into between the parties stand upon a different footing. These are part and parcel of the contract itself, entering into and constituting a portion of its very elements; something stipulated for, the right to the enjoyment of which is just as clear and plain as to the fulfillment of any other stipulation. They are presumed to have been taken into consideration and deliberated upon before the contract was made and formed, perhaps the only inducement to the arrangement.\nIn all the circumstances of this case I would disallow those $150 of anticipated profits because they are secondary and not primary damages within the meaning of the rule and as being too speculative and uncertain and not in contemplation of the parties when making the contract or such as the plaintiffs may be held to have impliedly contracted to be bound for in case of breach of their contract. As I have rejected the \"fair rental\" rule because of the misleading character of the information given to defendant as to when the repaired engine would be furnished him, I conclude that the remaining damages, as found by the trial judge, $277.11, should be approved as the reasonable compensation for the loss of the use of the mill and judgment entered accordingly, for that amount with costs of this appeal, but, under the circumstances, neither party to have costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia; the respective judgments for the plaintiffs and defendant for debt, damages and costs to be subject to set-off and costs in the trial court to be apportioned as awarded by the trial judge. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an unsatisfactory sort of case. The learned trial judge, in my opinion, erred in the amount of damages he allowed even though the principle he adopted had been right. It seems to me, moreover, that the principles of allowing for full rental of a good engine to supply the place for the full time of the one bought and sent to the shop for repairs and also the damages for men being kept idle as well as for loss of profits was quite erroneous. I cannot reconcile or harmonize the findings as Mr. Justice Russell attempts to do.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia this assessment is rightly, as I view the case, set aside and only the amount of the estimated rental of a good substitute for the one in question whilst it was being repaired,\u2014and some item for incidentals that may be properly added are allowed. But the evidence of another engine fitted for the boiler power being used, being available for appellant, is by no means as clear as I would like. There is evidence however, left unnoticed in cross-examination and I cannot see how we can discard it.\nWhen we look further into the law and the facts we find that neither party stood upon his strict legal rights but each in a sense seemed to act in a reason- able way up to a certain point, and paradoxical as it may seem, the very doing so renders it more difficult to assess the damages.\nWe cannot assess them satisfactorily by a strict adherence to the usual rules that would be applicable if the respondents had ignored the complaints of the appellant entirely.\nThen when we find that the respondents properly took, on hearing the complaints of the appellants that the engine had not come up to the standard guaranteed, possession of the engine with the consent of appellant and undertook its repair, and the engine was replaced by the appellant getting one of his own choice and on his own terms we see there cannot be the usual damages assessed in the usual way for breach of a warranty.\nWe turn to the agreements that followed the breach and have to ask: Has there been any breach of such agreements or of any of them? They are all set out in the pleadings and the default in each also but in regard to each so set out we have not the full particulars of dates, times, and exactly what done, or might have been done that would enable us to assess in detail for breach of each of these subsidiary agreements in any satisfactory manner.\nWe have, covering them all, the fact that before the guaranteed engine in question was removed to be repaired, the respondents were told by the appellant on the 5th December, that in order to get to work he had hired an engine from Crease.\nThis substituted engine was got and set up and kept by the appellant till the 19th or 20th of December. Meantime acting on the reasonable option given them, respondents took or caused to be taken, the engine they had guaranteed, away to the repair shop.\nBeing told of this hired engine led them no doubt to so take the other and at the same time in giving instructions for repair to rest on the assurance the mill was going, and not make, at a possible extra expense, provision for such strenuous efforts for expeditious return of engine from repair shop, as they otherwise might have done and certainly it would not, on such a state of facts, be within the reasonable contemplation of the parties as to this subsidiary agreement that the Crease engine would fail, and the mill of appellant stop for want of it.\nYet there came a time when respondents were told it did fail and I incline to think somewhat greater energy induced by extra pay might have been used after that in getting it out of the repair shop. I see, however, no evidence, in this regard, on which I could, satisfactorily, assess damages.\nBesides I cannot say that respondents even then neglected anything or that what happened, or the results thereof, could have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties either at the making of the original or the subsidiary agreements.\nNor can I see that the loss of profits if any were of such a character as to render that loss a proper element to enter into the assessment of damages in this case.\nAnd yet one cannot help feeling but that the appellant has suffered more than he has been allowed.\nMy difficulty is to bring that suffering within the rules by which damages must be measured and allow for it on a legal basis.\nThe allowances about to be made here as the result of this appeal exceed, I think, that permissible within such lines. Even if I thought them so based on principle I would not allow to that extent. Moreover, I feel that I should not disregard the finding of the court below for such absolute trifles without the clearest warrant for so doing. In short, I do not feel that, in fixing the sum of $150, the court was so clearly wrong, even if the absolutely correct rules had been followed, that I ought to interfere. The rental basis adopted, to the extent it is, does not appear clearly right but the gross sum allowed may after all be almost, if not altogether, so near right that it better stand. I do not think we should, unless upon the clearest ground, reverse only to change by a trifling increase or reduction of damages respecting which, even when applying correct rules of law, men might reasonably differ in their estimate of the facts. This is not the case of a fixed sum in respect of which the court has, if at all, gone wrong.\nI therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nMaclennan J. concurred in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree with the views expressed in the judgment of Russell J. in the court below, and I would, consequently, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

Brown and Others (Defendants) Respondents.\n1907: November 20; 1907: December 13.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME\" COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Sale of corporate property\u2014Committee of council\u2014Authority to sell\u2014Ratification.\nA committee of a municipal council cannot, unless authorized by the council, sell corporate property and if they do an action lies against them by the corporation for any loss incurred thereby.\nSuch illegal sale cannot be ratified by resolution of the council carried by the votes of the members of the committee.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs and dismissing the action.\nThis action was brought by the plaintiff, the Town of New Glasgow, against the defendants, to recover damages for the wrongful conversion by the defendants, of 37 tons, 875 pounds, of water pipe and also for a declaration that the defendants (respondents) had no right or authority to convert or sell the same.\nAt the time of the conversion and sale the defendants were members of the council of the plaintiff town, and three of them, namely, Brown, Jackson and Murray, were members of the Water Committee of the said council. On or about the 5th day of December, the four defendants, without authority of the town council, and without submission of the question to the town council, and acting independently of the council, undertook to sell, and did sell, the 37 tons, 875 pounds, of water pipe, the property of the said town, to William Cooke, of Glace Bay, N.S.\nThe pipe in question was acquired by the Town of New Glasgow under the authority of a special Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia\u2014chap. 114, Acts of 1903\u2014by which the Town of New Glasgow was empowered to borrow f 40,000 for the purpose of improving, repairing and extending the water system of the town and \"for laying a new 12-inch main pipe from the pumping station to the reservoir.\"\nThe pipe was part of the 12-inch pipe bought for the purpose of laying a new main from the pumping station to the reservoir and was not required for that purpose.\nSeven days after the sale the question of the sale of the pipe was for the first time brought before the town council and a resolution purporting to ratify the sale was introduced by the defendant Brown. The mayor refusing to put the resolution, it was put by the defendant Brown and declared by him carried, the defendants alone voting for it, the remaining two councillors voting against it and the mayor declaring it unconstitutional.\nSubsequently this action was entered by the town under authority of a resolution of the town council claiming the difference between the price received and the actual value of the pipe. The action was tried at Pictou before Mr. Justice Meagher, who found for the plaintiff appellants, holding that the defendants had no authority to sell the pipe, and that the subsequent attempt to ratify the sale by Brown's resolution was of no effect.\nAn appeal was asserted from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and was heard by a court composed of Townshend, Graham, Russell and Longley JJ. Mr. Justice Russell read an opinion allowing the appeal with which opinion Mr. Justice Graham concurred. Mr. Justice Townshend, with some doubt, concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Russell, and Mr. Justice Longley dissented, holding that the defendants had no right to sell the pipe.\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC. E. Gregory K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellants.\nThe defendants had no authority to sell the pipe in question and could not lawfully do so: Pictou School Trustees v. Cameron[1]; and, necessarily, they could not themselves ratify the sale.\nThe town corporation has.only the powers given it by the charter and the sale of personal property is not one of them. See Attorney-General v. Great Eastern Railway Co.[2]; Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[3].\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents. The sale in question was incidental to the construction of water works authorized by statute and so within the powers of the council. See Liverpool and Milton Railway Co. v. Town of Liverpool[4]. Brice on Ultra Vires (3 ed.), pp. 117-8.\nC. E. Gregory K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellants.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice concurred with Maclennan J.\nDavies J. concurred with Idington J.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants are, as the name indicates, a municipal corporation. The Legislature of Nova Scotia passed an Act enabling this corporation to construct water works.\nIn the course of some months after works begun thereunder it became apparent that there was more pipe on hand than the corporation had ready money to make immediate use of.\nThe respondents were members of the council of the said corporation. Three of them constituted a committee which, I infer from its name and references to it in the evidence, had charge of this work.\nIt is not pretended, however, that they ever had any authority to sell or dispose of any of the pipe in question. Neither the mayor, nor the council, so far as appears, had ever considered the question of what should be done with what had become, for the present moment, pipe that we may for argument's sake call surplus pipe.\nWhether it would be a wise thing to sell it, if the power existed to do so, or retain it awaiting future developments was clearly a question for consideration by the whole council, at a meeting properly constituted for the consideration of such business.\nThis seems so clear that one is at a loss to comprehend the frame of mind of those who, unauthorized and quite unwarranted in any way, took the steps the respondents did to sell this part of the town property. Brown, who was chairman of the committee I have referred to, tells how, as a result of his meeting with one Cooke, a contractor at Glace Bay, the negotiations came about, and then says :\u2014\nThis is how the sale originated. The pipe was shipped under the instructions of the four of us to Cooke. That is all the authority we had at that time.\nI may suggest that he might as well have added to the last sentence \"or any other time\" and completed the story.\nEight or nine days later at a meeting of the council when, on these facts, this very cause of action now before us had arisen in appellants' favour and all four respondents were liable to be adjudged in a suit for, and in trial of suit for, such cause of action as Mr. Justice Meagher, the learned trial judge, afterwards did adjudge them liable, to pay the town over twelve hundred dollars, they ask the mayor to submit to the council meeting the resolution I am about to quote, and on his refusal they had it put by themselves, and voted for by themselves, and entered on the minutes duly signed by themselves, as follows :\u2014\nResolved, that the sale of 37 tons, 875 pounds of water pipe to Wm. Cooke, contractor, Glace Bay, at the rate of $31.00 (thirty-one dollars) per ton of 2,000 lbs. f.o.b., New Glasgow, be confirmed, and that the proceeds be placed to the credit of the \"water construction account.\"\n(Sgd.) David P. Brown.\n\" G. S. Jackson.\n\" H. Murray.\n\" John J. Grant.\nNew Glasgow, Dec. 12, 1905.\nResolution re sale of pipe voted on.\nAfter which Councillor Brown put the resolution to a vote of the council and passed on the following vote, viz.: For resolution\u2014 Councillors Grant, Murray, Brown and Jackson. Against resolution\u2014Councillors Fraser and Glendenning.\nMinute book, page 165.\nNobody ventured to assist them or countenance their proceeding.\nWhat could they expect to gain legally by such a proceeding?\nI am not surprised that counsel have failed to find precedent to fit such a case.\nThe legal principles that do fit it are old and are just as much in force to-day as when first applied.\nWhen men are named as committee men on behalf of a municipal council or any other body of men, they are but agents of, with such authority as, those nominating them choose (acting within and no further than their legal power of such nomination may extend) to give.\nNo one acting on or as such committee exceeding the limits of such agency or authority can ratify his own wrongful act, and make it legally right or effective or release himself from the consequence of his own wrong.\nIt seems idle to discuss the statutory authority, of the town to sell, when the town never did sell.\nIt may not be out of place to refer to what was pointed out by eminent judges such as the late Chief Justice Hagarty in the case of Baird v. The Village of Almonte[5], at p. 419, and the late Chief Justice Harrison at pp. 424 et seq., followed by Mr. Justice Osier, now of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in the case of Vashon v. Township of East Hawkesbury[6], at pp. 202 and 203, in cases where statutory prohibition existed against municipal representatives, who are trustees for the public, acting when their interest and duty came in conflict. It appears from them that apart from the statutory prohibition there existed no right to act.\nOf course we express no opinion on the need of assent by the Lieutenant-Governor to a sale.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of Mr. Justice Meagher restored.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I am of opinion that, quite irrespective of the statute requiring the consent of the Governor in Council, to a sale of property by the municipality, the respondents had no power, without the previous authority of the municipal council, to make the sale in question.\nThey not only made a contract of sale, but actually shipped the pipes to the purchaser at Glace Bay; acts which constituted a conversion of the property, and gave rise to a good cause of action on the part of the municipality.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs here and below.\nDuff J. concurred with Idington J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

No person was stationed on the last car to give warning of its approach and as the bell was encrusted with snow and ice it could not be heard. Evidence was given that on a train of the kind the conductor was supposed to act as brakesman and would have to be on the rear of the coal-car to work the brakes but when the car struck M., who was engaged at the time in keeping the track clear of snow, the conductor was in the cab of the engine.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that an absolute duty was cast on the company by the statute to station a person on the last car to warn workmen, as well as other persons, on the track which, under the facts proved, they had neglected to discharge. The defence under the doctrine of common employment was, therefore, not open to them. Groves v. Wimborne, ([1898] 2 Q.B. 402), followed (a).\nHeld, per Idington J., that the evidence shewed the only failure of the company to comply with the statutory provision to have been through the acts and omissions of the fellow-servants of deceased; that the company, therefore, could not be held liable for the consequences under the \"Fatal Injuries Act\"; that it is, therefore, unnecessary to determine the applicability of the said section of the \"Railway Act,\" as the fellow-servants were guilty of common law negligence which rendered the company. liable but only by virtue of and within the limits of the \"Employers' Liability Act.\" (a).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments published herewith.\nThe trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiffs and assessed the damages at $3,800.

Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[2].\nAnd plaintiffs are entitled to succeed under \"The Employers' Liability Act\" which recognizes Lord Campbell's Act and excludes the doctrine of common employment.\nThe statement of claim sufficiently sets up this ground of negligence. See Ruegg on Employers' Liability (5 ed.) p. 121 and form at pp. 362-3. And it may be joined with another or an alternative claim. Ruegg, p. 362; Curran v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents. The deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. He knew that the train might be expected at any moment and the engineer was justified in assuming that he would be on his guard. See Aerkfetz v. Humphreys[3]; Crowe v. New York Central and Hudson River Railway Co.[4]; Dominion Iron & Steel Co. v. Oliver[5].\nSection 251 of \"The Railway Act\" does not apply to the case of a company injuring one of its own employees. See Labatt, Master and Servant, secs. 637-8. Even if it does we can invoke the doctrine of common employment. Labatt, sec. 638. Smith, Master and Servant, ed. 1904, p. 225.\nMellish K.C. for the appellants\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Davies J.\nGirouard J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal. Davies J.\u2014This action was one brought under what is known as \"Lord Campbell's Act\" by the widow and infant children of one John McMullin, an employee of the defendant company, to recover damages arising out of the death of the said employee while engaged at his work on the railway track of the company.\nThe defendant company owns and operates a railway between their works at Sydney Mines and their shipping piers at North Sydney, N.S., and such railway runs through the town of North Sydney.\nThe railway being entirely a provincial one is governed as to its construction, management and operation by the provincial statute, B.S.N. S. ch. 99, intituled \"The Nova Scotia Railway Act.\"\nThe 251st section of that Act is as follows :\u2014\nWhenever any train of cars is moving reversely, in any city, town or village, the locomotive and tender being in the rear of such train, the company shall station on the last car in the train a person who shall warn persons standing on or crossing the track of such railway, of the approach of such engine, tender and train; and for any violation of any of the provisions of this section, or of any of the three sections next preceding, the company shall be liable to a penalty of one hundred dollars.\nSection 280 of the same Act is as follows :\u2014\nEvery company * * * causing or permitting to be done, any matter, act or thing contrary to the provisions of this chapter * * * or omitting to do any matter, act or thing required to be done on the part of any such company * * * is liable to any person injured thereby for the full, amount of damages sustained by such act or omission * * * .\nThe main and substantial question raised and argued before us was as to the true construction of section 251.\nThe trial judge held that the section did apply to railway servants as well as others not being so, and cast an absolute duty upon the company for damages arising from the non-performance of which the company was liable.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversed the judgment of the trial judge, holding that even\nassuming the moving of the cars through the town in reverse order, stationing a man on the last car is analogous to and is governed by the same principle as the failure of a defendant to supply some permanent protection to machinery, such as the fence or guard required by statute in such a case as Groves v. Wimorne[6]\nstill in the case at bar,\nall the negligent omissions, including the stationing of a man on the forward car to give the necessary warning, were those of fellow workmen of the deceased, and even if the company would be liable on proof of a system on their part of running their trains without these necessary precautions * * * there is nothing in the least degree approaching the proof that would be required to support such a case.\nI am quite unable to agree with the conclusions reached by the court below, either as to the application of the doctrine of \"common employment\" or as to the proper inferences to be derived from the very meagre evidence given at the trial.\nWith respect to the proper construction to be given to section 251, I am unable to agree with the contention that the section only applies to persons not railway servants, and, as to them only \"while standing on or crossing the track of the railway\" at a highway crossing.\nThere does not appear to me to be any justification arising either from the language of the section itself or from its position in the Act and its relation to its context which would justify the courts in importing such limitations into it. Nothing is said in the section with respect to a \"highway crossing.\" What is said is that \"persons standing on or crossing the track of such railway\" within the limits of a town, city or village, shall be entitled, so far as trains moving reversely are concerned, to have a certain specified precaution and warning observed. It does seem to be an arbitrary and unreasonable construction to exclude workmen from the benefit of such a prudent and beneficial section as this. In fact, it would seem rather more necessary for the workman's protection than for that of the outside public. Business might occasionally, no doubt, take some of the general public on or across these railway tracks within cities, towns or villages, but, apart from public highways, the presence of any of the general public would be a rare occurrence on these tracks.\nOn the other hand, the duties of many of the workmen, trackmen, switchmen, etc., require them to be \"on or crossing the track\" frequently, and it would seem reasonable to conclude that the section was enacted as much, if not more, for their benefit than for the benefit of the small section of the general public who would legally go \"on or across the track.\" Of course, the section is not for the benefit of trespassers and they, I assume, not to be within it.\nThe section applies in terms to any and all parts of the company's track within the city or town, and I see as little reason for excluding from the section the grounds of the company itself within such city as the workmen of the company.\nThe section is general in its terms. Its object evidently was the protection of \"persons on or crossing the track\" within the town's limits from the damages arising from a train of cars running reversely, and I entirely fail to find any justification for confining its protection to persons crossing the tracks at a highway and excluding others who legally and properly are on or crossing the track for business or other purposes, even within the company's own grounds, or others who, being the company's workmen, are on or crossing the track in discharge of their duty.\nThat being so, what are the facts proved here?\nThe deceased was a switchman and was engaged, at the time of his death, in the midst of a snow storm, in keeping the switch clear of snow and ice. He was run down and killed by a train of cars running reversely. Not a scintilla of evidence is given as to any contributory negligence on his part, and it is admitted that no person was on the last car ahead of the engine to warn persons of its approach. That being so, the statutory duty of the company was violated.\nNo evidence whatever was called for the company. No attempt to shew that, as a company, it had tried to discharge its duty by \"stationing a man on this last car.\"\nThe fireman stated :\u2014\"We had no book of rules at that time that I know of.\" And this evidence is neither contradicted nor explained, but we are asked to assume, from a casual statement of the same man, that\nthe conductor (who as a fact was in the cab), is supposed to be on the car ahead of the engine;\nthat the conductor's orders and the system under which the railway was operated required him to be there.\nI am not able to draw from this casual statement, the conclusion that the company had, in the words of the statute, \"stationed a man on the last car on the train.\" As a fact, no man was so stationed. If the company desired to raise the defence of common employment, they would be bound, in my judgment, to prove either that the man was stationed there to warn people and by his own carelessness and negligence had failed to do so, or, at least, that it was, by their rules or orders, the duty of some one to have been there to carry out the statutory duty, and that his absence was not in any way owing to their negligence or default, but to the deliberate breach of duty of some workman charged with such duty.\nThen, if they desired to rely upon the qualifying words, which Williams L.J. added to his concurrence with the other members of the appeal court in the judgment of Groves v. Wimborne[7], they would stand in a position at any rate to urge the application of the doctrine so qualified to the special facts proved.\nAs for me, I think the law as laid down by the appeal court in Groves v. Wimborne7, applicable to this case and binding. The section being applicable to the place where the man was killed and to the man, he being within the class of persons intended to be protected, although a workman of the company, there arose under it a statutory obligation imposed upon the company in the interests of the workmen's safety which they failed to discharge and for the consequences of which failure they are liable. Under the facts as proved it was not open to them to invoke the doctrine of common employment, even if such a doctrine could, in any case, be invoked to relieve a company from the consequences following the failure to observe or conform to a statutory obligation towards a party injured.\nThese conclusions relieve me of any necessity of considering the other branch of the case, namely, the plaintiff's right to recover under \"The Employers' Liability Act.\" As nothing was said respecting the amount of the damages awarded by the trial judge, I have assumed them to be right.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed but concur in the opinion of the court below that the action, so far as rested on \"The Fatal Injuries Act\" alone, is not maintainable. It needs also the support of \"The Employers' Liability Act.\" There was common law negligence, and hence, in my view of the evidence, I cannot find that it is necessary to pass any opinion on the question of the appellants' right to rely only or at all upon the statutory provisions invoked from \"The Nova Scotia Railway Act.\" My reason for that is that I infer from the evidence that the men in charge of the train neglected what had been their accustomed observance of the statutory duties, and that I cannot impute the breaches thereof to the respondents, as part of their system, or at all, except through the misconduct of their servants, who were also the fellow servants of the deceased.\nThe driver of the engine says:\u2014\nThe conductor was both brakesman and conductor * * * The brake on the car at that time was on its rear and there is where he would likely be.\nTo the Court.\u2014If it had been a fine day, the brakeman would have been there. He was not there because it was storming too badly. Boutiler says:\u2014\nThe conductor was in the cab *- * . The conductor is supposed to be on the car ahead of the engine * * *\nA man would require to be on the car to operate its brake on that occasion. There was no man on the car that day up to the time of the accident. If we had a brakesman that day, his position would have been on the coal car. We could only stop the car through stopping the engine. We had no book of rules at that time I knew of.\nAnd, in cross-examination;\nIt was a shunting engine. At that time the crew usually consisted of three and the conductor handled the brakes.\nAnd, on this occasion, the three men were there, but evidently the conductor-brakesman, though he had only one car to look after, neglected his duty as such. He had died before the trial and hence above only evidence obtainable, of the sphere of duties assigned, unless the respondents' manager and secretary had been brought to prove such from by-laws or otherwise expressly. Such, certainly, has not been the practice at trials of this sort and was not, in face of the foregoing evidence, in my opinion, incumbent on the respondents here.\nAt first, I was disposed to attach some importance to the statement as to want of a book of rules as indicating a neglect of duty on the part of the company. The statement, as appears above, cannot, however, I think, fairly be so read as to imply of necessity that the company never had delivered the men such rules, or given proper instruction or ever sanctioned the neglect of duty such as is apparent on this occasion. Their man was there to comply with the statute as was also the bell, and, even if the statute can be interpreted so as to enure to the benefit of \"the appellants, it cannot, in this view, get rid, under the circumstances, of the doctrine of common employment. The action cannot, therefore, in my opinion, be maintained without the support that \"The Employers' Liability Act\" gives. It is urged by the respondents that this cannot be given effect to in this action, and so the court below seems to have assumed and held for reasons I fail to find sufficient.\nAs to the statement of claim, I see no insuperable difficulty. Paragraph four seems framed as if intended to cover the cases under section three of \"The Employers' Liability Act,\" and paragraph five seems framed as if intended to meet the case of an action resting upon a breach or breaches of the statute there invoked, and which might, if the evidence got the case past the difficulty of the common employment doctrine, support an action under\n\"The Fatal Injuries Act\" itself without regard to what precedes.\nSuch are the. cardinal features of this statement of claim. On its face are presented two cases. Then this becomes clearer when we consider the statement of claim in its first three paragraphs and find that it shews the deceased to have been a servant of the respondents in the very same service as those whose negligence is complained of in the fourth paragraph.\nHow could any one read such a statement of claim and not see thus suggested a claim that must rest on \"The Employers' Liability Act\" for support?\nThe pleading, in that regard, is neither lucid nor precise nor concise, but it must mean nothing if it does not point to an intention to found the first part of the statement of claim on that Act. It, indeed, jumbles together the provisions thereof by using, in a very undesirable way, some of the language used in each of the three later sub-sections of section three.\nThe statement of claim, as a whole, covers at least quite enough to prevent us from holding that it so absolutely fails to disclose any ease within \"The Employers' Liability Act,\" that the trial judge would have erred if he had found, on the facts, such a case and entered judgment thereunder.\nI think that is a fair test of the possible meaning of the statement of claim here. If, down to the trial, respondents could pretend they were misled, and, therefore, did not plead want of notice, a motion to amend and set up alternative claims was made and allowed. This amendment could mean nothing short of claiming, as the meaning of the pleading, what I have suggested above as its intention and possible meaning. The learned trial judge might well have refused this amendment unless and until the whole pleading had been put in less embarrassing form.\nThe refusal of the learned trial judge to put plaintiff to an election, confirms my opinion, not only that it was possible either case might be shewn or appear, but that the case proceeded with everybody concerned understanding that the case might be found in either way as the facts and law applicable should disclose later.\nThe necessity for particulars of claim (so much relied on below) is just as great under the one Act as under the other\u2014only there is there prescribed a slightly different mode of evincing them.\nI cannot see that either was adopted in this suit. Mere forms these are in either case; and can be supplied at any time by amendment as can also the pleadings. No one should be driven to another action for any of these things.\nThe questions of the cause of the death, the legal relations of the parties concerned in that and the consequences thereof were all threshed out at the trial.\nThere is nothing to prevent us from acting on section 54 of \"The Supreme Court Act\" and so amending, within that and other sections, as the court below also could have done, and giving judgment accordingly, unless we should see that the respondents are entitled to say they were misled and now are, therefore, entitled to plead want of notice and claim a new trial.\nI think the fair inference, from the correspondence produced, is that notice was given and I infer that all objections to it, if any possible, were waived; and, upon some features, the correspondence presents, but which I need not enlarge upon, there existed good reasons for the waiver.\nI think, therefore, the appellants entitled to have the case maintained and disposed of on the merits; and claim upheld by whatever law it can be rested upon.\nNow as to the merits of the appellants' case; the habitual compliance with the enactments requiring outlook and ringing of bell; even if such statutes are not such as appellants' action can rest upon; when habitually observed, as I have inferred they were, and as, in law, they may fairly be presumed to have been so observed, created a condition of things that the deceased was entitled to have relied on, as likely to continue.\nThe view of such a matter has been so well presented by Lord Esher, in Smith v. The South Eastern Railway Co.[8] in appeal at pages 182 et seq., that I refer thereto and adopt his reasoning as applicable, and rely on it here.\nMore than that, I am prepared to hold, and do hold, that an engine merely used for shunting in a railway yard, such as this was, and especially running reversely, requires in its management a high degree of care, and that, when the ringing of a bell or keeping of an outlook or possibly either on such occasions, as reason and due regard to the safety of those in the yard may reasonably require, has been abandoned, he, who being in charge or control, has thus abandoned such safeguards, without adopting some equivalent, quite as efficient, has been guilty of that sort of negligence that section 3, sub-section (e) of the \"Employers' Liability Act\" refers to.\nSuch was I take it, too clear for argument, the case disclosed by the facts before us.\nThis opinion of the law, apart from statute, is clearly in accord with the principle of the common law and what was given expression to by Sir Henry Strong, the Chief Justice of this court, in the case of The Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. Henderson)[9], at page 636, where he said :\u2014\nFurther I think it right to say that on this evidence (that the bell did not ring, that the speed was over six miles an hour, and that a flagman, stationed there, did not give warning), we should be justified in holding that there was common law negligence, as in the case of The St. Lawrence and Ottawa Railway Co. v. Lett[10]\nand, as on the same occasion, the late Mr. Justice Gwynne also said:\u2014\nI am of opinion that if the ringing of the bell would prevent an accident to a person crossing a highway, there is an obligation, at common law, to ring it,\nand, with what the late Chief Justice of Ontario, Sir George Burton, said, in the case of Hollinger v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11]. Thus I find, besides the case of the Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Jackson[12], not cited, but itself quite sufficient to meet the allegation of contributory negligence, the element of expectation, on the part of the deceased, that he might ring the bell or see the outlook, when relied upon by Mr. Justice Meagher, in connection with the question of contributory negligence, was fully justified. And thus I find further the amplest legal ground for maintaining the action and giving damages for $1,500, without relying on the Nova Scotia Railway statute, as enuring to the appellants' benefit. And as I have already said, the breaches of that statute, not being shewn to be the direct act of the company, or of a system adopted by it, but arising from clear neglect of duty, on the part of a fellow servant, can give no higher right that I indicate here.\nI would allow the appeal with costs of appeal and costs of suit in all courts below, save so much thereof as may have been occasioned by the striving of the appellants to maintain their right to damages exceeding the limit of $1,500, and enter judgment for that sum to be properly apportioned, but, as the majority of the court take another view, say nothing further anent the same.\nDuff J. agreed with Davies J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: D.

It was alleged that the interest so claimed had been assigned to the plaintiff by McDonald in whose favour the trial judge found that the defendant had made a declaration of trust in respect of the areas, but no written note of the assignment was produced. At the trial, oral testimony was admitted to shew that the alleged assignment was in the form of a receipt from McDonald to the plaintiff for $300, stating that the money had been paid for one-fourth of McDonald's interest in the areas and purporting to be signed by the assignor, but his signature to the lost receipt was not proved.\nThe appeal was from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, affirming the judgment by Russell J., at the trial, by which it was ordered that the plaintiff should recover against the defendant, McNeil, the sum of f 668.56, with costs.\nBell for the appellant. As to contract for benefit of a third party not being enforceable at law see Burris v. Rhind[2]. The contract cannot be supported on the ground of voluntary trust. Antrobus v. Smith[3].

Green[5], per Willes J. at pages 56, 57. The Statute of Frauds is not pleaded and, in any eventais satisfied by the receipt from McDonald to Corbett stating that the money had been paid and accepted for the interest in question ; see Warren on Choses in Action, p. 352. The other grounds raised by the appellant have been already disposed of in the case of McNeill v. Fultz[6] which had reference to the same areas and transactions between the parties.\nBell for the appellant\nMellish K.C. for the respondent\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The plaintiff fails, I think, for noncompliance with the Statute of Frauds.\nThe agreement which he alleges in his statement of claim is an agreement with the defendant McDonald for the purchase of an interest in certain coal mining licenses\u2014admittedly an interest in lands within the meaning of that statute.\nI am unable to agree with the court below that, upon the evidence, the plaintiff can succeed as upon an agreement for the purchase of an interest in the proceeds of the sale of the licenses as distinguished from an interest in the licenses themselves. The oral agreement proved 'was an agreement for the purchase of an interest in the licenses. And there is no sufficient evidence that prior to the agreement there had been such a conversion of that interest as would, take away its character as real estate.\nNo memorandum in writing was produced. As regards the lost receipt referred to, there was no finding of the learned trial judge regarding the nature of its contents; and, considering the unsatisfactory character of the evidence and the evident hesitation of the court below upon the point, I think one ought to give effect to one's view that the contents of and McDonald's signature to the document have not been sufficiently proved,\nWith great respect, moreover, I must disagree with the view of the court below that the plaintiff has made out a case enabling him to take advantage of the doctrine known as the doctrine of part performance. A condition of the application of that doctrine is thus stated by Lord Selborne, in Maddison v. Alderson[7], at page 479:\nAll the authorities shew that the acts relied upon must be unequivocally, and in their own nature, referable to some such agreement as that alleged;\ni.e. to an agreement respecting the lands themselves; and, as further explained in that case, a plaintiff who relies upon acts of part performance to excuse the non-production of a note or memorandum under the Statute of Frauds, should first prove the acts relied upon; it is only after such acts unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land which is alleged to have been the subject of the agreement sued upon have been proved that evidence of the oral agreement becomes admissible for the purpose of explaining those acts. It is for this reason that a payment of purchase money alone can never be a sufficient act of performance within the rule.\nHere there is nothing in the nature of the acts proved which bears any necessary relation to the interest in land said to have been the subject of the agreement in question. A sale and purchase of the stock and bonds actually transferred would suffice to explain them.\nA further point remains to be noticed. It is said that McNeil cannot avail himself of the statute. I do not see why.\nThe fourth section of the Nova Scotia Statute of Frauds provides that\nno interest in land shall be assigned '* * * except by deed or note in writing signed by the party assigning * * * the same or by his agent thereunto authorized by writing or by operation of law.\nIt is not suggested that there was any deed or note in .writing in compliance with this enactment ; the plaintiff was, therefore, compelled to base his action and did in fact base it upon the allegation of an agreement by McDonald to sell to him the interest referred to. But section seven of the statute provides that no action shall be brought upon a contract of sale of land or any interest therein unless the contract or some memorandum or note thereof is in writing signed by the person sought to be charged. Such a contract in the absence of such a note or memorandum or acts of part performance, being non-en: forceable, could not, it seems to me clear, be held to vest by its own operation in the purchaser such an interest in the subject matter of the agreement as would entitle him to maintain an action in respect of it. If the purchaser were entitled to maintain an action to compel the execution of an assignment of the subject matter of the agreement he would in equity be treated as having such an assignment; but I know of no principle under which a purchaser of an interest in land under an oral agreement for sale non-enforceable by reason of non-compliance with the Statute of Frauds can be held by virtue of the non-enforceable agreement alone to have vested in him any interest in the subject matter of it.\nIt is true the statute was not pleaded original; but I think that, having regard to the course taken at the trial respecting the defendant's application for, leave to amend and in the actual conduct of the trial itself, the respondents could not now resist such an application.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Terrell\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

In an action to recover back from the secretary the moneys so received by him as commission.\nHeld, that, although the secretary had received the commissions under mistake of law; yet, as he must be assumed to have had knowledge of the illegality of the transaction, the moneys could be recovered back by the company.\nSubsequently the scheme of conversion was approved of by a resolution of the shareholders, but it did not appear that they had been fully informed as to the arrangement for the payment of a commission to the secretary in that respect, in addition to his regular salary.\nHeld, that the resolution of the Shareholders had not the effect of ratifying the payment of the commissions.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial whereby the plaintiffs' action for the recovery back of the moneys claimed to have been illegally paid was affirmed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated by Idington J. in his judgment now reported.\nThe action was to recover money received by the defendant as commission on the conversion of preferred stock of the plaintiff company into bonds. The defendant, who was manager and secretary of the company at the time the services were performed, counterclaimed for damages for wrongful dismissal.\nThe trial judge, Russell J., entered judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount paid defendant, holding the contract to be ultra vires. He also found that there was no evidence of bad faith on his part, nor of any conduct that would warrant his dismissal, and awarded him, as damages on the counterclaim, the amount of his salary during five months, the unexpired portion of his year.\nBy the judgment appealed from this decision was affirmed, in so far as it related to the plaintiffs' claim, but the amount awarded to the defendant on his counterclaim was increased to $750, the full amount of six months' salary at' the rate of his engagement.\nLafleur K.C. and Mellish K.C. for the appellant.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Idington J.\nGirouard J, concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nDavies J.\u2014In this case some questions were raised in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the counterclaim of the appellant (defendant) and decided by that court.\nNo appeal was taken to this court from that decision.\nThis appeal related entirely to the right of the respondent company to recover back from its manager and secretary, Rountree, certain moneys alleged to have been improperly and illegally paid to him by the officers of the company he himself being one of the signers of the cheques on which the moneys were obtained.\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Meagher, in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, I am of opinion that these moneys were recoverable back and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent company was promoted by the appellant and incorporated for dealing in land and loaning money and he became the secretary and also under the powers of that office, I think, manager.\nThe following section of the company's by-laws defined his duties :\u2014\nSection 9. The secretary shall also be manager of the company and attend all meetings of the shareholders and board of directors. He shall keep all accounts fully and accurately, as well of the company as between the company and its shareholders, have the custody of the records and seal, and issue all notices on the order of the president or vice-president; sign all certificates of shares and agency appointments, and have the general management of the company. He shall present to the directors at each meeting a statement of monies received and disbursed during the preceding months, and shall also perform such other duties as may be assigned to him by the board of directors.\nSection 7 of the same by-laws also shews he was required to countersign cheques. Section 7. The funds of the company shall be deposited in a chartered bank of Canada, to be selected by the directors, and shall so remain until drawn therefrom by cheque or drafts, signed by the president, or in his absence, the vice-president and manager.\nThe company were to allow him under a written agreement between it and him \u00e0 stated salary and 21\/2 per cent. for selling stock of the company.\nSometime later the company decided upon issuing bonds and passed a resolution authorizing appellant to sell the same to the amount of $150,000 and allowing him a commission of 5 per cent, on such sales upon the amounts paid for such bonds.\nLater on and at a time when the company was evidently falling behind the directors conceived the scheme of converting the preferred stock, that was to bear 8 per cent. interest, and was previously sold, into bonds of the issue just now mentioned. The appellant had been allowed for sales of this preferred stock and for the additional trouble of canvassing for its conversion desired 5 per cent. more.\nThe company had no power, however, to make this conversion.\nThe president asked the secretary to look after this business and the appellant said he supposed he would get the 5 per cent. commission on such conversion as he might get agreed to. He says the president assented to this and also that later on the other directors also assented to it. No resolution of that kind was passed. It may be observed that the rate seems excessive as compared with 21\/2 per cent. for canvassing for original subscriptions for stock. It suggests the assent so far as got may have been through mistake.\nThe entire arrangement for conversion was so obviously ultra vires one is surprised to see it ventured on. The secretary made claim for the 5 per cent. commission for conversion, and got paid in great part by cheques countersigned under the above by-law by himself and the company now sue to recover back the commission thus paid and the learned. trial judge adjudged appellant do pay this claim and on appeal the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia dismissed his appeal and now he appeals here.\nIt was urged in support of this appeal that the company had no right to recover, as moneys so paid could not be recovered, and, even if in law it ever could be held that such a recovery was possible, the company had ratified and adopted the secretary's services and became thereby so bound that recovery. should not be allowed.\nI think one holding such relations as this secretary did to the: company cannot claim to hold such commission for legal services and that he either had or should have had knowledge of the illegality and when he ventured to countersign cheques to himself for such commissions he was bound to inquire for the legal authority for the act he was pretending to do, professedly as such secretary.\nThere could never be any safeguard for a company if one entrusted with such duties did them with so little regard so the law or what the law might be as this appellant evinced under the facts of this case.\nThere was no. ratification as I view the facts.\nThere may have been culpable negligence on the part of the directors also but the two blacks could not make a white.\nEach official in such place of trust must inquire for himself.\nThe last part or balance of this commission account was not paid by such cheques as appellant countersigned but by other officers, but I think that does not place such later payments in a better position in law for the appellant's case. Had he not neglected his duty in regard to the first payments he never would have applied for the later ones.\nI think also that the duty devolved on the appellant to have explained more fully to the shareholders, and directors than he did the nature of his claim and especially that he ought to have seen they each knew at their meetings that the auditor's written refusal to sanction the first payments, was read and the nature of the auditor's objection made quite plain. And more than that; when, if ever, he was unable to have brought all that could possibly have arisen thereout home to the minds of shareholders and directors, beyond all doubt, he should have refrained from touching the pen, to countersign the cheque, or the money it brought, if by accident he had countersigned.\nWhen a man occupies any position of trust and it so happens as it sometimes almost unavoidably does that he is made to appear as acting where his duty and his interest conflict he should as he regards his own honour, to say nothing of the law, see that his conduct in the premises is thoroughly well understood by those entitled to know and that he, if acting, is but obeying their command and desires and not his own mere volition.\nSecretaries having as this appellant had to sign or countersign cheques for or to themselves should, by thus clearing things up as far as possible reduce the act of doing so, when it enures directly to their own benefit, to the mere needful mechanical duty. Companies might do well to provide for such cases so that even the appearance of acting the dual part need not exist.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. agreed with Idington J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Burchell & McIntyre.\nSolicitor for the respondents : Joseph A. Gillies.\n"}

Jarvis v. The Great Western Railway Co. (8 U.C.C.P. 280), and The Charlevoix Election Case (Cout. Dig. 388) followed.\nAppeal from an order of the Registrar in Chambers, on taxation of the costs awarded to the respondent on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada[1].\nThe judgment in question was taken on appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, pursuant to leave granted on 22nd July, 1903[2], and subsequently[3] the order granting leave to appeal was rescinded and the appeal dismissed by the Board.\nOn the taxation of the costs awarded to the Crown, the Registrar, in Chambers, allowed counsel fees to the Attorney-General of Canada and the deputy Minister of Justice, who argued the appeal on behalf of the Crown. On behalf of the appellants, an appeal from this order was taken and heard in chambers before Maclennan J.\nBurbidge appeared for the appellants.\nPownell for the respondent.\nMaclennan J.\u2014This is an appeal by the company from the taxation of the costs awarded to the Crown on the dismissal of the appeal, as noted in the Supreme Court reports[4], in 1902.\nThe registrar has taxed counsel fees to the Attorney-General and the deputy minister of justice, who argued the appeal on behalf of the Crown, and it is objected that those fees cannot be allowed inasmuch as both the Attorney-General and the deputy minister are salaried officers of the Crown and must be regarded as having acted officially in conducting the appeal.\nThe statute, R.S.C. (1906) ch. 4, fixes the salary of the Minister of Justice, and the Act, R.S.C. (1906) ch. 21, sec. 2(2), declares that the Minister of Justice shall be ex officio Attorney-General; sec. 53 of R.S.C. (1906) ch. 16, \"The Civil Service Act,\" fixes the salary of the deputy Minister of Justice ; and sub-secs. 2 and 3 of sec. 59, of that Act are as follows:\u2014\n(2) He (the deputy head) shall give his full time to the public service, and shall discharge all duties required by the. head of the department, or by the Governor in Council, whether such duties are in his own department or not.\n(3) No deputy head shall receive any pay, fee or allowance in any form in excess of the amount of the salary hereinbefore authorized to be paid to him. I am of opinion that counsel fees ought not to be taxed either to the Attorney-General or the deputy; minister, or rather to the Crown, in respect of fees paid to either of those officers.\nSo far as the Attorney-General is concerned, he represented the Crown in this litigation. He might have employed other counsel, but, instead of doing so, he chose to act himself. In doing so he was performing one of the ordinary functions of his office; and, if the Crown had been unsuccessful and had not been awarded costs, it is not conceivable that he would, or could legally claim or receive any compensation for his service, other than, or in addition to, the salary prescribed by statute.\nThe costs awarded are not the costs of the counsel or solicitor, but the costs of the client, incurred by him, independently of the result of the litigation, and if the client has not incurred or is not liable for costs, or any particular item or fee, he cannot recover them as costs of the litigation.\nI think, therefore, that the fees taxed as paid to the Attorney-General ought not to have been allowed.\nAnd it is, a fortiori, as to the deputy minister, for he is required to give his full time to the public service, etc., and is not to receive any pay, fee or allowance in any form in excess of his fixed salary.\nNo English authority was cited to me, which may be accounted for by the fact that, except as prescribed by different statutes, the Crown in England neither pays nor receives costs of litigation; The King v. The Archbishop of Canterbury[5] at pages 569, 571.\nThe point here in question was decided in the Province of Ontario, nearly fifty years ago, in Jarvis v. The Great Western Railway Co. (l), a decision which has been followed ever since in the courts of that province.\nIn that case, the company's solicitor was employed at a salary, and it was held that the company, not having incurred any costs in the litigation, so far as it was conducted by their solicitor, could recover nothing in respect of his services, upon a judgment in their favour with an award of costs.\nThe same point was decided in this court, in 1880, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, in The Charlevoix Election Case; Valin v. Langlois(2).\nIn that case, the respondent, an advocate, argued the appeal in person, and it was held that a counsel fee could not be taxed to him.\nThe appeal should, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 33 Can.

(j), and 60 Vict. ch. 4, sec. 12, the subsidy was attributable to the first eighty miles of the railway beginning at Metapedia and extending towards Gaspe Basin; that the land subsidy was of a special character subject only to the conditions enumerated in the second part of said sub-section (j), and that, as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council had exercised the discretion of making cash payments in lieu of the land subsidy given by the statute and effected a compromise for the payment of the last thirty-five cents per acre, at the rate agreed upon by the compromise, the Provincial Government was bound by the terms of that transaction.\nIt was contended by the respondent that the subsidy was attributable to the eighty miles of the railway beyond the first one hundred miles of the line, viz., the part extending from Paspebiac to Gasp\u00e9 Basin; that payment was conditional on the completion of the works to Gasp\u00e9 Basin, which condition had not been fulfilled, and that, in any event, such payment was a matter of grace and was not obligatory upon the Crown.\nIn the courts below, the petition of right was dismissed and it was held that the subsidy applied to the eighty miles of the railway which terminated at or near Gasp\u00e9 Basin, and that a different construction placed upon the statute by the officers of the Crown, in effecting a compromise and making part payment of the subsidy in money, gave the appellants no right to recover the balance claimed from the Crown.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the parties, on the appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs for the reasons given in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nT.

In an action for damages by the widow and children of C.,\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 15 K.B. 472), that as the injury complained of was caused by the fault of the servant during the performance of duties in the course of his employment, the master and servant were jointly and severally responsible in damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe defendant, Turcotte, was employed by the defendant, Desjardins, as a travelling clerk to take orders for merchandise and, for this purpose, it had been agreed that Desjardins should furnish him with a vehicle and a harness which Turcotte used in the course of his employment, soliciting orders and delivering merchandise. This arrangement had been made, at Turcotte's suggestion, in order that he might not be blamed for driving his employer's horse at excessive speed.\nWhile engaged in the course of his said employment, Turcotte was driving the horse and vehicle mentioned, at a trot, round the corner of two public streets in Montreal, and carelessly drove against one Callery, the deceased, who was in the act of crossing one of the streets, thereby causing injuries which resulted in his death.\nIn an action by the widow and two daughters of the deceased to recover damages against both master and servant, jointly and severally, they were successful in both courts below.\nDescarries K.C.. for the appellants.\nAtwater K.C. and Morrison for the respondents.\nDescarries K.C.. for the appellants. The death of Callery was not due to any fault of Turcotte, but resulted from his own imprudence and want of proper care in attempting to cross the street in front of the approaching vehicle.\nThe defendant, Desjardins, cannot be held responsible in damages for the act of his employee because, at the time of the injury, Turcotte was driving his own horse, the harness and vehicle being merely loaned to him, and he alone could be held liable, in case of negligence. See Beauchamp, Code Civil, art. 1053, No. 716; Moffette v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[2]; Brouillard v. Cot\u00e9[3]; Garand v.

The defendant, Turcotte, was disobeying the city bylaw No. 50, section 31, which declares that \"No person shall drive any horse faster than a walk, when coming out of any cross street or court-yard into any of the main or leading streets, in the said city or in turning any corner of a street in the same\" He therefore, was guilty of gross carelessness; Grand Trunk Railway Co.v.Hainer[5]; Sault Ste.

Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, were of opinion that the order had been properly granted.\nA possessory action will not lie in a case where the trouble de possession did not occur in consequence of the exercise of an adverse claim of right or title to the lands in question, and is not of a permanent or recurrent nature. Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, were of opinion that, under the circumstances of the case, a possessory action would lie.\nP. brought an action au possessoire against the company for interference with his rights in a stream, for damages and for an injunction against the commission or continuance of the acts complained of. On service of process, the company ceased these acts, admitted the rights and title of P., alleged that they had so acted in the belief that a verbal agreement made with P. some years previously gave them permission to do so, that this license had never been cancelled but was renewed from year to year and that, although the privilege had not been exercised by them during the two years immediately preceding the alleged trespass in 1904, it was then still subsisting and in force, and tendered $40 in compensation for any damage caused by their interference with P.'s rights.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting, that, as there had been no formal cancellation of the verbal agreement or withdrawal of the license thereby given, it had to be regarded, notwithstanding non user, as having been tacitly renewed, that it was still in force in 1904, at the time of the acts complained of and that P. could not recover in the action as instituted. The Chief Justice, on his view of the evidence, dissented from the opinion that the agreement had been tacitly renewed for the year 1904.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ. (dissenting). As the appeal involved merely a question as to costs, it should not be entertained.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Gagn\u00e9, in the Superior Court, District of Chicoutimi, whereby the plaintiff's right to recover damages was reserved and an injunction made absolute in his favour with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and questions at issue on the appeal sufficiently appear in the head-note and statements in the judgments now reported.\nThe dispositions of the formal judgments in the courts below, which are specially referred to are as follows:\nGagn\u00e9 J.

G. Stuart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The respondent, plaintiff in the court below, brought an action in the Superior Court at Chicoutimi against the appellants, in respect of interferences with his rights, alleging that he and his predecessors had been for a great number of years in possession as proprietors of a water-power on the Chicoutimi River; that the defendants, now appellants, owned and operated a large pulp-mill situated a short distance above on the same river in connection with which they used several machines known as barking mills ; that the refuse from these machines, consisting of bark, sawdust, etc., was dumped into the river and thence carried by the current into the flume and cistern of his mill thereby injuring the power, mill, and machinery, and generally causing the plaintiff damages for which he claims in compensation $2,000.\nTo this action the defendants filed a plea admitting the plaintiffs' title to the water-power alleged to have been interfered with and denying that they ever at any time claimed any right or title to the use or possession of any portion of it ; and they alleged affirmatively that such refuse as did get into the river was put there as the result of a misunderstanding; that during previous years an agreement existed under which the bark and sawdust were thrown into the river and that portion that reached the plaintiff's premises was under agreement removed by the latter at the defendants' cost, and they undertook to prevent in future a recurrence of the trespass complained of.\nAn interlocutory injunction was applied for and granted when the action was first launched.\nAs I read the pleadings and evidence the plaintiffs' title was not in dispute. The trespass complained of is proved as is also the agreement alleged by the defendants to have existed during previous years. I do not find evidence to support the allegation that this agreement was renewed for 1904, and the evidence that defendants continued to dump their refuse into the river after being notified that the agreement was at an end in my opinion is far from conclusive.\nA preliminary question of procedure raised for the first time by the judges in the court of appeal, though not argued there as stated by the appellants in their factum, is pressed on us here. I give the facts as they appear by the record.\nIn the Superior Court the plaintiff's pretensions were maintained except as to his claim for damages for which his recourse was reserved. The interlocutory injunction was declared permanent and the possessory conclusions of his declaration maintained. Both parties deeming themselves aggrieved by the judgment appealed, the respondent to the Court of Review and the appellants to the Court of King's Bench, as each had under the Quebec Code of Procedure the right to do. The case came on for hearing in review first and then the defendants made this formal declaration:\nAussi sans aucunement acquiescer au jugement de premi\u00e8re instance- dont nous entendons appeler, en ce que nos offres auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es valables, en ce que l'action comme l'injonction auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9es avec d\u00e9pens, nous soumettons humblement que le pr\u00e9sent appel du demandeur doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe Court of Review held unanimously that as to the damages, which was the only point submitted, the judgment of the Superior Court was right. Then the appellants here, who had succeeded in review, being within the delay prosecuted their appeal to the Court of King's Bench and the majority of that court held that the injunction had been properly granted, but they said that the appellants should have appealed from the judgment of the Court of Review which had become, under article 1203 of the Code of Procedure, the judgment of the Superior Court. As I understand the consid\u00e9rants of their Lordships' judgment they contend that the judgment from which the appeal should have been taken was the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review and not the judgment of the Superior Court sitting as the court of first instance, although both are absolutely the same in so far as the \"dispositifs\" go. In review the judgment of the Superior Court is confirmed purely and simply, and the technical point raised in appeal was merely as to the date of the judgment from which the appeal was taken. When, as I said before, the judgment was rendered in the Superior Court both parties had the right to appeal instanter from that judgment either to the Court of Review or the Court of King's Bench. One appeal must be taken within eight days and the other can be taken at any time within six months, but if at once after judgment rendered both parties appealed as they subsequently did, one to the Court of Review and the other to the Court of King's Bench, the judgment appealed from would necessarily have been the judgment of the Superior Court of date 8th March, 1906, and because by the judgment of the Court of Review that judgment must thereafter bear a different date, though it remained the same in substance and form, the appeal, in the opinion of their Lordships,; must be refused. In this highly technical view I cannot concur.\nIt would be interesting to know what the position would be if in this case the judgment of the Court of Review had not been rendered until after the expiration of the six months within which the defendants were obliged to take their appeal. Which would then be the judgment appealed from, or when would the delay of six months expire?\nNow, as to the merits.\nBy the judgment below the injunction was maintained, the conclusions of the possessory action were granted and the recourse of the respondent for the damages he alleges to have suffered is reserved to him.\nI am of opinion that the injunction should not have been granted and that the possessory conclusions of the action should have been dismissed; and I would reform the judgment below to that extent and reserve the right of the respondent to claim such damages as he may have suffered, the two courts below having concurred in the opinion that on the pleadings and evidence it is impossible to determine the quantum of damages.\nArticle 957 Code of Procedure:\nAny judge of the Superior Court may grant an interlocutory order of injunction in any of the following cases:\n1. At the time of issuing the writ of summons:\na. Whenever it appears by the petition that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and that such relief consists, in whole or in part, in restraining the commission or continuance of any act or operation, either for a limited period or perpetually:\nb. Whenever the commission or continuance of any act or operation would produce waste, or would produce great or irreparable injury;\n2. During the pendency of a suit:\na. Whenever the commission or continuance of any act or operation during the suit would produce waste, or would produce great or irreparable injury;\nb. Whenever the opposite party is doing or is about to do some act in violation of the plaintiff's rights, or in contravention of law, respecting the subject of the action, which is of a nature to render the final judgment ineffectual.\nBy the plea to the action and the answer to the petition for an injunction defendant admit plaintiffs right to the water-power and deny that they ever had any intention to interfere with it. They further declare that the improper use which they admittedly made of the river had been so made under the belief that an agreement admitted to have previously existed between them and the plaintiffs was still in force and under which a mode of settling the damages complained of had been fixed.\nIt has been suggested that there is a difference between the case of the appellants as stated in their pleadings and as made by the evidence, and that in fact the trespass was continued after the suit was brought.\nThe only evidence to support the statement that the appellants continued to throw their refuse into the river after the injunction is to be found on page 36, lines 20 et seq.\nDubuc, at page 86, line 10, says that he forbade his employees to do this. On pages 87 and 88 Dubuc explains what occurred. Dubuc at page 90 denies having allowed any of the refuse to get into the river from the time the injunction was actually served, and no attempt is made to cross-examine him on that point.\nTo justify interfering by interlocutory injunction the court must be of opinion that there is a substantial question to be tried and some legal right as to property to be protected during the litigation. The granting of an injunction is, it is true, an act dependent on the discretion of the court, but in exercising this discretion the court must consider whether the act complained of will produce injury to the applicant or whether the injury can be condoned for by damages.\nThe only question here was whether the bark or refuse had been thrown into the river by the permission of the plaintiffs' employees. There was no attempt made to put in issue the legal right of the plaintiff to prevent the defendants from doing what was complained of. (See evidence by Racey, at page 38 of the case on appeal, lines 20 et seq.) If done without the permission of plaintiff's employees the defendants had incurred a liability for which there was a remedy full and complete by an action of damages. The plaintiffs had for a couple of years acquiesced in what defendants were doing and had accepted compensation from them, thus shewing that it was not impossible to fix compensation for future injury. Omerod v. Todmorden Mill Co.[1].\nAs to the possessory conclusions, which were maintained by the judgment of the Superior Court, the defendants admit plaintiffs' title as alleged\u2014affirm they have no right or title to the use or possession of the water-power and say that what was done was under the erroneous impression that the previous existing agreement was renewed, and that the trespass complained of ceased when the action was brought, and for such damage as was caused they offer in compensation the sum of forty dollars.\nOn these facts would a possessory action lie? Leconte, No. 93, first paragraph :\nIl ne suffit pas qu'un fait porte atteinte au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, m\u00eame au droit de possession, pour qu'il donne lieu \u00e0 une action possessoire, il faut que le possesseur soit emp\u00each\u00e9, ou de moins menac\u00e9.dans sa possession m\u00eame, que le trouble soit tel, que l'intention de celui qui le cause, d'exercer un droit \u00e0 la possession ou \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit manifeste.\n* * * * * 94. On doit r\u00e9puter trouble de possession, dit cet auteur, tout acte emportant pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou \u00e0 un droit de servitude.\nMais puisque le m\u00eame acte peut, suivant l'intention de celui qui le commet, passer pour un trouble de possession ou pour un pur fait nuisible, comment le demandeur fera-t-il pour qualifier sa demande? Ne faut-il pas admettre que l\u2019action possessoire sera r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement form\u00e9e, toutes les fois qu'il sera possible d'interpr\u00e9ter le fait d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la justice comme un acte de possession? Sans doute, j'admets que dans ce cas la demande sera bien dirig\u00e9e, en ce sens qu'aucune faute n'\u00e9tant \u00e0 impliquer au plaignant, le3 frais de citation devront \u00eatre mis \u00e0 la charge du d\u00e9fendeur. Mais je n'oserais pas dire que l'action sera toujours possessoire; je crois au contraire que cela d\u00e9pendra de la r\u00e9ponse que fera le d\u00e9fendeur. S'il d\u00e9clare qu'il n'agissait pas jure domini, qu'il n'a aucune pr\u00e9tention \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter des actes semblables il me r\u00e9pugne de voir une action possessoire l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n'y a nul d\u00e9bat sur la possession.\nThe same doctrine will be found in Dalloz, Repertoire de Jurisprudence, No. 53, vo. \"Action possessoire.\" See also, Bioche \"Actions possessoires\" page 11, para. 32; Pothier, \"Possession\" No. 39; Boitard, \"Procedure\" page 425; Price v. Girard (Chronique Judiciaire de Beaubien); Bertrand v. Levesque[2]. Both these cases were decided in review by a very strong bench.\nThe nature of the act complained of here was in itself sufficient to shew that the possessory action should not have been brought because evidently there was no intention manifested by the appellants to exercise any claim of right. Dalloz again, loc. cit. para. 59. And by their plea the defendants made it abundantly clear, that they did not pretend to do the acts complained of jure domini.\nI wish to repeat that I am clearly of opinion that under the Quebec Code the disturbance must be one of a permanent or recurrent nature; isolated acts of interference give rise to an action for damages but do not constitute a ground of action to justify the plain- tiff in haying recourse to the action n\u00e9gatoire which corresponds to the Roman actio negatoria. The Roman actio negatoria applied principally in cases in which the defendant claimed to be entitled to do the act complained of by virtue of a servitude affecting the owner's land.\nI would allow the appeal. The action of the respondent is dismissed and the injunction dissolved, with costs in all the courts sauf recours as to the damages suffered. I would add that this conclusion has been reached after much hesitation because I am obliged to differ from the trial judge, for whose great learning, and impartiality I have always entertained the highest respect, if I may with proper deference be permitted to say this much.\nGirouard J.\u2014Il s'agit ici d'une action possessoire intent\u00e9e le 30 mai, 1904, par le propri\u00e9taire inf\u00e9rieur d'un moulin \u00e0 scie, situ\u00e9 sur la rivi\u00e8re Chicoutimi, contre le propri\u00e9taire sup\u00e9rieur d'un moulin \u00e0 pulpe, qui, depuis le mois d'avril pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, jetait \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re quantit\u00e9s d'\u00e9corces, de ripes, sciures de bois et d'autres d\u00e9chets du m\u00eame genre. Il all\u00e8gue que ces mati\u00e8res, emport\u00e9es par le courant, finissent par obstruer le canal et le pouvoir d'eau de son moulin et en arr\u00eater la marche. Il conclut aussi \u00e0 $2,000 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nCette action fut pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d'un prot\u00eat notari\u00e9 qui fut signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante le 4 mai, 1904, et fut suivie d'une injonction provisoirement accord\u00e9e le 4 juin. Dans tous ces documents, il n'est fait aucune allusion \u00e0 l'arrangement qui jusqu'alors avait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 les relations de ces deux industriels, appuy\u00e9es apparemment sur des motifs de bon voisinage.\nPar sa d\u00e9fense produite le 9 juin, l'appelante nie d'abord qu'elle ait jamais voulu troubler l'intim\u00e9 dans la libre jouissance de son pouvoir d'eau, puis elle all\u00e8gue :\nIl a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu entre la d\u00e9fenderesse et le demandeur repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son agent M. Blair d'abord et ensuite par son agent, M. Racey, et ce verbalement, que lorsque la d\u00e9fenderesse serait comme elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pendant quelques jours avant l'action en cette cause, oblig\u00e9e de laisser tomber quelques \u00e9corces dans la dite rivi\u00e8re Chicoutimi, par suite de r\u00e9parations \u00e0 ses machines, qu'elle paierait au demandeur les services d'un homme pour emp\u00eacher les dites \u00e9corces de passer dans les dalles et dans le moulin du demandeur, ce que le demandeur a toujours accept\u00e9 et reconnu pour agr\u00e9able, et ce par ses dits agents, le dit homme pour enlever les dites \u00e9corces devant \u00eatre mis l\u00e0 par le demandeur et ses agents et la d\u00e9fenderesse devant payer son salaire.\nPuis elle offre $40.00 et les frais d'une action de cette classe en tout $49.75, pour payer les frais d'enl\u00e8vement des \u00e9corces pour le printemps de 1904, sauf \u00e0 parfaire.\nL'arrangement est prouv\u00e9 hors de tout doute, tant par l'agent de l'intim\u00e9, Blair, que par celui de l'appelante, Dubuc. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance (Gagn\u00e9 J.) est d'opinion qu'il n'\u00e9tait que pour l'ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il fut fait et qu'il ne s'applique pas \u00e0 l'avenir. Il est admis que si c'est l\u00e0 le vrai sens de l'entente, l'action doit \u00eatre maintenue ; si, au contraire, elle liait les parties tant qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e\u2014point que le savant juge n'examine pas\u2014elle doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e.\nLa preuve \u00e9tablit que cet arrangement fut suivi et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par les deux parties jusqu'au temps du prot\u00eat du 4 mai, l'intim\u00e9 remettant ses comptes de charges qui furent invariablement pay\u00e9s par l'appelante. Etait-il encore en force le printemps de 1904 et de fait toute la saison de cette ann\u00e9e l\u00e0? Voici la nature de l'arrangement tel que d\u00e9fini par Blair, l'agent de l'intim\u00e9 avec qui il fut fait :\nAu commencement, (sans donn\u00e9e de date pr\u00e9cise) je me suis object\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'il (l'agent de l'appelante Dubuc), envoie des ripes dans la rivi\u00e8re, par rapport que cela nous faisait un grand dommage et ensuite nous sommes venus \u00e0 une entente, que l'on mettrait. Je leur ai demand\u00e9 premi\u00e8rement de mettre un homme ou deux hommes pour tenir les ratelliers du moulin \u00e0 scie clairs et monsieur Dubuc n'a pas voulu. Ils m'ont demand\u00e9 de mettre des hommes moi-m\u00eame et qu'ils paieraient le co\u00fbt du nettoyage.\nQ. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait monsieur Blair?\nR. Oui, c'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nQ. Vous avez mis des hommes pour nettoyer les reteliers et la pulpe les payait?\nR. Oui. .\nEn transquestion, Blair ajoute :\nQ. Les arrangements dont vous avez parl\u00e9, monsieur Blair, c'\u00e9tait pour chaque ann\u00e9e, n'est-ce pas?\nR. Oui, chaque .ann\u00e9e.\nQ. Vous n'avez jamais fait d'arrangements pour donner le droit \u00e0 la compagnie de pulpe d'envoyer ses \u00e9corces dans l'avenir; ind\u00e9finiment, n'est-ce pas ?\nR. Non, jamais.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend non pas que l'arrangement obligeait les parties pour toujours, mais qu'il les liait tant qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, et qu'il' ne pouvait l'\u00eatre que pour les ann\u00e9es futures et non pour celle qui \u00e9tait commenc\u00e9e.\nEt d'abord, que comportait cet arrangement, sinon un louage d'ouvrage susceptible de la tacite reconduction aux termes de l'article 1667 du code civil, diff\u00e9rent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de l'article 1780 du code Napol\u00e9on? Mais il y a plus.\nComme je lis l'arrangement, il fut stipul\u00e9 qu'il durerait tant que l'une des parties n'y mettrait pas fin. C'est en effet de cette mani\u00e8re que les deux parties Tout interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 par leur conduite. Il ne parait pas qu\u2019il n\u2019ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment renouvel\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il fut agr\u00e9\u00e9 avant ou vers la saison de 1900, et les re\u00e7us des frais d'enl\u00e8vement des d\u00e9chets par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9stablissent qu'il fut suivi et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre en 1900 et 1901, sans renouvellement pour cette derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e. En 1902 et 1903, les \u00e9corces et d\u00e9chets furent br\u00fbl\u00e9s au br\u00fbleur que l'appelante venait de faire construire pour se conformer \u00e0 la loi, et cons\u00e9quemment l'intim\u00e9 n'eut pas de comptes \u00e0 envoyer pour ces deux ann\u00e9es. En 1904, le br\u00fbleur se brisa et ce fut pendant que l'appelante le r\u00e9para\u00eet qu'une petite partie des \u00e9cores et d\u00e9chets dont se plaint l'intim\u00e9\u2014un sixi\u00e8me de toute l'usine\u2014furent jet\u00e9s \u00e0 l'eau. Mais \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, l'ancien arrangement \u00e9tait en force :\nGet arrangement, dit Dubuc, a dur\u00e9 tout le temps que monsieur Blair a \u00e9t\u00e9 ici, et ses successeurs ne l'ont jamais r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 et tous les comptes qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de ce chef n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 disput\u00e9s, nous les avons pay\u00e9s.\nLe prot\u00eat du 4 mai, 1904, peut bien \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un acte de r\u00e9vocation, mais il ne peut avoir d'effet quant au pass\u00e9 ni m\u00eame pour l'ann\u00e9e courante. L'action est donc mal fond\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb faire enlever les d\u00e9chets par ses hommes et envoyer son compte \u00e0 l'appelante.\nAinsi que je l'entends, c'\u00e9tait encore la loi des parties le printemps de 1904, au dire m\u00eame de l'agent de l'intim\u00e9. Voici ce que Dubuc repr\u00e9senta \u00e0 l'agent nouveau de l'intim\u00e9, Racey :\nJe suis toujours pr\u00eat \u00e0 honorer votre compte d'apr\u00e8s l'arrangement que nous avons avec votre maison, si yous jugez que \u00e7a vaut la peine de nous l'envoyer. Monsieur Racey m'a r\u00e9pondu: correct.\nCe fut aussi de cette fa\u00e7on que Racey comprit la situation apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre renseign\u00e9: Q. Qu'est-ce que vous avez compris que cet arrangement-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait?\nR. Je ne le savais pas dans le temps, mais plus tard je suis venu \u00e0 bout de savoir quel \u00e9tait cet arrangement.\nQ. Quel \u00e9tait cet arrangement?\nR. Il payait des hommes pour faire faire l'ouvrage.\nQ. Vos hommes faisaient l'ouvrage et la pulpe les payait?\nR. Oui, et si j'avais compris cela, j'aurais accept\u00e9.\nQ. Vous n'avez pas compris que c'\u00e9tait cela?\nR. Non, jamais, quand je lui en ai parl\u00e9 plus tard, dans le mois de mai, il riait de cela.\nQ. Il vous a fait comprendre qu'il voulait payer?\nR. Oui, et plus tard il n'a pas voulu.\nDe l\u00e0 l'institution de l'action possessoire et la demande d'une injonction.\nComment Racey a-t-il pu conclure que Dubuc ne voulait pas payer? C'est ce que je ne puis concevoir. Dubuc n'a jamais d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne paierait pas. C'est tout le contraire qui apparait. Il envoya un de ses employ\u00e9s, Morrier, deniers en mains, lui offrir $40 pour les frais d'enl\u00e8vement et les d\u00e9pens d'une action de cette classe que Racey ne voulut pas m\u00eame prendre en consid\u00e9ration. Il voulait \u00e9videmment avoir recours au possessoire, lorsque sa possession \u00e9tait m\u00eame reconnue par Dubuc. Il ne r\u00e9plique pas que le montant n'est pas suffisant. Il ne lui envoie pas de compte. Il est sous l'impression, sans raison, que Dubuc n'\u00e9tait pas s\u00e9rieux et qu'il l'amusait. Au lieu de recourir au possessoire, il aurait d\u00fb faire enlever les d\u00e9chets, lui envoyer un compte du co\u00fbt de cet ouvrage et poursuivre en recouvrement, s'il n'\u00e9tait pas pay\u00e9. Je consid\u00e8re que dans les circonstances, le recours au possessoire est un abus, la possession n'\u00e9tant pas ni\u00e9e, mais m\u00eame admise.\nLa cour de premi\u00e8re instance et la cour d'appel ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'arrangement n'\u00e9tait que pour une ann\u00e9e; les savants juges ne le disent pas en toutes lettres, mais le r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9montre que c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 leur opinion, puisqu'ils maintiennent l'action possessoire et l'injonction. La cour de r\u00e9vision n'en dit rien, pour la raison toute simple que l'intim\u00e9 avait inscrit seulement sur la demande des dommages qui fut rejet\u00e9e par les deux cours quant \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\nJe suis d'avis que le premier arrangement \u00e9tait encore en force en 1904 et qu'il fut m\u00eame formellement renouvel\u00e9 cette ann\u00e9e l\u00e0, bien que ce renouvellement n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nQuant \u00e0 l'objection technique, que l'appelante n'a pas appel\u00e9 du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant en r\u00e9vision, je crois qu'elle est mal fond\u00e9e. C'\u00e9tait son droit d\u2019appeler comme elle le fit. L'intim\u00e9 ne souffre rien de ce que son inscription fut du jugement du juge Gagn\u00e9, puis qu'il fut confirm\u00e9 purement et simplement. Je la consid\u00e8re donc r\u00e9guli\u00e8re.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d'opinion d'accorder l'appel et de renvoyer l'action et l'injonction de l'intim\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours, sauf recours pour les frais d'enl\u00e8vement des \u00e9corces et d\u00e9chets.\nDavies J. (dissenting) concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014There is really nothing but costs involved in this appeal and for that if no other reason we should refuse to interfere.\nThe appellants owned a pulp mill about a mile higher up the same stream as that on which the respondent owned and ran a planing mill.\nIn 1897, being forbidden by law from throwing into the stream the refuse of such mills, the appellant's manager says it was agreed that until his company got a burner erected to burn the refuse, his company agreed to make their peace with the respondents by paying for the expenses of the removal of so much of the refuse as should lodge about and be detrimental to the respondent's mill and there were several payments made for that sort of service.\nThe facts are not put exactly thus by the respondents, but they admit some payments made for such a purpose. It is of little consequence which is exactly right, for appellant's burner was, in or before 1902, completed, and that ended any need or reasonable expectation for a continuation of any such arrangement.\nIn 1904, respondent desired to start up his mill and found not only a large quantity of old refuse from appellant's mill accumulated and needing removal, but also found further that appellants had renewed, in April of 1904, without asking permission their former practice of throwing refuse into the stream.\nThe manager of appellants did not when remonstrated with, stop this being done. After some time the respondent's manager caused a formal protest against this utterly unjustifiable conduct to be served on the other manager on the 4th of May, 1904.\nIt continued, however, from time to time and on the 2nd June, 1904, the respondent took steps to get, and on the 4th of June, 1904, got an injunction and sued for its continuation and also to recover damages.\nAt the trial the injunction was continued, but the right to recover damages in this action was refused and reserved to the respondent to be recovered by such means as the respondent found open to him.\nThe appellants' manager had after action tendered, he says, forty dollars to cover these damages. One is at a loss to know how, if honestly desirous of having damages assessed at the trial, the appellants could not bring it about when the respondent was pressing for it.\nThe respondent appealed unsuccessfully to have this done. The Court of Review dismissed this appeal, and a nice question of practice arises here, which I will not dwell upon, though, if the respondent's contention is right as to the effect of article 1203 of the Code of Procedure and the other things he urges, appellants ought not to have been heard here. I pass that and many other things that are or have been in the case to say that the court of appeal did not accept the contention of the respondent in this regard, but dismissed the appeal which the present appellants had carried there and upheld the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThe appellants by way of appeal therefrom, come here asserting that they had never denied and do not now deny the rights of the respondent to enjoy his property, and use it free from such disturbances as the respondent complains of.\nThey in this case suffer nothing, by the judgment and injunction standing, but the costs they have been ordered to pay.\nThey have escaped paying damages they certainly ought to have paid and, as I understood counsel to state without contradiction, nothing further had been done and the respondent's right to damages had been thus prescribed. If the material damages really were as the court seems to think after action, though I might have thought otherwise, the appellants practically escape. It is said, however, this action is wrong in form by claiming an injunction that is not maintainable.\nEven in this I do not agree. It is in the last analysis a question of fact whether it be so or not It has been passed upon and upheld by two courts at least in the Province of Quebec, and according to one contention, by three, and yet respondent is not satisfied.\nI do not think it is open to any one, in Quebec or elsewhere, by a continuous and persistent system of disturbing others in the enjoyment of their property, such as appellants were here guilty of, to say that because they do not do it in assertion of a right and in denial of the wronged party's title, the jurisdiction to enjoin cannot be exercised. It was continued even a day or two after the injunction. So persistent was appellants manager.\nIn Martineau & Delfausse, annotated edition of the Code of Procedure[3], there is collected under section 1064 of the same, such a review of the authorities as leads me to come to the conclusion that this action was on the evidence here rightly brought and has been properly maintained.\nIt is said, however, there was an agreement between the parties regulating this practice, but the only one proven is the one that I have shewn ended in 1902, and it never was revived.\nThere is a loose sort of conversation given as taking place between the managers, but exactly when or how or where is not clear.\nAt best it seems to have taken place after at least a good deal of what is complained of was done. The evidence is very unsatisfactory unless we accept entirely, and discard all else, a sentence or two of the appellants' manager which I am not disposed to do. I would infer, if anything in the way of assenting to it was done by the respondent, it was conditional upon settling for the past and ceasing to disturb, and that no such spirit of settling was ever shewn by appellants' manager, but rather a contemptuous treatment of the other manager, and a continuation of the disturbances which rendered an injunction necessary.\nIt rests on the evidence of appellants' manager and he swears that the protest and the suit for injunction were on one and the same day.\nQ. Monsieur Racey a dit qu'il vous avait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 le quatorze mai qu'il allait vous protester et que vous auriez r\u00e9pondu en riant?\nR. Je ne me rappelle pas de cela.\nQ. Avez-vous re\u00e7u un prot\u00eat?\nR. Je crois avoir re\u00e7u un prot\u00eat en m\u00eame temps que l'action; une heure avant ou ensemble.\nIf that is a fair specimen of the reliability of his evidence when we know from the record these two events were nearly a month apart, I want evidence of some one more credible to go upon than one so reckless, before I reverse the courts below.\nMoreover, the story is not that which is pleaded. The pleading alleges only one bargain. The evidence of this man shews two. It is only the last that is applicable if at all to this case.\nIf it had in fact transpired as he puts it with nothing done after it, we would likely have seen it so pleaded.\nThe other manager's story clearly shews when read as a whole that so much of this story as he assents to was conditional upon getting together and settling as I have already said.\nThe only right bound or affected by the judgment below being one of costs, the cases of Moir v. The Village of Huntingdon (1), and Schlomann v. Dowker (2), ought, I submit, to be followed, and the appeal be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan and Duff J J. concurred with Mr. Justice Girouard.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Belleau, Belleau & Belleau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\n[1] 11 Q.B.D. 155, at p. 162.\n[2] Q.R. 28 S.C. 460.\n[3] P. 691.\n"}
