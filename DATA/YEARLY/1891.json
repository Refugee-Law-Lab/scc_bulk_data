C.\nP. having filed a tierce-opposition to a judgment obtained by the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec in 1884, in a suit commenced by information in 1790 against the succession of one M. P. in order to have the judgment set aside on the ground that it declared escheated to the Crown a part of the Seigniory of Grondines of which he (P. ) had been in possession for a great number of years and which judgment it was alleged had been obtained illegally and by fraud and collusion, one M. au advocate, who had purchased all the rights of the Crown in the said succession, intervened and asked for the dismissal of the tierce-opposition. The Attorney-General and the curator to the succession of M. P., the only parties to the judgment sought to be set aside, in answer to P.'s tierce-opposition merely appeared and declared that \"ils s'en rapportent justice.\" Upon the issues being joined on the tierce-opposition and on the intervention and evidence taken the Superior Court dismissed M 's intervention and maintained P.'s tierce-opposition. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by the crown and M. jointly, this judgment was reversed, and P.'s tierce-opposition was dismissed.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada :\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, 1st that M. had no locuestandi to intervene the sale to him of the crown s rights being void (a) because it was a sale of litigious rights to an advocate prohibited by arts. 1485 and 1583 C. 0. and therefore null under arts. 14 and 990 0. C. C; (b) because it was tainted with champerty, arts. 14, 989, 990 0.0.; (c) because M. admitted he had no interest in the, case, art. 154 C. P. C.\n2nd. That P. being in posession of the property declared escheated to the crown in a proceeding to which he was not a party had a sufficient interest under the circumstances in the case to file a tierce-opposition, and that the judgment of 1884 should be set aside because inter alia, (a) it was obtained by fraud and collusion; (b) the action' being prescribed in 1884 ('Arts. 2216, 2242 2265 0. C) P. under art. 2187 had the right to avail him~ self of this prescription.\nFounder J. dissented on. the ground that P. not having alleged or shown a right 'superior to that of the crown his tierce-opposition should be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, whereby a tierce op-position filed by the appellant to a judgment rendered in the Superior Court of the 14th June, 1884, was maintained.\nUpon an information filed by the Attorney-General for. the King in 1790, claiming as escheated to the crown certain real estate, viz: a portion of the Seigniory of Grondines forming part of the succession of one Marie Fiery widow of Jean Baptiste Hamelin Fran chevilee, and alleging that she died intestate and without heirs, and that the deceased was a bastard the curator to the succession appeared and pleaded to the information, and no further steps or proceedings were taken until 11th March, 1884, when Hon. L. O. Taillon, Attorney-General for Province of Quebec obtained a reprise d'instance\\, and after certain proceedings were taken to appoint another curator, &c, and the filing of an amended information, and the hearing of the case on the merits, the Superior Court on the 14th June 1884, rendered a judgment in favor of the crown. On the 24th. July, 1884, the Queen, represented by the Commissioner of Crown Lands sold to Gr. P. La-fontaine, as agent for T\u201e T. Moreau, among other property, all that heretofore described as forming part of the estate and succession of the late Marie Piery, belonging to Her Majesty par droit de desherence, and on the 24th March, 1885, T. T. Moreau, as assignee of the crown, brought an action against the present appellant, claiming the property in question.\nUpon the service of this action the present appellant filed an opposition tierce opposition) to the judgment of June, 1884, which declared the property of which he had been in possession for over 30 years, as escheated to the crown, and the respondent for and on behalf of Moreau intervened.\nThe pleadings and documentary and oral evidence produced on the tierce opposition and on the intervention are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.\nThe Superior Court rendered the judgment now appealed from, on the 1st February, 1887, maintaining the opposition of the appellant and dismissing 1. 1. Moreau's intervention.\nOn an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), that court allowed the appeal on the ground that the present appellant, in order to succeed on his tierce opposition, should have alleged an interest on a right superior to that of the party who had obtained the judgment sought to be set aside, but reserved to the appellant his right to have it declared by the court upon regular proceedings, that the judgment complained of does not affect the immovables in appellants s possession.\nIrvine Q.O., and Stuart Q.C., for appellant, and Beique Q.C., for respondents.\nThe arguments and authorities relied on by counsel are reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C-J.I feel very great embarrassment in arriving at a conclusion in this case in consequence of the great diversity 01 opinion of my brother judges from the Province of Quebec for both of whose opinions it is needless to say I entertain the highest respect and from the able manner in which both have dealt with the question at issue and to which judgments, having been accorded the privilege of reading them, I have given the most serious consideration\nThe question, independent of the merits, seems to resolve itself very much into a matter of procedure namely, as to the right of Price, an intervening party, to make a fierce opposition to the judgment in this case, the learned judge of the Superior Court holding that there was a manifest interest in the opposant by tierce opposition to call in question the legality of the judgment in the present case, declaring the Seignory Grondines, or. any part thereof, belonging to or in the possession of the opposant, to the property of Her Majesty as against the opposant who was not a party to the present action. On appeal the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench, on the contrary, holding that to authorize a person, not a party to a judgment, to form a tierce opposition to this judgment, it was not sufficient that he may have an interest contrary to him who has obtained this judgment but it is necessary that this interest should be founded on a right superior to that of the party who has obtained this judgment in his favor.\nI cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that Price the tiers opposant had no interest which was affected by the judgment in this case. He is in possession of the land in question, and has been so for a very long time, some fifty years, adverse to the crown, and L cannot think his right to this possession would not be seriously affected by the said judgment; in addition to which this judgment would be registered and could continue in force for thirty years, during all of which time it would seriously affect the ability of the tiers opposant to sell or deal with the property and the title under which it is fair to assume he claims to hold this possession; and in any proceeding instituted to dispossess the opposant this judgment, it appears to me, would necessarily be the basis of the plaintiff's claim. If so, I cannot avoid thinking that he has a substantial and direct interest in having it removed if he can show as he alleges, that the judgment was fraudulently, improperly and illegally obtained, and therefore I cannot help thinking he had a right to file an opposition to such judgment by virtue of Art. 110 CO P. which declares that any person whose interests are affected by a judgment rendered in a case in which neither he nor the persons representing him were made parties can file an opposition to such judgment.\nMy brother Taschereu, whose views I feel constrained to adopt has in a very full and elaborate judgment, traced the history and merits of this, I may say, very extraordinary case, from its inception, more than one hundred years ago, and has discussed at length the law as applicable to it, and has, so far as I am capable of forming an opinion, shown that this appeal should be allowed. Consequently I am relieved from doing more than concurring in that judgment which he will deliver, which, however, I must say, I do with the greatest diffidence.\nI therefore think the appeal should be allowed the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored. FOURNIER J.\u2014La pr\u00e8sente contestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e sur la tierce-opposition produite par l'appelant Price, au jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieuce, en date du 14 juin 1884 accordant \u00e0 la Couronne, par droit de desh\u00e9rence, la possession et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la succession de dame Marie Piery, veuve de Jean-Baptiste Hamelin Fran-chieville.\nCette procedure avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e par Alexandre Gray, procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9, par une information en date du 9 juillet 1790, dirig\u00e9e contre J.-Bte. Gueyrault, nomm\u00e9 curateur \u00e0 la succession vacante de la dite dame Piery.\nLe 7 juillet 1791, Nicolas Piery, Marie Madeleine Piery et Marie Scholastique Piery intervinrent pour reclamer la dite succession contre le curateur. Le m\u00eame jour 11 fut permis \u00e0 Jenkins Williams, Ecr., soliciteur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, vu le d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'Alexandre Gray, procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de reprendre l'instance an nom de Sa Majest\u00e9.\nLe 11 mars 1881 l'honorable Louis Olivier Taillon procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province de Quebec, obtint de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure la permission de reprendre l'instance en cette cause en remplacement de Jenkins Williams. Le 8 mars de la m\u00e9me ann\u00e9e Adalbert Fontaine, de Qu\u00e9bec, avocat, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur en remplacement de Gueyrault, reprit, le 14 du m\u00eame mois l'instance comme d\u00e9fendeur.\nL'intervention de Nicolas Fiery et autres fut renvoy\u00e9e le 4 juin par jugement de l'honorable juge Casault. Et la cour le 14 juin, consid\u00e9rant que Sa Majest\u00e9 avait prouv\u00e9 les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de son information, d\u00e9clara par son jugement que les biens de la dite succession appartenaient \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 par droit de desh\u00e9-rence et ordonna an curateur Fontaine, \u0141a-qualit\u00e9, de rendre compte \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 de sa gestion et administration des biens de la dite succession et de payer et d\u00e9livrer \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 les argents, droits, credits, effets, titres et s\u00fbret\u00e9s appartenant \u00e0 la dite succession, avec la possession des terrains et parties de seigneurie, etc., pour 1 usage de Sa Majeste.\nL'appelant Price qui so trouve en possession d'immeubles appartenant \u00e0 cette succession s'est porte tiers-opposant au jugement qui a ordonn\u00e9 au curateur d'en remettre la possession \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 qui en est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire par droit de desh\u00e9rence.\nIlse son opposition principalement sur les moyens suivants :\u2014que dans une certaine cause pendante, savoir, le no 1796, ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi par Tancr\u00e8de Toussaint Moreau, comme acqu\u00e9reur des droits appartenant \u00e0 la couronne en vertu du jugement qui l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire par droit do d\u00e9sh\u00e9renoe des biens de la succession Piery, le 14 juin 1884, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et qu'en qualit\u00e9 de cessionnaire de ces droits ii r\u00e9clame du tiers-opposant, une partie do la seigneurie des Girondines appel\u00e9e le fief do Francheville, dont celui-ci est en possession paisible comme propri\u00e9taire depuis un grand nombre d'ann\u00e9es, avec aussi thus les arr\u00e9rages et revenus per\u00e7us par le dit opposant, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du paiement d'une somme de $100,000. Quo le dit Tancr\u00e8de T. Moreau, cherche comme acqu\u00e9reur des droits de la Couronne \u00e0 priver le dit opposant do sa possession et jouissance do la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'en cons\u00e9quenee celui-ci a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 so porter opposant au jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en cette cause le 14 \"juin 1884.\nCette action do Tancr\u00e8de T. Moreau est encore pendante\nPrice all\u00e8gue encore dans son opposition que ce jugement est illegal, irr\u00e9gulier, erron\u00e9 et non fond\u00e9 en faits et en loi et devrait \u00e9tre annul\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 et mis do c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour les raisons suivantes :\n10 Parcequ'il n'y a aucune preuve \u00e9tablissant quo Marie Pi\u00e9ry \u00e9tait une enfant ill\u00e9gitime. 2\u00b0 Parce qu'il n'y a pas do preuve que la dite Marie Piery fut pro- pri\u00e9taire d'aucune partie de la dite seigneurie des Grondinss, parce que si la dite Marie Piery. e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9gitime, sa succession vacante n'aurait pas appartenu \u00e0 la Couronne de France; que tous les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s faits dans la dite cause depuis 1884 sont entach\u00e9s de fraude irr\u00e9guliers et ill\u00e9gaux.\nQue le jugement renvoyant l'intervention de Nicolas Piery et al a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu par surprise, etc., etc. Et l'opposant conclut \u00e0 ce que tous les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s faits depuis 1884 soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s frauduleux et collusoires et le jugement du 14 juin 1884 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul.\nSur cette opposition Tancr\u00e8de T. Moreau a \u00e9t\u00e8 re\u00e7u partie intervenante et a produit une d\u00e9fense en droit \u00e0 cette partie de la dite opposition qui se lit comme suit :\nThat the intervention in this cause filed on the seventh day of September, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-one, by Nicolas Piery, Marie Madeleine Piery, and Marie Scholastique Piery, should not have been dismissed and the judgment in this cause rendered on the fourth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-four, dismissing such intervention, was obtained from the court by surprise, and is illegal null and void in as much as there was at the date of such indgment legal presumption of the death of such intervening parties and of their attorneys, and that no judgment could legally be rendered upon such intervention until the heirs and legal representatives of the said intervening parties had been legally summoned to continue the said intervention.\nThat the .proceedings taken in the name of the Crown for the pur~ pose of forcing the said intervening parties to appoint attorneys in lieu of their said attorneys being since deceased and the judgment rendered upon such proceedings are, for the same.reason, illegal, null and void and of no effect.\nParceque cette partie de la dite opposition de l'opposant dolt \u00eatre retranch\u00e9e et rejet\u00e9e en admettant que les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s en seraient vrais.\nParce que l'opposant excipe du droit d'autrui.\nLe dit intervenant plaida aussi au m\u00e9rite de la dite opposition les moyens suivants :\u2014\nQue l'opposant n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l'opposition et dans l'action intent\u00e9e par Sa Majest\u00e9 pour recouvrer les biens de la succession de feu Dame Marie Piery et qu'il n'est pas l\u00e9s\u00e9 par le jugement rendu en icelle.\nQue l'oppposant n'a aucun droit dans les dits biens, qu'il n'en est pas,. n'\u00e9tait pas et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 lui ou ses auteurs, propri\u00e9taire et en pos- l session des dits biens revendiqu\u00e9s par la dite action et qu'il n'all\u00e8gue F aucun titre.\nQue les pr\u00e9tenduss ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s et informalit\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par l'opposant n'ont pu lui causer aucun tort et lui pr\u00e9judicier, et queen supposant pour un moment qu'elles seraient fond\u00e9es ce que l'intervenant nie ce ne seraient que des nullit\u00e9s sans grief et dont l'opposant ne peut se plaindre.\nQue tous et chacun des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la dite opposition, sont faux et mal fond\u00e9s, et que l'intervenant les nie tous sp\u00e9cialement, sp\u00e9cifiquement, et comme s'il les niait seriatim.\nQue toute la proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et l\u00e9galement, pour et au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9 et qu'il n'y a eu aucune fraude ou collusion ou artifice, parce que les dits intervenants Piery, seuls, pourraient invoquer les dits moyens et se plaindre des dites procedures, et que l'opposant est sans int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le faire\nSur la contestation, ainsi li\u00e9d, apr\u00e8s preuve faite de part et d'autre, la cour Sup\u00e9rieuee rendit jugement le ler f\u00e9vrier 1887, maintenant l'opposition de l'appelant.\nThat the action and intervention of the heirs Piery were pending at the time the Court of Common Pleas ceased to exist 1793 and that no evidence had ever been adduced in proof of the allegations of the principal demand or of the intervention; that no proceedings were taken to revive the said suit before any existing Court of the Province, by and on behalf of his Majesty George III.\nThat the action against the defendant, Gueyrault. was a personal action to account, which, had the King established a right of property in the succession or shewn provisional possession thereof under judicial authority a judgment to account would have condemned the defend ant, Gueyrault, in the amount proved, but upon default of the Crown to prove property or possession of the estate, the action could not be maintained : '\nThat all the parties being dead, Attorney-General Taillon could not validly move to continue the suit in lieu of Jenkin Wiliiams, Solicitor General to King George III :\nThat if the case could be revived after a century it could only be done by some one representing King George III against the heirs or legal representatives of J. B. Gueyrault, by means of an action em reprise d'instance commencing with a writ of summons. That King George III was not shewn to be vested with any pro-perty in the succession, nor to have been put in provisional possession thereof :\nThat Mr. Fontaine was not the heir or legal representative of Gueyrault and he is not shewn to have been in the possession of the estate in question:\nThat there is no pleading or demand in the Record, by Her Majesty claiming the succession as her property, and the judgment, in consequence, was ultra perty and inoperative.\nCe jugement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 porte en appel \u00e0 la cour du Bane de la Reine, a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 sur le principe que l'appelant n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait un droit sup\u00e9rieur a celui de la partie qui avait obtenu .ce jugement en sa faveur.\nEn effet, les moyens invoqu\u00e9s consistent principalement dans l'invocation des droits des h\u00e9ritiers Piery, s'il en existe, et de moyens d'irrr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s .dans la proc\u00e9dure\nLa cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que pour \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 former une tierce-opposition un jugment, iI ne suffit pas d'avoir un int\u00e9r\u00e8t contraire \u00e0 celui qui a obtenu le jugement, mais ii faut que cet int\u00e9r\u00eat soit fond\u00e9 sur un droit sup\u00e9rieur a celui de la partie qui a obtenu ce jugement en sa faveur. Que l'objet de la tierce-opposition n'est pas seulement de faire annuler le jugement dont se plaint le tiers-opposant, mais de faire prononcer le tribunal contradictoirement sur le m\u00e9rite des droits r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par le tiers-opposant et par celui qui a obtenu le jugement attaqu\u00e9 par la tierce-opposition.\nDans cette cause, le tiers-opposant, ni par les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de son opposition, ni par ses conclusions, n'a mis en question le droit de la couronne aux biens qui out \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par feu Marie Piery lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. II a simplement demand\u00e9 que le jugement fut annul\u00e9 pour des vices de forme dans la procedure et pour absence de preuves, et en invoquant le droit d'autrui. Ces allegations sont tout \u00e0 fait insuffisantes. Le recours extraordinaire \u00e0 la tierce-opposition nest pas accord\u00e9 pour faire declarer nul un jugement pour des irr\u00e8gularit\u00e9s, ii faut, comme le dit le jugement de la cour du Bane de la Reine, que l'opposant all\u00e8gue et d\u00e9montre un droit sup\u00e9rieur au droit de celui qui a obtenu le jugement. Ceci est confirm\u00e9 par toutes les autorit\u00e9s.\nIl v a plusieurs conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour avoir droit de former opposition \u00e0 un jugement. La premi\u00e8re de toutes est d'\u00e9tablir que le jugement dont se plaint l'opposant lui cause un prejudice. Comment peut-il d\u00e9montrer ce prejudice s'il n'al\u00e8gue pas son droit, s'il ne fait pas voir qu'il a aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s r\u00e9clam\u00e9es, un titre qui, mis en comparaison avec celui de son adversaire, doit l'emporter et lui faire adjuger l\u00e9galement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est une condition essentielle de la tierce-opposition de mettre la cour en \u00e9tat de juger sur la validit\u00e9 des titres respectifs des parties.\nLe droit, (dit Bioche), doit \u00eatre Certain et l\u00e9gitime; en cas d'incertitude on ne saurait admettre une attaque dirig\u00e9e contre une d\u00e9cision de justice et autoriser peut-\u00eatre une procedure frustratoire (1).\nDalloz dit (2) :\u2014\nAussi la premiere condition pour agir par la voie de la tierce-opposition est d'\u00e9prouver un prejudice \u00e0 nos droits fart. 474). Cette disposition repose sur ce principe de droit et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 : pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, pas d'action.\nCarr\u00e9 et Chauveau (1):\nCe n'est pas un int\u00e9r\u00eat, mais un droit quelconque compromis directement, qui est indispensable pour l\u00e9gitimer la voie de la tierce-opposition.\nEt plus loin il ajoute :\nIl faut, ainsi que l'enseignent MM. Favard de Langlade (1), et Poncet (1), que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui sert de mobile au tiers-opposant soit reel, l\u00e9gitime, en d'autres termes que l'atteinte port\u00e9e \u00e0 l'existence d'un de ses droits actifs autorise l'emploi du recours extraordinaire qui lui est ouvert contre cette sentence pour en obtenir la r\u00e9tractation (1). Appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans ces autorit\u00e9s, ii est \u00e9vident que la procedure de l'opposant est tout \u00e0 fait vicieuse. D'abord, parce qu'il n'a fait aucune allegation qui puisse mettre la cour en \u00e9tat de '. decider le m\u00e9rite des pr\u00e9tentions respectives des parties \u2014n'ayant all\u00e9gu\u00e9 aucun titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e8 en litige la cour ne pent decider que l'opposant a un meilleur titre que le contestant (l'intim\u00e9); qu'il ne fait voir aucun prejudice, puisqu'il ne montre aucun titre\u2014et le titre qu'il doit produire doit \u00eatre certain et l\u00e9gitime. Loin de prendre cette position, qui est la seule que puisse prendre le tiers-opposant, il no conclut pas m\u00eame \u00e0 ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il r\u00e9clame lui soit adjug\u00e9e; ii conclut simplement \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 du jugement en faveur de l'intim\u00e9. C'est-\u00e0-dire Qu'il fait une demande qui ne decide rien ni sur le droit de la Couronne \u00e0 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni sur le sien. C'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il fait comme dit Bioche :\nUne attaque contre une d\u00e9cision de justice par une proc\u00e9dure frustiatoire.\nLes droits de la couronne dans cette cause sont ceux des h\u00e9ritiers de Marie Fiery veuve de J.-Bte Hamelin Francheville, morte en 1785, sans laisser de repr\u00e9sentants. Ces droits appartenaient du moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, an domaine public par droit de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence, on succession irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re Laurent dit (1) :\nQuoique les successeurs irr\u00e9guliers n'aient pas la saisine, ils out la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires, de plein droit, des l'instant de l'ouverture de l'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9\nLe droit de la couronne remontant \u00e0 1785 l'appelant aurait d\u00fb all\u00e9guer dans son opposition un titre aut\u00e9rieur on sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de la couronne, au bien all\u00e9guer et prouver qu'avant cette \u00e9poque cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise par la prescription. Mais comme on l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ii n'a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 aucun titre quelconque. Dans son opposition ii n'al\u00e8gue la possession de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que d'une mani\u00e8re indirecte en disant que l'ntim\u00e9 :\u2014\nDemands from appellant who is and has been for many years past in open public and peaceable posession of the Seigniory of Grondines as proprietor thereof, etc. etc.\nIl n'all\u00e8gue pas non plus que cette possession est ant\u00e9rieure au jugement qu'il attaque.\nL'appelant se trouvant comme opposant dans la position d'un demandeur, c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui \u00e0 faire preuve des erreurs qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 de nature \u00e0 faire r\u00e9tracter le jugement. Il aurait d\u00fb \u00e9tablir que s'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 partie en cause ses titres auraiet emp\u00e8h\u00e9 ce jugement d'\u00eatre renduton prouver l'existence d'h\u00e9ritiers de madame Piery, et que partant ii n'avait Pu exister de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence en faveur de la Couronne; que le fief Francheville ne faisait pas partie des biens d\u00e9laiss\u00e9s par madame Piery. Mais il \u00e9tait sans int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 faire cette preuve \u00e0 moins de pouvoir aussi prouver qu'il d\u00e9rivait son titre de madame Fiery, ce qu'il ne pouvait aucunement faire, car ii n'a et ne produit aucun titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il r\u00e9clame. Cons\u00e9quemment les deux moyens de la demande du procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que le fief Francheville appartenait \u00e0 madame Piery et que sa succession est tomb\u00e9e en d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence, n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement attaqu\u00e9s. Le droit de la Couronne reste donc clairement \u00e9stabliest\nIl facile de comprendre pourquoi l'opposant n'a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de titre au fief Francheville. C'est parce que lors de la vente par le sh\u00e9rif en octobre 1807 \u00e0 Moses Hart de la seigneurie des Grondines, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le titre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier, par le sh\u00e9rif, dans l'acte de vente pass\u00e9 par T\u00eatu et B\u00e9langer, notaires, l'exception suivante :\u2014\nEvery part and parcel of the seigniory of St. Charles and Grondines containing save and except the following' parts and parcels of the said seigniory of St. Charles.\nThat is to say: \"First, one undivided fourth and one undivided eighth of that part of the seigniory of St. Charles, commonly called the fief Francheville, which fief begins on the South West, at the line which separates the seigniory of St. Charles from that of Dorviliers, contains in front twenty-six arpents, six perches and twelve feet by the whole depth of the seigniory, and on the North East side at the line which separates the seigniory of St.- Charles from the seigniory of Latesserie, commonly called Lachevroti\u00e8re, contains twenty-two arpents in front by three leagues in depth, exclusive in both parts of any right in each island and battures in front of said seigniory and is claimed by the attorney general for and on behalf of His Majesty.\nCette vente fut faite en vertu d'un ordre de la cour du Banc de la Reine dans lequel cette exception est exprim\u00e9e dans les m\u00eames termes.\nLe 26 f\u00e9vrier 1810, Hart revendit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 P. Charay avec la m\u00e9me exception, et le 8 juillet 1831, Charay vendit \u00e0 Burnet qui revendit ensuite \u00e0 l'hon. D. E.

E. Price s'est mis en possession de ce fief en 1871. Ce titre ne contient aucune transmission da droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Price et ne pent m\u00eame servir de base la prescription. Tout au contraire ii contient une reserve expresse du fief Fran-cheville qui est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e appartenir \u00e0 la couronne. L'appelant est l'h\u00e9ritier de D. E. Price et n'a partant pas plus de droit que lui \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont ii s'agit. Il lui eut donc \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible, s'il cut \u00e9t\u00e9 partie an jugement du 14 juin 1884 de se faire declarer propri\u00e9taire du fief Francheville auquel ii n'a aucun titre. Et la cour n'eut pu faire autrement que de declarer comme elle l'a fait que le fief Francheville \u00e9tait \u00e9chu en 1787 \u00e0 la Couronne par droit de d\u00e9sh\u00e9rence. Dans tous les cas, l'appelant ne peut se faire adjuger la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question, parce qu'il ne la r\u00e9clame pas par son opposition et qu'il n'a pas mis la cour en position de decider la question de titre; il ne demande que la nullit\u00e9 du jugement, qui, Si elle \u00e9tait prononc\u00e9e, n'aurait pas plus d'effet que le jugement n'en a maintenant, puisque n'y ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie, ce jugement n'affecte nullement ses int\u00e9r\u00eats ni ses droits. C'est res inter alios judicata. Cette procedure est tout-\u00e0-fait inutile et frustratoire. Ce n'est qu'en faisant triompher ses moyens de defense \u00e0 l'action prise contre lui par Fontaine qu'il pourrait arriver \u00e0 son but. C'est cette action qu'il aurait d\u00fb mener \u00e0 judgment en cour an lieu de recourir \u00e0 la tierce-opposition que la loi ne lui accorde pas dans le cas actuel. Par tous ces motifs, je suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Over one hundred and five years ago, on the 25th March, 1785\\, one Marie Fiery, widow of Jean Baptiste Hamelin Francheville died, at Quebec. intestate, and without leaving any then known heirs,\nOn the same day, one Gueyrault was named curator to her vacant succession. The said curator appears to have proceeded to the inventory required by law, but an extract only of such inventory dated the 30th January 1787 is to be found in the record In this extract a portion of the seigniory of Grondines, consisting of a frontage of 26 arpents, six perches et twelve pieds by three leagues in depth is entered as forming part of the said succession.\nOn the 9th of July, 1790, the Attorney-General filed an information in the Court of Common Fleas at Quebec, against this curator, claiming for his Majesty King George III the succession of the said Marie Fiery and more particularly the aforesaid portion of the seigniory of Grondines \u00e0 titre de bastardise et desh\u00e9renee On the 16th of July 1790 the curator filed an answer to this information whereby he alleges, 1st. That the succession of Marie Fiery was not vacant, as she had left legitimate heirs in France who, as he alleges, were entitled to her succession 2nd That even if these heirs did not accept the succession the crown could not, in any case, maintain its claim as to the seigniory of Grondines, because such seigniory, in law, for reasons given in the said answer, became, by Marie Piery's death the property of one Hamelin and one Boisvert, who then were in actual possession of it 3rd. That consequently the said Hamelin and Boisvert should have been made parties to the information, or that the King to have his claim on the said seigniory established, should proceed against them by a direct action.\nThe Attorney-General, on the 25th September, 1790, replied to the curator's plea praying that the succession Ta aforesaid, in the curator's hands, should be accounted for and delivered over to His Maiesty's Receive-General It would appear that towards the end of 1790 or in the beginning of 1791, an intervention claiming the said succession was filed by the brother and sisters of Marie Fiery, in answer to which, on the 7th of July, 1791 the Solicitor-General for the King, substituted that same day to the Attorney-General, filed an opposition or plea. However neither this intervention nor the crown's said opposition or plea are now to be found in the record.\nOn the 13th July, 1791, the intervening parties filed an answer to the crown's opposition or plea and on the 15th the Solicitor-General filed a replication to that answer both of which are in the record This ends the proceeding's in the Court of Common Fleas, with the exception of the filing, on the 9th February, 1808, by the intervening parties of a copy of Gueyrault's appointment as curator; and for the next seventy-six years, no proceedings whatever were taken in the case either by the crown, or by the curator, or by the heirs Piery.\nBy deed executed on the 12th of January, 1884, the Quebec Government promised to sell for the sum of $300 to one Tancr\u00e8de Toussaint Moreau, barrister, of Montreal, all the rights of the crown in the said succession, and authorised him to continue the proceedings, in the name of the crown, upon the aforesaid information of 1790. One Eug\u00e8ne Pierre Lafontaine, also a barrister and partner as such of the then Prime Minister, Mr. Mousseau, accepted this promise of sale as agent of Moreau and in his name. It is clearly established however by the evidence of Mioreau himself and of one Martin to which I shall refer later on, that it was himself, Lafontaine, who was the real purchaser of the crown's rights and that Moreau had no interest whatsoever in the matter.\nA short time after that deed, on the 8th March, 1884, one Albert Fontaine was appointed curator to replace Gueyrault who had been appointed in 1795, on a petition purporting to be in the Attorney General's name. On the 11th the Honorable Louis Olivier Taillon as Attorney General, took up the instance for Her Majesty on the information of 1790 with conclusions against Fontaine the said new curator. (In these and all subsequent proceedings, I must here observe, the Attorney General had nothing whatever to do with the case and all the proceedings, though in his name, were taken and carried on by and in the interest of the purchaser of the crown's rights, who, by the aforesaid promise of sale, was even bound to give to Her Majesty, before taking any proceeding, security for the costs to be incurred and those already incurred).\nOn the 13th March the new curator promptly declared that he was willing to take up the instance. On the previous day he had gone before a notary and had passed a deed of amended inventory, giving a new description of the part of the Seigniory of Grondines that, in his opinion, the crown was entitled to, a fact of which he had not the least personal knowledge; and upon this amended inventory an amended information was subsequently, on the 20th of March, by consent, fyled in the name of the crown.\nOn the 22nd of March a notice was served on the intervening parties at the Prothonotary's office, on the part of the Attorney-General, calling upon them to appoint a new attorney in lieu and place of Barthelot Dartigny deceased, their attorney in 1790. Only eleven days before, however, the Attorney General had served his petition en reprise d'instance on this same Barthelot ME Dartigny at the Prothonotary's office. No further proceedings, it would appear, were taken on that notice; a but on the 15th of April following, upon a rule nisi taken by the curator defendant, it was ordered that upon the intervening parties' default to name a new attorney within thirty days thereafter, their intervention would be dismissed, and accordingly, upon such default on the 9th of June the intervention was dismissed, with the consent, the judgment adds, of the plaintiff and of the defendant, A. and B. consenting that C.'s intervention be dismissed This rule nisi, I notice, had also been served on the intervening parties at the Prothonotary's office, the bailiff solemnly making his return upon oath that he had not been able to find the parties in the District of Quebec. There was it is evident no reason to doubt the truth of this return for when their intervention was fyled, in 1791, the youngest of these claimants must have been at least 21 years old so that in 1884 when this return was made he, if living, would have attained the respectable age of one hundred and fourteen Then the curator strange to say, who so obtained, upon motion, the dismissal of this intervention, was not a party to the contestation thereon. The crown alone had appeared and joined issue upon it. Now, what right he had to move to dismiss a proceeding to which he was not a party, or what interest he had, as curator, on a contestation between the crown and the heirs Piery I fail to see. The present appellant it is true may not have the right to invoke jus tertii and to impugn proceedings which do not concern him, but I have referred to them as evidence of the means resorted to by the interested parties to get at a final judgment on the information. The intervention having been so disposed, of in this singular way the parties interested found no difficulty, with the ready assistance of the curator Fontaine in obtaining a judgment in their favor, and on the 14th of June, 1884, the Superior Court declared Marie Piery's succession, and more especially that part of the Seigniory of Grondines described in the supplementary inventory, escheated to the crown, with order to this curator to deliver up possession thereof.\nOn the 24th of July following the Quebec Government, according to the promise of sale previously passed, executed a deed of sale to Eugene Pierre Lafontaine, here again falsely pretending to act as agent for Tancr\u00e8de Toussaint Moreau of all its rights under the aforesaid judgment for the sum of $300.\nUpon this sale, in March, 1885, an action in Moreu's name was brought against the present appellant, alleging that he, the appellant, by himself and his auteurs, had been in possession of that part of the Seigniory of Grondines declared escheated to the crown by the judgment of the 14th of June, 1884, and had illegally received the rents and revenues thereof for at least fifty years with conclusions that he Moreau, as assignee of the crown's rights be declared to be the proprietor of the said part of the said seigniory, and that the appellant be condemned to deliver it up and to account for its revenues since 1871, unless he prefer to pay $100,000.\nUpon the service of this action Price the present appellant, filed an opposition tierce opposition to the said judgment of June, 1884. On this opposition Moreau filed an intervention by which and the moyens in support thereof, he alleged that Price had no title to the property in question, and had never been in possession thereof, and that the said property had been duly declared escheated to the crown in whose rights he, the said Moreau, claimed to be. This intervention and the tierce opposition Were submitted together to the Superior Court, where, on the 1st February, 1887, a judgment was given dismissing loreau's intervention, maintaining Price's tierce opposition and avoiding the judgment of the 14th June, 1884, so far as the same might affect the said opposant or the said Seigniory of Girondines. Upon an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, by the crown and by Moreau jointly, this judgment of the Superior Court was reversed, and Price's ticrce opposition was dismissed. Hence the present appeal by Price, upon which, as in the court below, the crown joined with Moreau as respondent.\nThe first of these proceedings that obviously comes up for our consideration on this appeal is IMoreau's intervention (though there is no reference whatever to it in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench), and on that intervention IMoreau's locus standi and right to intervene on Price's tierce opposition is the first question that suggests itself for enquiry. He, of course, alleges as the basis of his right to intervene the sale to him by the Government of the 24th of July 1864. Now this sale it seems to me is null of a nullit\u00e9 de plein droit. It was, as the promise of sale itself was, clearly a sale of litigious rights, without warranty and for a nominal price (1). And the sale of litigious rights to advocates or attornies practising before the courts under the jurisdiction of which those rights would fall is expressly prohibited by art 1485 CO. And by art. 14 C.C. (not in express terms in the Code Napoleon), all prohibitive laws import nullity. Then, by art. 989 C.C. a contract with an unlawful consideration has no effect and the consideration is unlawful when it is prohibited by law or contrary to public order, 990 C.C. And on this point, I may at once remark, it is immaterial whether this sale is to be considered as made to Moreau or to Lafontaine, as both are practising attornies. As well said by the Supreme Court of Louisiana in a recent case under the article of their code corresponding with our art. 1485 \" The elevated standard which the learned profession must occupy in public esteem makes it the imperative duty of courts to exact a rigid compliance with a rule calculated to enhance the honor and usefulness of the profession\" (1). It is also immaterial that this objection has not been taken. The courts are bound to take cognizance of infractions of laws enacted in the public interest, even when passed sub silentio by the litigating parties (2).\nI have not failed to notice that this litigation is pending in the District of Quebec and that Moreau, examined as a witness, swears that he is generally practising in Montreal. But as such he is entitled, I take it, to practise anywhere in the Province before the Court of Queen's Bench and I would say in any of the judicial districts before the Superior Court. I should judge from this record itself by the fact that in this very case, his own action against Price taken at Quebec is signed by MM. Robidoux & Fortin, who, it is in evidence usually practise in Montreal. Then, apart from the consideration that this sale was made to a practising attorney it seems to be unlawful and void as tainted with champerty, an offence punishable under the criminal law of the country; see arts. 14, 989, 990 C.C. Wharton, law lexicon vo. Champerty; Earle v. Hopwood (1); GreIl v. Levey (1). Upon these ground alone, the judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed Moreau's intervention could, in my opinion, be supported. But if in addition, we take into consideration the fact admitted by Moreau himself, that he has no interest whatsoever in the case that the sale by the Government to him was a sham to cover a sale to Eugene P. Lafontaine, it seems to me unquestionable that his intervention must, in any case, be thrown out. To be allowed to intervene in a case an interest in the event of the suit must be shown. Art 154 C.P.C.; Dorion v. Dorion (1); and an intervening party who has no interest must be mis hors de cour.\nI now come to the appellant's tierce opposition, One of the allegations of this opposition is, that all the proceedings taken in 1884 on the information of 1790 were fraudulent and collusive. Now, of this allegation there is, on this record, abundant and cogent evidence, as well directly from the depositions of the witnesses examined as indirectly from the proceedings themselves. I have already alluded to the fact that, as admitted by Moreau himself he has no interest whatever in the case. It is falsely, fictitiously and with intent to deceive (no euphemism is possible) that his name appears as vendee in the deeds of January 12th and July 2th, 1884, and. it was Eug\u0141and. Lafontaine, the prime minister's partner at the bar who was the real purchaser. One Joseph Martin, also a practising attorney, and who, as such, appeared for Lafontaine in this case on the proceedings of 1884, brought up as a witness on the intervention by the intervening party himself also clearly proves this fact, giving as the reason why this contrivance was resorted to : That as Lafontaine was the\\n the law partner of Mr. Mousseau, the then prime minister, the adversaries of the prime minister, and of La-fontaine himself who might later on enter the political career, might . have caused some trouble to the government or to Lafontaine, and that as the transaction appeared more advantageous to the purchaser than to the Government it might be cristicised by Lafontaine's or the prime minister's adyersaries.\nThis witness, Martin, further admits that, in payment of his services as attorney for Lafontaine in this case it was agreed, between him and. Lafontaine that he, Martin, would share in the profits of the suit. The following passage of his deposition leaves no room for doubt as to this :\nQ. Vous \u0109tes int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans le process? R. Oui.\nQ Voulez-vous dire \u00e0 la cour quel est votre int\u00e9r\u00eat? R. Mr. La-fontaine m'avait charg\u00e9 de le repr\u00e9senter ici dans toutes les procedures et recherches qu'il devait faire; et pour cela il m'a dit qu'il me don-nerat une part dans le r\u00e9sultat du proc\u00e8s.\nQ. Au lieu de vous r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer en argent pour les services que vous lui rendiez il vous a interess\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re? R. Oui.\nThey, in other words, he and Lafontaine, agreed to a pact de quot\u00e2 litis and were to be associates in this traffic on litigation. Now, though this so very reprehensible conduct on the part of these two members of the bar cannot, in any way, affect the solution of the questions in controversy in the case yet the court cannot allow it to pass unnoticed. \u00c0. reference to the following authorities, inter alia, will show how strictly forbidden to advocates and attorneys stipulations of that nature have always been. Laurent, on pacte de quota litis, says (1):\nC'est toujours avilir le saint minist\u00e8re de la justice cue de le souill v par les sordides calculs de la cupidit\u00e9.\nAnd Morin, de la discipline, says (1) :\nCe qui est surtout interdit, c'est toute stipulation qui impliquerait, ou sous entendrait plus ou moins une participation r\u00e9elle aux b\u00e9nefides esp\u00e9r\u00e9s du proc\u00e8s. Ou sait combien est antipathique \u00e0 la profession d'avocat le pacte de quot\u00e2 litis, trop souvent propos\u00e9 par lea plaideurs. De tout temps la loi a trouv\u00e9 contraire \u00e0 la morale, et consquemment nul, tout trait\u00e9 entre plaideur et avocat, associant celui-ci au gain du proc\u00e8s, lui piomettant une partie de I'objet en litige ou de sa valeur. On doit r\u00e9puter tel tout pacte analogue entre avocat et client, par example, celui qui promettrait conditionnellement \u00e0 l'avocat une chose d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, ou bien un honoraire proportionn\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat recherch\u00e9\nFavard de Langlade Repert. and Merlin Repert. vo. pacte de quod litis, Marcad\u00e9 (1), and Blackstone (1), also condemn severely all transactions tainted with champerty, more especially when entered into by practising attorneys.\nNow to return to the case and to the fact I have alluded to that it was Lafontaine and not Moreau, who purchased the rights of the crown, we have thereby unquestionable evidence from these parties themselves that, at its very inception, they resorted to simulation in the furtherance of their scheme Let us see now what was their subsequent mode of action in the matter. Clothed with the permission to use the Attorney General's name they began their proceedings on the information by a \" reprise d'instance \" on the 11th of March, 1884, as I have already stated, signed \" per Joseph Marilin, duly authorised\"; the same J Joseph Martin \" I have alluded to. It was then 94 years since the last contentious proceeding had been taken by the crown on the information (25th September, 1790), and 93 years since the last contentious proceeding upon the intervention of the heirs Piery (15th July, 1791).\nI have already stated that, on the 8th of March preceeding, one Adalbert Fontaine had been appointed curator to the vacant estate of Marie Fiery in lieu of Gueyrault, who had been appointed in 1785. This Adalbert Fontaine also an advocate, and as such, as partner of Joseph Martin, himself testifies that he was so appointed upon the suggestion of Joseph Martin, acting for Lafontaine, in the name of the Attorney General. Immediately after his appointment he declared that he took up the instance', and again, upon the suggestion of Joseph Martin, consented to re-make the inventory. And to further avoid all possibility of obstruction and delay to the plaintiff he appeared as attorney of record for himself as defendant. Later on only one witness is examined for the plaintiff, and that witness is this same Fontaine, who thus appears on the record in the threefold capacity, of defendant, of attorney and of a witness. So much for that aspect of the proceedings.\nI now come to the merits of the judgment of the 14th June, 1884, itself.\nIt seems to me plain that, even if the plaintiff had been entitled to a judgment at all on this information, the description given in the amended inventory, and in this judgment, of the part of the seigniory of Grondines, left by Marie Piery at her death, is altogether unsupported by the documents of record. This judgment declares escheated to the Crown two separate parts of this seigniory, described by metes and bounds. Now, Marie Piery, as far as I can make oat from the record never had a title to any part of that seigniory, but to an undivided share of it. Her own title is her marriage contract, in virtue of which, at her husband's death she inherited all of his estate Now her husband's title was a sale to him, on the 8th April, 1762, by one Langani\u00e8r\u00e9, and all what that deed conveyed to him was one-fourth of one-half of the said seigniory \"indivis avec les autres h\u00e9ritiers.\" Further a deed of \" foi et hommage,\" of the 15th June, 1781, by Marie Fiery herself jointly with her coseignors, purports to be as to her for her undivided part, and an undivided part only, of the seigniory. \" A cause du fief et seigneurie de Grondines dont ils jouissent tous en commun et par indivis;\"relevant en plein fief de Sa Majest\u00e9 dont ils jouissent tons sans. . Ta partage et par indivis,\" are words in that deed which it seems to me leave no uncertainty upon that point. Two \" proc\u00e8s verbal de bornage \" of the 15th November, 1783, were relied upon by the respondents as evidence of a partition of the seigniory between the owners thereof. But I cannot see anything of that kind in these deeds alone and by themselves. The first is nothing but the location of a division line between the Grondines and Lachevroti\u00e8re seigniories and the second was never completed and signed by the surveyor with-out which signature it is an absolute nullity, besides being, as it seems to me, unintelligible and further, not signed by Augustin Hamelin upon whose requisition it appears to have been made but most illegally only by his wife for him. Moreover no partition was ever concluded by this deed of \u201cbornarge\" It does not even purport to make any, but was probably made in view of a partition which the parties, it may be assumed, intended to proceed to later, but which was never made from the fact perhaps that Marie Fiery died not long afterwards. Then there is no evidence whatever of the possession by Marie Fiery or her husband of a separate and divided part. The extract of the inventory of 1787 cannot be taken as affording such evidence. Such an inventory could not in any case be evidence of possession or of any other fact whatever against third parties. The curator, in 1790, in his plea to the information denied that he was in possession of the part of this seigniory claimed by the crown and not only has no evidence to the contrary ever been brought forward but it appears on the record that a comparatively short time afterwards on the 10th September, 1806, this seigniory of Grondines was sold by the sheriff to one Moses Hart in a case 01 Blanchard v- McNider under the express reserve (I assume upon an opposition by the crown) of two un-divided parts declared in the sheriffs deed to he claimed by the crown and this upon a motion of the Attorney General himself, who appeared in the case for the plaintiff Blanchard. Now it seems to me that the crown, as a necessary consequence of this sheriff's sale, never had since the right, under any circumstances, to claim any part of this seigniory but the undivided parts so reserved in this sale, assuming they ever had any, and that the judgment of the Superior Court of 1884 which declared escheated other distinct and divided parts thereof, is, on that ground alone, utterly erroneous and would not have been obtained but for the collusion between the parties\nThis judgment adjudicates up on property which has never been in the possession of either of the curators. When the first curator pleaded to the information that he was not in possession of any part of this seigniory, admitting that he was in possession of the other property claimed, the crown merely replied that he should render an account of what he had in his hands. That was equivalent to a withdrawal of the claim as to the seigniory. The crown officers, aware, it may be presumed, of the truth of the fact pleaded by the curator evidently saw that it would have been as useless as illegal to get a judgment against the curator ordering him to deliver up or account for a property he never had the possession of (1).\nWhen the first curator further pleaded that not he but Boisvert.& Hamelin,were then in possession of the property claimed by the crown, and that the crown should not further proceed upon the information as to this seigniory without bringing them in the case, the crown ought to have so brought them in, and have its claim to this property adjudicated upon contradictorily with the parties in possession of it animo domini.\n1 may add further that there may he doubts as to the legality of Fontaine's nomination as curator. Can a succession be deemed vacant when the crown comes forward to claim it? See Art. 1331 C.P.C. Arts. 637, 638, 639, 684, 687 C.C.\nUne succession (says Laurent) (1) r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'\u00e9tat, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'h\u00e9ritiers ou autres successeurs irr\u00e9guliers, ne peut \u00e9trereput\u00e9e vacant, et d\u00e9s lors lee arts. 811 et seq. (684 of our code) ne lui sont pas applicables.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, il n'y a pas lied \u00e0 la nomination d'un curateur \u00e0 cette succession en attendant le jugement d'envoi en possession au profit de l'\u00e9tat; et Si un curateur a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 par le tribunal avant la reclamation de l'\u00e9tat, ce curateur doit \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, sauf au tribunal \u00e0 remettre l'administration provision de la succession \u00e0 tel g\u00e9rant qu'il trouve convenable.\nI simply refer for the decisions and the authorities in support of these propositions to Sirey's Code Civil Annot\u00e9, under Art. 768 Nos. 8 et. seq. without further investigating the question or coming to any determination upon it. The new curator may, perhaps, be considered as the g\u00e9rant charg\u00e9 de administration provisoire.\nAnother objection to the reprise d' instance of 1884, taken by the appellant in his factum, one which the curator Fontaine did not, of course, take, as he was appointed not to take objections, is that the action was then prescribed. I refer on this point to Arts. 2216, 2242, 2265 C. C. and to the following authorities :\u2014\nMerlin (1)\nOn ne doit pas confondre, en fait d'instance, la prescription avec la p\u00e9remption.\nAnd citing Brodeau : La partie qui, apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure, demeure 30 ans dans l'inaction, est cens\u00e9e avoir abandonn\u00e9 son droit apr\u00e8s 30 ans tout est p\u00e9ri et prescrit. Les assignations, les jugements, tout se prescrit par 30 ans, ind\u00e9pendamment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s des parties.\nAubry & Rau (1).\nL interruption (de prescription par une action) est \u00e9galement regarder comme non avenue, si l'instance vient \u00e0 s'\u00e9teindre par la discontinuation de poursuites pendant 30 ans.\nLe loux de Bretagne (1).\nSi m\u00eame il y avait eu discontinuation de poursuites pendant 30 ans, l'instance serait \u00e9teinte par la prescription.\nAnd at No. 510\nLa discontinuation de poursuite? pendant 30 ans teint tout \u00e0 la fois l'instance et l'action.\nRodi\u00e8re, Proceed. (1).\nL'instance, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de la p\u00e9remption peut s'\u00e9teindre par la prescription trentenaire. Comment supposer, en effet, qu'une instance puisse subsister pendant une s\u00e9rie indefinite de si\u00e8cles.\nLaurent (1).\nTout droit s'\u00e9teint par le laps de 30 ans; donc s'il y a eu discontinuation de poursuites pendant 30 ans, l'instance sera \u00e9teinte. La jurisprudence est en ce sens, quoique la question soit controvers\u00e9e.\nRe Marcnnay (1).\nInd\u00e9pendamment de la p\u00e9remption pour discontinuation de poursuites pendant 3 ans, les instances sont soumises \u00e0 la prescription de 30 ans pour d\u00e9faut de poursuites pendant ce laps de temps.\nHabitans de Langlet (1).\nL'instance en cassation se prescrit par d\u00e9faut de proc\u00e9dures pendant 30 ans. Plus de demande en reprise d'instance apr\u00e9s, cette date.\nVillegouan, C. Talhouet. Cassation(1).\nL'instance ne conserve l'action qu'autant que l'instance n'est pas elle-m\u00eame prescrite pas une discontinuation de poursuites pendant plus de 30 ans.\nLe droit de demander la peremption d'instance se prescrit par 30 ans. a partir de lexpiration de 3 ans sans poursuites (1). Delmas v. Bruvois (1).\nLa prescription de 30 ans \u00e9teint les instances discontinu\u00e9es pendant ce laps de temps.\nAnd in the Journal du Palais 1887 (1) Rodi\u00e8re on that case says,\nCette d\u00e9cision nous para\u00eet fort bien rendue malgr\u00e9 l'opinion de Carr\u00e9 Chauveau & Bourbeau\nIn 1886, in re Boueix (1).\nLorsqu'une instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue pendant plus de 30 ans l'action et l'instance elle-m\u00eame se trouvent teintes en mime temps par la prescription, et dans ce cas la reprise d'instance faite post\u00e9rieurement est sans effet et doit \u00e9itre rejet\u00e9 comme non recevable. Cette solution est aujourd'hui d\u00e9finitivement admise.\nIt follows from these authorities, that; if Fontaine, instead of taking up the instance, had waited till an action en reprise d'instance was taken and had met such action with a plea of prescription, he would have had it dismissed. A. clearer proof of collusion between him and the parties acting as plaintiffs cannot be had. The appellant, under art. 2187 C.C., has now the right to avail himself of this prescription.\nAs to the appellant's right to a \"tierce opposition\" in this case, it is not, in my opinion open to controversy. The respondents cannot argue that, because the judgment of 1884 was as to him res inter alios judicala he the appellant, is estopped from impeaching it. It is precisely against a judgment to Which he is not privy, that a party aggrieved by it is given the right to a \"tierce opposition,\" as the very name of this proceeding implies. (1). And the fact that the appellant here might, in another case, avail himself of the illegality of the said judgment, does not deprive him of his remedy by a u tierce opposition.\" (1). So to hold, would obviously be to deny the right, under any circumstances, to that proceeding. Then, it seems to me unquestionable, that the appellant here has sufficient interest and qualit\u00e9 \" to impeach this judgment. (1). As to his\" qualit\u00e9,\" it cannot he denied. He was clearly not privy to it. As to his interest, it is to me equally clear. Why was it obtained by Moreau? Or by Lafontaine and Martin rather? If not only for the very purpose of laying the foundation of an action against him, and to enable them to impugn his rights to this seigniory of Grondines. Would they now treat it as of no value to them as a nugatory proceeding towards their interests, it might then well be asked why they intervened at all on the present issue between the appellant and the crown what induced them to join on this contestation; if it did not concern them what motives prompted them to so strenuously contend for the legality of a judgment foreign to the rights they assert? They obtained, behind his back, a judgment declaring escheated to the crown a property of which he, the appellant, is in possession animodomini since fifty years, and they \"would forsooth say to him that he has no interest whatever in the matter that it is none of his business Their contention is untenable The measure of their interest to uphold this judgment is the measure of his interest to have it annulled\nIt is obvious that even if no action had been taken against him upon it, that judgment, as long as it stands must have the effect to cast a cloud on his title and possession, a trouble de droit. It could be registered at any time, and thereby be the cause, in case of a sale for instance, of serious embarrassment to him. And. if no action were taken upon it how could he contest it? Ivey a direct action perhaps, as in Thouin Leblanc (1) but how much more simple and direct under the circumstances is the remedy that the law has provided the \" tierce opposition.\" A case in the Cour de Cassation of Commune de Lalley c. Commune de Pr\u00e9bois (2) is precisely in point :\nUne d\u00e9cision judiciaire qui declare une personne propri\u00e9taire peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e adversus omnes, sauf aux tiers \u00e0 l'egard desquels cette d\u00e9cision n'a pas l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose juge\u00ea \u00e0 Ia faire tomber la voie de la tierce opposition.\nOr as given in Sirey :\nSi la d\u00e9cision judiciaire qui d\u00e9clare une personne propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds n'a point l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9econtre le possesseur qui n'y a point \u00e9t\u00e9 partie, elle \u00e9quivaut toutefois \u00e0 un titre vis-\u00e0-vis do celui-ci comme tout autre, sauf la voie de la tierce-opposition ouverte (1).\nThat decision, it seems to me, entirely supports the appellant's s right to a tierce-opposition in the present case.\nThe respondents argued that as a \" tiers opposant \" must show a right superior to the right of the party who has recovered the judgment impeached, therefore the appellant's opposition here must be dismissed, as it is not based on any title. But the fallacy of this argument is apparent. It is a petitio principii. It assumes that the crown has proved a title to the property declared escheated. Now, that is precisely what the appellant controverts, and, in my opinion, has established. As to him, his possession of fifty years alleged in Moreau's action itself fyled with the \"tierce opposition\" is his title and a sufficient one to entitle him to his conclusions against a plaintiff who has neither title nor possession. He has established his rights on the rescindant and the rescisoire.\nIn connection with that point I have not failed to notice a case, of Tercinet v. Tripier (1), though it was not cited. In that case the Cour de Cassation held that\nL'arr\u00eat qui d\u00e9clare l'existence an profit de l'une des parties d'un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est opposable aux tiers, sauf \u00e0 ces derniers \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard desquels cet arr\u00eat n'a pas l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e \u00e0 l'attaquer au moyen de la tierce opposition on m\u00eame directement, mais la charge de d\u00e9truire la preuve qui en result en \u00e9tablissant en leur favour soit un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, soit possession ant\u00e9rienre l\u00e9galement acquisitive.\nThis last part of the \"arr\u00eat\" supports the legal proposition submitted by the respondents, that a \"tiers opposant \" must show a right superior to the right of the party whom judgment has declared proprietor. But this obligation imposed on a \" tiers opposant\" has been fulfilled by the appellant here. Having proved that the Crown has no title to the pro-perty declared escheated and never had the possession thereof he has the right, as I said before, to rely on his actual possession alone, to have the judgment of 1884 set aside. He has not got to prove a \" possession legalement acquisitive,\" where the party who obtained the judgment adverse to his rights had neither title nor possession, and this, aside from the further consideration, a weighty one here, that this judgment could not have been obtained but for the connivance of the defendant a feature of this case which distinguishes it from all the authorities cited by the respondents, and upon which the appellant might, perhaps have contended, that it was not necessary for him to show a superior right to the right of the plain-tiff.\nThe objection has been taken by the respondents to the conclusions of the \"tierce opposition,\" that they are too restricted in that they do not ask that the information of the crown be dismissed. I am rather inclined to think the point well taken, and that the appellant might have asked more than he did. but that is not, in my opinion, a reason why we should refuse him what he asks.\nThere is one point more to which I deem it necessary to refer, from an observation made by my learned colleague, whose concurrence in this judgment, I very much regret we have failed to get. I understood the learned judge to say that Price could never have acquired the ownership of a certain part of this seigniory by prescription, because his primary title, the sheriff's sale I have alluded to and other subsequent conveyances of the seigniory, expressly reserve a part of it to the crown. Now, there is no question of perscription raised by the pleadings, and we do not determine anything whatever on this point. I simply refer to it, with deference to my learned colleague, lest our silence should be construed as an acquiescence in what has been said on the matter.\nI am of opinion that we must allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court with costs in Queen's Bench and in this court in favor of appellant against the crown and Moreau, jointly and severally.\nGWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred with TASCHEREAU J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitors for respondent : Be\u00eeque, Lafontaine & Martin.\n"

The devisees mortgaged the land to C. in March, 1879, and the mortgage was not registered until January, 1880. In November, 1879, a second mortgage was given to M. and registered the same month. In this mortgage the widow joined barring her dower and releasing her annuity for the benefit of M. She had had knowledge of the prior mortgage when it was made and had refused to join in it. The second mortgagee, not being aware, when his mortgage was executed, of the prior incumbrance, gained priority, and the land was sold to satisfy his mortgage: the proceeds of the sale being more than sufficient for that purpose the surplus was claimed by both the widow and by C.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that the security for which the dower had been barred and the annuity released having been satisfied, the widow was entitled to the fund in the court as representing her interest in the land in priority to C.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Chancellor[2] in favor of the appellant.\nThe appellant is the widow of one Charles Gray who, by his will, left his real estate to two sons subject to an annuity to the widow, but such annuity not to be in lieu of dower. The sons mortgaged the real estate to the respondent, the widow not being a party to such mortgage; subsequently, a second mortgage was given to one Maclennan in which the widow joined, releasing for the purposes of the mortgage her interest in the land both as annuitant and doweress. The respondent neglected to register his mortgage until the second mortgage had been registered and the latter thus obtained priority under the Registry Act. Default having been made in paying the second mortgage the land was sold under it and such sale realised some $1600 over the mortgage. The contest in this case is over this surplus the widow claiming it as annuitant and doweress, the respondent claiming it under his mortgage.\nThe right to this money was tried out in the master\u2019s office who decided that the appellant was entitled to it. On appeal to the Chancellor this decision was affirmed[3]. On further appeal to the Court of Appeal the Chancellor\u2019s judgment was reversed and the court held that the widow was not entitled to priority over the respondent. She then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMoss Q.C. and Bolton for the appellant. The second mortgage was paid by appellants\u2019 interest in the land and she is, therefore, a surety and entitled to an assignment of MacLennan\u2019s securities. See Merchants Bank of Canada v. McKay[4].\nOn the question of subrogation the following authorities were cited: Hodgson v. Shaw[5]; Craythorne v. Swinburne[6]; Re Robertson[7]; McNeale v. Reed[8]; Sheldon on Subrogation[9]; Mutual Life Assurance Society v. Langley[10]. Scott Q.C. for the respondent cited DeColyar on Guarantees[11]; Brand on Suretyship and Guarantee[12]; Patterson v. Hope[13]; Newton v. Charlton[14]; Farebrother v. Wodehouse[15] Duncan & Co. v. North and South Wales Bank[16]; Forbes v. Jackson[17].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It appears that from the first of March, 1879, when Richard and John Gray mortgaged their interest to the respondent, Rosanna Gray was entitled to dower in the mortgaged premises and the property was also subject to an annuity to her of $150 a year. The chancellor has fixed the value of the dower and annuity at $1525. Had there been no second mortgage and had the property been sold under this first mortgage it is fair to assume that it would have sold for what it did sell for under the second mortgage, namely, $7500, less the value of the dower and annuity $1525. This first mortgage was not registered until the 2nd January, 1880; Rosanna Gray no doubt had notice of its existence as she refused to join in it. On the first of March, 1879, Richard and John Gray mortgaged the same lands to MacLennan for $4,000, the appellant Rosanna Gray joining in the mortgage, releasing for the purposes of that mortgage all her rights and interest in the land as doweress and annuitant for the benefit of the mortgagee and for the better securing the repayment of the advance to Richard and John Gray whereby her property thus became security to answer the plaintiff\u2019s testator\u2019s claim in case his mortgage was not paid by the mortgagors. But she received no portion of, or benefit from, the money so advanced. This mortgage was duly registered on the 27th November, 1879, thereby gaining priority over the mortgage to Coughlin. Thus matters stood until default was made in the payment of MacLennan\u2019s mortgage when under proceedings on that mortgage the land was sold and after payment of MacLennan\u2019s claim a surplus of $1612 was left in court, $1525 of which surplus is the subject of this litigation. The mortgagee, Coughlin, claims to have his mortgage paid out of this surplus.\nThe first question that naturally suggests itself is: Did the land mortgaged to Coughlin produce this surplus? To my mind it clearly did not. It was produced by the property sold under the second mortgage, namely, the land mortgaged to Coughlin, plus the dower and annuity of Rosanna Gray. I think no question of registration or non-registration arises in this case between Coughlin and Rosanna Gray. It is clear that when Coughlin advanced the money on his mortgage he had express notice of the appellant\u2019s outstanding dower and annuity and he did so after an express refusal on her part to join therein. The effect of the decision appealed from appears to me to place the appellant, Rosanna Gray, notwithstanding such refusal, in precisely the same position as if she had actually joined in the respondent\u2019s mortgage, which I respectfully think we have no right to do. Had the respondent registered his mortgage he would have had a prior claim on the land but not on the land relieved from Rosanna Gray\u2019s dower and annuity. This priority he lost by reason of the non-registration of his mortgage, but how does this give him a claim on the fund produced by the value of Rosanna Gray\u2019s dower and annuity which was never pledged to him? Her portion of the fund only escapes liability by reason of the share of her sons in the land being sufficient to pay the first charge on the property, namely, the MacLennan mortgage, and for the security of which or for which purpose alone she included her dower and an nuity in the mortgage. I am at a loss to see how Coughlin can claim more than the surplus after deducting the value of the dower and annuity fixed as we have seen by the Chancellor at $1,525; otherwise, Coughlin would be getting payment of his mortgage, not out of the lands mortgaged to him, but out of the value of the dower and annuity which were not released for the benefit and security of his mortgage, but alone for the benefit and security of the second mortgage. He lost his priority by his own negligence or default. Had the mortgagor of the second mortgage paid it off at maturity can it be doubted that Rosanna Gray would have been entitled to insist on being restored to her original position with reference to her dower and annuity leaving the Coughlin mortgage to stand against the interest of Richard and John Gray in the land, as it was conveyed by them in that mortgage? Or had Rosanna Gray, instead of her dower and annuity, included in the mortgage a piece of her own land and the mortgaged premises had been sold en bloc could Coughlin have claimed the surplus without accounting for the value of the land belonging to her? Or supposing the land had not been sold en bloc, but had been sold in parcels and the first parcel sold was the land mentioned in both mortgages and that brought sufficient to pay the mortgage having priority, could Coughlin have insisted that the parcel of land belonging to Rosanna Gray should be sold for the purpose of being applied in payment of his mortgage? I should certainly think not. Surely the property primarily liable to pay the mortgage money is the property of the borrower, not the property of the surety, when the mortgage on the property, having legal priority over all other securities, has paid the debt secured by it. I am at a loss to understand on what principle of law or equity the property of the surety can be sold to pay a mortgage second in pri- ority never pledged for its payment. When Coughlin advanced money on the mortgage from Richard and John Gray, he so advanced it on the land and on the land alone subject to the rights of dower and annuity of Rosanna Gray. Had he registered his mortgage and so obtained priority he could only have recovered his advance subject to such rights, but he lost that priority by neglecting to register his mortgage whereby the mortgage to MacLennan\u2019s testator gained the priority. Rosanna Gray having joined in the mortgage to MacLennan\u2019s testator with a view of adding her dower and annuity to the security of that mortgage and of that alone, why should the proceeds of her dower and annuity be taken to discharge the respondent\u2019s mortgage for payment of which such dower and annuity never were made responsible, and as against which the respondent would have had no claim if he had retained his priority, inasmuch as the mortgage was from Richard and John Gray on their interest only in the land subject to those charges. I cannot see how having lost his priority he is in any better position to claim against the fund on which he could not have claimed if he had not so lost his priority. His mortgage interest has not produced the fund in court. I think it will be anything but equitable to allow this surplus to be applied in payment of the mortgage which never covered either Rosanna Gray\u2019s dower or her annuity. The prior existing mortgage to Coughlin is postponed to MacLennan\u2019s and is not defeated by allowing Mrs. Gray\u2019s claim but by reason of the lost priority and because Coughlin, under his mortgage, never had any claim in the dower and annuity, and because Rosanna Gray only released her interest in the land for the purpose of the mortgage to MacLennan, not for the purpose of Coughlin\u2019s mortgage. Had the mortgagors paid off the MacLennan mortgage there can, in my opinion, as I have said before, be no doubt that Mrs. Gray\u2019s interest would have reverted to her, and if the mortgage is paid off by means of the sale under the decree of the court, I cannot see why she is not equally entitled to say that the amount having been obtained by the sale of her interest she is equally entitled to the benefit of the amount which her interest realised. Inasmuch as her dower and annuity were solely given as security for the MacLennan mortgage why should they be made security for the Coughlin mortgage likewise?\nAs I have said I cannot see what the registry acts have to do with this case beyond giving the second mortgage priority over the first, nor can I see why Rosanna Gray\u2019s knowledge that the first was in existence before the second was given can be in any way used to increase the security of the first mortgage, nor in any way make her charges on the property given as security for the second available to make good the deficiency on the first. Richard and John Gray never having had any right to or claim on such charges, and the same having been given simply as security for the second mortgage alone, to take Rosanna Gray\u2019s dower and annuity or the proceeds thereof to satisfy the first mortgage to which she was no party and in which she was in no way interested and in which she absolutely refused to join, would be, in my opinion, most unjust and inequitable. I therefore cannot see that as surety Rosanna Gray was not entitled after payment of the second mortgage to any surplus that might arise from the sale of the land free from her dower and annuity, that is to say, the value thereof established by the Chancellor, namely $1,525, nor can I discover that Rosanna Gray claims in any way under the registry acts but simply under the general principle of equity that her property shall not be applied to the payment of an indebtedness and liability she never incurred and which she expressly refused to incur, simply because the first mortgagee had lost his priority either willingly or by negligence. The registry laws placed the Maclennan mortgage in a better position than the Coughlin mortgage, but why should that operate to give Coughlin a right to take the proceeds of Mrs. Gray\u2019s property to pay his mortgage? Under such priority thus obtained over the Coughlin mortgage MacLennan was entitled to be paid out of the fund in court representing the mortgagor\u2019s property in priority to Coughlin, leaving the part which represents the property of Rosanna Gray to be appropriated to her and not to Coughlin. It is said, in that case, that Coughlin would be entirely cut out; be it so, but by whose fault but his own. In other words, I do not think that Coughlin having lost his priority in the mortgaged premises secured to him there is any equity in allowing him now to recoup himself out of the fund produced by the property of the surety to another mortgage in which property he, Coughlin, has no interest, and on which he had no claim. The practical operation of the judgment of the appellate court is to remove the Coughlin mortgage from the property of his mortgagors and place it on the property of Rosanna Gray which was never mortgaged to him.\nUnder these circumstances I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Chancellor restored.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts which have given rise to this litigation are few and simple and are not disputed. Charles Gray died in 1874, leaving his widow Rosanna Gray, the present appellant, and his two sons, Richard and Charles Gray. By his will he devised the lands which are the subjects of the mortgages to be hereinafter mentioned to his sons Richard and Charles sub- ject to an annuity of $150 to his wife charged on the same lands. This annuity was not in lieu of dower. On the first of March, 1879, Richard and Charles Gray mortgaged the lands devised to them by their father to the respondent Cornelius Coughlin to secure $700 and interest. The appellant was not a party to this mortgage, having refused to join in it. The mortgage was not registered until the 2nd of January, 1880. On the 1st of November, 1879, Richard and Charles Gray made a second mortgage of the same lands to Donald MacLennan, who was the original plaintiff in this action, the present plaintiffs being his executors by whom the action was revived. This second mortgage was to secure $4,000 and interest. To this latter mortgage the appellant was a party, and she thereby released all her right, title and interest as doweress and as annuitant for the purpose of the mortgage; in other words, she mortgaged her dower and her annuity as a surety for the benefit of her sons, the mortgagors. The mortgage deed contained a clause expressly making these interests of the appellant thus mortgaged by her as a surety for her sons subject to the proviso for redemption. This mortgage to MacLennan was registered on the 27th of November, 1879, and it is not disputed that MacLennan the mortgagee had no notice of the prior mortgage to Coughlin which, as before stated, remained unregistered until the 2nd January, 1880. Mrs. Gray had notice of Coughlin\u2019s mortgage when she executed the mortgage to MacLennan.\nThe money not having been paid according to the tenor of the mortgage MacLennan brought this action for a foreclosure or sale of the mortgaged property. The sale realised sufficient to pay off MacLennan\u2019s mortgage, and after doing so there remained a residue of the purchase money produced by the sale amounting to $1,612. In the master\u2019s office a contention arose between the appellant, the respondent and one Allan, an incumbrancer subsequent to Coughlin, who is not a party to this appeal, regarding the application of this money. The appellant insisted that she was entitled first to be paid out of the fund (so far as it was adequate for that purpose) the equivalent in value of her annuity and dower, whilst the respondent on the other hand insisted that he was entitled to be paid the amount secured by his mortgage in priority to the appellant. The master by his report found that Mrs. Gray was entitled to priority and to be paid $388 as the value of her dower and $1,650 as the value of the annuity.\nIt was further contended that there was a merger to the extent of a moiety of the annuity by reason of Richard Gray having, on the 4th of August, 1881, conveyed his undivided one half in the equity of redemption in the mortgaged lands to his mother the appellant. The master finding that there was no merger rejected this last mentioned claim. This report of the master was, on appeal, confirmed by the learned Chancellor of Ontario, with the exception that there was a variation of the report by a deduction from the arrears of the annuity, which resulted in the reduction of the aggregate amount due in respect of both the annuity and the dower to the sum of $1,525.\nFrom this judgment of the Chancellor there was an appeal to the Court of Appeal, by which court the judgment of the Chancellor was reversed, and it was adjudged that the respondent Coughlin was, in respect of his mortgage, entitled to priority over the appellant and had therefore a right to be first paid out of the balance of purchase money remaining in court. From this latter judgment the present appeal has been brought.\nIt is to be remarked that the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is to make the property of the appellant Mrs. Gray, who mortgaged her dower and her annuity together with the charge by which it was secured as surety for her sons to secure the payment of $4,000 to MacLennan, liable not merely for the debt which she contracted to secure but also for a debt due to the respondent Coughlin for which she had expressly refused to charge these same interests.\nThe question which we have to decide is, then, whether she is, upon MacLennan being paid off, entitled to her dower and annuity, or, which is the same thing, to the money which represents them; or are these interests to be sequestrated for the benefit of Coughlin to whom she never in any manner agreed that they should be liable.\nThe first thing which strikes one is the result of the judgment appealed against, which has the effect of charging the appellant\u2019s property with a debt which she never contracted or even contemplated it should be charged with, and that too in the absence of any positive act apart from contract or any omission or failure of duty on her part creating any obligation binding her towards the respondent. The only possible way in which in any event it could even have been plausibly argued that Coughlin\u2019s debt could be made a lien on Mrs. Gray\u2019s interest as doweress and annuitant would have been that it might have been pretended that if the decree had been for a strict foreclosure instead of a sale Coughlin might have entitled himself to some equity through the dry technical rules which, in the interest of a paramount mortgagee, have sometimes to be applied in working out a decree for redemption by successive incumbrancers, which occasionally operates prejudicially to those interested in a portion only of the equity of redemption. As I shall endeavor to show, however, no argument of this kind can prevail; first, because here there are no successive redemptions but the property having been realised and turned into money by a sale no provisions for successive redemptions have been requisite; and secondly because, even if instead of a sale there had been a judgment for foreclosure, thus obliging each successive incumbrancer to redeem or be foreclosed, Mrs. Gray could not have been prejudiced by the adoption of that mode of proceeding. It is true, as I have said, that where in foreclosure actions there were successive incumbrances the rules of courts of equity relating to tacking and consolidation sometimes operated oppressively, and that one of the reasons for substituting the remedy of sale for foreclosure was that some harsh consequences might be avoided, but I do not think that any such rules would have entitled the respondent to the relief he has obtained by the judgment under appeal. It is quite sufficient, however, for the disposition of the appeal to consider the rights of the parties in the event which has happened of the mortgaged property and interests having been converted into money by a sale, thus dispensing with any process of redemption, and only requiring the adjustment according to equitable principles of their rights to payment out of the fund thus produced remaining in the hands of the court.\nI will then put a case which is distinguishable as regards its influence on the rights of Mrs. Gray from that which we have actually to deal with. Supposing instead of this property having been all sold, including that belonging to the appellant as well as the lands which the mortgagors had mortgaged, the mortgagors had out of their own moneys paid off MacLennan, the mortgagee, and he had sought the direction of the court as to how he was to dispose of the dower and annuity mortgaged by the appellant as a surety for her sons, could it for a moment have been pretended that he would have been directed to convey and assign these interests to Coughlin? On what ground could any claim by Coughlin to make these interests a security for the money advanced by him have been based? Not, certainly, on any engagement by way of contract or agreement for the appellant had expressly refused to charge her property for his benefit; and if not in that way, upon what other principle could such a liability have been imposed? There can be no doubt but that in such a case Mrs. Gray would have been held entitled to a re-conveyance of her dower and to a re-assignment of her annuity. Then let us go a step further and suppose that MacLennan, in exercise of a power of sale which might have been contained in his mortgage, had sold the land subject to Mrs. Gray\u2019s interests, thus leaving her dower and annuity intact, and out of the proceeds of such a sale had paid himself off, what reason would there be in such a case for any difference between this case and that first put? None that I can discern, and none I am sure which any amount of fertile ingenuity could suggest. The like consequences must have followed and Mrs. Gray would have been entitled to be reinstated in her property and rights. Then take another hypothetical case; if MacLennan had sold all which had been mortgaged to him, viz. the lands free from the incumbrances of the dower and the annuity, so that these latter subjects of the mortgage would have been included in the sale, and had then paid himself out of the proceeds, why should the result as regards Mrs. Gray differ in this case from those before put? The mere accident of the sale could not alter her rights and the residue of the purchase money remaining, so far as it might be adequate and to the extent of a full indemnity to her, would in that case also and on the same principle as in the cases first and secondly supposed have belonged to her absolutely. Then what difference as regards the rights and equities of the appellant can there possibly be between the last case and that which has in fact happened, of a sale by the court instead of by the mortgagee under a power? I venture to think that the most acute lawyer could not suggest a difference in principle between this series of cases beginning with the supposed case of a payment by the mortgagors and ending with the case actually before us. For the reasons thus made apparent, viz., that Coughlin, never having had or contacted for any charge or lien upon the appellant\u2019s property, is not entitled now, since they have been converted into money, to derive an advantage for which he could have shown no title while they existed in specie, I am of opinion that the Chancellor\u2019s judgment was entirely right and must be restored.\nI am also of opinion, although it is not necessary to decide the point, that the rights of the appellant would have been precisely the same under a decree for foreclosure providing for successive redemptions. In considering this it is important to bear in mind that the question is not whether the respondent is to suffer any prejudice or loss through the appellant, but whether or not he is to obtain any adventitious addition to his security by extending, to the prejudice of the appellant, the lien of his mortgage to the appellant\u2019s property; if he fails in this he will lose nothing which he ever stipulated for; if he succeeds he will gain that which he never contracted for, or even contemplated the acquisition of. Any accidental advantage which might have been derived by the respondent in the way of getting the appellant\u2019s property as an additional security for his debt could only, therefore, have arisen, not from any rights or equities which the respondent originally had against the appellant, but solely as a consequence of the paramount equitable right of the first mortgagee, MacLennan, to be redeemed entirely and not piece-meal. For this reason Mrs. Gray could not have had the security apportioned and have redeemed her dower and annuity by paying a proportionate part of the mortgage money. If the decree had been for foreclosure the first question in framing it would have been that as to who had the prior right to redeem, Mrs. Gray or Coughlin. Now, upon the 27th November, 1879, when the plaintiff, MacLennan, registered his mortgage the effect of that registration was to postpone Coughlin\u2019s mortgage, made on the 1st March, 1879, but not registered until the 2nd January, 1880, to MacLennan\u2019s mortgage; the parties were, therefore, just in the same position from that date as if MacLennan\u2019s mortgage had been made first and Coughlin\u2019s mortgage had been made subsequently to it. They were to all intents and purposes first and second mortgagees from the date of registration on the 27th November, 1879. Then nothing can be clearer than that Mrs. Gray was a surety for her sons, and that MacLennan, from the very form of his security, knew this. It follows that Mrs. Gray was entitled from the first to be subrogated to all securities held by the creditor, the first mortgagee, on payment by her of the latter. Then according to the latest authorities this right of subrogation entitled her, not only to the securities held by the creditor when she originally became surety, but also to all securities and incidental advantages obtained by him after the appellant\u2019s liability as a surety arose. This was at one time supposed to be otherwise and the case of Newton v. Chorlton[18], was thought to have settled the law the other way. That case has, however, been overruled, the learned judge who decided it, V.C. Wood, having subsequently considered that his decision was erroneous. Pledge v. Buss[19]; Pearl v. Deacon[20]; Forbes v. Jackson[21]. To apply the rule to the facts of the present case it would therefore have been originally the right of Mrs. Gray to have had, upon payment to MacLennan of the amount of his mortgage debt, a transfer of his mortgage; and when MacLennan has gained by prior registration priority for his security over Coughlin that advantage would also have enured to the benefit of Mrs. Gray as a surety on her redeeming MacLennan. In that case she would have been entitled, as the law has now been settled by statute, not merely to be subrogated by decree to MacLennan\u2019s right and thus to stand in his shoes, but to have an actual transfer of his securities with the benefit of all priorities attached thereto, unless, for some good reason founded on equitable principles, she had disentitled herself to this prim\u00e2 facie equity of a surety. No such reason for depriving the appellant of her ordinary equitable right as a surety could be suggested, except that which has been referred to in the court below that she had notice of the respondent\u2019s mortgage. That she had such notice is no doubt an established fact, but it is one totally irrelevant to the question of the right of priority of redemption between Mrs. Gray and the respondent. If anything can be well settled it is, that one who for valuable consideration acquires title from a purchaser or mortgagee, who has himself gained priority under the registry laws over a former unregistered deed or mortgage, is entitled to the benefit of the priority so acquired, even though such sub\u2011purchaser or mortgagee may himself have had notice; in such case he is entitled to shelter himself under the valid preferable title of his own immediate grantor. So that if A. takes a mortgage and does not register and then B. takes a mortgage of the same lands and acquires priority over A. by registering without notice, C., obtaining for valuable consideration an assignment of B\u2019s mortgage, though with notice of A\u2019s prior mortgage, is nevertheless entitled to the benefit of the priority acquired by his assignor B. Nothing can be better established than this, the principle being the same as that which always applied in equity to the case of a purchaser with notice from a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value without notice. Therefore Mrs. Gray would not in any manner be deprived of her right of subrogation by the fact that she had notice of the respondent\u2019s mortgage. Then in the case of Mrs. Gray paying off MacLennan, her own property, the dower and annuity, would have been revested in her and she would have been entitled to call on Coughlin to redeem the lands subject to the dower and annuity on payment of the full amount of the mortgage money, or stand foreclosed. In the event of the appellant not voluntarily paying off MacLennan, and a decree for foreclosure being drawn up by way of carrying out the same principle as that just referred to, the prior right of redeeming MacLennan would have been given to Mrs. Gray and the respondent in turn would have been directed to redeem her as to the lands only subject to the dower and annuity upon payment of the whole principal and interest paid to MacLennan; for she, being a surety, would retain in her own hands her own property mortgaged as such, and Coughlin would not have been entitled to redeem anything more than the lands belonging to the principal mortgagors; in other words, in the technical language of conveyancers, the suretyship securities, namely, the dower and annuity, would be \u201cat home\u201d in Mrs. Gray\u2019s hands, and the decree would have directed that in the event of Coughlin not redeeming the lands by paying off the full amount of the mortgage debt and interest he should stand foreclosed.\nThe foregoing conclusion results from the cases of Forbes v. Jackson[22] and re Kirkwood[23], which, following Bowker v. Bull[24], have overruled the earlier cases of Williams v. Owen[25] and Farebrother v. Wodehouse[26]. To put it shortly, the equity of a surety to be subrogated to the rights of a mortgagee is a better equity and takes precedence of the right of a subsequent mortgagee to redeem. Here, by the effect of the prior registration by MacLennan of his mortgage, Coughlin became, in respect of his unregistered mortgage, a subsequent incumbrancer, just as he would have been had his mortgage not been executed until after the 27th of November, 1879, the day on which MacLennan\u2019s mortgage was registered. It is no answer to this to say that the registry laws gave Coughlin any advantage over Mrs. Gray by cutting out her equity to subrogation, when on the 2nd of March, 1880, he registered his mortgage; and this, for more than one reason; in the first place, Mrs. Gray acquired the right to subrogation under the mortgage to MacLennan, which, on its face, showed she was a surety, and which was registered previously to Coughlin\u2019s; then Coughlin had notice, by reason of the prior registration of this mortgage to MacLennan, when he himself registered, of all rights accruing under that instrument, for I hold that under the registry law of Ontario (now R.S.O., cap. 114, sec. 80), registration is conclusive and not merely presumptive notice to all subsequent purchasers and incumbrancers, and by a provision embodied in sec. 82 of the same act, not to be found in either the Middlesex or Yorkshire or Irish registry laws,[27], but peculiar to the Ontario Act, notice of a prior unregistered deed or equity, after the execution of a conveyance or mortgage, but before registration, is sufficient to postpone the party claiming under it. But the conclusive answer to any contention that the Registry laws operated in favor of Coughlin to: counteract Mrs. Gray\u2019s right of priority, is that Coughlin had nothing to do with the dower and the charge for the annuity and never registered anything against those interests which were not comprised in his mortgage, and as they were, of course, distinct properties from the lands out of which they were derived, just as if they had been other lands owned by Mrs. Gray in fee, it is plain that on this ground alone, no advantage under the registry laws could have accrued to Coughlin as a subsequent registered mortgagee even if it should be considered that he had no notice of Mrs. Gray\u2019s equity, for he was not in fact a subsequent registered mortgagee at all in respect of the dower and the annuity. The right to subrogation as regards the lands mortgaged by Richard and Charles Gray is clear and in respect of them Mrs. Gray was entitled to be substituted for MacLennan together with all his right of priority as regards them, and for the reasons before given, notice to her of the respondent\u2019s mortgage could make no difference.\nI have thus discussed the questions which would have arisen had the judgment directed a foreclosure and successive redemptions according to the old practice in chancery instead of a sale, not because the rights of the parties can depend upon such considerations, but rather by way of testing the correctness of the conclusion to which I have come upon the case as it is actually presented. For these reasons, I am of opinion that even in the case of a strict foreclosure Mrs. Gray would have been entitled to priority in the case before us in which there are no complications or difficulties arising out of directions for successive redemptions but where the property as well that of the mortgagors as that of the surety, mortgaged on their behalf, has been all converted into money, and the mortgage debt having been paid out of the proceeds the only question which remains is as to the right of the surety to take the money representing in value her own property (or as much of it as remains for her to take) a right which I fail to see any one is entitled to interfere with.\nCertainly, it would have been a strange result if by obtaining priority over the appellant the respondent could have indemnified himself from the result of his own negligence in not registering his mortgage, out of the property of the appellant, who neither by contract nor by any wrongful act or omission had in any way subjected it to the charge of the respondent\u2019s debt.\nAs regards the question of merger, the law now depends on the statute of Ontario which provides that there shall be no merger in such a case as the present, thus settling the law in the way the learned chancellor has indicated, and this is sufficient for the present purpose, without entering upon any consideration of the old authorities prior to the statute.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the chancellor\u2019s judgment restored with costs to the appellant both here and in the Court of Appeal.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014I concur in the reasons given by the Chief Justice for allowing the appeal and restoring the chancellor\u2019s judgment.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Charles Gray died in 1874, seised in fee of certain lands which by his will he devised to his two sons Richard and John as tenants in common in fee, subject to the payment of his debts and legacies among which latter was a bequest of $150 to be paid yearly to his wife Rosanna during her life, and this bequest was not stated in the will to be in bar of her dower. In March, 1879, Richard and John Gray mortgaged the said land with the knowledge of Rosanna to the respondent Coughlin, to secure the repayment of $700 advanced by Coughlin to them, of which sum $150 at least was applied in payment of certain debts of the testator Charles. Rosanna did not bar her dower on this mortgage nor did she release her claim to the legacy of $150 per annum. In October, 1879, a quit claim deed was executed to Richard and John by the other legatees except Rosanna. In November, 1879, Richard and John Gray being desirous of borrowing a further sum of $4,000 upon a mortgage of the lands procured their mother Rosanna, in order to enable them so to do, to agree to release both her claim for dower and for the legacy. This was effected by a mortgage executed by Richard and John to one MacLennan to which Rosanna was made a party of the second part. She thereby released, demised and for ever quitted claim unto the said MacLennan his heirs and assigns, all her interest, & c., both at law and in equity so that MacLennan his heirs and assigns should hold the land for ever exonerated and discharged from all claims and demands whatsoever of the said Rosanna thereupon.\nAt the time of the execution of this mortgage Coughlin\u2019s mortgage had not been registered he having, at the request of the mortgagors Richard and John, abstained from registering it, but the legal estate in the land was nevertheless vested in him and upon the execution of the mortgage to MacLennan Coughlin\u2019s estate had precedence and was in fact then the first charge on the land; this precedence, however, he lost, but in the interest of MacLennan alone, by reason of MacLennan having placed his mortgage first on the registry whereby MacLennan acquired a statutory precedence over Coughlin. On the 4th August 1888 Richard Gray executed a deed of bargain and sale whereby he conveyed his undivided share in the said land to Rosanna in fee; this deed was put upon the registry on the same 4th of August. Rosanna now says that she was not a party to this conveyance; it appears, however, that subsequently to the execution of that deed she and John leased the premises to a tenant who occupied the land thereunder paying rent for some years and she must therefore be regarded as having been, since the execution of the deed by Richard to her, seized of the land as tenant in common with John of the equity of redemption in fee in the mortgaged lands. That is the position which she held when MacLennan instituted the suit for foreclosure or sale of the mortgaged lands to which suit, as such tenant in common in fee of the equity of redemption, she was made a necessary party. Upon a sale of the lands under a decree in that suit a sum has been realised which leaves a surplus above what is required to pay MacLennan\u2019s mortgage debt, and Rosanna\u2019s claim now is that although the lands were released, exonerated and discharged from her claims for dower and the annuity, yet that the money realised from the sale of the lands so released, exonerated and discharged remaining after payment of MacLennan\u2019s mortgage is not to be applied in discharge of the mortgage debt of Coughlin which was a charge upon the land and the estate in the equity of redemption therein of which Rosanna was herself seised as tenant in common with John, but is to be applied first in satisfaction of her original claim for both dower and annuity as if she had never executed a release of the land from these claims, and thus that Coughlin\u2019s mortgage, the loan raised upon which was in part at least applied in payment of the testator\u2019s debts which had precedence of Rosanna\u2019s annuity, shall be postponed to her right of dower and annuity and so rendered worthless. This demand, in my opinion, has been rested wholly upon a fallacy, namely, that when Rosanna executed the release contained in the mortgage to MacLennan the effect was that she mortgaged what is called an estate which she had in the land as doweress and annuitant to MacLennan as collateral security and as surety merely for Richard and John. It is unnecessary, in my opinion, to inquire what her rights might have been upon the surplus if such had been the nature and effect of the transaction but there is no foundation, in my opinion, in law or equity for the contention that it was.\nShe had no estate in the land as doweress for dower had not been assigned to her. She had no estate either as annuitant. All that she had was a claim to have an estate in dower assigned to her and her annuity secured. These were claims from which she could have released the lands and in the interest of her sons Richard and John she released both her claims and the lands from liability therefor to MacLennan, his heirs and assigns, and such release operated, in my opinion, under the circumstances in which it was executed, by her, with full knowledge of the mortgage to MacLennan being a second mortgage, just as if she had released to Richard and John to enable them to execute and that thereupon they had executed the mortgage to MacLennan. The effect in reality was to release, exonerate and discharge the land both at law and in equity from these claims of Rosanna so that Richard and John might mortgage the lands freed there from as their own absolute estate and as MacLennan\u2019s mort- gage obtained only a statutory precedence over Coughlin\u2019s, upon MacLennan being satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale, Coughlin is entitled to come upon the surplus in preference to Rosanna who had no claim upon the land mortgaged, but as tenant in common with John of the equity of redemption therein and as such only after satisfaction of Coughlin\u2019s mortgage. The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Under the judgment appealed from the appellant is exactly in the position which she knowingly and intentionally assumed. She was aware that her sons had made a mortgage to Coughlin. She had refused to be a party to it for the purpose of releasing her dower or postponing the charge for her annuity. Then when the sons borrowed money from MacLellan on a second mortgage she joined in that deed and released her charges for the dower and the annuity. The land has now been sold under the mortgages for $7,500. The money is not enough to pay both mortgages in full and also to pay the full value of the annuity and the dower. It will pay her a part but not the whole. She must lose a part, but that is the risk she voluntarily undertook when she joined in the second mortgage. It would be a matter of some surprise to find that anything has happened to improve her position at the expense of either of the mortgagees. What has happened is that the first mortgage was left unregistered and the second was registered, whereby the first mortgage, of which the second mortgagee had not been informed but which the appellant knew all about, became liable to be adjudged fraudulent and void against the second mortgagee, and he became entitled to rank as first incumbrancer on the fund produced by the sale. The appellant insists that the neglect to register the first mortgage enures to her benefit, and gives her an equity to take all the money that remains after satisfying the second mortgage and to let the first mortgage go wholly impaid. No rule of equity could make her claim a just one, and I do not take it to be supported by any rule that has been appealed to.\nThere was plausibility in the contention that the appellant\u2019s relation to the second mortgage was that of surety, and that she was entitled to benefit by the advantage which accrued to the second mortgagee from the non-registration of the first mortgage.\nThat contention has been, in my opinion, effectually answered in the Court of Appeal. I shall add only a few observations which may, perhaps, be little more than a repetition in another way of the same ideas.\nI do not say that the appellant may not properly be regarded as a surety, and I do not affirm that under the circumstances that was her true position. I assume, for the sake of argument, that she was a surety.\nThe first mortgage was not void as against her, and I know of no principle of equity on which she could insist on the second mortgagee asserting against the first the priority which his want of notice of the first mortgage entitled him to assert. The rules which in some cases enable one who has notice of an incumbrance or defect of title to acquire a good title by purchasing from one who took without such notice have no application to a case of this kind. Nor is it the case of a person who joins in a mortgage as surety under the belief that it is a first mortgage. The agreement, as far as the appellant was concerned, was that a second mortgage should be given embracing the land freed from the charges in her favor. That was the instrument to which she became a party. MacLennan, whose right under the Registry Act was to have Coughlin\u2019s mortgage adjudged fraudulent and void, was at liberty to waive such adjudication and let it retain its priority. He would have disobeyed no law, and would have done nothing of which the appellant could properly complain, by redeeming it as the first incumbrance; and seeing that he would have had no choice in the matter but would have been obliged to redeem it if he had taken his mortgage with the knowledge which the appellant had when she joined in making it, her claim is, to my apprehension, a perversion of equity.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kingsford & Evans.\nSolicitor for respondent: Henry J.

Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nAppeaL\u2014Validity of by-law\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, Secs. 29 (a) and (b) 30 and 24 (g)\u2014Constitutional Question\u2014when not matter in controversy.\nThe plaintiff sued the defendants to recover the sum of $150 being the amount of two business taxes, one of $100 as compounders and the other of $50 as wholesale dealers under the authority of a municipal by-law. The defendants pleaded that the by-law was illegal and ultra vires of the municipal council, and also that the statute 47 Vic., ch. 84 P.Q. was ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec The Superior Court held that both the statute and by-law were intra vires and condemned the defendant to pay the amount claimed. On an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by the defendants that court confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court as regards the validity of the statute, but set aside the tax of $100 as not being authorized. The plaintiff thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court, complaining of that part of the \"judgment which declares the business tax of $100 invalid There was no cross-appeal. On motion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld, that the appeal would not lie, sec. 24 (g) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, not being applicable, and the case not coming within sec. 29 of the Act ; the amount being under $2,000, no future rights within the meaning of said sec. 29 being in con-troversy nor any question as to the constitutionality of the Act -of the legislature being raised. Strong J. dissenting on the ground that the judgment appealed from involved the question of the validity of the Provincial Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side). By the judgment of the Superior Court for the province of Quebec, at Sherbrooke, rendered the 28th February, 1889, the act 47 Vic. c. 84 P. Q. was held intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec and respondents were condemned to pay to appellant one hundred and fifty dollars being the amount of two business taxes imposed by a municipal by-law passed in pursuance of the provisions of said act, viz., a tax of fifty dollars on wholesale liquor dealers, and a tax of one hundred dollars on compounders and bottlers of spirituous liquors, doing business in the said city.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) modified this judgment, and dismissed the action, so far as regards the tax of one hundred dollars for the reasons :\n(1.) That neither the charter of the city (39 Vic ch. 50 P. Q.) nor the amending act (47 Vic. ch. 84 P. Q.) in enumerating and specifying the different trades and occupations to be subjected to such tax, has specified the business of compounders or of bottlers of spirituous liquors and that this omission is not covered by the uncertain meaning to be given \" to the vague, general and indefinite last lines of section seven of said act more particularly too vague and uncertain in the matter of taxation,\" &c.\n(2.) That the legislature had not delegated by either of said acts or otherwise to the appellant, the power to impose the said tax of one hundred dollars and that the by-law, in so far as regards the said tax is ultra vires null and void.\nBy their pleas the respondents impeached the constitutionality of the act, 47 Vic. ch. 84 (P.Q.), but did not file a cross-appeal on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Belanger for respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the amount in controversy was under $2000 and that no question as to the constitutionality of any act of the legislature of the Province of Quebec was in controversy in the judgment appealed from, that court having decided in favor of the appellant on the question of constitutionality, and the respondents not having filed a cross-appeal, but being willing to rest their case on the illegality of the by law and acquiescing in that part of the judgment which related to the constitutionality of the statute.\nMr. Brown Q. C. and Mr. Ferguson Q. C. for appellant contra contended that the case came within sections 24 (g) and 30 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act and cited and relied on City of Montreal v. Corporation of Longueuil ([1]), Pigeon v. The Recorders Court of Quebec ([2]), Major V. Corporation of Three Rivers ([3]) Mayor &c. of Terrebonne v. Sisters of Providence ([4]). In any case upon the face of the record the question of the constitutionality of an act of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec was involved, and therefore the case was appealable under sec. 29 (a) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J \u2014 In my opinion whatever as to quashing the by-law arises in this case. I think the words i in such like matters or things \" in sec 29 of the statute refer to matters of the same nature as the title to lands, etc., previously mentioned, and I cannot see that this appeal comes within any of the exceptions in that section.\nI do not think that any question is raised as to the constitutionality of the Quebec statute. The decision as to that was in favour of the appellant and the respondents do not complain and no question was intended to be brought before us in respect to it.\nSTRONG J.-On the face of the proceedings in this case it appears that the constitutionality of an act of the legislature of the province of Quebec is impeached. The first question raised certainly is that as to the construction of the by-law, but if that point should be decided against the respondent, there would still remain, before the appeal could be decided, the question of the constitutionality of the statute of Quebec under the authority of which the by-law purports to have been passed. Should the by-law be held invalid it would be impossible to give judgment without pronouncing upon this constitutional question. The question of waiver by counsel is entirely immaterial. The city of Sherbrooke would have the right to say that the constitutional question was still before this court being patent upon the record and that they were entitled under sec. 29 (a) of the Supreme Court Act, to maintain their appeal inasmuch as the judgment appealed from \" involves the question of the validity of an act of the legislature Of the province of. Quebec.\" For this reason I am of opinion that the motion to quash should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should he quashed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondent's counsel has demur-red to the jurisdiction of this court in this case, and I think his objection is well taken. The appellant has attempted to support his appeal on sub-sec. (g) of sec. 24 of the Supreme Court act, as being in a case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule or order of court. But that enactment, probably of no possible application in the province of Quebec, does not help the appellant. There is no by-law quashed by a rule or order here. In fact there is none quashed at all by the judgment appealed from. We are all agreed on this point I believe, neither could it be contended that the case is appealable because it relates to a tax or duty. The statute gives a right of appeal only in matters relating to a duty payable to Her Majesty, where rights in future might be bound, which the tax in controversy could it be called a duty, is clearly not.\nIt is contended however that the appeal in this case lies because the matter in controversy involves the question of the validity of an act of the legislature of the province of Quebec. If that was so, the appeal would undoubtedly lie. But I cannot see that there is anything in controversy on such a point on the appeal to this court as the case is presented to us. The respondent has abandoned that part of his pleas which put into question the right of the legislature to authorize this corporation to levy a tax of $100\" on compounders, the only one now in contestation. He has succeeded before the court of appeal on another ground. He asks now that that judgment be confirmed. The appellants of course do not question the validity of the act, they support their action on this very act itself. Under these circumstances I cannot see that the matter in controversy here involves the validity of the Quebec act. The case of Longueuil v. City of Montreal. ([5]) has no application. The constitutionality of an act of the legislature was clearly controverted in that case. I am of opinion that the appeal should be quashed with costs of motion.\nPATTERSON J.-I am also of opinion that the appeal should be quashed.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Ives, Brown & French.\nSolicitors for respondents : B\u00e8langer & Genest.\n[1] 15 Can.

J. Ritchie C. J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nMandamus\u2014Judgment on demurrer not final\u2014Appeal\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, sec 24 (g)\u2014Secs. 28, 29 and 30.\nInterlocutory judgments upon proceedings for and. upon a writ of mandamus are not appealable to the Supreme Court under sec. 24 (g) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. The word \"judgment\" in that sub-section means the final judgment in the case. Strong and Patterson JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) for lower Canada, reversing the interlocutory judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe appellant, a freeholder and ratepayer of the school municipality of the parish of St. Marc applied to the Superior Court for a writ of mandamus against the respondents, in order to enforce the execution of a decree of the Superintendent of Education ordering the respondents to maintain school district No. 6 of their municipality and to erect thereon a school house\nThe respondents filed four pleas to the petition and the appellants demurred to three of the pleas. The Superior Court maintained the appellant's demurrers, but on appeal the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada reversed the decision of the Superior Court and declared that the respondents had the right to the allegation set forth in their pleas.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\u2014\nMr. Cornellier Q.C. and Mr. Geoffrion Q C. for respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was an interlocutory judgment, and that section 24 (g) and section 30 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act did not give leave to appeal except from the final judgment in the case.\nMr. Lacoste Q.C., contra relied on the case of Dan\" jou v. Marquis ([1]) and sections 24 (g), 27, 28 and 30 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE.\u2014I am of opinion that this is not a final judgment which can be appealed from. It is said that the case of Danjou v. Marquis ([2]) supports the view that an appeal can be entertained. The question before the court was not whether an appeal would lie in the case but whether there could be an appeal from the Court of Review treating that as the court of final resort. That was the point in issue in that case and the conclusion arrived at was that the appeal would only lie from the Court of Queen's Bench.\nAs I am of opinion that under section 24 (g) of the Supreme Court Act, allowing appeals in proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus, the decision sought to be appealed from must be a final judgment and that the judgment in this case was not final it follows that we have no jurisdiction. I therefore think the appeal should be quashed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I entirely dissent from the opinion arrived at in this case by the majority of the. court both upon the express words of the statute allowing appeals from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus (sec. 24 (g), and also upon this consideration that if an appeal in mandamus proceedings is confined to final judgments it would, under the Ontario system of procedure in such cases, be useless\nThe words of the statute are: (An appeal shall lie) \"from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus not arising out of a criminal charge, and in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus,\" nothing indicating that the legislature intended to limit it to an appeal from the final judgment on the writ of mandamus; and we all know from experience that the final judgment in a mandamus case is seldom reached. To say that there must be a final judgment before there can be an appeal would imply that the return to the writ must be traversed, pleaded or demurred to and a final judgment given on such pleadings. If an appeal is to be confined to such a case, inasmuch as the proceedings seldom reach the stage of final judgment, there would be nothing left to appeal from.\nI think the legislature in enacting the clause in question, intended that the appeal in such cases should be assimilated to appeals in equity cases, as provided in sub-section (e). In such cases appeals from interlocutory orders may be brought to this court, and from the nature of the proceedings in mandamus it is reasonable to infer that the intention was to give an appeal in like cases.\nThe intention therefore (having regard to the express words of the statute) being to allow appeals from any judgment in proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus, and not from the final judgment only, I am of opinion that the judgment appealed from in this case was a judgment upon a proceeding for a writ of mandamus and therefore, one coming exactly within the precise words of the Act. The motion to quash should therefore be refused with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014 Le jugement dont est appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sur une d\u00e9fense en droit qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et que la Cour du Banc de la Reine a renvoy\u00e9. Ce jugement n'a certainement aucune finalit\u00e9 et partant n'est pas appelable.\nMais l'appelant pretend que dans les causes de mandamus l'appel n'est pas limit\u00e9, comme dans les autres au judgment final. Il fonde cette pr\u00e9tention sur le langage de la ss. g. de la sec. 24 concernant les habeas corpus, mandamus et r\u00e8glements municipaux o\u00f9 il est\nAn appeal shall lie, g. From the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a case of habeas corpus, not arising out of a criminal charge, and in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus and in any case in which a by-law, &c, &c, &c.\nCette disposition est-elle une exception au principe general \u00e9mis en t\u00eate de la section 24, limitant l'appel an jugement final? Il est evident que le statut a voulu proscrire les appels devant cette cour sur les jugements interlocutoires dont on avait reconnu les inconv\u00e9nients et qui avaient fini par \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une entrave \u00e0 l'administration de la justice. Cette disposition me parait fond\u00e9e sur le principe Qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de mettre, le plus not possible un terme aux proc\u00e8s. Elle doit s'appliquer aux affaires mentionn\u00e9es dans la ss. g, \u00e0 moins queles expressions employ\u00e9es ne fasse voir une difference que l'on ne pourrait m\u00e9connaitre. N'y a-t-il pas autant, et plus encore, de motifs d'arriver promptement au jugement final dans ces causes que dans lesautres ? Je ne vois pas de difference et les termes de la section n'en font pas non plus suivant moi\nC'est dans la section (24) n'accordant l'appel que du jugement final que se trouve cette disposition, et elle n'y forme pas une exception. L'appel n'y est donn\u00e9 que \"du jugement,\" ce qui, sans doute, signifie le jugement final comme dans les ss. b, c et f.\nIl n'y a \u00e0 cette signification qu'une seule exception, c'est celle faite par la ss. e. concernant les jugement des cours d'Equit\u00e9. Mais l\u00e0 le langage est diff\u00e9rent. Le l\u00e9gislateur n'emploie plus comme dans les autres sous-sections l'expression \"The judgment,\" mais au contraire, il se sert des ternies \"from any judgment\" de tous jugements et non pas \"du jugement,\" et les mots de \" tous jugements \" sont suivis d'une \u00e9num\u00e9ration de procedures (decree, decretal order, or order in any action or suit) qui fait voir que dans cette section l'appel n'est pas limit\u00e9 au jugement final et qu'il peut avoir lieu de jugements interlocutoires. Je vois dans cette disposition une exception bien formelle \u00e0 celle qui n'accorde l'appel que du jugement final, mais cette exception n'exste pas dans les autres sous-sections. Cons\u00e9quemment je suis d'avis que la motion doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e et l'appel renvoy\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In this case, it is conceded by the appellant that the judgment he appeals from is merely interlocutory, but he contends that under sec. 24 sub-sec (g) of the Supreme Court Act the appeal lies because the case here is one upon a writ of mandamus, as to which, he contends, the right of appeal is not confined to the final judgment. I am of opinion that the statute does not bear that construction.\nFirst I cannot see why such a distinction would have been made. Why allow the right of appeal only from the final judgment, so as to prevent parties from multiplying appeals, as the statute clearly does, yet make an exception as to cases of habeas corpus and mandamus, and allow an unlimited number of appeals in every case of that nature? Would it be because, more so than in ordinary cases, a prompt judgment is desirable in such proceedings?\nThere is certainly, that I can see, no reason why the exception contended for by the appellent should have been made. And it has not been made as I read the statute. The judgment in any case of proceedings upon a writ of habeas Corpus, or mandamus, in sub-sec. (g) of sec. 24 of the act means the final judgment as the same words do in sub-secs b, c d, f. In sub-sec. (e) the statute makes an exception, but there, it says, any judgment, not the judgement. The appellant would read the words in sub-sec. (g) \"an appeal shall lie from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus\" as if they meant from any judement; or from the judgment on any proceeding. Now \"the judgment is not\" any \"judgment,\" and in any case of proceedings\" does not mean \"on any proceeding.\" \"The statute reads by simply reversing the sentence \"in any case of proceedings upon a writ of mandamus an appeal shall lie from the judgment.\" Now, I repeat it, this means, it seems to me clear, the final judgment, not any judgment, nor the judgment upon any proceeding in a case of mandamus. Otherwise a case on habeas corpus or mandamus may be brought up here on a motion for security for costs, for instance, or on any motion or interlocutory order or proceeding whatever in the case and at any stage and an unlimited number of times I do not think that such is the law.\nSec. 30 of the act does not affect this case and Dan jou v. Marquis ([3]) is no authority on this point. This question could not arise there at all, for the judgment appealed from was unquestionably a final judgment. The only point determined in that case was that an appeal does not lie from a judgment of the Superior Court. I would quash this appeal. It is well settled law that an appeal never lies unless expressly given by statute. Rex. v. Cashiobury ([4]), Rex. v. Hanson ([5]), The Queen v. Trustees of Warwickshire ([6]).\nCrompton J. says:\u2014\nThe appeal is the creation of the Statute and can only exist where it can clearly he collected from the language of the statute that it was the intention of the legislature to give the appeal.\nExparte Chamberlain ([7]), Lord Campell C.J. says:\nNo appeal can be made except under an express enactment.\nAttorney General v. Sillem ([8]), in the Exchequer Chamber and in the House of Lords ([9]):\nThe creation of a right of appeal is plainly an act which requires legislative authority.\nLord St. Leonards\nNow it is clearly laid down that no right of appeal can be given except by express words.\nAnd in Chagnon v. Normand ([10]) in this court. Sir W. J Ritchie C J. for the court:\nWe think that an appeal which is unknown to the common law must be given by statute in such clear and explicit language that the Tight to appeal cannot be doubted.\nWe should, in my opinion, be careful not to assume jurisdiction where the statute does not clearly give it. I am against grasping at jurisdiction. We have gone too far already in that direction. In Levi v. Reed ([11]) for instance, amongst others, and city of Montreal v. La-belle ([12]), Joyce v. Hart ([13]), Lord v. Davidson ([14]), Bender v. Carrier ([15]) The Ottawa v. Sheridan ([16]) Dorion v Crowley ([17]), in which we entertained the appeals, we have had since to determine that in cases of that class, no appeal lies to this court ([18]).\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The appellant instituted proceedings in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, praying, for reasons set out in his petition for the issue of a writ of mandamus commanding the school commissioners forthwith to carry out a decree of the superintend of public instruction which ordered the formation of a new school district. The application was made to Judge Mathieu under article 1022 of the C. C. P. which authorises the issue of a writ commanding the defendant to perform the act or duty required or to show cause to the contrary on a day fixed.\nThe application was supported by affidavits as required by article 1023, and the judge, on the 24th of July, 1889, ordered the issue of \"a writ returnable on the first of August following. After the return of the writ the defendants filed pleas, the petitioner answered them; and the defendants replied, raising issues in law and in fact, and on the 21st ofSeptember,1889 judgment was given by Mr. Justice Mathieu in favour of the petitioner. This entitled the petitioner to a peremptory mandamus under article 1025, but the commissioners appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench and that court reversed the decision, holding, by a majority, that the petitioner had not established the duty which he asked to have enforced by the writ.\nThe question now is whether an appeal from that decision lies to this court\nThe objection taken to our jurisdiction is that the judgment is not a final judgment.\nConceding, but only for the sake of the argument that the judgment is not final within the definition of the term \"final judgment\" contained in the interpretation clause of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, I have no doubt that the right of appeal is given. I think that is the clear result of sections 24 28 and 30.\nThat this is a judgment, and not a mere ex parte order such as that made on the 24th of July, is not and cannot he disputed. Section 24 enacts that an appeal shall lie in various cases specified in seven articles numbered from (a) to (g.) Mandamus is one of the subjects of article (g), and the enactment may be read thus omitting all matters irrelevant to this subject:\u2014\nAn appeal shall lie from, the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus.\nThe only reference to final judgments contained in the section is in article (a) which specifies final judgments of the highest court of final resort in any province. No restrictive words such as \"final judgments only\" are used. The article has no grammatical connection with the subsequent articles and some of those subsequent articles specify judgments which obviously may not be final. Article (d) is one instance:\n(d.) From the judgment upon any motion for a new trial upon the ground that the judge has not ruled according to law.\nAn order for a new trial is only interlocutory.\nNow, while it is true that an appeal will lie only when given by affirmative enactment, and. while article (a) specifies final judgments only, it is not laid down by section 24 as a general principle, either in terms or by implication, that an appeal will not lie from any judgment that is not final As to mandamus and habeas corpus, it will be noticed that article (g) specifies proceedings for the writ as well as proceedings upon it.\nThe restriction of appeals to final judgments is found, not in section 24 but in section 28 which enacts that\nExcept as provided in this act or in the act providing for the appeal an appeal shall lie only from final judgments in actions, suits, causes matters and other judicial proceedings originally instituted in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, or originally instituted in a Superior Court of any of the provinces of Canada other than the Province of Quebec. We have here a two-fold restriction\u2014first, to actions, &c., instituted in a Superior Court and secondly to final judgments in those actions. Proceedings in cases of mandamus, being necessarily commenced in a Superior Court, would thus have come under the restriction that required a judgment to be final in order to be appealable unless those cases were covered by the words \" except as provided by this act.\" I am inclined to think they would be covered by those words; but section 30 puss the matter beyond question by enacting that\nNothing in the three sections next preceding shall in any Way affect appeals in Exchequer cases, cases of mandamus, habeas corpus and municipal by-laws.\nThus, on the assumption that the judgment in question is not a final judgment, the appeal is, in my opinion distinctly given by the statute.\nI am not prepared however to concur in regarding this judgment as interlocutory. It concludes the controversy between the parties which was respecting the legal duty of the commissioners to do the act to enforce which the writ was prayed for. It is a final judgment just as any judgment dismissing an action is final. It would be equally so whether the peremptory writ were ranted or refused. It has been refused, and the right to it is res judicata. If it had been granted the question of right could not have been again brought into contest by any return to the writ. All that would have remained to the commissioners would have been to do the act commanded, after which any attempt to appeal would have been labour lost.\nFor these reasons, I think we ought to hear the appeal.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Lacoste, Bisaillon & Brosseau.\nSolicitor for respondents: C.

FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAppeal\u2014Order for a new trial\u2014When not appealable\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, sees. 24 (g.) 30 and 61.\n\"Where a new trial has been ordered upon the ground that the answer given by the jury to one of the questions is insufficient to enable the court to dispose of the interest of the parties on the findings of the jury as a whole, no appeal will lie from such order which is not a final judgment and cannot be held to come within the exceptions provided for by the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act in relation to appeals in cases of new trials. See Supreme and Exerciser Courts Act secs. 24 (q 30 and 61.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in Review ordering a new trial.\nThe facts and pleadings of the case are given in the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\nDoherty Q.C., Kavanagh with him, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment.\nTrenholme Q.C. for appellants contra. Sir \"W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014This was an action brought by the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning, against the respondents to recover the amount of a policy of insurance for $4000 issued to George Barrington & Sons, the loss having by endorsement been made payable to the Royal Institution, who are the mortgagees of the insured property.\nThe defendants set up a number of \"pleas to the action alleging misrepresentation of interest, and the breach of several conditions, and a special plea alleging that, at the time of the institution of the action and before, any injury and damage that may have been caused by fire to the property in question had been completely repaired without loss, cost or expense to plaintiffs, and the said property put in as good, and in fact better, condition than it was previous to the date of the fire, whereby the security of the plaintiffs and the value of the premises had been increased and the plaintiffs completely indemnified from any possible loss resulting from said fire, and that by reason of the premises the plaintiffs had no interest in the loss, nor was the amount of it payable under the policy.\nGeorge Barrington & Sons intervened alleging that as mortgagors of the premises they had an interest in the suit and in having the amount of the policy recovered from the defendants.\nThe case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Davidson and a jury. A number of questions were put and answered by the jury, most of them directly in favor of the plaintiffs. One specially related to the alleged repair of the premises, viz:\nQuestion No. six. Previous to the institution of the present action had the injury and damage done to the said property by the said fire been repaired without cost or expense to the plaintiffs, and was said \"property put in the same condition as previous to the occurance of the said fire, and plaintiffs indemnified of any possible loss resulting therefrom ?\" To this question the jury answered: \"Impossible to say.\u201d\nBefore the Court of Review the plaintiffs moved for ton judgment in their favor upon the verdict of the jury. The intervenants moved that judgment be rendered according to said verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and the intervenants and that the intervention be maintained. The defendants moved for judgment non obstante veredicto dismissing intervention And the defendants also moved for a new trial. The court granted the defendants' motion for a new? trial and set aside the verdict of the jury with costs.\nThey seem to have been influenced in coming to this conclusion by the belief that the answer to the sixth question was insufficient to enable them to dispose of the interests of the parties on the findings of the jury as a whole.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench affirmed this judgment of the Court of Review 'with costs.\nA motion has been made on behalf of the respondents to quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment in question is not a final judgment, which it clearly is not, and cannot be brought within any of the exceptions provided for by the act in relation to cases of new trial. The question in fact seems very similar to the one raised in the case of The Accident Insurance Company v. McLachlan, ([1]) and involves a consideration of the same provisions of the Supreme Court Act, viz.:\u2014\nSec. 24, sub-sec. (d.) [An appeal will lie] From the judgment upon any motion for a new trial upon the ground that the judge has not ruled according to law.\nSec. 30. Nothing in the three sections next preceding shall in any way affect appeals in Exchequer cases, cases of rules for new trials and cases of mandamus, habeas corpus and municipal by-laws.\nIn Halifax Street Railway v. Joyce ([2]),this court held that sec. 24 (d.) of Supreme Court Act which provides Barring for an appeal from a judgment ordering a second trial applies only to cases which have been tried by a jury and that no appeal would lie under that section from an and order granting a new trial in an non-jury case, the L expression \" that the judge has not ruled according to law, \" having reference to the directions given by a judge to the Jury.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be quashed. It is clear that there is no final judgment, so that the jurisdiction of the court would have to be rested, not on the final judgment clause of the statute, but upon the clauses relating to new trials. An appeal under these clauses is not general but is limited to two cases of new trials. One is confined to the case of where the judge has not ruled according to law and the other where the verdict is against the weight of evidence. This appeal does not come within either of these categories. It is quite evident that it is within the power of a court to send a case back for re-trial by a jury in order that the facts may be further investigated; This was the course pursued in the present case. Mr. Justice Cross, giving the judgment of the court says: \"It is a complicated case. The order of the court below was for a new trial. I would be ready to give plaintiff judgment on his motion because I think the obstacles are all removed and the jury decided the case according to the facts \u00b0 hut as it is only for a new trial and points of importance may be cleared up on both sides by a further investigation I concur with my colleagues that it is the exercise of the discretion of the court; we are not disposed to disturb the judgment of the Superior Court in \"Review- and therefore the appeal will he dismissed with costs of appeal the other costs to follow the event of a new trial.\"\nI think these observations accurately state the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, and, therefore, that court did what it had a perfect right to do in the exercise of its discretion without subjecting its judgment to be reviewed on appeal to this court. The appeal should be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case is now before us on a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. I am of opinion to allow this motion. This is not an appeal from a final judgment, but from a judgment granting a motion for a new trial. Now, an appeal lies in such a case by way of exception only where the motion is allowed upon the ground that the judge at the trial has not ruled according to law.\nIn this case a new trial has been ordered by the Court of Appeal, confirming the order made by the Court of Review, but simply upon the ground that the verdict of the jury was an imperfect verdict, inasmuch as they had not answered the sixth of the questions or assignment of facts put to them Art. 414 C O.P. enacts that when there is an assignment of facts the verdict must be special and articulated upon each fact submitted and be explicitly affirmative or negative. To the sixth question the jury had answered \"impossible to say.\" This is clearly not an appealable judgment under the statute. The appellant, it is true had moved for judgment upon the verdict, and that motion was dismissed. But that judgment is also an interlocutory judgment. It is clearly not a final judgment in the case. A judgment refusing a motion is not a final judgment. South Eastern v. Lambkin ([3]). In fact, on this point, the appellant's grievance is that the court below did not give a final judgment. The judgment dismissing his motion for judgment upon the verdict was the necessary consequence of the judgment ordering a new trial upon the motion of the defendants. They form hut one judgment. Both motions under Art. National 422 of the code of procedure formed but one issue. We could not entertain an appeal in the case upon the appellant's motion were it otherwise appealable without at the same time entertaining the appeal on the judgment ordering a new trial upon which no appeal clearly lies. This, it seems to me, is conclusive against the appellant's contentions.\nIt is true that if the appeal was entertained the appellant would be admitted to contend that his motion for judgment should be granted, and that this court would have to give the judgment that, in their opinion ought to have been given in the court below. But that is not the criterion of the jurisdiction of this court. That is mistaking the exit door for the entrance door of the court. The appellant must first show that he has a right to come into this court and it is not by the judgment that he would have a right to get when the case would have been won in this court that we are to be guided as to our jurisdiction, but purely and simply by the nature of the judgment appealed from. We must look at the judgment that was given, not to any judgment that should have been given, or that we would or might give. A case in point and in which, in my opinion, the decision is unimpeachable, is the South Eastern v. Lambkin ([4]). In that case the Superior Court had entered judgment upon the verdict for $7,000. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment and ordered a new trial. Upon an application for leave to appeal to the privy council Dorion C.J. for the court refusing the application, said: But it is said that by the judgment of this court the respondent has been deprived of the benefit of the final judgment which he had attained in the court below, and that, therefore, his appeal ought to be allowed as from a final judgment. The appeal to the privy council is not from the court below, but from the judgment by this court and the judgment rendered by this court is a judgment ordering a new trial and is merely interlocutory\nThe Privy Council in that case did. later on entertain an appeal ([5]), but on special leave, in virtue of the prerogative of the crown and not at all, as the misleading summary of the report gives it, on the ground that the Court of Appeal in Montreal had erred in refusing the leave to appeal.\nFOURNIER, GWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Trenholme, Taylor & Buchan.\nSolicitor for respondents: H, J.

R.S.C. ch. 135, ss. 24-28. Strong J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a judgment of the court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ordering the case to be sent back to the Superior Court in order to enable the parties to proceed on the merits of the scisie conservatoire and of the respondent's claim at the same time. The proceedings in the case are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given.\nDoherty Q.C. for respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nRobertson Q.C. and Laflamme Q.C. contra.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The judgment appealed from reversed the judgment of the Superior Court quashing a seizure before judgment taken by the plaintiff against the defendant on monies in the hands of the Prothonotary of the Superior Court, Montreal, and of the Provincial Treasurer. By his declaration accompanying the seizure the plaintiff claimed $3,932.17 for services as detailed in his account rendered to the defendant his wife and children and to protect the rights of the substitution created under the will of the late Hon. John Molson, and especially to save the sum of $13,712.50 which was seized in the cause.\nThe defendant took proceedings to quash the seizure on various grounds.\nThe Superior Court presided over by Mr. Justice Wurtele quashed the seizure\nThe Court of Queen's Bench reversed this judgment and ordered that the hearing of the petition contesting the seizure should be proceeded with at the same time as the hearing of the main action, and for this purpose directed that the petition should be joined to the said action to be decided at the same time as the merits of the action.\nThe respondent contends that no appeal will lie from this judgment, that, even admitting that the proceedings on the petition in question are judicial proceedings within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act in which an appeal would lie if the judgment on such proceedings were a final judgment, the judgment in question is in no sense final.\nI am of opinion that the judgment in this case was in no sense final but the exact opposite. This case is not governed by any previous decision of this court, and therefore the appeal should be quashed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appeal in this case is maintainable upon the authority of the judgment of this court in the case of Chevalier v. Gouvillier ([1]), and therefore the application to quash should be refused with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The judgment appealed from is clearly an interlocutory judgment and decides nothing. In my opinion it is not appealable.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In this case the plaintiff, now respondent, issued a writ of attatchment by garnishment. The defendant, now appellant, protested the attachment by a petition. The Superior Court granted the petition and quashed the attachment. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, but without adjudicating upon the petition, or upon the respondent's right to a seizure before judgment, simply ordered that the merits of the proceeding and of the action should be tried together. It is from this judgment that an appeal is taken to this court. I am of opinion that we have no jurisdiction. The judgment appealed from is clearly not a final judgment; it is not a judgment at all upon the contestation between the parties. A fair test on appeals to this court, where the question arises whether the judgment of the court of Queen's Bench is final, or interlocutory, seems to me this: Would such a judgment if given by the Superior Court, have been an interlocutory judgment or a jugement preparatoire ? If the answer to this is in the affirmative, then the judgment given by the Court of Appeal is an interlocutory judgment or a jugement preparatoire and not a final judgment from which an appeal lies to this court. It cannot be that a judgment which would be interlocutory only if given by the Superior Court, is not of the same nature, in the case, because given by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal may, when giving such an interlocutory judgment have to reverse a judgment which, if it remained unappealed from, would have been final, but that does not make the judgment of the Court of Appeal a final judgment so as to bring' it within the jurisdiction of this court. That is only the consequence of the decision they have come to to order an interlocutory or judgment di instruction, or rather the means to put the record in such a state that the interlocutory order may be given effect to. The judgment of the Court of Appeal deprived the present appellant of a judgment he had in his favor, it is true but it did not finally put an end to any matter in controversy between him and the respondent. It is equivalent to a judgment of preuve avant faire droit. Now, has such a judgment ever been held to be a final one ? It is evidently a \"simple judgment preparatoire ou d'instruc-tion. Goldring v. La Banque d'Hochelaga ([2]), is a case where, on a similar petition, the appeal was refused. The Privy Council in that case held that a judgment rejecting a petition to quash a capias was an interlocutory judgment from which there was no appeal. I refer also to Molson v. Carter ([3]). In that case the Court of Appeal had affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. But, if the Superior Court had granted the petition and quashed the capias, and if the Court of Appeal had reversed that judgment and rejected the petition, the result would have been the same and the Privy Council, I assume, would not have entertained the appeal. If interlocutory when confirming, it would not have been less interlocutory when reversing. Now, here, the appellant's case is a great deal weaker because his petition has not been dismissed but simply postponed for later adjudication. The appellant has invoked what he called, his constitutional right of appeal. Now there is no such right, nor any common law right of appeal. It is the creation of the statute and must be refused if not given in express or clear terms ([4]).\nPATTERSON J. concurred that the appeal should be quashed.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for respondent: Doherty & Doherty.\n[1] 4 Can S.C.R. 605\n[2] 5 App. Cas. 371.\n[3] 8 App. Cas. 530.\n[4] Chagnon v.

McLachlan, William McLachlan, Francis W. Radford and Thomas Brophy as members of a firm doing business in Montreal under the name of Mc-Lachlan Brothers & Co. The plaintiffs alleged that by the policy the appellants undertook to pay, within ninety days after the death of any one of the persons named, to the surviving representatives of the firm, the sum of $10,000, upon satisfactory proof of the death of such member of the firm. The plaintiffs further alleged that on the 18th November, 1888, John S. McLachlan met his death by drowning and that the policy was in full force and effect at the time of his death. On the 23rd December 1886 as was further alleged, appellants were notified that Thomas Brophy had ceased to be a member of the partnership and by endorsement upon the policy one James E. Bizzey was substituted for him.\nThe defendants pleaded three exceptions to the action. By the first they admitted the making of the policy but alleged they were not indebted; that the firm of McLachlan Brothers & Co. was dissolved on the 10th April, 1886, and by the conditions of the policy the insurance thereby became null and void.\nBy the second exception it was alleged that at the time of the death of J. S. McLachlan he was not a member of the firm of McLachlan Brothers & Co. he having on the 10th April, 1886, retired from the said firm.\nBy the third exception it was pleased that the action should have been brought by all the surviving members including Bizzey.\nBizzey subsequently intervened in the cause to meet the objection taken on the ground of his not being a party.\nTo the first plea the respondents answered that J. S. McLachlan never had retired from the firm, but that his capital remained in it and he retained an interest in the profits; that in September, 1886, when appellants substituted Bizzey for Brophy, by endorsement on the policy, the appellants had full knowledge that the two McLachlans, Bizzy and Radford had an interest in the insurance on the lives of each other as associated in the said business.\nThe trial of the action took place before a judge of the Superior court and a jury. Certain questions were put to the jury the questions and answers thereto being as follows:\u2014\nQuestion first (a). At the date of the policy, plaintiffs' exhibit No. one, did the defendants know that the only persons registered as interested in the firm of Mc-Lachlan Brothers & Co. were William and John S. McLachlan ?\nAnswer:\u2014Yes, by the registration of declaration.\n(b.) Were the defendants aware what business relations existed between the McLachlans Francis W. Radford and Thomas Brophy ?\nAnswer:\u2014Yes as shown by application for insurance.\n(c.) Had Radford and Brophy to the knowledge of the company defendant an interest in the success and existence of the business of McLachlan Brothers & Co.\nAnswer:\u2014Yes, as shown by application for insurance.\nQuestion Second:\u2014Did the defendant ever vary the terms of the policy excepting by consenting to a transfer of insurance from the person of Brophy to the per-son of James E. Bizzey ?\nAnswer: No.\nQuestion Third:\u2014Were McLachlan Brothers & Co. dissolved on or about the 10th April, 1886 ?\nAnswer:\u2014Yes, but J. S. McLachlan had a continued and active interest in the business\nQuestion Fourth:\u2014Did McLaughlan Brothers & Co. in that month publicly advertise that John S. McLachlan had retired and that a new firm had been formed ? Answer:\u2014Yes.\nQuestion Fifth, (a.)\u2014On the 18th of November, 1886, was John S. McLachlan a member of McLachlan Brothers & Co ?\nAnswer:\u2014No, but had an interest in profits.\n(b.) Had Bizzey any interest in the firm ?\nAnswer:\u2014No evidence.\nUpon these findings both parties moved at the ensuing term of the court of review for judgment with the result that the appellants' motion was granted and that of respondents refused, the effect being to dismiss the action.\nBefore the Court of Queen's Bench as before the Court of Review, respondents submitted that the answers of the jury warranted a judgment in their favor upon their motion for judgment; appellants on the other hand contended for the judgment in their favor. The Court of Queen's Bench, however, rejected both motions made by the parties severally and suo motu ordered a new trial.\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing in the Supreme Court the respondents took exception to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the judgment was not one from which an appeal would lie.\nThe question arising for decision is this: Assuming that the judgment, being a judgment ordering a new trial is not a final judgment does it come within any of the provisions of the act providing for appeals from judgment not in their nature final, and more especially the provisions relating to new trials ?\nThe only provisions relating to new trials are the following: An appeal shall lie:\n\" Sec. 24, sub-sec. (c.) From the judgment upon any motion to enter a verdict or non-suit upon a point reserved at the trial. \"\n\" (d.) From the judgment upon any motion for a new trial upon the ground that the judge has not ruled according to law.\"\n\" Sec. 30. Nothing in the three sections next preceding (secs. 27, 28 and 29) shall in any way affect appeals in Exchequer cases, cases of rules for new trials, and cases of mandamus, habeas corpus and municipal by-laws.\"\nSection 27 provides there shall he no appeal from orders made in the exercise of judicial discretion, except in equity cases.\nSection 28 provides that except as provided in the act appeals are to lie only from final judgments.\nSection 29 is the section regulating and limiting appeals from the province of Quebec.\nSection 61 also relates to new trials and is as follows: \" On any appeal the court may in its discretion order a new trial if the ends of justice seem to require it, although such new trial is deemed necessary upon the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence.\"\nDallon McCarthy Q.C., and Hatton Q.C. for appellants, and\nGreenshields Q.C. and H. Abbott Q.C. for respondents.\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(After reading the above statement of facts proceeded as follows): I think this is not a final judgment within the meaning of section 28, and does not come within any of the provisions of the sections relating to new trials, viz: sections 24 (a) 30 and 61 but the court of appeal in its discretion has ordered a new trial and consequently this is not an appealable case. As the objection was not taken by counsel but by the court after the case had been argued for two days the appeal will be quashed, but without costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order for a new trial made by the Court of Queen's Bench in the exercise of its discretion for the purpose of eliciting further information as to the facts, and, therefore for the same reasons as those assigned for the judgment in the preceding case of the Barrington, v. Scottish Union ([1]) it seems to me clear that no appeal lies in the present case. The objection to the jurisdiction of this court having been raised, not by the respondent but by my brother Taschereau after two days' argument by counsel on the merits, I think no costs should be given. The appeal must be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014We have no jurisdiction in this case, in my opinion. Upon the findings of the jury both parties moved for judgment. There was no motion for a new trial. The Superior Court in review dismissed the plaintiffs' motion and granted that of the defend-ants' and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, set aside the assignment of facts, and all the subsequent proceedings, and without adjudicating upon the merits ordered a venire de novo upon the grounds:\u20141st, That the assignment of facts was defective and insufficient; 2nd, That the answers of the jury thereto were so insufficient, contradictory and irregular that no judgment could be given there-on for either party. It is from this judgment that the company now appeals. Now this is clearly not a final judgment. Neither is it a judgment on a motion for a new trial upon the ground that the judge at the trial has not ruled according to law, nor a judgment upon any motion to enter a verdict or non-suit upon a point reserved at the trial. Consequently it is not appeal-able. I refer to my remarks in Molson v. Barnard ([2]) and Barrington v. Scottish Union ([3]) on the question.\nFOURNIER and PATTERSON JJ. concurred that the appeal should be quashed without costs.\nAppeal quashed without costs\nSolicitors for appellants: Hatton &c McLennan.\nSolicitors for respondents: Greenshields, Guerin & Greenshields.\n[1] See p. 617.\n[2] See p. 624.\n[3] Pee p. 619.\n"

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.\nAppeal\u2014Application to judge in chambers to set aside a writ of summons\u2014Final judgement.\nApplication was made to a judge in chambers to set aside a writ of summons served out of the jurisdiction of the court on the grounds that the cause of action arose in England and the defendant was not subject to the process of the court, and if the court had jurisdiction that the writ was not in proper form. The judge refused the application and his decision was affirmed by the full court.\nHeld, Gwynne J. hesitante, that the decision of the full court was not a final judgment in an action, suit, matter or other judicial proceeding within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act, and no appeal would lie from such decision, to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories([1]) affirming the ruling of a judge in chambers, who refused to rescind for irregularity an order for service of a writ out of the jurisdiction and to set aside the writ.\nThe plaintiff resided in the District of Alberta and the defendant was in the habit of spending a portion of each year in the Territories and residing in England the remainder of the time. An ordinary writ for service within the jurisdiction, returnable in ten days, was issued by the plaintiff, and the defendant not being found an order was made by a judge in chambers allowing the writ to be served out of the jurisdiction and extending the time for appearance to sixty days. The amended writ was served on the defendant in England and he moved before the judge who made the order to have it rescinded and the writ and all proceedings thereon set aside for irregularity. The motion was refused by the judge whose decision was affirmed by the full court. The defendant then sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChrysler Q.C. moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The decision appealed from is not a final judgement under the Supreme Court act but is a decision that deals merely with a matter of practice or procedure in the court below with which this court will not interfere. See Standard Discount Co. v. Le Grange ([2]).\nMoss Q.C. contr:\u2014The fact that an appeal relates to a matter of practice will not oust the jurisdiction of this court. McKinnon v. Kerouack ([3]); Wallace v. Bossom ([4]).\nAn important question as to the jurisdiction of the court below is involved in this appeal. In re Anglo-African s.s. Co. ([5]).\nThe following cases were cited as authorities for the position that defendant had no other remedy than to move as he did. In re Orr Ewing ([6]); Hewitsin v. Fabre ([7]): Fozen v. Hawkins ([8]).\nFor service out of the jurisdiction only a concurrent writ could be issued. Smallpage v. Tongue ([9]); Fowler v. Bristow ([10]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014After hearing the very full argument of Mr. Moss I cannot say that this case is anything more than an application to set aside a writ which was refused, and whether it touches the jurisdiction of the court below or not I do not think, so far as I can understand the case, to be of any importance whatever because the question we have to determine is not: Had the court below jurisdiction? but: Have we jurisdiction to hear the appeal ?\nI do not see how the decision in this matter can be called a final judgment under our statute or that it comes within any of the provisions of the act giving us jurisdiction and if not I fail to see how we can possibly hear an appeal our jurisdiction being purely statutory. If we should entertain this appeal we should be flooded with appeals in all cases where orders in chambers have been made and judgments pronounced thereon in matters relating to practice and procedure in the court below. I think the appeal should be quashed.\nStrong J.\u2014I am of opinion that the motion to quash this appeal must be granted. Mr. Moss has said everything that could be said in favor of the jurisdiction but he has failed to satisfy me that we can entertain the appeal. As the Chief Justice has said the only question is: Is this a final judgment? That is answered, I think, in this way. The application in this case was to set aside a writ of summons, nothing more nor less, and if we were to hold the decision of the judge a quo to be a final judgment under our statute, we should have to hold the same in every like case where judgment has been given affirming or setting aside an order of a judge in chambers. I think that the circumstance that an appeal would involve the question of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the territories to make an order for service beyond their territorial jurisdiction a mere incident in the case, and that it does not for the present purpose differ the case from any other order made as a mere matter of procedure.\nGwynne J.\u2014The point in question appears to be whether the court in the North West Territories had or not jurisdiction to make the order appealed against. Their order concludes the point, as far as that court can, that it had jurisdiction. I am not satisfied, if that was an erroneous decision, that there is not an appeal to this court under the statutes relating to our jurisdiction, but as the other members of the court appear to entertain no doubt upon the point I do not desire to delay judgment for further consideration of it.\nPatterson J.\u2014I think the question we are dealing with at present is not whether the court of the North-West Territories had jurisdiction, but whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and that must depend upon the question whether or not the judgment appealed from is, within the meaning of the statute by which we are governed, a final judgment. I do not think it is. I think it merely deals with the matter of setting aside a writ of mesne process. The cases referred to by Mr. Moss, which show that the question dealt with by the court below is one of considerable importance, and that the mode adopted by the appellant is the only one by which relief could be obtained, do not, in my opinion, touch the question of our jurisdiction. The observation of Baron Amphlett quoted by Mr. Moss from one of those cases([11]), makes the distinction between a summary decision by a judge in chambers, although it may, in England, be contested on appeal and if necessary in the House of Lords, and a determination of the merits of the action.\nOur jurisdiction does not arise until the merits have been disposed of. I think, therefore, that the appeal should be quashed.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Longhead, McCarthy & Beck.\nSolicitor for respondent: T. B. Lafferty.\n[1] 1 N.W.T.

J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.\nBill of sale\u2014Affidavit of bona fides\u2014Adherence to statutory form\u2014Proof of execution\u2014Attesting witness.\nWhere an affidavit of bona fides to a bill of sale stated that the sale was not made for the purpose of holding or enabling the bargainee to hold the goods mentioned therein against the creditors of the bargainor, while the form given in the statute uses the words \"against any creditors of the bargainor,\" such variation did not avoid the bill of sale as against execution creditors, the two expressions being substantially the same. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nThe statute requires the affidavit to be made by a witness to the execution of the bill of sale but as attestation is not essential to the validity of the instrument its execution can be proved by any competent witness.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories ([1]) affirming the judgment at the trial of an interpleader issue in favor of the defendants.\nThe issue was ordered to ascertain the title to a stack of oats. The plaintiffs claimed as execution creditors and the defendants as mortgagees under a bill of sale.\nThe bill of sale was attacked on two grounds. First, that the affidavit of bona fides was defective in not following the strict wording of the ordinance, the affidavit stating that the mortgage was not made to defeat or delay the creditors of the mortgagor the ordinance using the words any creditors.\nSecondly, that the bill of sale was not properly proved at the trial, it being made, as the ordinance requires, in the presence of an attesting witness who, under the rules of evidence in the territories, was the only person who could prove its execution and who was not called.\nThe court below held the bill of sale good as against both objections.\nDavis for the appellant. The Ontario courts have held, in these cases, that very slight deviations from the statute will invalidate a bill of sale. Harding v. Knowlson ([2]); Boynton v. Boyd ([3]); Boulton v. Smith ([4]). These cases have never been overruled, and are recognized as good law in Boldrick v. Ryan ([5]).\nThe words of the ordinance must be construed in their ordinary grammatical sense, and if there is a deviation which makes it doubtful if the meaning is the same as the statute so construed it is fatal.\nIn an affimative sentence the expression \"the creditors\" would include \"any creditors,\" but it is otherwise in a negative sentence. That the bill of sale could not be proved except by the attesting witness, see Bryan v. White ([6]); Roberts v. Phillips ([7]).\nMoss Q.C. for the respondent cited as to the objection to the affidavit, Mathers v. Lynch ([8]); Farlinger v. McDonald ([9]); Gemmill v. Garland ([10]); and that the execution of the mortgage was properly proved, Armstrong v. Ausman ([11]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nPatterson J.\u2014Mr. Davis in his learned and exhaustive argument presented very fully all the grounds that could be urged against the judgment appealed from, but without creating in my mind any doubt of its correctness.\nThe objection that the affidavit of bona fides fails to satisfy the statute because, while it denies any intention to hold the goods against the creditors of the bargainor the term used in the revised ordinance ch. 47 section 5 is \"against any creditors,\" seems to me to require a construction of the statute which would be unreasonable and unnecessary. I think the evidence furnished by the statute itself by means of the retention of the expression \" the creditors,\" in the two cognate sections (3 and 4) proves that the legislature regarded the two forms of expression as practically synonomous, and I do not think the criticism bestowed upon them, ingenious and thorough as it was, led at all directly to a different interpretation. The bargainee deposes that the instrument is not made for the purpose of holding or enabling him to hold the goods against the bargainor's creditors, or \"the creditors of the bargainor,\" which is precisely the same thing. It is urged that an assignment of perjury upon this affidavit would not be sustained by proof of intent to hold the goods against any number of creditors short of the whole body of them; in other words, that in case a debtor assigned to one creditor with intent to defraud all the others, or to a stranger with intent to defraud all his creditors but one with whom he had an understanding, he could, without fear of an indictment for perjury, make that affidavit. The proposition is, to my mind, too obviously untenable to require serious argument. If the intent was to defraud any creditors of the bargainor it cannot be truly said that there was no intent to defraud the bargainor's creditors. Thus whether the words are \"any creditors\" or \"the creditors,\" the meaning is the same.\nIt was argued that an intent to defraud one single creditor would be covered by the term \"any creditors\" and not by the other form of expression; but both expressions being in the plural the distinction is too subtle for my perception. It is not made clearer by a reference to the case cited of The Queen v. Rowlands ([12]), in which it was decided that an indictment charging a man with having removed his goods with intent to defraud his creditors, contrary to a statute which made it a misdemeanor to do so, was not sustained by proof of removing the goods for the purpose of defrauding one particular creditor, it not being shown that there were other creditors. It is not our duty at present to consider that decision more closely. The importance of clearly apprehending what is really decided by it before applying the decision as an authority in other cases is very obvious, but our present purpose is satisfied by noting that if the decision be taken to establish as a general proposition that a charge based on a plural form of words, e. g. \"his creditors\" will not be sustained by proof of an act touching one creditor alone, which is what must not be hastily assumed, it applies equally to both the plural expressions before us, \"the creditors\" and \"any creditors,\" and so fails to affect the discussion.\nI am not prepared to say that the inquiry whether a charge of perjury assigned upon the affidavit before us could be sustained by proof of intent to defraud any number of creditors, whether one or several, less than the whole body, is a final test of the sufficiency of the affidavit to satisfy the clause of the statute which, in the formula given, uses the words \" any creditors.\" I do not feel driven to pronounce on that point because, in my opinion, the test supports the sufficiency of the affidavit. We have to read the formula in the light of the Interpretation Ordinance, which enacts that slight deviations from forms prescribed by the ordinances, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead, shall not vitiate them ; and we have here an affidavit which deviates slightly from the formula given, the deviation not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead. We have in this particular a different rule of construction to follow from that on which we had lately to act in Archibald v. Hubley ([13]), in applying a statute which required a rigid adherence to the forms it prescribed.\nThe other point made on the appeal related to the proof at the trial of the bill of sale in question\nIt was proved by a credible witness who was not an attesting or subscribing witness to the execution of the instrument but who had been present at its execution.\nThere is no ground whatever for valid objection to the sufficiency of that proof. The objection taken con- founded two things which are quite distinct, the execution of the deed between the parties, which the statute does not interfere with, and the proof by affidavit for the purpose of notice to creditors and subsequent purchasers. That affidavit must be made by a witness to the instrument, and it was made by a subscribing witness. It is not the subject of objection.\nAttestation is not essential to the valid execution of the deed between the parties, and that being so the deed may be proved at a trial by one who is not attesting witness to it, whether there happens or does not happen to be an attesting or subscribing witness.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question raised on this interpleader issue is as to the validity of the bill of sale of a stack of oats by one Sparrow to the plaintiff Bannerman.\nBy an ordinance of the North-West Territories in force at the time of the execution of the bill of sale in question it was enacted that every sale, assignment and transfer of goods and chattels, not accompanied by an immediate delivery and followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the goods and chattels sold, shall be in writing, and that such sale shall be absolutely null and void as against the creditors of the bargainor, and as against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith, unless the bill of sale should be accompanied by an affidavit of the bargainee, or one of several bargainees, or of the agent of the bargainee or bargainees duly authorized to take the conveyance, that the sale is bon\u00e2 fide and for good consideration as set forth in the said conveyance, and not for the purpose of holding or enabling the bargainee to hold the goods mentioned therein against any creditors of the bargainor, which conveyance and affidavit were re- quired to be registered as in the ordinance directed within fifteen days from the execution thereof. By a bill of sale bearing date and made upon the 24th day of September, 1889, Sparrow, in consideration of the sum of $400.00 therein acknowledged to be paid to him by Bannerman, bargained, sold, assigned, transferred and set over to Bannerman the slack of oats in question, to have and to hold the same unto and to the use of Bannerman, his executors, administrators and assigns, to and for his sole and only use forever, and by the said conveyance Sparrow undertook and agreed to thresh the oats and to deliver the same in Calgary to Bannerman as soon as possible. While the stack of oats still remained unthreshed in Sparrow's possession it was seized by the sheriff upon executions in his hands at the suit of the above defendants as judgment creditors of Sparrow. The affidavit accompanying the bill of sale was made by Bannerman the bargainee, and is in the words following:\nI, James Bannerman, of &c., &c., in the foregoing bill of sale named, make oath and say, that the sale therein is bon\u00e2 fide, and for good consideration, namely, four hundred dollars, and not for the purpose of holding or enabling me this deponent to hold the goods mentioned therein against the creditors of the said bargainor.\nIt is objected that this affidavit is defective as not being in conformity with the affidavit prescribed in the ordinance, which required the affidavit of the bargainee to contain his declaration upon oath that the sale was not made for the purpose of enabling him to hold the goods \u201cagainst any creditors of the bargainor.\" I regret very much feeling constrained to yield to this objection, for I entertain no doubt, as has been found by the learned judge who tried the interpleader issue, that the transaction was an absolute and perfectly honest sale of the oats in question, and that it is not open to any of the other objections taken to it. I cannot, however, bring my mind to the conclusion that there is not a marked difference between an affidavit that a sale was not made for the purpose of enabling the bargainee to hold goods \"against any creditors of the bargainor,\" and that it was not made for the purpose of enabling him to hold them \"against the creditors of the bargainor,\" the former expression is identical with, \"any or any one of the bargainor's creditors\"\u2014while the latter refers to the general body of his creditors\u2014and although there might be no intention in a given case to hold goods purported to be sold to a bargainee against the general body of the bargainor's creditors there might be an intention to hold them against one particular creditor. Assuming, then, the latter to have been the intention in the present case, and that the deponent should be indicted for perjury, then, if the indictment should be framea assigning the perjury to have been committed in an affidavit stated in the words of the ordinance, the affidavit actually made upon its production would disprove the allegation in the indictment; and assuming the indictment to be framed stating the affidavit in the words in which it was actually made then the prosecution must fail upon its appearing that the intention, in point of fact, was to hold only against one particular creditor, although that is the very case which the ordinance declares shall make the bill of sale absolutely void against the bargainor's creditors. In the present case the bill was perfectly honest and absolute and for good consideration as found by the learned judge and not voidable within the meaning of the ordinance upon any ground except for defect in the affidavit of the bargainee of the bon\u00e2 fides of the sale; still I can see no way of avoiding the peremptory provision of the ordinance. I cannot concur in holding that an affidavit, the terms of which vary materially from the terms required by an ordinance, is a sufficient compliance with the ordinance, nor can I concur in the idea that we can for any reason assume that the alteration of the former ordinance upon the same subject by the substitution of the word \"any\" for the word \"the\" in the affidavit required to be made was occasioned by error, or carelessness or any inadvertence of the legislative body making the alteration, or that it was occasioned by the mistake of a clerk copying the ordinance as originally framed. The mistake in the frame of the affidavit most probably has been occasioned by the use of a printed form of bill of sale and affidavit endorsed thereon, as the same were in use before the former ordinance was repealed and the altered one substituted therefor, and although in the present case strict adherence to the terms of the amended ordinance will have the effect of defeating a perfectly honest, bona fide, absolute sale made for good consideration I can see no way, as I have already said, of getting over the peremptory provision of the ordinance. The appeal must, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: E. P. Davis.\nSolicitors for respondent: Smith & West.\n[1] 1 N. W. T. Rep.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMaster and servant\u2014Agreement for service\u2014Arbitrary right of dismissal Exercise of\u2014Forfeiture of property.\nBy an agreement under seal between M., the inventor of a certain machine, and McR., proprietor of patents therefor, M. agreed to obtain patents for improvements on said machine and assign the same to McR., who in consideration thereof agreed to employ M. for two years to place the patents on the market, paying him a certain sum for salary and expenses and giving him a percentage on the profits made by the sales. M. agreed to devote his whole time to the business, the employer having the right, if it was not successful, to cancel the agreement at any time after the expiration of six months from its date by paying M. his salary and share of profits, if any, to date of cancellation.\nBy one clause of the agreement the employer was to be the absolute judge of the manner in which the employed performed his duties, and was given the right to dismiss the employed at any time for incapacity or breach of duty, the latter in such case to have his salary up to the date of dismissal but to have no claim whatever against his employer.\nM. was summarily dismissed within three months from the date of the agreement for alleged incapacity and disobedience to orders.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal and of the Divisional Court, that the agreement gave the employer the right at any time to dismiss M. for incapacity or breach of duty without notice, and without specifying any particular act calling for such dismissal.\nHeld, per Ritchie C.J., Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ., that such right of dismissal did not deprive M. of his claim for a share of the profits of the business.\nPer Strong and Gwynne JJ., that the share of M. in the profits was only a part of his remuneration for his services which he lost by being dismissed equally as he did his fixed salary. Appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the decision of the Divisional Court[2] by which judgment for the defendant at the hearing was set aside.\nMarshall, the respondent, was the inventor of a crimping machine used in the manufacture of boots and shoes which he had patented in England and the United States as well as in Canada; These patents he had assigned to McRae, and having invented an improvement of the machine an agreement was executed between McRae as party of the first part, and Marshall as party of the second part, which after a covenant by Marshall that he would obtain patents for the said improvements and assign the same to McRae, and do the same with all subsequent improvements he might make, contained the following provisions:\u2014\n4. In consideration whereof the party of the first part hereby agrees to employ the party of the second part for the term of two years from the date hereof for the purpose of demonstrating and placing the said patents of invention granted or hereafter to be granted, on the market on the following terms, viz.: The said John A. McRae covenants to pay the said Thomas T. Marshall the sum of $100.00 per month during the said term of two years payable monthly, and in addition to said salary the party of the first part covenants and agrees to pay the actual travelling expenses and board of the party of the second part. And it is further agreed between the parties hereto that the said Thomas T. Marshall shall be entitled to and receive twenty per cent. of the actual net profits that are derived in any way whatsoever from the sale or otherwise of the paid patents of invention.\n6. That the said John A. McRae shall be absolute judge of what are expenses and what are not, and shall have the exclusive control and management of all matters in connection with the said patents, the party of the second part simply being his agent for the purposes aforesaid.\n7. That the said John A. McRae shall in the event of said business not proving a success have the right to cancel this agreement at any time after the expiration of six months from the date hereof, if he shall deem it advisable so to do, by paying the party of the second part all salary which may be due him up to the date of such cancellation and his share of the profits, if any, on the basis aforesaid.\n8. That the said Thomas T. Marshall shall devote his whole time and attention to the business of the party of the first part and shall neither directly or indirectly engage in any other business, occupation or employment and that he shall be faithful to the said McRae in all his transactions and dealings.\n10. It is further agreed that the party of the first part is to be the absolute judge as to the manner in which the party of the second part performs his duties under this agreement, and shall have the right at any time to dismiss him for incapacity or breach of duty, in which event the party of the second part shall only be entitled to be paid his salary up to the time of such dismissal and shall have no claim whatever against the party of the first part.\nThe provisions of this agreement were carried out between the parties for two or three months when McRae, wishing to test the crimping machine, gave orders to Marshall to have a certain quantity of leather prepared and the test made on a certain day. At the appointed time the leather was not ready and another day was appointed, but the preparations for the test being still incomplete McRae instructed his solicitor to discharge Marshall from his employment. This action was then brought by Marshall claiming damages for wrongful dismissal and his share of the profits under the agreement.\nAt the hearing before Mr. Justice Rose judgment was given dismissing the plaintiff's action. This judgment was reversed by the Divisional Court and judgment entered for the plaintiff with substantial damages. The decision of the Divisional Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, both courts proceeding on the ground that McRae in dismissing the plaintiff under clause 10 of the agreement could only do so after due notice to the plaintiff and hearing what he had to urge against it. The defendant, McRae, appealed to this court. Dalton McCarthy Q. C. for the appellant referred to The Queen v. The Bishop of London[3].\nNo counsel appeared on behalf of the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014Sections 5 and 10 of the agreement are as follows:\n5 That the said party of the first part shall cause to be kept proper books of account and entries shall be made therein of all such matters transactions and things as are usually kept and entered in books of account, and all the costs, charges and expenses in connection with the purchase of the said patents of invention by the said McRae and of the obtaining assignments thereof, and all the costs, charges and expenses in connection with the obtaining of further or other patents of invention, and any renewal or renewals thereof, and all the costs, charges and expenses in connection with the demonstrating and placing the said patents of invention on the market, including the said salary of the said Marshall, and all losses arising in any way in connection with the said patents shall be a first charge on the profits that may hereafter be derived from the said patents and shall be first deducted before any division of profits shall take place or be made.\n10. It is further agreed that the party of the first part is to be the absolute judge as to the manner in which the party of the second part performs his duties under this agreement, and shall have the right at any time to dismiss him for incapacity or breach of duty, in which event, the party of the second part shall only be entitled to be paid his salary up to the time of such dismissal and shall have no claim whatever against the party of the first part.\nI can see no reason why a provision of this kind cannot be so framed as to make the approval of the employer quite arbitrary, if it is exercised in good faith and not for the special purpose of defeating the contract.\nI cannot very well see how this stipulation could be more strongly drawn. The employer is to have the right at any time of dismissing the employee for incapacity or breach of duty, and the employer is to be the absolute judge as to the manner in which the employee performs his duties under the agreement.\nI think the question turns on the word of the contract which appear to me too clear and explicit to be misunderstood, and by them we must be governed. The law which I think should govern this case is very clearly stated in Stadhard v. Lee[4] as follows:\u2014\nCockburn C. J.:\nBut we are equally clear that where, from the whole tenor of the agreement, it appears that however unreasonable and oppressive a stipulation or condition may be the one party intended to insist upon and the other to submit to it a court of justice cannot do otherwise than give full effect to the terms which have been agreed upon between the parties. It frequently happens in the competition which notoriously exists in the various departments of business that persons anxious to obtain contracts submit to terms which, when they come to be enforced, appear harsh and oppressive. From the stringency of such terms escape is often sought by endeavoring to read the agreement otherwise than according to its plain meaning. But the duty of a court in such cases is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of both parties as evidenced by the agreement; and though, where the language of the contract will admit of it, it should be presumed that the par des meant only what was reasonable, yet, if the terms are clear and unambiguous, the court is bound to give effect to them without stopping to consider how far they may be reasonable or not.\nI agree with the trial judge and Chief Justice Hagarty that the defendant was not without apparent reason for availing himself of the power of dismissal, and I also agree with Mr. Justice McLennan who says:\nI think the preparation of the tests required by the defendant was within the scope of the plaintiff's duties as defined by the agreement, and that a neglect or refusal by him to prepare those tests would have been a breach of the agreement. It was most important, for the purpose of putting the invention on the market, to be able to show what it could do, and the one hundred pairs of uppers which the defendant [Illegible Text] to have prepared on different kinds of leather would have assisted that object. I think the first thing the parties would have had to do, in endeavoring to demonstrate or sell the invention, would be to show what it could do, and so to have specimens of its work. The defendant had no practical knowledge of the invention, and the inventor was the person he would naturally look to to prepare and supply him with what he required to enable him to display the results of the invention to those engaged in the shoe trade. I think the evidence shows that plaintiff in reference to this was derelict in his duty and that his dismissal was bon\u00e2 fide.\nI agree with Hagarty C. J. that the dismissal from the two years' employment by defendant does not involve or affect the plaintiff in his right to an interest in the property mentioned in the agreement; that the words \"shall have no claim,\" should be read as limited by the context to refer to a claim under that clause. I think the contract of hiring is wholly distinct from the respective rights and interests of the parties in the property existing, or to be acquired.\nI therefore think the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in which I concur.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014I would allow this appeal. I agree with the reasons assigned by Hagarty C. J. in the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The judgment which is appealed from appears to have proceeded upon the grounds that the respondent was interested in certain property in partnership with the appellant, and that the dismissal of the respondent by the appellant was not authorized by the agreement of the 2nd February, 1886, in the statement of claim mentioned, or if authorized that it amounted to an exclusion of the respondent from the partnership, and that, therefore, to attain such an end the proceeding to dismiss was in the nature of a judicial proceeding which must be pursued in accordance with the principle governing judicial proceedings, namely, by giving notice to the respondent of the appellant's intention to exclude him from the partnership and so giving him an opportunity to explain whatever conduct of his constituted the cause of the appellant's proposed exercise of his power of expulsion from the partnership, and to enable the respondent to show cause, as it were, why the power should not be exercised. Whether the authorities upon which the judgment has been rested apply to the circumstances of the present case is the sole point raised by the appeal; it will be necessary, therefore, to review them.\nIn Bagg's Case[5] the judgment was that a burgess or magistrate of a borough cannot be removed from his office for words of contempt addressed to the chief magistrate or his fellow burgesses, nor for any cause not against his duty as a citizen or burgess and against the public good of the city or borough whereof he is a freeman or burgess and against the oath which he took when he was sworn a freeman of the city or borough; and that where a corporation has power to disfranchise a freeman or burgess for sufficient cause they cannot remove him from his freedom without proceeding in a judicial manner and giving him an opportunity to answer the charge preferred against him and made the ground of his removal. In Rex v. Cambridge[6] the court of the congregation of the University of Cambridge assumed to deprive a graduate of his academical degrees for a contempt alleged to have been offered to the Vice Chancellor's Court, and it not being shown that there was a visitor to whom the party so deprived could appeal it was held that the court of Queen's Bench could interfere by mandamus to compel his restoration; and it was further held that assuming the university to have had power to deprive a graduate of his degrees they could only do so for good cause and after summons of the party, and hearing in a judicial manner the charge upon which the right to remove the accused was exercised. Const v. Harris[7] simply decided that where the majority of the partners in a firm desired to make a material change in the articles of partnership they must give all the partners notice of the proposed change and of the time when it should be taken into consideration; that the act of the majority is only the act of all provided all are consulted, and that the majority are acting bon\u00e2 fide with reference to the particular facts of that case Lord Eldon giving judgment says[8]:\u2014\nFor a majority of partners to say, we do not care what one partner may say, we being the majority will do what we please, is, I apprehend, what the court will not allow.\nIn Capel v. Child[9] it was held that where a statute gave a bishop power to interfere in a particular manner whenever it should appear to him, either upon affidavit or of his own knowledge, that by reason of the number of churches or chapels belonging to any benefice situate within his diocese, or the distance of such churches from each other, or the distance of the residence of the spiritual person holding the same, that the ecclesiastical duties of such benefice were inadequately performed in consequence of the negligence of the incumbent, that was a judicial power which could only be exercised after giving the incumbent an opportunity of shewing that he was guilty of no negligence, and of trying to satisfy the bishop that his duties were not inadequately performed Lord Lyndhurst there says[10]:\u2014\nHere is a new jurisdiction given, powers given to the Bishop to pronounce a judgment, and according to every principle of law and equity such judgment could not be pronounced, or if pronounced could not for a moment be sustained, unless the party in the first instance had the opportunity of being heard in his defence, which in this case he had not. And Bayley J. says[11]:\nI know of no case in which you are to have a judicial proceeding by which a man is to be deprived of any part of his property without his having had an opportunity of being heard.\nThe judgment of the bishop had subjected the vicar of a parish to the payment of \u00a390 per annum to a curate whom the bishop had imposed upon him as a punishment authorized by the statute, to assist in the discharge of the duties of the parish. But in re Hammersmith rent charge[12] in the same court differently constituted in 1849, under the Tithe Commutation Act 6 & 7 Wm. 4 c. 71, which enacted that \"where the half-yearly payments of rent charge on land shall be in arrear and unpaid for the space of forty days, and there shall be no sufficient distress upon the premises liable to the payment thereof, it shall be lawful for any judge of His Majesty's Courts of record at Westminster, upon an affidavit of the facts, to order a writ to issue to the sheriff requiring him to summon a jury to assess the arrears of rent charge remaining unpaid and to return the inquisition thereupon taken to some one of the Superior Courts,\" it was held by Pollock C. B. and Alderson and Platt BB. (Parke B. dissenting), that the fact of the writ of the sheriff having issued upon an order made ex parte afforded no ground for setting aside the writ and the subsequent proceedings. Parke B. proceeded upon the above language of Bayley J. in Capel v. Child[13] treating the order for the writ of the sheriff to issue to be equally in the nature of a judgment as was the proceeding in Capel v. Child (3). Alderson B., however, in his judgment says[14]:\nI look upon the question as one only of form and the reasonable construction of the 81st and 82nd sections of this particular Act of Parliament. He then proceeds to put upon them what appeared to him their proper construction, and he adds[15]:\nCertainly, the authorities do shew that when the proceeding is in the nature of a final judgment against a party he must in general be summoned and have the opportunity of being heard before the judgment can be properly pronounced against him. But here I cannot treat the issuing of the writ as a judgment, nor do I think that if it issues ex farte the party is punished without the opportunity of being heard, for it is no more like a judgment than a writ of capias is which after a judge is satisfied of certain facts by affidavit he is to issue against the defendant, and yet there the proceeding which issues ex parte deprives him of his liberty.\nAnd referring to Capel v. Child[16] he says[17]:\nWithout saying how far if it was res integra I should agree to that decision, and accepting it as an authority in a similar case, although it is difficult to understand why the bishop whom the legislature permitted to act on his own knowledge should be required to summon a party any more than a magistrate who is to present a road on his own view should summon the inhabitants before he does it which no one ever dreamed he ought to do: Yet it is clearly put there that the ex parte proceeding of the bishop was a judgment on a definite matter by the bishop against the incumbent and Lord Lyndhurst intimates in his judgment [p. 575], that if there could have been a proceeding to cancel the bishop's requisition it might have been different, but there the only subsequent proceedings were for the purpose of carrying into effect the final ex parte judgment.\nAnd Pollock C. B. says[18]:\nThe case of Capel v. Child (2), it must be admitted, is to some extent in principle and authority against the order. It was, however, upon a different Act of Parliament. It presented none of the inconveniences which the same course of practice would produce if we were to act on that principle in the present case, and the case of Capel v. Child (2), whatever it may be deemed now, having once been pronounced as the judgment of this court, and being a binding authority upon us sitting here, I can only say, as far as that Act of Parliament goes I shall feel myself bound by it, but not one degree further. I agree with my brother Alderson that if that case had to be re-argued I for one should be disposed to come to a different conclusion.\nBlisset v. Daniel[19], was a case of partnership. By the articles it was provided that the partners should meet every year within 60 days after the 30th June, and state, settle and finally adjust all the accounts and make a rest and settlement up and home to 30th June, to which end an inventory estimate and valuation of all the joint stock and property was to be taken, and also of the separate account of the partners, so that the true state and condition of the partnership and of the shares of the partners might clearly appear. There were then clauses providing for a partner wishing to retire from the firm or dying, becoming bankrupt or being expelled, under a power in that behalf vested in two thirds of the partners, and in all such cases there was one provision, namely, that the value of the removed partner's share was to be paid to him or his representatives as it stood on the last preceding 30th June. The plaintiff and his partners carried on business on amicable terms until the 26th August, 1850, when one of the partners, who was the managing partner, proposed that his son should be admitted to a share of the management; the plaintiff objected to this on principle whereupon the managing partner declared to the partners other than the plaintiff that he would not continue in the concern together with the plaintiff, and pointed out to them the clause of expulsion. On the 29th August the plaintiff signed the accounts without being made aware of this declaration or of the clause of expulsion which all parties had forgotten. On the evening of the 29th August the plaintiff received a notice duly signed signifying his expulsion from the firm, and the defendants, the remaining partners, proceeded to pay him out at the rate at which his shares stood in the account as signed. No cause was alleged or assigned in the notice or in the answers to the bill. Evidence was gone into by the plaintiff and not attempted to be met by the defendants to show that the valuation upon which the estimate of his share rested was purely conventional and did not nearly represent the full market value of the plaintiff's share. Upon a bill to have the notice of expulsion declared void and to have the concern wound up and he plaintiff's real share ascertained by a sale, Sir W. P. Wood V. C. held:\n1. That the notice of expulsion need not assign any cause nor be founded on a previous meeting of the company in committee with each other.\n2. That the valuation at which the share of a partner expelled without cause assigned and proved should be estimated must be a real valuation and not the conventional valuation in the books; that no means were pointed out for arriving at such a valuation except by sale; that a sale was contrary to the whole scope of the articles of partnership; that there was, therefore, no method of ascertaining the value of the plaintiff's share; and that, therefore, the clause of expulsion could not be acted on.\n3. That the power of expulsion was one vested in the two thirds of the partners but to be exercised for the advantage, not of themselves, the expelling partners, still less at the wish or for the benefit of one of their number, but for the benefit of the whole concern, and therefore;\n4. That under the circumstances of concealment from the partner intended to be expelled of all intention on the subject until after he had signed the accounts, and Vaughan, the managing partner, having procured the other partners to join in expelling the plaintiff, not upon their own judgment, but under threats of the managing partner to retire from the management and the concern altogether, the power had not been exercised bon\u00e2 fide.\nSir W. P. Wood, after stating the circumstances under which, as appeared in evidence, the notice of expulsion was given, says[20]:\nIt is impossible to uphold that notice. The power was intended for the benefit of all\u2014not that one partner (for in reality all this emanated from Mr. Vaughan), being dissatisfied with the manners and conduct of another should, behind the other's back, suggest and procure\u2014nay, almost by threats, coerce\u2014others of his partners to join him in expelling a partner whom he alone seeks to expel.\nAnd again[21],\nHad the defendants made out their case as to uncourteous bearing I could not possibly hold but that this was an act of arbitrary power on the part of the expelling partners at the suggestion of Mr. Vaughan alone\u2014an advantage obtained by him for his own purposes, behind the plaintiff's back, which he cannot be allowed to retain.\nThis case proceeded upon the clear establishment of a flagrant case of actual mala fides in the attempt to exercise a power contained in articles of partnership under circumstances which did not come within the intent with which the power was inserted in the articles, and in two of the partners withholding the exercise of their own judgment as to the propriety of the expulsion of their co-partner, and submitting to the dictation and coercion of a third partner who, for his own private purposes and benefit, and not at all for the benefit of the partnership, conceived the design of getting rid of the plaintiff, against whom he may be said to have entertained a personal grudge, by procuring his expulsion from the firm.\nIn Clarke v. Hart[22], it was held that a power in co-adventurers to forfeit the shares of one of their number for non-payment of calls is not necessarily incident to a mining adventure conducted on the cash book principle. This case is an authority that where a powder to forfeit the shares of a co-adventurer exists, either by agreement between the parties or by a legally established custom, it is to be treated as strictissimi juris like a power of forfeiture with respect to an estate, and the forms prescribed by the agreement, or established by the custom, to be observed in declaring the forfeiture must be strictly followed.\nLord Chancellor Chelmsford there says[23]:\nI am clearly of opinion that supposing the power to have existed it has not been duly exercised and that there has been no proper resolution by which the appellants could declare the shares of the respondent to be forfeited. It is unnecessary to advert to the principle that forfeitures are strictissimi juris, and the parties who seek to enforce them must exactly pursue all that is necessary to enable them to exercise this strong power. With regard to this particular case it seems to be admitted, both by the answers and by the evidence on the part of the appellants, that the only proper mode of declaring a forfeiture was by convening a general meeting after the period limited for payment of the calls and the party being in default, that general meeting being necessarily to be preceded by notice to all the adventurers to enable them to attend it, and also, as appears to have been conceded at the bar, by a notice of the intention for which the meeting was convened.\nIn Regina v. The Archbishop of Canterbury[24] where a statute gave an appeal to the archbishop from the judgment of a bishop revoking the license of a curate, and the curate appealed from such a judgment of his bishop, it was held that it was not competent for the archbishop to affirm the judgment of the bishop without giving the curate an opportunity of being heard upon his petition of appeal.\nLord Campbell C.J. there[25] says:\nThe legislature here gives an appeal from the bishop to the archbishop that implies that the appellant is entitled to an opportunity of being heard. The appellant here has not been heard. In his petition he denies almost everything charged against him specifically, and asks the archbishop to appoint a time and place at which he may be heard and adduce evidence on his behalf. Without any communication with him the judge decides against him. That was not a hearing. The appellant should have had an opportunity of arguing before the archbishop that the bishop's decision was nut correct upon the facts.\nAnd Compton J. says:\nWhere a statute of this kind gives an appeal it gives by implication a right to be heard upon the appeal. Sec. 111 clearly contemplates a judicial inquiry before the archbishop, that is, a further inquiry, not merely one upon the original document set forth in the appeal.\nPhillips v. Foxall[26] is an authority that on a continuing guarantee for the honesty of a servant if the master discovers that the servant has been guilty of dishonesty in the course of the service, and instead of dismissing the servant chooses to continue him in his employ without the knowledge and consent of the surety express or implied, he cannot afterwards have recourse to the surety to make good any loss which may arise from the dishonesty of the servant during the subsequent service. What bearing this case has upon the present is not apparent; wha is relied upon is the language of Blackburn J. who, although he arrived at the same conclusion as the other members of the court, did so upon different grounds from those upon which they proceeded; still I cannot see any thing in this language of Blackburn J. which can be said to have any bearing upon the present case. At page 680 he says:\u2014\nA surety, as soon as his principal makes default, has a right in equity to require the creditor to use for his benefit all his remedies against his debtor, and as a consequence if the creditor has by any act of his deprived the surety of the benefit of any of those remedies the surety is discharged. * * * Now the law gives the master the right to terminate the employment of a servant on the discovery that the servant is guilty of fraud. He is not bound to dismiss him, and if he elects after knowledge of the fraud to continue him in his service he cannot at a subsequent time dismiss him on account of that which he has waived or condoned. This right the master may use for his own protection. If this right to terminate the employment is one of those remedies which the surety has a right to require to have exercised for the surety's protection, it seems to follow that by waiving the forfeiture and continuing the employment without consulting the surety the principal has discharged him.\nWood v. Woad[27] was the case of a mutual insurance association one of the rules of which was that a committee of the society should have entire control of the funds and affairs of the society, and that if the committee should at any time deem the conduct of any member suspicious, or that such member was for any other reason unworthy of remaining in the society, they should have full power to exclude such member by directing the secretary to give such member notice in writing that the committee had excluded such member from the society, and after the giving of such notice such member should be excluded and have no claim or be responsible for or in respect of any loss or damage happening after such notice; and it was held that this rule did not empower the committee to expel a member upon the alleged ground that his conduct was suspicious or that he was for some reason unworthy of remaining in the society without giving the plaintiff an opportunity of being heard before them in vindication of his conduct and character against the charge, whatever it might be, which was relied upon as ground of expulsion. Kelly C.B. referring to the power of the committee and their duty under the above rule says[28]:\nThey are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim audi alteram partem, that no man shall be condemned to consequences resulting from alleged misconduct unheard and without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals.\nFisher v. Keane[29] is an authority that the committee of a club are a quasi-judicial tribunal and bound in proceeding under the rules of the club against a member of the club for alleged misconduct to act according to the ordinary principles of justice, and are not to convict him of an offence warranting his expulsion from the club without giving him due notice of their intention to proceed against him and affording him an opportunity of defending or palliating his conduct; and the court will, at the instance of any member so proceeded against, declare any resolution passed by the committee without previous notice to him, based upon ex-parte evidence, and purporting to expel him from the club, to be null and void and will restrain the committee by injunction from interfering by virtue of such a resolution with his rights of membership. Jessel M.R. before whom the case was heard, giving judgment, says: \u2014\nIn the first place I have to consider what the true construction of the rule is and in the second place I have to consider whether the method adopted by the committee of putting that rule in force was such as according to the rules of conducting judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings ought to have been adopted.\nThen after reading the rule and commenting on it he came to the conclusion that its clear grammatical construction was:\u2014\nThat a member shall not be recommended to resign unless the recommendation is agreed to by two thirds of the committee specially summoned for the purpose.\nAnd as to the second point he says[30]:\nAs I paid before it does behoove the committee, who are a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, to be very careful before they expose one of their fellow members to such an ordeal. They ought to gravely consider, when proceeding to enforce such a rule as this, whether he has committed any offence at all, and especially whether he has committed such an offence as will warrant their branding him with the name of an expelled member of their club. In the present instance they did nothing of the kind. At a meeting without notice a, few members only being present, they allowed two other gentlemen behind the back of the plaintiff to make a statement (upon which they acted,) as what he said and did in the billiard room on the night in question.\nAnd he concludes[31] this:\nIn my opinion a committee acting under such a rule as this are bound to act, as Lord Hatherley said[32], according to the ordinary principles of justice and are not to convict a man of a grave offence which shall warrant his expulsion from the club without fair adequate and sufficient notice and the opportunity of meeting the accusation brought against him. They ought not according to the ordinary rules by which justice should be administered by committees of clubs, or by any other body of persons who decide upon the conduct of others, to blast a man's reputation for ever\u2014perhaps to ruin his prospects for life, without giving him an opportunity of either defending or palliating his conduct.\nSteuart v. Gladstone[33] was a case where, in articles of co-partnership, there was a provision that if the majority of the partners should at any time desire that any of the partners should retire, and should give him six months notice in writing to that effect, the partnership should as regarded him be dissolved at and from the time mentioned in the notice; and it was held by Fry J. that the majority had not power to exclude a partner under that provision in the articles without giving him a full opportunity of explaining his conduct but that, upon the evidence in that case, the defendants had given the plaintiff such opportunity. Labouchere v. Earl Wharncliffe[34] was a case before Jessel, the Master of the Rolls, identical in character with Fisher v. Keane[35] before the same learned judge, and upon the facts of the case the learned judge held that the committee of the club had acted without full inquiry and without giving the plaintiff notice of any definite charge, that the resolution expelling him' was carried without a sufficient majority and that the plaintiff was entitled to the injunction prayed for in his bill. Dawkins v. Antrobus[36] is a decision of Jessel M.R., affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that where the committee of a club proceeded to expel a member in accordance with the rules of the club the courts have no jurisdiction to interfere with the decision of the members duly assembled, or to inquire whether the decision was reasonable or unreasonable, or to interfere at all unless the decision could be attributed to actual malice and want of good faith.\nGould v. Webb[37] was a case in which it was held that, to an action brought by a newspaper correspondent for wrongful dismissal from his employment under a contract with the defendant, pleas averring certain defaults of the plaintiff to fulfil the terms of his contract as justifying the dismissal did not justify a dissolution of the contract. It was a question of pleading arising upon demurrer to pleas in which the right to dismiss the plaintiff from his employment was rested upon the assertion of a legal right founded upon specifically alleged breaches of his contract by the plaintiff, and the judgment which allowed the demurrer simply decided that the acts, default in the fulfilment of which was pleaded as justifying the dismissal, were not acts the performance of which constituted conditions of the contract continuing in existence, that they were mere stipulations the breach of which, although they might give the defendant a cause of action against the plaintiff, did not in point of law justify a dissolution of the contract.\nWinstone v. Linn[38] was simply a decision that covenants in an indenture of apprenticeship are independent covenants, and consequently that acts of misconduct on the part of the apprentice stated in the plea were not an answer to an action brought for breach of covenant by the master to instruct and maintain the apprentice during the term agreed upon by the indenture. Neither of these two last cases, it is obvious, can have any application to the present case.\nRussell v. Russell[39] is a decision that where partnership articles between A and B provided that, if the business should not be conducted to the satisfaction of B. he should have power to give notice to A. to determine the partnership, this was a power which was exercisable at B's. sole will and pleasure without any previous notice of intention to exercise the power being given to A. The case is particularly valuable as containing a review by Jessel M.R. of Blisset v. Daniel[40] and Wood v. Woad,[41]in which that learned judge, while thoroughly approving of the judgments in those cases, points out, with that judicial precision for which he was remarkable, how very different the facts of these cases were from the facts of the case then before him, in language whch seems to me to furnish a perfect guide in the determination of the question: To what state of facts will the judgment in those cases apply and to what will they not apply? As to Wood v. Woad (3) he says[42]:\nNow one must consider what Wood v. Woad (3) was to show how different it is from this case. Woad v. Wood (3) was in effect this: there was a rule which allowed a committee of a mutual insurance society to expel a member, and the ground was that if the committee should at any time deem the conduct of any member suspicious, or that such member is for any other reason unworthy of remaining in this society, they should have full power to exclude such member. Consequently by excluding him the committee declare to the world, to all his neighbors and friends, and to all the other members of the society in particular, that they \"deem\" his conduct suspicious, and for some reason that he is unworthy to remain in the society. By the very act of excluding him they cast a stigma upon him; then remembering that I have to say a word as to the use of the word \"deem.\" That word has more than, one meaning, but one of its meanings is to adjudge or decide. In fact the old word \"deemster\" or \"dempster\" was the name for judge\u2014to \"deem\" at one time meant to decide judicially. Consequently, taking that meaning what they had to do was to \"deem\" that the member's conduct, was suspicious, and such as made him unworthy. That was in fact a decision not merely depending upon opinion but depending on inquiry. No one could suppose it was to be left to the caprice of the members of the committee to stigmatise as dishonorable or dishonest any member of the society. Of course it was not. It was intended that they should be satisfied by something like reasonable evidence that his conduct was unworthy. Therefore, in construing the rule the Court of Exchequer came to the conclusion, and if I may say so I think rightly came to the conclusion, that it was a case in which the committee ought not to have decided until after inquiry. That case therefore has no bearing upon the question as regards the partnership right to give notice to one partner to dissolve. It is a case of a totally different kind.\nThen as to Blisset v. Daniel[43] he says:\u2014\nThat was a very peculiar case. The case there was this: A majority of the partners consisting of two thirds wished to expel a partner and nothing more, but if they did expel him the other partners had a right to buy up his shares in a particular way by valuation. All the vice-chancellor decided was this, that in a case of that kind they had no right to expel merely for the purpose of buying up the shares, and that it was not a fair and bon\u00e2 fide exercise of the power. He decided that the partners were not to meet together and say, \"we should like to have so and so's shares and therefore we will expel him;\" that was a consequence of the expulsion but it was not to be the motive of the expulsion, it was not a bon\u00e2 fide exercise of the power. Then they alleged that they had grounds of dissatisfaction with the partner, but his reply in effect was, \"if you have any ground of dissatisfaction you ought to have given me notice to see if I had anything to answer.\"\nThere the vice chancellor was of opinion that even in that limited case, where it was only inter se as regards the partners themselves, yet if the reason as far as the other partners were concerned was misconduct they ought to give the partner sought to be expelled an opportunity of explaining his alleged misconduct.\nThe learned judge then proceeds to compare that case with the one before him and says: \u2014 How that case applies to the case of a single partner I do not well understand. In the case of several partners it may well be that it is a thing to be considered, but if it is a single partner it is plain that neither Blisset v. Daniel[44] nor Wood v. Woad[45] has any application because the moment you give the power to a single partner in terms which shew that he is to be sole judge for himself, not to acquire a benefit but to dissolve the partnership, then he may exercise that discretion capriciously, and there is no obligation upon him to act as a tribunal or to state the grounds on which he decides for himself.\nThen, as to the power vested in the partner in the case before him, he says:\nIt is plainly a power which puts it entirely within the right of W. A. Russell to say: \"I am not satisfied although all the world except myself would be satisfied with such a result.\" In other words, it is a power which he may exercise at his will and pleasure, capriciously or not capriciously as he thinks fit, and to my mind the cases cited have not any bearing whatever. He need not make any inquiry. He need not call upon the partners for explanation. It is open to him to say \"I am not satisfied\" and there is an end of it.\nLet us now see what are the circumstances of the present case in order to determine whether any, and which, of the above cases apply to and govern it. In the year 1885 the plaintiff, Thomas Fennock Marshall, one Greorge A. Philp and one Alexander W. Thompson were carrying on business together in partnership at Hagersville, in the County of Haldimand, under the name, style and firm of \"The Marshall Seamless Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Company,\" in the carrying on of which business they used a crimping machine for the manufacture of boots and shoes for which, and for certain improvements from time to time made therein by Marshall, letters patent were granted to him by the Dominion of Canada. The three partners were severally possessed of equal shares or interest in the said letters patent. On the 2nd of October, 1885, the defendant met for the first time Marshall and Philp in Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, and was there induced by them to purchase from Philp two-twelfths of his share, and from Marshall one-twelfth of his share, in the said patents and patented articles. The deed from Marshall to the defendant, bearing date the 5th of October, 1885, has been produced, and thereby it appears that Marshall assigned and transferred to the defendant, his executors, administrators and assigns a full absolute one-twelfth interest in and share of three several letters patent for the said crimping machine and the improvements made therein (previously recited in the deed of assignment), and all other patents that may have been issued in respect of such improvements, and the inventions and improvements to which the said letters patent refer and in all rights and benefits held and enjoyed by the said Marshall or to which he is or may become entitled under said letters patent or any other or future letters patent that have been or may be issued for improvements in said invention. On the 21 October, 1885, this assignment appears to have been duly registered in the patent office of the Dominion of Canada. On the 30th October the defendant met Marshall by appointment at the city of Hamilton, and then learned that the said partnership so trading as aforesaid under the name, style and firm of \"The Marshall seamless boot and shoe manufacturing company,\" at Hagersville had become insolvent, and that the firm on the 22nd of October had made an assignment of all their estate and effects to one Lamb in trust for the benefit of their creditors. Besides the letters patent for the said crimping machine and the said improvements made therein granted by the Dominion of Canada, the said Marshall had obtained letters patent in the United States for the said crimping machine and the said improvements made therein, and also in Great Britain. The defendant made an offer to the assignee for the whole property and stock in trade of the partnership including the interest and rights of all the partners severally and respectively held by them in all the letters patent granted for the said crimping machine and the improvements therein. In order, as it would seem, to give effect to this offer, Marshall and Philp and Mary Jane Thompson executrix of the said Alexander W. Thompson, who had died in the month of august previously, executed a deed bearing date the 28th of November, 1885, whereby, after reciting that on the 22nd October, 1885, Marshall and Philp had made an assignment to Lamb for the benefit of the creditors of the firm, and that doubts had arisen as to whether the interest of Marshal and Philp in the several letters patent set out in a schedule annexed to the deed had passed under the said assignment, and that it, had been agreed by and between the several parties to the deed now in recital that Marshall, Philp and Mary Jane Thompson, executrix of the said Alexander W. Thompson deceased, should execute an assignment of all their respective interests in said letters patent to the said Lamb, it was witnessed that the said Marshall, Philp and Mary Jane Thompson, as such executrix, did thereby grant, bargain, sell, assign, transfer and set over all their respective interests in the said letters patent particularly enumerated in said annexed schedule unto the said Lamb, in trust for the creditors of the said Marshall, Philp and Thompson deceased, formerly carrying on business in partnership together under the name and style of \"the Marshall seamless boot and shoe manufacturing company.\" The assignee Lamb, under the authority of this deed, sold, assigned and transferred the whole estate and stock in trade of the said partnership firm, together with said absolute interest in the said letters patent so conveyed to Lamb, unto the defendant who thereupon became the absolute owner thereof for his own benefit, for good, full and valuable consideration paid by him therefor. The letters patent enumerated in the schedule annexed to the deed were nine in number, all of them being for the said crimping machine or for improvements therein and thereto made by Marshall, one of which letters patent was granted in Great Britain, four by the Dominion of Canada, and four by the United States of America, of which latter one was issued to the said Alexander W. Thompson deceased. Immediately upon the defendant so acquiring the absolute interest in the said letters patent he employed Marshall to carry on the boot and shoe manufacturing business for him until the 2nd of February, 1886, when Marshall having alleged that he had made some further improvements in the said crimping machine an agreement was executed by and under the hands and seals of Marshall and the defendant whereby after reciting among other things that the defendant was the owner of the said letters patent of invention (a list of which was annexed to the deed) under and by virtue of certain assignments thereof which had been duly registered, and that the said Marshall had made certain improvements in the said patents of invention, and that the defendant had agreed to employ the said Marshall for the purpose of demonstrating and placing the said patents of invention granted, and all such as are hereafter granted, upon the market for the purpose of sale in such manner as the defendant should deem most advantageous, he, the said Marshall, covenanted that he would at the request of the defendant apply and petition for, and take such steps as might be necessary for obtaining, letters patent in all such countries as the defendant should deem advisable, and at the cost, charges and expenses of the defendant, and that he should also, as speedily as might be after the date of the said agreement, apply for said petition or take such steps as might be necessary for obtaining letters patent for the said alleged improvements he had made in the said crimping machine in all such countries as the defendant might deem advisable, all fees, costs, charges and expenses in connection with the obtaining of such letters patent being borne by the defendant; and that upon such letters patent being granted he would assign them to the defendant; and it was expressly provided that the defendant should have exclusive control and management of all matters in connection with the said patents, and that the said Marshall should be simply the defendant's agent for the purposes aforesaid. And the said Marshall covenanted to devote his whole time and attention to the business of the defendant, and that he should not directly or indirectly engage in any other business, occupation or employment, and that he should be faithful to defendant in all his transactions and dealings, and should from time to time consult him in all matters in any way appertaining to the said patents or any of them. And the defendant by the said deed agreed to employ Marshall for the term of two years from the date of the said deed, for the purpose of demonstrating and placing the said patents of invention granted, or to be granted, on the market on the following terms, namely, $100.00 per month to be paid to the said Marshall during the said term and his actual travelling expenses and board and twenty per cent of the actual net profits that should be derived in any way whatsoever from the sale or otherwise of the said patents of invention. And finally it was agreed by and between the said parties to the said deed that the defendant should be the absolute judge as to the manner in which the plaintiff Marshall should perform his duties under the said agreement, and should have the right at any time to dismiss him for incapacity or breach of duty, and that in such event the plaintiff should only be entitled to be paid his salary up to the time of such dismissal, and should have no claim whatever against the defendant.\nThis deed, as it appears to me, is plainly framed upon the assumption that the defendant, as purchaser of the absolute rights of Marshall, Philp and Thompson in the letters patent already issued for the crimping machine, and for improvements made thereto by Marshall, of which the deed recites that the defendant is the owner, was also entitled to the benefit of the further improvement in the machine alleged by Marshall to have been made by him but not yet patented; and there can, I think, be no doubt that, in point of fact, the defendant was so entitled to this extent and in this sense, that as the improvement was alleged to be in the patented machine, of which the defendant was then the acknowledged owner, the plaintiff adversely to the defendant could have had no enjoyment of letters patent for such improvement. The alleged improvement in the patented machine, of which the defendant was the owner, if patented by Marshall would not have enabled him to make any use of the defendant's patented machine; and as the alleged improvement was in that machine itself such improvement of itself, apart from the machine, would have been useless; and the use of it by Marshall in connection with the defendant's patented machine would have been an infringement of the defendant's rights in the patented machine of which he was the acknowledged owner by assignment from Marshall, so that Marshall could have had no beneficial enjoyment of his newly alleged improvement during the currency of the letters patent assigned to the defendant. Ex parte Fox[46]. Such being the position of the parties Marshall, by the deed of the 2nd February, 1886, agrees to apply for letters patent for his alleged improvement, not for himself and his own benefit, but for the defendant and simply as his agent, and at his request, and at his costs, charges and expenses, and only in such countries as he shall direct, and the defendant agrees to employ Marshall to devote his whole time and attention in the business of the defendant for the purpose of demonstrating and placing the said patents of invention upon the market, and agrees to pay Marshall certain specified remuneration for the services to be rendered by him, consisting partly of a determined sum per month besides his actual travelling expenses and board and partly of an undetermined sum of 20 per cent. of net profits, such part being conditional upon there being any such profits, but the whole of such payments, both the determined or fixed sum and the conditional, being by way of remuneration only for the services to be rendered by Marshall during the period for which he was to be employed, namely for two years, subject to express provision that the defendant should be the absolute judge of the manner in which the plaintiff should perform the duties of his said employment, and should have the absolute right to dismiss the plaintiff at any time for what the defendant should consider to be in breach of the plaintiff's duty in the rendering the services required of him. This, as it appears to me, is the manifest construction of the contract, and it gave in plain terms an absolute right to the defendant to determine the employment whenever the plaintiff should fail to give the defendant satisfaction as to the manner in which the plaintiff performed the services required of him, without specifying any particular act or default which failed to give satisfaction. To use the language of Jessel M. R. in Russell v. Russell,[47]which is the only one of the above cases which appears to me to apply to and govern this case: It is open to the defendant to say to the plaintiff I am not satisfied with the manner in which you discharged the duties required of me, and there is an end of it.\nIn the event of the defendant exercising such his right to dismissal it was expressly agreed that the plaintiff should have no claim for anything whatever save only payment of his salary under the agreement up to the time of such dismissal, and this, in my opinion, determines the plaintiff's claim as well for that portion of the remuneration agreed to be paid to him which was conditional upon there being net profits, as for the fixed sum agreed to be paid monthly. Turning now to the plaintiff's statement of claim we find that he rests his claim for relief:\n1st. Upon the allegation that the agreement does not contain the true agreement between the parties, and he states what he alleges was the true agreement, and prays that the deed may be reformed; but in this contention the plaintiff wholly failed for he admitted that the agreement had been read to him, that he objected to the clause relating to dismissal, but that the defendant said that if he, the plaintiff, would not sign the agreement as it was, he would have nothing more to do with it. He admitted that, upon this, he signed the agreement with full knowledge of the terms of the clause as to dismissal, and although he thought it a very arbitrary clause and that he thought he was wrong in signing it, and although he made no remonstrance against his dismissal, he thirteen months afterwards brings this action in which, without any averment that he has always been ready and willing since the dismissal to render the services he had agreed to render, he complains:\n2. That the defendant dismissed him wrongfully and unlawfully, and without any just or sufficient cause; and he claims a right in law to obtain the whole benefit of the employment as if he had continued rendering services to the satisfaction of the defendant during the whole term of the two years.\nThat the agreement is not one in the nature of a co-partnership interest in the letters patent granted for the crimping machine and for the improvements made therein there can be, in my opinion, no doubt. It was simply a contract of employment of the plaintiff by the defendant to render certain services to the defendant in the business of the latter, for which services the defendant agreed to give to the plaintiff a stated remuneration, partly fixed and determined, partly undetermined and conditional upon there proving to be a net profit accruing from the business, and he agreed that the employment should continue for two years, subject to the condition that the defendant might at any time dismiss the plaintiff if he should fail to perform the services required of him to the defendant's satisfaction, and that upon such dismissal the plaintiff's claim upon the defendant for every part of the remuneration agreed to be paid should cease and determine. This may have been, as the plaintiff admits he thought it was when he signed the contract, an arbitrary clause; with that the court has nothing to do; arbitrary or not arbitrary it is the contract of the parties that it should have effect.\nBut whatever be the true construction of the contract, Russell v. Russell[48] and the language of the learned Master of the Rolls there commenting upon Blisset v. Daniel[49] and Wood v. Woad[50], is conclusive, in my opinion, that the present case was not at all one in which a judge has any right to inquire whether the defendant had or had not sufficient cause for exercising the power of dismissal, which by the contract was submitted to his sole absolute judgment and discretion; and even if mala fides could be a matter to be inquired into and passed upon in a case of dismissal under a contract in the terms in which the present is, none was suggested in the statement of claim, or in point of fact, at all; nor did there appear to be any ground upon which such a charge could be rested. The learned judge who tried the case was of opinion that even if the point was open to him to decide there was no evidence to justify his arriving at the conclusion that the defendant acted otherwise than with the most perfect good faith in exercising the power of dismissal vested in him by the contract. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal has taken the same view of the evidence, in which, also, I must say that I entirely concur. The appeal therefore must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and judgment entered for the defendant in the court below dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree with his lordship the Chief Justice of Ontario that the dismissal of the plaintiff under the tenth clause of the agreement did not work a forfeiture of his interest in any profits that might happen to be made by means of the patents, but that it only cut short the two years' engagement, and that his dismissal without previous notice and without any form of judicial trial was justified by the tenth clause Upon the law bearing on the construction of the power given' by the clause I have nothing to add to what has now been said by his lordship the Chief Justice and by my brother Gwynne. The divisional court made an order for an account consequent upon their finding that the dismissal was wrongful. That order ought not now to stand. No case is made for it. I concur with Mr. Justice Osler's remarks on that subject. The fourth clause of the agreement, as I understand it, gives the plaintiff an interest in potential net profits. Reading the whole agreement I am inclined to the view that only the profits made in the first two years are intended. The order for an account is not so limited, but I take it that a demand for an account before the end of two years,\u2014this action being brought within the two years\u2014is premature. The only part of the plaintiff's judgment which he can plausibly expect to retain, after our decision that his dismissal was warranted by his contract, is the abstract declaration that he has an interest in the profits. But we cannot declare that interest without defining it, and I am not prepared to affirm it to the extent affirmed by the divisional court. The plaintiff has not given us the assistance of any argument in support of his contention. The learned judge who tried the action declined, for reasons that seem to me to be good reasons, to entertain the question, and confined his judgment to the charge of wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff now fails, as he failed at the trial, upon that charge which was his main ground of action, and I think our proper course is simply to restore the judgment given at the trial, which dismissed the action with costs, and to allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Walker, Scott & Lees.\nSolicitors for respondent: Carscallen & Cahill.\n[1] 17 Ont.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Suretyship\u2014Endorsement of note\u2014Right to commission for endorsing\u2014Consideration.\nM., by agreement in writing, agreed to become surety for McD. & S. by endorsing their promissory note, and McD. & S. on their part agreed to transfer certain property to M. as security, to do everything necessary to be done to realize such securities, to protect M. against any loss or expense in regard thereto or in connection with the note, to pay him a commission for endorsing, and to retire said note within six months from the date of the agreement. The note was made and endorsed and the securities transferred, but McD. & S. were unable to discount it at the bank where it was made payable, and having afterwards quarrelled with each other the note was never used. In an action by M. for his commission:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that M., having done everything on his part to be done to earn his commission, and having had no control over the note after he endorsed it, and being in no way responsible for the failure to discount it, was entitled to the commission.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of the trial judge in favor of the defendants.\nThe plaintiff and defendants entered into an agreement in writing by which the plaintiff agreed to become surety for the defendants by indorsing a promissory note, for which defendants agreed to pay $1,000. The recitals of the agreement were, that plaintiff had agreed to endorse the note upon receiving as security certain specified properties and that assignments thereof had been duly executed; and the substance of the operative part was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cNow this indenture witnesseth that in pursuance of said agreement, and in consideration of the said Alexander Manning becoming surety and endorsing the said promissory note for the said parties of the first part\u201d (the defendants), \u201cthey,\u201d the defendants, \u201cdo transfer, assign,\u201d etc.\u2014setting forth the various securities\u2014\u201cAnd the said parties of the first part (the defendants) in consideration of the said party of the second part becoming such surety, hereby covenant and agree to pay\u201d the $1,000 sued for.\nThe note was drawn as agreed, endorsed by the plaintiff and delivered to the defendants who left it in the hands of Mr. Bain, solicitor for the plaintiff, while they went to the Bank of Montreal where it was made payable and interviewed the manager, who refused to discount the note as he already held a large amount of defendants\u2019 paper. This was communicated to plaintiff and his solicitor. Subsequently the defendants, having quarrelled between themselves, respectively notified Mr. Bain not to transfer it to the other defendant. Nothing further was done for some four years, when defendants, having sold certain timber limits assigned to plaintiff as security, applied to him to re-transfer them, which he refused to do unless he was paid the $1,000, and on defendants refusing such payment the present action was brought.\nOn the trial judgment was given for the defendants on the ground that plaintiff never really became surety for the defendants. This decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, and the defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Hector Cameron Q.C. for the appellants. The sole question is whether or not the plaintiff ever became surety under the agreement. It is submitted that suretyship would not arise until the note was transferred to a third party as holder for value.\nThe mere delivery of the note is not sufficient. Chitty on Bills[1]; Bromage v. Lloyd[2].\nThe claim is not meritorious and the agreement should be construed strictly.\nAt all events the judgment of the Court of Appeal was wrong in allowing interest which was never agreed on nor demanded.\nLaidlaw Q.C. for the respondent. The plaintiff could legally stipulate for this commission. Evans on Principal and Agent[3].\nThe plaintiff did all that he was required to do to earn the commission.\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The moment plaintiff endorsed the note and it was placed in the hands of Bain with defendants\u2019 consent, as trustee for them, the rights of both parties were fixed and established, the plaintiff\u2019s liability on the note commenced and he had no further control over it, and could not prevent its being handed over to defendants or used by them, and he thereby became security for defendants to whomsoever they chose to make the holders, and when plaintiff endorsed the note, and it became subject to defendants\u2019 disposal, defendants became entitled to the note and to use it as they thought proper, and thus plaintiff had, in my opinion, fulfilled his contract and become entitled to the $1,000, which the agreement specified was to be paid on the execution of these presents not on the discount or the disposal of the note, and he cannot be deprived of this by reason of defendants quarrelling between themselves.\nIf the evidence of Mr. Bain is to be believed he held the note in trust for McDonald and Shields, and his evidence is, in my opinion, entirely confirmed by the action of both McDonald and Shields, and had they not quarrelled it is clear they could have got the note at any time; unfortunately for them neither party would allow the other to have it; McDonald wanted to use the note, but Shields objected and gave Bain an emphatic notice not to give it up to him. This, to my mind, conclusively shows that McDonald and Shields well knew that Bain was holding the note for them, and that both the parties clearly recognised the note as an outstanding security available to both but not controllable by one alone, and thus they prevented the note being discounted or used as both individuals desired, but as neither would trust the other it remained in the hands of Mr. Bain. Had they been of one mind they could have discounted the note or otherwise have used it as served their purposes, and would no doubt have done so could they have trusted one another, but with the subsequent disposal of the note after plaintiff\u2019s endorsement, and after it was placed in the hands of Mr. Bain, plaintiff had nothing whatever to do that I can discover.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I see no reason for differing from the Court of Appeal in the conclusion which it has reached, with the unanimous concurrence of all its members, that the respondent had performed the condition precedent which under the terms of the sealed agreement sued upon was to entitle him to receive the $1000 which he seeks to recover in the present action. The words of this covenant are as follows: And the said parties of the first part, in consideration of the said party becoming such surety, hereby covenant and agree to pay to the said part of the second part the sum of $1000 upon the execution of these presents being a per centage of 5 per cent. upon the said sum of $20,000.\nThe recital of the instrument is that\nWhereas the said parties of the first part have applied to the said party of the second part, to endorse their promissory note for the sum of $20,000 * * * and whereas the said party of the second part has agreed to endorse the said note upon receiving by way of security for such endorsement, &c.\nThen the operative part begins as follows:\nThat in pursuance of the said agreement and in consideration of the said Alexander Manning having become surety and endorsing the said promissory note for the said parties of the first part, they, the said parties of the first part, &c.\nThe evidence shows that the respondent endorsed the note and delivered it to the appellants who endeavored to negotiate it but failed in doing so, and that they then deposited it in the hands of Mr. Bain to keep as a depositee for them.\nIt appears to me that upon this state of facts the respondent did all that could be required of him to entitle him to the payment of the $1,000. It is to be observed that the $1,000 were to be paid immediately upon the execution of the deed of covenant while no time is fixed for the endorsement of the note, so that it may perhaps admit of some doubt whether the endorsement was a condition precedent at all, but I will assume in favor of the appellants that it was a preliminary condition requiring performance to entitle the respondent to recover his commission.\nThe note having been endorsed by the respondent, and having gone into the hands of the appellants to be used by them in such way as they might think fit, the respondent had thus become surety for the payment of the $20,000; it is true that no liability has ever actually arisen by reason of the endorsement, but it was in the power of the appellants by their own act, in which they could in no way be controlled by the respondent, to cause such liability to attach at any moment, and for all that appears to the contrary this may even yet be done since the note still remains in the appellants\u2019 hands or subject to their control. The risk for which the appellant was to be paid the $1,000 attached so soon as the note left his hands and as he had literally complied with the condition by endorsing and becoming surety there can be no reason why he should not recover his commission which he had thus earned.\nFrom the words of the recital which are that the respondent was to \u201cendorse,\u201d and from those at the beginning of the operative part of the deed which are that upon his \u201cbecoming surety and endorsing the said promissory note\u201d the security stipulated for was to be given, I think it a reasonable interpretation of the language of the covenant to construe it as meaning that the commission was to be paid in consideration of the respondent becoming \u201csuch surety.\u201d On the face of the instrument itself it is very clear that the suretyship contemplated was the endorsement of the note by the respondent and its delivery to the appellants to be dealt with by them as they might think fit without regard to its passing into the hands of a bon\u00e2 fide holder. This construction is considerably strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, and is inevitable when we find that the commission was by the covenant to be paid \u201cupon the execution of these presents\u201d without regard to any postponement until the note should be discounted or otherwise made use of.\nI am unable, therefore, to agree with Mr. Justice Falconbridge who considered that the respondent could not recover inasmuch as no liability ever attached as there never was any creditor, and that consequently, the respondent was never a surety. In my opinion an inchoate or potential liability did attach as soon as the note got into the appellants\u2019 hands, and the respondent therefore became, if not a surety according to abstract legal definition, yet just such a surety as the instrument executed by the parties contemplated.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal. I concur with my brother Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question involved in this case is simply one of fact, and the true conclusion to be deduced from the facts in evidence, in my opinion, is that the object of the defendants in applying to the plaintiff to endorse their note, and of the plaintiff in consenting to do so, was to enable the defendants to raise money for which they had immediate occasion to pay for logs which they had contracted for to carry out a purpose in which the plaintiff then had, or had had, an interest under an agreement to which he had been a party with the defendants; and that the intention of both the defendants and the plaintiff was that the note when endorsed by the plaintiff should be discounted in the office of the Bank of Montreal at Toronto, where the note was made payable, in order to raise the money for the purpose aforesaid, and that, in point of fact, the defendants after making the note and leaving it in the hands of the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor for the purpose of its being endorsed by the plaintiff never did receive it back, and so never received the consideration which in the instrument sued upon is expressed to be the sole consideration for their undertaking to pay the plaintiff the amount sought to be recovered in the present action. As soon as the defendants made the note and had left it in the hands of the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor they went immediately to Mr. Yarker, the manager of the Bank of Montreal at Toronto, to make arrangements with him for the discount of the note as soon as they should receive back the note with the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement thereon, and told him that they were getting the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement on their note, and asked him if he would not discount it for them. He refused to do so, alleging for reason that the debt of the firm of Manning, McDonald, McLaren & Co., of which the plaintiff and the defendants were members, to the bank was so heavy that he could not do it, and to the defendants\u2019 request that he should apply to the head office of the Bank of Montreal for authority to discount it, he replied that there would be no use in applying to the head office until the debt of the firm should be reduced. Thereupon the defendants went straight back and informed the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor of what Mr. Yarker had said, and of his refusal to discount the note. The defendants said that according to their recollection the papers which, in order to perfect the transaction on their part, they had to sign were signed by them before they went down direct, as they say, from the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors office to negotiate with Mr. Yarker for the discount of the note; the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor\u2019s recollection is, that it was immediately upon the defendants\u2019 return to his office with the information that Mr. Yarker had refused to discount the note that these papers were signed by the defendants. Adopting this view it is obvious that the transaction remained still incomplete at this time, and that although the defendants had subscribed their names to the instrument now sued upon they had not as yet became liable to pay the $1,000 mentioned in that instrument as payable only on consideration of the plaintiff becoming a party to the note as their surety. That liability could only arise upon their receiving back the note endorsed by the plaintiff which, in point of fact, they never did so receive. Before the transaction could be completed some of the papers signed by the defendants had to be sent to Ottawa to Mr. McLaren whose acknowledgment of the receipt of them, and his undertaking to comply with the directions contained in them, was a condition precedent to the plaintiff incurring the responsibility of becoming surety for the defendants on their note. So, likewise, the chattel mortgage signed by the defendants had to be sent to Manitoba for registration and for the purpose of seeing that there was no prior charge on the mortgaged premises. This would require some little time. Now the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor\u2019s own view of the condition in which the transaction was when the defendants came back on the same day they had signed the note, and informed him what Mr. Yarker had said upon refusing to discount the note, is that the note remained in his hands so that when everything was ready and when Mr. Yarker would be prepared to discount the note the defendants could come and get it and discount it after the account should be reduced.\nIt can only be inferred, I think, that this view was based upon the instructions he had received from his client the plaintiff, namely, not to give up the note to the defendants with the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement upon it until he should be satisfied that the papers signed by the defendants were all right, and that the defendants could get the note discounted at the Bank of Montreal. There is not a suggestion in any part of the evidence that the defendants had ever said anything constituting the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor as their agent to take charge of the note for them as their property. His statement, therefore, that he held the note until everything was ready and Mr. Yarker could be procured to discount the note tends, in my opinion, to confirm the statement of both of the defendants that it was for the purpose of being discounted at the Bank of Montreal as aforesaid that the plaintiff agreed to endorse the note.\nThe Bank of Montreal still persisting to refuse to discount the note the defendants made arrangements otherwise to raise the money they required to meet the purpose for which they say the plaintiff had agreed to endorse their note; difficulties arose between the defendants themselves, each appearing to have entertained distrust of the other. In July the defendant, McDonald, seems to have applied to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor for the note, and in so doing explained that the purpose he had in view was to obtain some power over the defendant Shields, in a manner not necessary to set out here, but which showed that his object was to use the note for a purpose different from that for which both of the defendants say the plaintiff consented to endorse the note for them. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitor refused to give the note to McDonald. He says that he did so in Shields\u2019s interest but he admitted that he had not any instructions from Shields to act on his behalf in the matter, and he added, moreover, that he had never given any notice to the defendants or to either of them that he held the note for them.\nNow, if the defendants\u2019 right to have the note returned to them with the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement upon it was not qualified by any condition to the effect that the Bank of Montreal should first consent to discount for them, surely it was but natural, after the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor had received Mr. McLaren\u2019s reply to the letter of the 28th May, and after search in the registry office in Manitoba to ascertain whether property covered by the chattel mortgage was subject to any prior incumbrance, that the defendants should have been informed that the matter was concluded so as to entitle them to receive back their note with the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement upon it, and that therefore the time had arrived which, in the meaning of the defendants\u2019 covenant, entitled the plaintiff to demand and receive the $1,000, which sum would not be payable until they should receive the note so endorsed, or at least until they should be notified that it was ready to be delivered to them; but nothing of the kind was done, no notice given to the defendants that they could receive the note endorsed by the plaintiff, and no demand made for the $1,000. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, however, informed Shields of McDonald\u2019s application for the note, and he says that Shields then gave him notice not to give up the note to McDonald, or to deal with it at all. Shields\u2019s explanation of the meaning of this notice, whatever may have been the time of its having been given as to which there was a conflict of opinion, was that he considered the whole matter at an end as they had failed to get the note discounted for the purpose for which it had been, as the defendants allege, made and endorsed.\nThere does not in this refusal to give the note to McDonald appear to me to be anything inconsistent with the fact that the note still remained in the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor\u2019s hands as still under the control of the plaintiff, as whose agent it originally came into his hands and as whose agent he must still be regarded as having held it under the instructions given by the plaintiff when he endorsed it and placed it in his hands, which instructions may be fairly inferred to have been to the effect of the view entertained by the solicitor himself as to the purpose for which he held the note, when on the 24th of May as before stated he was informed by the defendants that Mr. Yarker, the manager of the bank of Montreal, refused to discount the paper. Then again at a subsequent period, when precisely is not stated but before the note if it had been negotiated would have fallen due, the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor admits that, as he thought it probable the note would remain in his hands, he converted the endorsement of the plaintiff which was in blank upon the note into one making the note payable to himself or to his order. It is, I think, inconceivable that he could have done this in virtue of any authority supposed to have been derived from the defendants, or otherwise than as the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and the effect of this endorsement so made special, whatever may have been the intent with which it was done, was, I think, to nullify the endorsement, and to put an end to the transaction, if it had not already been determined by reason of the note with the plaintiff\u2019s endorsement upon it never having been returned into the power and possession of the defendants; and that it never was so returned, but on the contrary remained always in the possession and under the control of the plaintiff, is, in my opinion, the proper conclusion to be deduced from the evidence. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the learned judge who tried the case, in favor of the defendants, restored.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I do not see any way to interfere with this judgment, although I cannot help feeling that the defendants are made liable to pay without in reality having enjoyed what they have to pay for, and that the plaintiff is being paid for a risk which he cannot in strictness be said to have run. It seems to me that in disallowing the plaintiff\u2019s claim we should be enforcing a bargain which it would have been reasonable enough for the parties to have made, and which they perhaps would have made if they had anticipated the difficulties that they encountered when they attempted to negotiate the note, but not the bargain set out in their deed. That bargain was that upon the execution of the deed the defendants would pay $1,000 to the plaintiff, being a percentage on the amount of the note which he was to endorse, and which he did endorse.\nI think we cannot properly do otherwise than dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant McDonald: Cameron and Spencer.\nSolicitors for appellant Shields: Mulock, Miller Crowther and Montgomery.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bain, Laidlaw & Co.\n[1] 11 ed. p. 168.\n[2] 1 Ex. 32.\n[3] 2 ed. p. 397.\n"

C. when the debtor borrowing the sum of money declares in his deed of loan that it is for the purpose of paying his debts, and in the acquittance he declares that the payment has been made with the moneys furnished by the new creditor for that purpose.\nWhere subrogation is given by the terms of a deed the erroneoes noting of the deed by the registrar as a discharge, and the granting by him of erroneous certificates, cannot prejuduce the party subrogated.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court on the contestation by respondent of a report of distribution.\nIn the case of Owens et al v. Wilson the defendant\u2019s immoveable property was ordered to be sold by the sheriff and a registrar's certificate was furnished to him including inter alia the following privileges and hypo these registered which did not appear by the registrar's books to have been wholly discharged, to wit :\n1st. Obligation dated. 4th June 1884, A. Gr. Isaacson N. P. from William Wilson to Thomas and William Owens hypothecating official No. 1633, St. Ann Ward, Montreal, for the payment of $3,000.00 and interest at 7 per cent, and $50.00 for insurance. Registered 7th October. 1884\n2nd. Loan, dated 29th September, 1,885, C. Cushing, N.

Registered 5th October, 1885.\nAfter the sale the proceeds were returned to the prothonotary for distribution and the respondent filed an opposition claiming the full amount of her mortgage based on\n1st. A deed of hypothec for $3,000 and interest at 6 per cent, from William Wilson to Melvin Smith executed before Isaacson, N.P., on the 8th August, 1881, and registered on the 10th of August following, against the property in question in this cause.\n2nd. On the deed mentioned in the registrar's certificate as loan of $2,500 dated 29th September, 1885, and\n3rd. Another deed of the same date 29th September 1885, before Cushing, N. P. by which said Smith acknowledged to have received the amount of his said first hypothec from Wilson, but out of the hands of and by money furnished for that purpose by, respondent Bedell.\nThe prothonotary collected the respondent as being\" subrogated in the rights of Smith for the full amount of her claim.\nThe terms of the collocation are as follows;\u2014\n13; To opposant, Katharine Jane Bedell, as subrogated to the rights of Melvin Smith by the effect of a certain deed of loan by her the said opposant to '' to defendant, executed before C. Cushing, Notary, on '' the 29th September. 1885, and registered on the 5th '' October, 1885, the said defendant (the debtor) declaring in said deed that he borrows the sum of $2,500 for the purpose of paving, his debt to said. Melvin Smith and of an act of release and discharge from '' said Melvin Smith to defendant, executed before the same notary, on the said 29th September, 1885, in which said act of release and discharge the said Melvin Smith, the creditor, declares that the payment has been made with the moneys furnished by the said '' Katharine Jane Bedell amount in capital claimed under obligation from defendant to said Melvin '' Smith, executed before Isaacson, notary, on the 8th August, 1881, registered on the 10th August, 1881, '' $2,500, interest from 29th September, 1886, to the 3rd December 1887 $ 176.171 costs of opposition to Messrs. Morris & Holt, $18.50.\nThere remained of the monies a balance of $386033 which was collocated to the appellant Owens part payment of his second hypothec.\nAppellant drew this balance and did not contest the collocation in his favor for the $386.03 but contested that part of the collocation which awarded $2,500 and interest to respondent.\nAppellants' ground of contestation was that the subrogation, created in favor of respondent Bedell by the two deeds of the 29th September, 1885, was not express.\nRespondent replied that no express subrogation was necessary.\nBoth the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada confirmed the collocation in favor of respondent.\nButler Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for appellants;\nMorrss Q C. for respondent.\nIn addition to the points of argument and cases cited in the Court of Queen's Bench, and which are given in the report of the case in 21 Revue Legale, pages 95, 96,97, the learned, counsel for appellants cited and. relied on Pothier Coutume d'Orleans, Inrroduction au Titre XX des Arr\u00eats Executions ([2]) Domat ([3]); Rev. Statutes Que., Art 5840; Morrinv. Daly et al ([4]); Chince v.Canada Steel Go ([5]); Filmer v. Bell ([6]); and Arts. 1176 2148 and 2152 C.C.; and the learned counsel for the respondent cited and relied on Desrosiers v. Lamb ([7]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The only question submit-ted in this case is whether the respondent has been subrogated to the hypnotherapy rights of Melvin Smith to recover the amount of the obligation for which she has been collocated. The respondent claims this right of subrogation under Art. 1155 CO., sec. 2, which declares that when the debtor borrows a sum for the purpose of paying his debt, and of subrogating the lender in the rights of the creditor, it is necessary to the validity of the subrogation in such case that the act of loan and the acquitance be notarial (or be executed before two subscribing witnesses); that in the act of loan it be declared that the sum has been borrowed for the purpose of paying the debt, and that in the acquit-tance it be declared that the payment has been made with the moneys furnished by the new creditor for that purpose. This subrogation takes effect without the consent of the creditor.\nThe requirements of this article have been fully complied with. The deed of loan by the said opposant to defendant dated 29th September 1885 and the deed of release and discharge by Melvin Smith to defendant of same date respectively contained a declaration required by the second part of the art. 1155 C. C, namely, that the act of loan declared that the money had been borrowed for the purpose of paying the debt and the acquaintance declared that the payment had been made with the money furnished by the said creditor for that purpose. I can see no reason why full force and effect should not be given to that article, or why its provisions should be ignored, and therefore I am of opinion that the respondent was rightly collocated I think the declaration of Melvin Smith, that he released and discharged the land from the mortgage thereon had reference only so far as he was concerned, and I do not think the respondents rights to subrogation were in any way affected by any acts of omission or commission in reference to the registration or non registration or certificate granted by the registrar for which the respondent was in no way responsible.\nI therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J. was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. La contestation en cette cause repose sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la subrogation op\u00e9r\u00e9e en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 par les actes suivanes;\u2014\n1.

Bans la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l'honorable juge Tait l'a d\u00e9cid\u00ea de la mani\u00e8re suivante;\nThat the deed of loan by said opposant to defendant, dated twenty-ninth September, eighteen hundred and eighty-five, and the deed of release and discharge by Melvin Smith to Defendant of same date, respectively contain the declaration required by the second part of Article 1155 of the Civil Code; that from such declarations the law presumes an intention to subrogaee, and that by said deeds said opposant became and was and is subrogated in all the rights and privileges and mortgages of said Melvin Smith in and upon the property in question and in the proceeds thereof, and this without any express mention of subrogation in said deeds, which is not necessary;\nConsidering that intention to subrogaee on the part of the debtor, being clear, and that such subrogation can by law take place without the consent of the creditor the declaration of Melvnn Smith in the latter part of the deed of release and discharge to the effect that he released add discharged the said lot of land from the mortgage thereon created only meant that so far as he was concerned he granted such discharge, and such declaration ought not and cannot deprive said opposant of the subrogation created in her favor by said deeds.\nDans la Cour du Banc de la Reine o\u00f9 le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 confirmant celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, Sir A. \u00c0. Dorion juge en chef a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour dans les termes suivanss :\u2014\nThe only question submitted in this case is whether the respondent has been subrogated to the hypothecary rights of Melvnn Smith to recover the amount of the obligation for which she has been collocated.\nTo effect a subrogation in favor of a party lending money to pay a mortgage Art. 1155, C. C. s. 2 requires that it be declared in the act of loan that the money has been borrowed for the purpose of paying the debt, and that in the acqutttance it be declared that the payment has been made with the moness furnished by the new crediorr for that purpose. No formal declaration of subrogation is required, and this has been repeatedly held under .Art. 1250 of the French Code which is in the same terms as our article. These declarations are contained in the deed of loan and the discharge, and we are of opinion that the respondent was rightyy collocated.\nComme on le volt par ces deux jugemenss les conditions requises par l'article 1155 pour op\u00e9rer la subrogation suivant le paragraphe 2 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exactement remplies. L'appelant, n'a pas le droit d'en exiger d'autres; mais comme il a cite des autorit\u00e9s et des jugements pour Ctablir sa pr\u00e9tention que, pour qu'iI y alt subrogation il faut quil y ait une declaration expresse a cet effect, il ne sera pas sans utilit\u00e9 de faire voir quelle est condamn\u00e9e par les auteuss et n'est pas justifi\u00e9e par les jugemenss qu'il a cites pour la supporter.\nSi une declaration expresse \u00e9tait \u00e9cessaire liintim\u00e9e pourratt pr\u00e9tendee quelle est contenue dans l'acte d'emprunt oi se trouve la, declaration suivanee :\u2014\nThe borrower declares that the. said property belongs to him absolutely, and is tree and clear of all imcumbrances save the ground rent and commutation money, which latter the borrower binds himself to pay off within six months and the balance due to T. & W. Owens (the appellants) which ranks subsequent to the present loan.\nVoil\u00e0 une declaration bien explicite que l'hypoth\u00e8que donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant est une seconde hypoth\u00e8que et que la baaance qui lui est due prendra rang aprss l'emprunt fait pour payer Smith. Mais une telle declaration n'\u00e9tait pas exig\u00e9e par la loi. Je n'invoque pas ce moyen au soutien de mon opinion; au contraire, je partage cette des honorables juge Tait et Sir A. A. Dorion, exprim\u00e9e dans leurs jugements respectifs, qu'une telle declaration n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire et je suis d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e s'etant conform m\u00e8re aux conditions du paragraphe 2 article 1155, a droit \u00e0 la subrogation.\nCette doctrine, qui d'ailleurs est celle du code, dont l'article 1115 n'est quela reproduction de l'article 1250 du code fran\u00e7ais, est support\u00e9e par tous les commentateurs ci-apr\u00e8s cites.\nLaurent ([8]).\nFaut-il une d\u00e9claration expresse de subrogation? La negative est certaine. L'article 1250 n'exige pas de subrogation expresse, et le silence de la loi d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la question puisqu'il n'appartient, pas \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e8te d'ajouter \u00e0 la loi en exigeant une condition que le l\u00eagislateur na pas prescrite\nDemolombe ([9]).\nCes deux declarations ; de la destination de deniers dans i'acte d'emprunt, et de l'emploi dans la quittance, sont d'ailleurs, suffisantes. Le texte n'exige en outre ni dans l'un ni dans l'autre de ces actes, une declaration expresse de subrogation. L'arr\u00eat\u00e9 de 1690 voulait, il est vrai, que cetee d\u00e9claration y f\u00fbt faite, mais le l\u00e9gislateur nouveau a justement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la volont\u00e9 des parties d'op\u00e9rer la subrogation r\u00e9suite d'une mani\u00e8re suffisamment expresse de l'accomplissement m\u00eame qu'elees font des conditions requises par la ioi pour l'obtenir. Aussi, n'est-ce en effet, que pour la premier cas de subrogation conventionnelle que l'article 1250, lo. exige qua la subrogation soit expresse, et son silence pour le second cas t\u00e9moigne qu'il ne le soumet pas \u00e0 cetee condition. (Comp. Merlin E\u00e9pert, Vo. Privilege, sec. IV, \u00a7 11; Toullier, t. IV, No. 129; Duranton, t. XII, No. 133; Mourlon p. 260, 268; Zachariae, Aubry et Rau, t. IV, p. 179; Larombi\u00e8re t. III, art. 1250, No. 66.)\nAubry et Rau ([10]).\nEn dehors des deux conditions exig\u00e9ss par le No. 2, de i'article 1250, aucuee autre nest reciuise pour la validit\u00e9 et 1 elicac\u00efte de la subrogation dont il s'agit. Ainsi elle s'op\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendamment de touse declaration expresse de subrogation, soit dans Pacte d'emprunt soit dans la quittance.\nLarombi\u00e8re ([11]).\nLe second paragraphe de l'article 1250 n'est que la reproduction r\u00e9sum\u00e9e des dispositions de cet arr\u00e9t de r\u00e8glement (arrt du 6 juillet, 1690). Ili faut, dit-il, pour que cette subrogation soit valable que l'acte d'emprunt et la quittance second pass\u00e9s devant notaires, que dans l'acte d'emprunt, il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9e pour faire paiement et que dans la quittance, il soit d\u00e9cla\u00e9\u00e9 que le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait des deniers fournis \u00e0 cet effet par le nouveau cr\u00e9ancier. Comme lui, il veut que l'acee d'emprunt et la quittance soient pass\u00e9s devant notaires, comme lui, il exige la doubee mention de la destination et de l'emploi des deniers pr\u00eat\u00e9s. Mais il y a cetee diff\u00e9rence que l'arr\u00eat voulait une stimulation de subrogation tandss que larticle 1250 la fait ressorrir implicitement de la mention de destination et de lemfiloi,\nRolland de Vilaargues ([12]).\nIl n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire au resee pour que le pr\u00eateur succ\u00e8de \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8oue du cr\u00e9ancier pav\u00e9 s'il s'agtt d'une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire que l acte deruprunt stipuee formelleinent que le fr\u00e9teur sera subrog\u00e9 \u00e0 cetee hypoth\u00e8que, ainsi que le voulaient les lois Romaines.\nIi n'est pas de rigueur que dans la quittance, il soit express\u00e9ment diclar\u00e9 que le d\u00e9biteur subroge le pr\u00eateur. L'article 1250, 2e paragraphe ne l'exige point, comme il l'exige dans la premiere disposition pour la subrogation d\u00fb cr\u00e9ancier.\nPotbier et tous les autres auteuss cites par l'appelant \u00e0 l'exception de Troplong et de Tonllier, out \u00e9crit avant le Code et sons l'empire de l'arr\u00eat du 6 juillet 1690, qui voulatt une stipulation de subrogation, tandis que l'article 1250, comme notre article 1155 lefait ressortir implicitement de la mention de destination et de l'emploi. Demolombe explique trss bien qne la d\u00e9claration expresse de subrogation n'est requsee que pour le premier cas de subrogation conventionnelle men-tionee en l'article 1250, comme dans le paragraphe premier de l'article 1155, et que le silence du Code pour le second t\u00eamoigue qu'il ne le soumet pas \u00e0 cette condition. La quittance donn\u00e9e par Melvin \u00e0 Wilson comporte non seulement la declaration qu'il a recule montant de ce qui lui \\\u00e9tait d\u00fb en vertu de son obligation et de l'Hypoth\u00e8que qui en assurait le paiement, mais il d\u00e9charge en outre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'hypoth\u00e8que donn\u00e9e pour assurer son remboursement. Cet acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 due-ment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 chez le r\u00e9gistrateur qui ne Pa enregistr\u00e9 que comme une simple quittance,sans faire'l'entr\u00e9e dans ses livres ni dans son certiiicat que l'effet des deux actes qui se rapportent l'un \u00e0 l'autre \u00e9tait d'op\u00e9rer une subrogation en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e, le t\u00e9moin m\u00e9me de l'appelant, le d\u00e9put\u00e9 r\u00e9gistrateur, reconna\u00eet que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 pour enregistrement,\nLorscjue le r\u00e9gistrateur re\u00e7oit une quittance pure et simple d'une hypoth\u0141que, il se borne \u00e0 faire l'entr\u00e9e en marge de l'acte \u00e9stablissant la cr\u00e9ance d'une declaration que l'hypoth\u00e8eue est radi\u00e9e et il fait le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la quittance dans les records de son bureau. Sans faire l'examen des deux actes qui lui furend d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pour enregistrement, afin de s'assurer s'il y avait extinction complete de l'hypoth\u00eaque, il prit pour admis que l'hypoth\u00e8que devatt \u00eatre radi\u00e9e et la nota comme telle. Si an lieu de cela il eat enregistr\u00e9 cetee quittance comme c'\u00e9tait son devoir il se fat aper\u00e7u de suite que Smith reconnaissait avoir re\u00e7u son paiement avcc des deniers fournss par l'intim\u00e9e qui, par l\u00e0, se trouvatt subrog\u00e9e \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8eue de Smith en vertu de cette declaration et de celle contenue dans l'acte d'obligation.\nL'intim\u00e9e peut-elle \u00eatre tenue responsabee de l'erreur commise par le r\u00e9gistrateur? Elle s'est conform\u00e9e en tous points \u00e0 ce qu'elle devatt faire pour obtenir la subrogation; elle a accompli les formalit\u00e9s du paragra-graphe 2 de l'article 1155, et r\u00e9guli\u00e8remtnt d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses actes an bureau d'enregistrement. C'est l\u00e0 tout ce qu'elle devatt faire pour acqu\u00e9rir la subrogation. L'erreur du r\u00e9gistrateur ne peut lui en enlever le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, ainsi qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, dans les m\u00eames circonstances dans la cause de Desrp- siers V Lamb ([13]).\nAs to the error in the registration this cannot be invoked against, Lamb. He is not responsible for the registrar's mistake. It may be noticed that Desrosiers was not prejudiced at all by the wrong entry in the registrar's boos and the registrar's erroneous certificate: His hypothec was taken as a second one to rank after that of Madame Amos. However even had he been prejudcced he could not deprive Lamb of his rights under the deed giving subrogation.\nLes faits de cette cause sont tout \u00e0 fait analogues \u00e0 ceux de la pr\u00e9sente et les raisonnements qui ont fait obtenir gain de cause \u00e0 Lamb doivntt faire triompher l'intim\u00e9e Dans ce cas comme dans celui de Lamb l'appelant n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 nullement pr\u00e9judici\u00e9 par l'entr\u00e9e erron\u00e9e du r\u00e9gistrateur; son hypoth\u00e8que ne devatt prendre rang qu'apr\u00e8s celle de Smith. Les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents invoqu\u00e9s par l'appelant ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 la questonn sous consid\u00e9ration. Dans la cauee de Morrin v. Daly ([14]) il s'agissait de la cession d'une moiti\u00e9 de cr\u00e9anee enregistr\u00e9e, par Joseph \u00e0 Derousselle, qui en avait accep\u00e9\u00e9 le transport, mais a'av\u00eat pas fait enregistr\u00e9 son transport. Plus tard, Joseph en recevant son paiement dela moiti\u00e9 Qui lui tait due donna une discharge compl\u00e8te de hypoth\u00e9que. Il avait ce pouvoir parce que le transport n'\u00e9tant pas enregistr\u00e9, il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 ouvertement le seul cr\u00e9ancier de l'hypoth\u00e8que et pouvait valablement en donner la decharge. Dans l'autre cause Ghiitic v. Canada Steel Co. ([15]) il s'agissait d'une subrogation r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en vertu de l'article 1156. Cette subrogation ne pent avoir lieu \u00e0 moins que celui qui la r\u00e9clame ne prouve avoir pay\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 laquelle il demande \u00e0 \u00eatre subrog\u00e9. Dans cc cas, la subrogation \u00e9tait r\u00e9clamee par le Canada Steel Co. qui all\u00e9geait avoir pay\u00e9 les montants pour lesquels elle s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9e opposante. Le consid\u00e9rant du jugement est que la dite opposante n'avait pas prouv\u00e9 les all\u00e9gu\u00e9es essentiels de son opposition, et nomm\u00e9ment le; paiement par elle des sommes de deniers qu'elle r\u00e9clame dans et par sa dite opposition. L'honorable juge Meredith. dit \u00e0 ce sujet :\u2014\nAs to the larger of the two sums claimed by the Steel Company, viz :\u2014 $2,016.64, it is impossible to doubt the correctness of the judgment so rendered; for that sum appears, by the discharge of the creditor, to have been paid by the honourable Eugene Clinic, and not by the Canada Steel Company who allege they paid it and claim the subrogation.\nL'autre somme de $483366 dit l'honorable juge n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 payee par la compagnie, ni par ses agents, ni par d'autres personnes dont les droits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s \u00e0 la compagnie; dans ce cas la compagnie ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme subrog\u00e9e en vertu de l'ar\u00eaicle 1156 quant \u00e0 la somme de $483366 comme elle le pretend; et c'est principalement sur ces motifs que l'honorable juge Dorion s'est apur\u00e9e pour maintenir la contestation de ]Madame Lloyd.\nDaus cetee derni\u00e8re cause le jugement decide seulement que l'opposanee Canada Steel Company n'ayant pas prouv\u00e9e qu'elle avait pay\u00e9 les deniers, elle ne pouvait obtenir la subrogation qu'elle r\u00e9clamait en vertu de l'article 1156\nLe jugement n'a nullement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la subrogtion n'avait pas en lieu paree que l'hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait d\u00e9charg\u00e9e dans le bureau d'enregistrement. Dans le holding du jug'ement on Voit seulement que le rapporteur soul\u00e8ve un doute sur la question de savoir si la subrogation tacite peut avoir lieu en vertu d'un acte qui comporte la d\u00e9charge des privil\u00e8ges an sujet desquess la subrogation est demande, cetee hypoth\u00e8que apparassant d\u00e9charg\u00e9e par le bureau d'enregistrement. Ce doute ainsisoulev\u00ea n'est nullement r\u00easolu et aucune partie du jugement de l'honorable juge Meredith ne tranche cette question. Tout an contraire il dit que la cour \u00e9tait unanime \u00e0 confirmer le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee pour les raisons donnees par l'honorable juge de, cetee cour, savoir que les argenss n'avaeent pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par, on pour, la partie qui r\u00e9clamait la subrogation, et il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la cour de se prononcer sur la question de l'effet de la d\u00e9charge de l'hypoth\u00e8que de la Couronne. Les observations de l'honorable juge sur ce sujet ne sont qu'un obitsT dictuTU contre! lequel la Cour du Bane de la. Reine s'est depuss prononc\u00e9 deux fois dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et dans celle de Desrosier v. Lautb ([16]).\nLa question dans le cas actuel n'est nullement affec\u00e9e par les decisions cit\u00e9es. En consequenee le principe soutenu par les deux cours que l'intim\u00e9e ne peut pas \u00eatre tenue responsabee de l'erreur du r\u00e9oristrateur doit btre maintenu Comme on l'a vu dius haut il suffit pour que la subrogation ait lieu que les deux conditions du m\u00e9me paragraphe de l'article 1155 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplies, 10 que dans i'acee d'emprunt il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 emprunt\u00e9e pour payer la dette; 20 que dans la quittance il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qre le paiement est fait des deniers fournis \u00e0 cet effet par le nouveau cr\u00e9ancier, et elle a lieu de plein droit et sans le consentement du cr\u00e9ancier. Elles s'op\u00e8rent ind\u00e9pendamment de toute declaration expresse de subrogation soit dans l'acte d.emprunt, soit dans la quittance comme le disent Aubry et Rau, et sans declaration que le porteur sera subrog\u00e9 \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8que payee de ses deniers. Elle ressort, comme le dit Larombi\u00e8re, implicitement de l'article 1250 (1155 c. c.) de la mention de destination et de l'emploi.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nMarine insurance\u2014Application\u2014Promissory representation.\nAn application for insurance on a vessel in a foreign port, in answer to the questions: Where is the vessel? When to sail? contained the following: Was at \"Buenos Ayres or near port 3rd February bound up river; would tow up and back.\" The vessel was damaged in coming down the river not in tow. On the trial of an action on the policy it was admitted that towing up and down the river was a matter material to the risk.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the words \"would tow up and back\" in the application did not express a mere expectation or belief on the part of the assured but amounted to a promissory representation that the vessel would be towed up and down, and this representation not having been carried out the policy was void.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment for the defendants at the trial.\nThe action was on a policy of marine insurance. In the printed form of application for the policy there were two questions as follows:\u2014\n\"Where is the vessel?\"\n\"When to sail?\"\nAnd opposite these the applicant wrote: \"Was at Buenos Ayres or near port 3rd February, bound up river; would tow up and back.\" The damage to the vessel for which the action was brought occurred when she was coming down the river not in tow.\nThe policy insured the vessel for a year.\nThe only question decided in the court below, and the sole issue raised in the appellants' factum, is whether the above statement in the application was a promissory representation by the assured failure to carry out which would forfeit the policy, or was merely intended to afford information to the company of the movements of the vessel at the time. The judgment at the trial, which was affirmed by the full court, was for the defendants and was founded on the ground that the statement was a promissory representation. The plaintiffs appealed.\nHenry Q.C. for the appellants. The words \"would tow up and back\" do not amount to a promissory representation. Arnould on Marine Insurance[2]. If they do the policy is not void. Brine v. Featherstone[3].\nW. B. Ritchie for the respondents cited Harrower v. Hutchinson[4]; Ex parte Dawes. In re Moon[5]; Cleveland v. Fettyplace[6].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In the application for insurance for appellant is asked \"where is the vessel?\" and the answer was \"at Buenos Ayres or near port;\" and to the question \"when to sail?\" the answer was \"3rd February, bound up the river, would tow up and back.\" It is admitted that towing between Buenos Ayres and Corrientes, 750 miles up the river where the ship was to load, is a matter material to the risk of a voyage between these ports, and would materially decrease the perils to which a vessel would be exposed on such a voyage. If such is the case it is very clear that, in view of that voyage at any rate, the amount of premium would be materially affected, for it is clear this towing decreased the risk for that portion of the year during which this voyage up and down the river lasted, though the defendants would, no doubt, be liable for any voyage after the one contemplated in the application during the year.\nThe ship did tow up but did not tow down the river. The damage now sought to be recovered for was sustained by the ship on her voyage down when not in tow. I am of opinion the representation was not a mere matter of expectation or belief, but a representation or affirmation of a positive fact that the ship would tow up and down, and I think all the surrounding circumstances show that the assured intended that assurers should so understand it.\nThe plaintiffs at the time of this application, in a letter to their brokers 21st March, 1885, say the \"vessel was at Punta Lava near Buenos Ayres February 3rd, and was to leave the following day up the river to load and was to tow up and down.\" [His Lordship here referred to the evidence showing that the insured knew when the application was made that by the charter party the vessel was to tow up and down the river.]\nI think we must take these words in their plain and obvious meaning, in that sense in which it is most reasonable to conclude they were understood by the underwriter.\nIt was a positive representation of an existing or future fact material to the risk; there was no representation of belief or expectation, but a positive engagement that she should or would be towed up and down the river. It would have been very easy in this case for the assured to have said it is expected she will be towed up and down, but this would not have answered his purpose. He had positive evidence that she was intended to be towed up and down, and, therefore, naturally wished to influence the underwriter by the positive statement that she would be. I think the nice distinction which has been attempted to be drawn between \"would\" and \"will,\" is too fine for the practical purposes of life in this connection. Suppose the assured had warranted in time of war that the ship would sail with convoy, would her not doing so be a breach of such a warranty? I can really see no distinction between a promissory representation and a warranty.\nI think this was not matter of expectation but the promissory representation of a material fact; therefore I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For the reasons given by the court below I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is a clear case for dismissal. I would call it a frivolous appeal and it should have been disposed of without calling on the respondents.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appeal in this case must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs. It is admitted that whether the vessel proposed to be insured should or should not have been towed up the river La Plata and back was material to the risk. It is apparent from the letter written by the plaintiffs to their agent directing him to effect an insurance for them that they intended that their agent should, in order to effect the insurance, make the representation on their behalf that the vessel was to be towed up and down. In view of what might naturally have been supposed to have been the state of things at the time when the policy was effected, the statement of the plaintiffs' agent to the defendants appears to me to read plainly enough that the vessel was to have left Buenos Ayres on the 3rd of February on a voyage up the river in tow up and back, and it was upon this representation that the defendants were asked to enter into the policy which was effected. The language so used is capable of being construed, and reasonably so, as a positive representation of the plaintiffs made for the purpose of effecting the insurance through their agents; and the insurance company had reasonably a right so to understand the language, and as that representation was not fulfilled the policy is avoided.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal ought to be dismissed. The verbal criticism of the phrase \"would tow up and back,\" in the application for the insurance seems to me to be beside the question, having regard to the fact that the statement related to something that had happened or was understood to have happened six weeks or more before the date of the application. It is argued by counsel for the appellants that a material difference would have been made by using the words, \"will tow up, &c.,\" or \"is to tow up, &c.,\" or \"towing up and down.\" The first two of these forms of expression would have been inappropriate to the circumstances, and the third has, as I apprehend, its precise equivalent in the expression actually used.\nThe statement, expanded without altering its effect, may, I think, be put in this shape: \"The vessel was, on the 5th of February, about to proceed up the river Parana, but with the precaution against the dangers of the river navigation of being towed up and down\"; or in this form: \"The vessel was about to be towed up and down the river\"; or to bring in one of the forms of the phrase suggested by counsel: \"The vessel was to sail up the river, towing up and back.\"\nThe representation naturally conveyed to the underwriter was that the vessel, though a sailing ship, would have or was to have for the trip up and down the river the security of being towed, and that representation was clearly a material one.\nIts materiality can scarcely be more satisfactorily shown than by the letter of the 21st of March from the plaintiffs to their agent asking for rates for the insurance, in which they make a point of the towing. \"This vessel was at Punta Lava near Buenos Ayres, February 3rd, and was to leave the following day up the river to load; was to tow up and down.\"\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: B.

The City of Portland\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Statutory powers\u2014Control over streets\u2014Alteration of grade\u2014Negligence\u2014Contributory negligence\u201434 V. c. 11 (N.B.)\u201445 V. c. 61 (N.B.)\nThe act of incorporation of the town of Portland, 34 Y. c. 11 (N.B.), which remained in force when the town was incorporated as a city by 45 V. c. 61 (N.B.), empowered the corporation to open, lay out, regulate, repair, amend and clean the roads, streets, etc.\nHeld, that the corporation had authority, under this act, to alter the level of a street if the public convenience required it.\nW. was owner and occupant of a house in Portland situate several feet back from the street with steps in front. The corporation caused the street in front of the house to be cut down, in doing which the steps were removed and the house left some six feet above the road. To get down to the street W. placed two small planks from a platform in front of the house and his wife in going down these planks in the necessary course of her daily avocations slipped and fell receiving severe injuries. She had used the planks before and knew that it was dangerous to walk up or down them. In an action against the city in consequence of the injuries so received:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the corporation having authority to do the work, and it not being shown that it was negligently or improperly done, the city was not liable.\nHeld also, that the wife of W. was guilty of contributory negligence in using the planks as she did knowing that such use was dangerous.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside a verdict for the plaintiffs and ordering a non-suit.\nThe action was brought against the city of Portland for injuries to the plaintiff Alice S. Williams incurred under the following circumstances. Plaintiffs' house had a platform in front and steps leading down to the street. The city authories altered the grade of the street in front of this house, and in doing so removed the steps leaving a perpendicular fall of some six feet from the platform to the street as altered. These steps were the usual means of ingress to and egress from the house, and after they were removed the plaintiff Edward Williams placed two deals about ten feet long where the steps had been. The plaintiff Alice S. Williams in going down these deals to cross the street and feed her hens on the other side sustained the injuries for which the action was brought.\nOn the trial the plaintiffs obtained a verdict for $625 damages. On motion to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick this verdict was set aside and a non-suit ordered, the court being of opinion that the cutting down of the street being for the convenience of the public defendants were not liable, and, also, that there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs. From this judgment of non-suit the plaintiffs appealed.\nPugsley, Sol. Gen. for New Brunswick, for the appellants. Under its charter the city of Portland had power to open, lay out, regulate, repair, amend and clean the streets. This gives no authority to alter the grade. Nutter v. Accrington Board of Health[1].\nIf the defendants could cut down the street they were guilty of negligence in encroaching upon plaintiffs' property and removing the steps.\nThe plaintiffs having been deprived of their means of access to the street adopted a reasonable mode of securing it, and cannot be prevented from recovering from the fact of the plaintiff Alice S. Williams having used it. See Clayards v. Dethick[2].\nCurrie for the respondents referred to Boulton v. Crowther[3]; Smith v. Corporation of Washington[4]; as to the power to alter the grade; and on the question of liability for negligence to Adams v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co.[5]; Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[6].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the town of Portland, under the authority given to it by 34 Vic. cap. 11 s. 83 to open, lay out, regulate, repair, mend and clean the roads, bye roads, highways, streets, sidewalks, had full power to alter if need be the levels of the streets. This principle we recognized and acted on in this court in Pattison v. The Mayor of St. John[7]. There is no evidence that defendant went beyond the line of the street; there is evidence that the cutting was all within the line of the street. There was no evidence whatever that the work was done negligently or improperly; though the jury found such to be the case there was no evidence whatever to establish this. There was clear evidence of contributory negligence. I think the injury the plaintiff sustained was brought about entirely by the manner in which the planks were placed and which plaintiff admits it was dangerous to go up and down. It is abundantly clear that it was because the planks were so placed that it was not reasonably safe for plaintiff's wife to pass over them in the manner she did that caused the accident.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For the reasons given by the court below I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. FOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I think that the judgment ordering a non-suit was right. I have come to this conclusion upon the ground that it is clear, by the evidence adduced at the trial, that the accident to the plaintiff Alice S. Williams was entirely due to her want of proper care and caution in the use of the planks to get from the house to the street, placed there by her husband in such a position that it was dangerous to pass over them. I would dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The declaration filed by the plaintiffs in this action proceeds wholly upon the allegation that the defendants wrongfully cut down a certain street or highway in the city of Portland in the Province of New Brunswick in front of dwelling house of the plaintiff, Edward Williams, so as to make the said street and highway considerably lower than it had previously been, and also wrongfully, illegally and improperly removed certain steps which the plaintiff, Edward, used for affording access from his dwelling house to the street, so as to make it dangerous getting from the said dwelling house and premises to and upon the said street and highway, and that the defendants frequently promised to replace the said steps, so as to continue them down to the said street so lowered, but did not do so.\nUpon this foundation is erected the superstructure which constitutes the gist of the action, namely:\nThat the said Edward Williams, relying upon the said promise, in order to get access to said street and as a temporary means of getting such access was obliged to and did, prudently, carefully, and in a reasonable manner, place boards leading in a slanting direction from the said premises to the said highway as a temporary means of getting from said dwelling house upon said highway until the said defendants should place said steps there as they had agreed and were lawfully bound to do, the said plaintiff, Edward Williams, using all proper and reasonable care in that behalf, and the said Alice S. Williams, then being the wife of the said Edward Williams, while seeking to pass from said dwelling house to said street by the way which she had theretofore been accustomed to, and had a right to go, was stepping down the said boards when, without any fault of her own, she slipped and fell, and was very severely bruised, wounded, maimed and injured, and became and was sick and disabled for a long time and suffered great pain of body and mind.\nAnd the plaintiffs claimed for the said injury to the said Alice 8. Williams the sum of $2,000, and the said Edward Williams for the loss of the comfort of the services of his said wife and for expenses of nursing her and for medical attendance claimed the further sum of $500.\nTo this declaration the defendants pleaded in their second plea that they did the several acts complained of under, and by virtue of, the authority in them vested by the act of the general assembly of the province of New Brunswick, 34 Vic. ch. 11, passed to incorporate the town of Portland, and acts in amendment thereof, and without any negligence or improper conduct on the part of the defendants, and not otherwise. And as to the removal of the steps leading from the plaintiffs' dwelling house to the said street the defendants in a fifth plea pleaded, that such steps were upon, and wrongfully encumbering, said highway or street, and the defendants as they lawfully might took away and removed such steps from off said highway or street. The defendants in other pleas denied that they had ever promised to replace said steps and continue the same down to the street as lowered, but the whole case is involved in the sufficiency of the defence as pleaded in their second plea that what the defendants' did in lowering the street as set out in the plaintiffs' declaration was authorized by the acts of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick in that plea mentioned and under which the defendants justified.\nA protracted inquiry into much irrelevant matter seems to have taken place at the trial, for in view of the fact that the whole foundation of the action as laid in the declaration was the allegation that the act of the defendants in lowering the street, as they undoubtedly did, was illegal and so wrongful to the plaintiffs, the whole question was reduced to one of law, namely, whether the acts under and in virtue of which the defendants justified authorized them so to lower the grade of the street. As to the removal of the steps in the declaration mentioned as formerly leading from the plaintiffs' dwelling house to the street the evidence showed what was done to have been an act incidental to, and necessarily consequential upon, the lowering of the street as lowered. These steps rested upon the street or highway, and the lower ones consisted merely of rough boards laid across a channel in the highway used for drainage purposes, and after the lowering of the street or highway the plaintiffs' dwelling house was left standing several feet nearly perpendicularly above the line of the street or highway as lowered, and so the access from the dwelling house to the street which had before existed was undoubtedly cut off as a consequence necessarily resulting from such lowering of the street. There was no evidence offered at the trial for the purpose of shewing, that, nor indeed did the declaration contain any complaint that, the defendants in lowering the street had crossed the limit of the street, and had entered upon and had cut down any part of the plaintiffs' land; they were granted leave at the trial to amend their declaration by inserting a count to that effect, if they desired to do so, but they declined availing themselves of the privilege thus granted to them. If such a case had been made it would have been necessary to inquire whether such a trespass on land of the plaintiff, Edward Williams, would have rendered the defendants liable for the injury sustained by the wife of Edward Williams occasioned by her using the mode of descent provided by the husband for procuring access from his dwelling house to the street, which, if it was legally lowered, the plaintiffs have not shewn any right so to encumber. Several questions were submitted to the jury by the learned judge who tried the case, all of which the jury answered unfavorably to the defendants. It is, however, unimportant now to consider these questions, or to inquire whether the answers to them are supported by the evidence, for it was agreed at the trial that the verdict should be taken in accordance with the answers of the jury to the questions submitted to them, subject to the opinion of the court whether a non-suit should not be entered upon points taken and moved at the trial and reserved for the consideration of the court. A non-suit has been ordered to be entered by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick pursuant to the leave so reserved, and from that judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe only points of non-suit so taken which are at all necessary to be considered are that the defendants are not liable to the plaintiffs by reason of their having lowered the grade of the street, that having been a lawful act done by them in the service of their jurisdiction as a municipal corporation, and done for the benefit and convenience of the public; and that there was no evidence of any negligence committed by the defendants in the lowering of the street, or of any duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs a breach of which had been committed, so as to entitle the plaintiffs to recover in the action. By the Provincial statute, 34 Vic. ch. 11, the town of Portland was incorporated and by the fourth section of the act it was enacted that the fiscal, prudential and municipal affairs, \"and the whole local government of the town\" should be vested in a town council consisting of a chairman and twelve other persons to be elected annually by the ratepayers as in the act directed, \"and in no other power or authority whatever.\" By the 57th section it was enacted that such town council should have the sole power and authority to make by-laws for the good rule and government of the town, and for the better carrying out of the provisions of the act, and from time to time to revise, repeal, alter or amend any by-laws, ordinances, rules or regulations whatsoever by them made under the authority of the act, and by the 83rd section it was enacted that the town council should have the sole and exclusive management and control of all roads, bye roads, highways, streets, sidewalks, wharves, docks, slips, ways, lanes and alleys within the said town, and power to open, lay out, regulate, repair, amend and clean the same, and to put and build drains, culverts and bridges therein, and should control the expenditure of all legislative grants for bye roads within the said town, and of all moneys assessed and collected or expended from the general revenues of the said town, for and on account of the making, repairing and improvement of any such roads, bye roads, highways, streets, sidewalks, wharves, docks, slips, ways, lanes and alleys.\nBy the 84th section the town council was invested with all the powers as to the expenditure and commutation of statute labor which were vested in the General Sessions of the Peace, and in the Commissioners and Surveyors of roads, under the Provincial statute, 25 Vic. ch. 16, to be exercised in such manner and through such officers, agents and persons, as the town council should prescribe. By this act, 25 Vic. ch. 16, the commissioners of roads were empowered to expend the statute labor and the monies arising from the commutation thereof in making or \"improving the roads and bridges in the best manner,\" the places where and the manner in which such improvements should be made being left to the discretion of the commissioners.\nBy 45 Vic. ch. 61 the town of Portland was erected into a city, and it was thereby enacted that the act of incorporation of the town of Portland, 34 Vic. ch. 11, should apply to the city of Portland, and that the words \"Town of Portland,\" \"Town,\" \"Town Council,\" \"Chairman,\" whenever occuring in said act of incorporation, 34 Vic. ch. 11, should thenceforth be read as \"City of Portland,\" \"City,\" \"City Council,\" \"Mayor.\"\nThese are the acts under which the defendants have justified the lowering the street, the legality of which the plaintiffs dispute. There can be no doubt, in my opinion, that the statutes under which the defendants have justified do authorize the defendants to lower the grade of the streets wherever necessary within the limits of the city in such manner and to such extent as shall appear to the town council to be the best manner for serving the interests of the municipality and the convenience of the public. The powers vested in the local municipal corporations throughout the Dominion are vested in them as part of the system of local self-government authorized by sec. 92, item 8, of the British North' America Act, whereby the local legislatures are exclusively empowered to make laws in relation to municipal institutions in the province, the policy being to place all matters of a purely local nature, which the regulating the grade of the streets in a municipality eminently is, under the absolute management and control of the municipal corporation, as a power essentially necessary to the interest of the public, and the good rule and government and prosperity of the municipality. If deprived of this power the municipalities throughout the Dominion would be stripped of a power which seems to be essentially necessary to the success of these institutions as local self-governing bodies. It is well established that if the lowering of the street in question was an act which was authorized no action lies at the suit of the proprietor of adjacent lands for any injury thereby occasioned to his property, unless it be for injury arising from negligence in the manner in which the work was executed, nor can he claim any compensation for such injury unless under a special legislative provision to that effect, and in the manner directed in such legislative provision if any special mode be directed, if not then by action. The present action, however, is not brought for any injury alleged to have been done to the property of the plaintiff, Edward Williams, abutting on the street which has been lowered in front of his dwelling house. The action and the claim made iu it are of a totally different nature, namely, that the total absence as is alleged of any right in the defendant corporation to lower the street, and by so doing to cut off the access which he had had from his dwelling house to the street as it was before being lowered, entitled the plaintiff, Edward. Williams, to provide himself with access from his dwelling house to the street as lowered, and that the defendants, by reason of their act being unauthorized, are responsible for the injury sustained by the wife of Edward Williams in using the mode of access provided by him. If the act of the defendants was a lawful act, if they were authorized to lower the street so as to deprive the plaintiff Edward Williams and his family of access to the street as lowered, there is no foundation laid for the action which has been brought and no action does lie at the suit of the plaintiffs, or of either of them; and it is unnecessary to inquire whether any action would lie under the circumstances appearing in evidence, as to the immediate cause of the injury complained of having been the defect in the mode of access constructed by the plaintiff Edward Williams himself, even if the defendants had not had, as is alleged, any authority to lower the street. The case of Nutter v. Accrington Local Board of Health[8] and certain questions put to counsel by Bramwell and Brett L.JJ. in the course of the argument were relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants in support of their contention, but that case carefully examined and thoroughly understood seems rather to support the contention of the respondents, namely, that they had authority to lower the street in question here.\nThe action was to enforce an award made in favor of the plaintiff, giving to her compensation for injury done to her property by reason of the grade of a highway near her house having been raised, and the question was whether she was entitled to compensation under the Public Health Act of 1848, 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, for such alteration made in the road upon which her house abutted.\nBy section 2 of the act it was enacted that the word \"street\" in the act should apply to and include any highway (not being a turnpike road) any road, public bridge (not being a county bridge), lane, footway, square, canal, alley or passage within the limits of any district.\nBy section 68 it was enacted that all present and future \"streets\" being, or which at any time should become, highways within any district of a local board should vest in and be under the management and control of the local board of health, and that the said local board should cause all such streets to be levelled, paved, flagged, channelled, altered and repaired as occasion might require.\nSection 144 provided for compensation being granted to all persons sustaining any damage by reason of the exercise of any of the powers of the act. In the town of Accrington there was a road called the Whalley road in respect of which a turnpike road had been established by 29 Geo. 3, ch. 107; part of this road was within the district of the Accrington local board, and it was on such part that the plaintiffs' property was situate. In 1858 the Local Government Act, 21 & 22 Vic. ch. 98, was passed (in amendment of the Public Health Act 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63,) by the 41st section of which act it was enacted that it should be lawful for any local board by agreement with the trustees of any turnpike road, or with any corporation or person liable to repair any street or road, or any part thereof, to take upon themselves the maintenance, repair, cleansing, or watering of any such street or road, or any part thereof, on such terms as the local board and the trustees, or corporation, or person, or surveyor aforesaid might agree upon between themselves. Prior to 1871 an agreement was entered into between the Accrington local board and the trustees of the turnpike road, whereby amongst other things the trustees undertook to raise the carriage way at a part of the road immediately opposite the house and land of the plaintiff, and the local board on their part undertook to raise the footpath along the plaintiff's land to a corresponding height. It was for this work that the plaintiff claimed compensation, and had procured an award in her favor to enforce which the action was brought.\nThe contention of the defendants was that the road in question being a turnpike road was, by the second section of 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, excepted from their jurisdiction, and that the work done was not done under the authority of that act, but under the agreement entered into with the trustees under 21 & 22 Vic. ch. 98, and that therefore the compensation clause of 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63 did not apply, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to compensation. The Court of Queen's Bench concurring in this contention gave judgment for the defendants from which the plaintiff appealed. Upon the appeal counsel for the plaintiff contended:\n1st. That the road was a \"street\" within 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, and under the control and management of the local board, notwithstanding that the piece of road in question was part of the turnpike road; and\n2nd. That even if not a \"street\" within the above statute the local board had power under 21 & 22 Vic. ch. 98, s. 41, by agreement with the turnpike trustees, to take upon themselves the maintenance, repair, cleaning and watering of it.\nIt was with reference to this contention that Bramwell L.J. put the question to counsel: \"What power had the trustees to raise the road?\" And that Brett L. J. said: \"Maintenance must mean keeping it up as it is; could they level a hilly road?\" to which questions counsel immediately gave answer:\u2014\nBy 9 Geo. 4 ch. 77, sec. 9, the trustees of any turnpike road are empowered to make, divert, shorten, vary, alter and improve the course or path of any of the several and respective roads under their care and management.\nAnd he argued that under this clause the trustees of the turnpike road had power to make the alteration complained of, and although they could do so without paying compensation, still they could authorize the local board to make the alteration under sec. 41 of 21 & 22 Vic. ch. 98, and that sec. 4 of that act made the provisions of the Public Health Act of 1848 apply and so that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under sec. 144 of 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63.\nThis 4th sec. of 21 & 22 Vic. ch. 98, as thus applied and relied upon, enacts that:\nThis act shall be construed together with, and deemed to form part of, the Public Health Act of 1848; words used in this act shall be interpreted in the sense assigned to them in said Public Health Act; and the provisions of each of the said acts shall, so far as may be consistent with the provisions of this act, be respectively applicable to all matters and things arising under the other act.\nThe argument for counsel for the defendants was that the turnpike road was not a \"street\" within 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, and so was not by that act placed under the control and management of the local board, and that section 144 did not apply\u2014that what the local board had done was by authority of the trustees who could have done it themselves without rendering compensation, and that the local board could justify under the trustees of the turnpike road and so were not liable to render compensation to the plaintiff. The majority of the Court of Appeal, consisting of Lord Justices Cotton and Brett, were of opinion that the road in question was a \"street\" within 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, and was therefore under the control of the local board, notwithstanding that it was also a turnpike road, and that therefore the plaintiff was entitled to compensation under section 144 of 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63. Bramwell L.J. dissented and was of opinion that a turnpike road was not a \"street,\" or under the control of the local board within 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, and that therefore the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division should be affirmed. In the observations made by him in his judgment, however, he gives a most complete answer to the above questions put by himself and Brett L.J. to counsel for the plaintiff during the argument. He there says:\u2014\nIf the acts were done, as indeed they were, and the alteration was made under the powers of the turnpike trustees, I cannot see that any action would be maintainable against the turnpike trustees or those who acted in their behalf. The trustees are empowered under their act of parliament to raise and alter the levels of the road, and it has been held in a case in the reports of Barnwell and Cresswell. Boulton is Crowther, 2 B. & C. 703, that no action lies against the trustees of a turnpike road for acts done bon\u00e2 fide and within their jurisdiction.\nBut, he adds:\u2014\nI am inclined to look upon it as a principle that no action ought to be maintainable. * * * * * Supposing that the owner of property adjoining a highway is not the owner of the soil in the highway, I do not think he has any right by the law of the land to have the road continued at a particular level. It may be a great inconvenience to him, no doubt to have the road altered, if he has built with reference to the level of the road, but it may be an inconvenience to the public not to have the level altered, and I do not know that he has any vested right in the road remaining at that level to the inconvenience of all mankind. If this view is right then there is no ground for saying that the defendants are continuing and maintaining a wrong which they have committed. If the act was rightly done by the turnpike trustees the defendants are justified in maintaining it.\nNow the right which Lord Justice Bramwell in these observations says the trustees had \"to raise and alter the levels of the road,\" was contained in the statute 9 Geo. 4 ch. 77, sec. 9, cited by counsel for the plaintiff in answer to the question put to him by the Lord Justices, in which statute the power granted is stated to be \"to make, divert, shorten, vary, alter and improve\" the course of the road under the \"care and management of the trustees.\" We have then the opinion of Lord Justice Bramwell himself in answer to the questions put by himself and Lord Justice Brett that those words were sufficient to confer authority upon the trustees of the turnpike road to cut down hills, to raise hollows, and to raise or lower the level of the road under their care, but whether these words would or would not be sufficient to authorize the local board of health, or turnpike trustees, in England to alter the levels of roads under their care, we cannot, in my opinion, permit a doubt to be entertained that the nature and contstitution of local municipalities in this Dominion is such that when, as in the statute incorporating the defendants, and in like statutes, the highways in the municipalties are placed under the sole and exclusive management and control of the councils of the municipalities with power to regulate repair, amend and improve the same the municipal corporations have most ample power to cut down hills, to raise hollows and from time to time to alter the levels of all such highways in such manner as shall seem to them to serve best the interests and convenience of the public. The case is, in fact, concluded by Pattison v. The Mayor of St. John[9] in this court. There can then be no doubt that the corporation of the City of Portland had ample power to lower the level of the street in question, and as the allegation that they had no such power is made the sole foundation of the action as laid in the declaration in this cause the nonsuit was rightly ordered, and it is unnecessary to refer to the other matters discussed at the trial. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This action is brought by husband and wife to recover damages for injuries received by the wife. The act of the defendants which is complained of is the lowering of the street in front of the house and premises of the husband, but he does not base his claim upon any asserted injury to or depreciation of his property. He asserts that the defendants cut down the street and removed some steps by which he used to descend from his house to the street at its former level, and promised to replace them but did not fulfil that promise, and he says that, relying on that promise, he was obliged, in order to get access to the street, and did prudently, carefully and in a reasonable manner, place boards leading in a slanting direction from his premises to the highway as a temporary means of getting from his house to the highway until the defendants should replace the steps as they had agreed and were lawfully bound to do; and it is then averred that the wife slipped when going down the boards and was hurt. There is no allegation that the lowering of the street was unlawful or improper. The removal of the steps is charged to have been wrongful, illegal and improper, but no right to have the steps there is shewn. They are not even alleged to have been on the plaintiffs' property. The allegation is that\u2014\nThere were and had been for a long time wooden steps leading from the said dwelling house and premises to the said street and highway;\nevidently meaning that the steps led from the higher elevation down to the then level of the street,\nwhich steps were then, and had been for a long time prior to the grievances hereinafter mentioned, rightfully and lawfully there.\nAll of which would be true of steps used by permission of the corporation within the line of the highway. In face the statement of complaint relies upon the alleged promise to replace the steps, though it does not allege any consideration for the promise.\nThe inquiry naturally suggested is: What cause of action in the female plaintiff is intended? No duty to her on the part of the defendants is averred, the idea conveyed by the pleading being that she is suing because she had received an injury which she might have escaped if the defendants had fulfilled their promise to her husband. And, as far as the husband is concerned, he appears to put forward his wife's injuries as special damage from the same breach of contract.\nIt is too late, however, to criticise the pleading, and the plaintiffs, both or one of them, must succeed if the verdict they have obtained can be supported on the law and evidence.\nI do not think it can possibly be supported.\nThe alleged contract may be put aside at once. There is no pretence that it can be maintained.\nConsider the case in the first place as if the cutting down of the street and the removal of the steps were unlawful acts, and, if you please, trespasses on the property of the husband. As already remarked the action is not for damages in respect of the property. Had it been so the measure of the damage would probably have been the price of a new set of steps. The position is that the platform of the house is left with a drop of six feet down to the level of the roadway.\nNow, assuming in his favor that there was no other way to get down, though there is evidence that there was another way, would the plaintiff be justified in saying:\u2014\nI have been accustomed to walk straight from my door to the street and I shall continue to do so. If I fall town the six feet where I used to have steps to go down, and am hurt, the corporation must pay me damages.\nNo one would contend for such a proposition. Clayards v. Dethick[10] whatever it decides, is not an authority that a man may run into obvious danger and then look to the person who caused the danger to make good any harm that follows. In Lax v. Darlington[11], Bramwell L.J. made some remarks upon expressions used in Clayards v. Dethick (1) which may usefully be referred to when that decision is appealed to. One of his illustrations is not inapposite here. Suppose, he said, a man is shut up in the top room of a house unlawfully, is he bound to stay there? He is not bound to do anything of the kind; he may jump out if he likes to run the risk of breaking his neck or his limbs; he may let himself down by a rope or a ladder, but if he runs the risk of getting out and breaks his neck, the person who shuts him up is not guilty of manslaughter; and if he breaks his leg, he ought not to have any right of action against that person although he was not bound to stay there.\nHere the plaintiffs did not jump down from the platform, they constructed a gangway and took the risk of getting down by it. It was a very unsafe and impracticable gangway, made by laying from the platform to the street two small planks 7 and 9 inches wide and 9 1\/2 and 10 1\/2 feet long. The platform being six feet high the planks must have rested on the ground about 8 feet off, forming a steep incline that would require some acrobatic skill to walk on at any time, but making it no matter of surprise that when the planks were wet the plaintiff Alice slipped off them. There would have been greater reason for surprise if she had not fallen.\nIt seems therefore clear that, irrespective altogether of the right of the defendants to do the acts complained of, the evidence fails to support the charges that those acts occasioned the injuries to the plaintiff Alice. The question of contributory negligence does not arise as a separate issue. The plaintiffs had to establish that the injuries complained of were occasioned by the acts charged against the defendants, and they have shown clearly what it was that caused the accident, and that it was the attempt to use the unsafe gangway which they had themselves constructed and which they knew to be dangerous[12].\nThere was under these circumstances nothing to leave to the jury, and I do not understand any of the questions on which the jury pronounced to have referred to the aspect of the case which I have been discussing. Several questions were asked relating to other means of access to the highway and as to the possibility of using, and the prudence of not resorting to, such other means in place of the planks, but the other access referred to was a route by another part of the platform. The question most directly relating to the planks was this:\u2014\nWas it reasonably necessary for the plaintiff in order to get from his premises to the street to put the planks in the position they were placed?\nthe learned judge explaining that by \"reasonable,\" he meant reasonably necessary considering the other means the plaintiff had of getting to the street. This question did not, any more than the others, touch the subject of the dangerous character of the gangway.\nThe point decided in Adams v. Lancashire & Yorkshire Ry. Co.[13] is very like that on which this case might turn on the assumption that the defendants were to blame for removing the steps. The company there had been negligent but the plaintiff had brought the injury on himself by his own act. He was non-suited by the court in banc. Brett L. J., who had tried the action, agreed in the judgment, though apparently with some hesitation. I shall read from his observations a passage which was quoted with approval in the recent case of Lee v. Nixey[14], and which is apposite to the case in hand:\nI think the jury were justified in finding that the defendants were negligent; but the immediate result of their negligence was not any peril to the plaintiff, but only considerable inconvenience. It has been argued that no amount of inconvenience, if there be no actual peril, will justify a person incurring danger in an attempt to get rid of it. I confess I am not prepared to go that length. I think if the inconvenience is so great that it is reasonable to get rid of it by an act not obviously dangerous, and executed without carelessness, the person causing the inconvenience by his negligence would be liable for any injury that might result from an attempt to avoid such inconvenience.\nHere the method adopted by the plaintiffs for reaching the street was obviously dangerous.\nBut there cannot be any serious dispute as to the authority of the defendants to change the level of any portion of the street under their statutory power to \"open, lay out, regulate, repair, amend and clean\" the roads, &c. within the town[15]. The same section gives the town council the control of the expenditure of moneys for the \"making, repair and improvement\" of the roads. The word \"improvement\" is evidently used as the synonym of \"amend,\" and these terms include something beyond merely repairing, being in each instance used in addition to the word \"repair.\" This subject has been fully discussed in the judgments delivered in the court below. I shall content myself with saying that I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Tuck and Mr. Justice King.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Wm.

McG. who claimed a large sum of money from the Government of the Province of Quebec under a contract he had for the construction of a portion of the North Shore Railway, agreed to submit to three mediators or amiables compositeurs all controversies and difficulties existing between the Government and himself, and the submission stated that these mediators should enquire into inter alia the extent of the obligation of the contract passed between the Government of Quebec and the said T. McG.; the alterations and modifications made in the plans, particulars and specifications mentioned in the said contract: what influence the said alterations and modifications may have had on the obligations of the said T. McG. and on those of the Government; the delays caused by reasons irrelevant to the action of the con-tractor; the pecuniary value, whether for more or for less, of the alterations or any increase in the works; and finally, all things connected with the matter and the execution of the said contract and with regard to the charges and obligations of both the Government and the said contractor, according to the terms of the said contract.\nThe submission also provided that the award was to be executed as a final and conclusive judgment of the highest court of justice.\nThe mediators by their award, after reciting the matters in controversy between the parties, found that the Government of the Province of Quebec was indebted to T. McG. in the sum of $147433 and annexed thereto an affidavit stating they had inquired into all matters and difficulties submitted to them as appeared in the deed of submission. This amount being much less that the amount claimed by T. McG. he filed a petition of right, asking that the award be set aside on the ground that it did not cover the matters referred to the arbitrators in the submission. The Superior Court for the district of Quebec set aside the award, and on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the petition of right. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that the object of the submission was to ascertain what amount the contractor T. McG. was to receive from the Government, and the specification of the several matters referred to in the submission was merely to secure that in determining the amount the mediators should fully consider all these matters and that all matters having been so considered the award was valid. Strong and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nPer Fournier J. Mediators (amiables compositeurs) are not subject to the provisions of art. 1346 C.P.C and their award can only be set aside by reason of fraud or collusion if given on the matters referred to them.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing a judgm\u00e9nt of the Superior Court in the District of Quebec ([1]).\nThe appellant had, under a contract with the Government of the Province of Quebec built the eastern section of the North Shore Railway between Montreal and Quebec.\nHe had claimed as a balance due him considerable sums of money which the government refused to pay, and the difficulties between the parties had been referred to arbitrators and mediators (amiables compositeurs), who by their award declared that the government owed the sum of $147,473 as the total balance.\nThe appellant applied to the Superior Court by petition of right to have the award set aside.

Dumouchel, notary public, of the City of Montreal and bearing date the thirtieth day of July last past, (1881) the time fixed and determined to render our award on said compromis having been extended and enlarged by the mutual consent of said parties to the fifteenth day of June instant (1882) inclusive under and by virtue of four different deeds to that effect executed before the same notary and bearing date respectively as follows: twenty-eighth December last (1881). twenty-fifth February last (1882), twenty-seventh.

J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It is abundantly clear from the recitals in the submission that the contractor was claiming from the government large sums of money for the execution of the works, and that the Minister in the capacity of Commissioner of Railways did not feel justified in taking upon himself the task of deter-mining the value of the claims of the contractor; that the contractors and Railway Commissioner did agree to refer and submit all such claims and demands to the decision of a board of arbitrators. \" Now, therefore,\" as the submission expresses it, the respective parties in order to settle definitely all the controversies and difficulties existing in the premises did mutually agree to submit the same with all questions connected therewith to the final decision of the arbitrators.\" This makes it to my mind very clear that the sole object of the arbitration was to ascertain what amount the contractor was entitled to receive from the government, and the specification of the several matters referred to in the submission was merely to secure that in determining the amount the assessors should fully consider all these matters.\nIt is clear from the award that the arbitrators did take into consideration and did fully consider and decide on all the matters referred to them. There is nothing whatever to show or from which it can be inferred that they did not do so and the result was the finding that the Government of the Province of Quebec was indebted to the suppliant in the sum of $147,473, and this was a final determination of the claims and demands of the contractor and of all things connected with the matter and execution of the said contract, and with regard to the charges and obligations both of the government and the said contractor, according to the terms of the said contract, and I think there is no ground whatever for disturbing this award, and that the appeal should be dismissed\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed and judgment of Superior Court restored, with costs in this court and in the courts below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le 24 septembre 1875, l'appelant contracta tracta avec gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, pour la construction de la partie est du chemin de fer de la Rive Nord. Les travaux furent compl\u00e9t\u00e9s et le chemin remis en la possession du gouvernement en 1880 Durant la construction il fut fait des changements dans la location de la ligne. A la fin des travaux un estim\u00e9 du co\u00fbt total du chemin, comprenant les extra fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Mr. Light, ling\u00e9nieur du gouvernement. Mais des difficult\u00e9s \u00e9tant survenues entre les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, elles convinrent par un acte de compromis pass\u00e9 en julliet 1881, de s'eu rapporter \u00e0 la decision de Mr. Walter Shanly, nomm\u00e9 par le gouvernement, et Mr. Charles O'Dell nomm\u00e9 par l'appelant pour agir comme arbitres et amiables compositeurs, et Mr. Sandford Fleming comme tiers-arbitre et amiable compositeur choisis par les deux derniers\nLes arbitres et amiables compositeurs ayant proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'examen de l'affaire qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e rendirent leur sentence d\u00e9clarant que le gouvernement devait \u00e0 l'appelant une balance totale de $147,473.00.\nMcGreevy s'adressa par petition de droit \u00e0 la cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour faire annuler la sentence et obtint jugement; mais ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine. L'appel est de ce jugement.\nLe compromis donne aux arbitres et amiables compositeurs les pouvoirs les plus amples pour la decision des mati\u00e8res en dispute qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s comme suit dans l'acte de compromis: \u2014\n1. That the three above named persons shall act as experts, arbitrators and mediators (amiables compositeurs,) in the examination of the matter in litigation, and they shall enquire into and determine the extent of the obligations of the contract passed between the Government of Quebec and the said Thomas McGreevy; the alterations and modifications made in the plans, particulars and specifications mentioned in the said contract; what influence the said alterations and modifications may have had on the obligations of the said Thomas McGreevy and on those of the Government; the delays caused by reasons irrelevant to the action of the contractor; the pecuniary value, whether for more or for less of the alterations or any increase in the works and finally all things connected with the matter and the execution of the said contract, and with regard to the charges and obligations of both the Government and the said contractor, according to the terms of the said contract\nLes proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour arriver \u00e0 cette sentence ont eu lieu \u00e0 Ottawa du consentement des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es bienqu'il n'y en ait pas d'\u00e9crit, et en leur presence, et leurs t\u00e9moins et conseils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus en dehors de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le 14 juin 1882, avant l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour prononcer la sentence, les arbitres et amiables compositeurs se rendirent \u00e0 Hull, dans la province de Quebec, et y sign\u00e8rent leur sentence qui fut ensuite d\u00e9posee chez un notaire. La sentence d\u00e9clare en ces termes:\nThat we find that the Government of the Province of Quebec is indebted to the Hon. Thomas McGreevy in the sum of $147,473.00.\nL'appelant dit dans son factum:\nThis amount being very much less than the amount claimed by the contractor, and being advised that the award of the arbitrators was, for various reasons, null and void, he presented a petition of right, &c, &c.\nVoil\u00e0, une admission bien formelle de la part de l'appelant que sa principale raison d'attaquer la sentence, c'est quelle ne lui accorde pas un montant assez \u00e9lev\u00e9.\nIl all\u00e8gue aussi que les arbitres n'avaient aucun pouvoir de decider d'autres questions que celles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le compromis, et qu'ils \u00e9taient obliges de decider tous les points qui leur \u00e9taint soumis.\nIl se plaint encore que la seule question d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par eux est que dans leur opinion le gouvernement est endett\u00e9 envers l'appelant en la somme de $147,473.00. Il pr\u00e9tend que cette question ne leur \u00e9tait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e. D'appris lui les amiables compositeurs auraient di se borner \u00e0 d\u00e9finir, 10 l'\u00e9tendue des obligations du contrat; 2\u00ba les changements et modifications faits aux plans et specifications; 30 l'effet de ces changements ont Pu avoir sur les obligations respectives des parties; 4\u00b0 les d\u00e9lass causes au contracteur; 5 la valeur en plus on en moins des changements faits, et enfin, 6\u00b0 toutes mati\u00e8res ayant rapport \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution, en prenant en consid\u00e9ration les obligations respectives des parties.\nLes amiables compositeurs n'ont sans doute pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 comme une cour ordinaire et ne sont pas entr\u00e9s dans les details des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s et des motifs sur lesquels ils ont fond\u00e9 leur sentence arbitrale. Leur qualit\u00e9 d'amiables compositeurs les en dispensait. Il en e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement s'ils eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement nomm\u00e9s arbitres.\nNotre code deprocedure, article 1346. dit: \u2014\nLes arbitres doivent entendre les parties et leur preuve respective, ou les constituer en d\u00e9faut, et juger suivant les r\u00e8gles de droit \u00e0 moins qu'ils n'en soient dispens\u00e9s par le compromis, ou qu'ils ne soient \u00e9tablis amiables compositeurs.\nLe code n'a fait aucun changement \u00e0 l'ancien droit au sujet des amiables compositeurs. Ils sont encore aujourd'hui comme auparavant, dispens\u00e9s d'observer les r\u00e8gles de droit et les formes de la procedure ils d\u00e9cident suivant l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et la bonne conscience. Leur sentence, pourvu qu'elle soit dans les limites de leurs attributions ne peut \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 que pour fraude ou collusion\nDalloz Vo. Arbitrage, ([2]):\u2014\nLes amiables compositeurs sont les arbitres qu'on nommait autrefois arbitrateurs. Ce sont ceux qui ont pouvoir de juger sans formalit\u00e9 judiciaire; ils peuvent temp\u00e9rer la rigueur de la loi \u00e9couter l'\u00e9ouit\u00e9 naturelle que l'orateur romain appelle laxamentum legis et prononcer non pro ut lex, sed pro ut humanitas aut misericordia impellit regerer.\nLes arbitres au contraire doivent juger suivant la loi et observer les r\u00e8gles de la procedure.\nLes amiables compositeurs sont affranchis en outre des r\u00e8gles du droit. C'est l\u00e0 ce qui les distingue des arbitres volontaires ([3]).\nBioche, ([4]):\u2014\nCependant, lorsque les parties leur ont donn\u00e9, par le compromis, la facult\u00e9 de prononcer comme amiables compositeurs, ils peuvent se d\u00e9patri\u00e9s r\u00e8gles du droit et suivre l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 naturelle.\nD'apr\u00e8s ces autorit\u00e9s il est evident que les amiables compositeurs avaient le droit de rendre leur sentence dans la forme qu'ils ont adopt\u00e9e c'est-\u00e0-dire d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et sans entrer dans des details. Mais leur sentence n'en est pas moins complete et porte sur toutes les mati\u00e8res r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es comme on le voit par l'extrait suivant de la sentence:\u2014\nNow therefore, we, the said experts, arbitrators and mediators (amiables compositeurs),having been first duly sworn as appears by the document hereto annexed, bearing date the twenty-fifth day of January last past, (1882), and marked A; heard the allegations of the said parties and their respective witnesses under oath, and having carefully examined the matters in controversy by them submitted to wit:\u2014 the extent of the obligations of the contract passed between the Government of Ouebec and the said Thomas McGreevy; the alterations and modifications made in the plane, particulars and specifications mentioned in the said contract; what influence the said alterations and modifications may have had on the obligations of the said Thomas McGreevy and on those of the Government; the delays caused by reasons irrelevant to the action of the contractor, the pecuniary value, whether for more or for less of the alterations or any increase in the works; and finally, all things connected with the matter and the execution of the said contract, and with regard to the charges and obligations of both the Government and the said contractor, according to the terms of the said contract\nComme ils le d\u00e9clarent, les amiables compositeurs ont entendu les parties et leurs t\u00e9moins et examine soigneusement toutes les mati\u00e8res en contestation qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises qu'ils \u00e9num\u00e9rent en citant textuellement la partie du compromis qui les d\u00e9finit. Ainsi il ne pent pas y avoir eu d'omissions, toutes les mati\u00e8res r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es et d\u00e9cid\u00e9es Et c'est apr\u00e9s cela qu'ils out fix\u00e9 le montant d\u00fb par le gouvernement \u00e0. l'appelant.\nIl suffit de lire le compromis pour comprendre que la proposition de l'appelant que la fixation de la somme due n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e aux arbitres, n'est pas soutenable. C'est l'unique but que les parties avaient en vue, celui d'arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement final et de mettre un terme aux incessantes reclamations que faisait l'appelant pour de grandes sommes d'argent lui revenant pour l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux de son contrat D'ailleurs la chose 13 est clairement dite dans la clause du compromis que l'on trouve \u00e0 la page 20 du dossier comme le fait voir l'extrait\nAnd whereas ever since the Government has taken possession of the said, road the contractor has never ceased to claim from the party of the first part the payment of large sums of money for the execution of the said works.\nAnd whereas the said party of the first part doss not feel justified in taking upon himself, not even with the assistance of the ordinary officers of his Department, the task of determining the value of the claims of the said contractor, nor does he believe himself qualified to make a just appreciation of the definitive estimates of the Chief Engineer Mr. Light.\nNow therefore, these presents and I, the said notary witness:\u2014\nThat the said respective parties hereto, in order to settee definitively all the controversies and difficulties existing between themselves in the premises, do hereby mutually covenant and agree to and with each other, to submit such controversies and difficulties, with all questions connected therewith, to the final decision of Walter Shanly, of the City of Montreal, Esquire, Civil Engineer, arbitrator and mediator (amiable compositeur) named by the said party of the first part, and Chas. Odell, of the City of Quebec, Esquire, Civil Engineer, arbitrator and mediator (amiablecompositeur) named by the said Thomas McGreevy, who (both hereto present and accepting,).\nComme on le volt par cet extrait la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de fixer le montant des r\u00e9clamations de l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 la raison d\u00e9terminante du compromis, les autres questions mentionn\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ne sont que des sujets d'examen pour en arriver \u00e0 la solution principale la fixation du montant d\u00fb par le gouvernement \u00e0 l'appelant. Si les amiables compositeurs n'eussent fait rapport d'une somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, ils auraient totalement failli \u00e0 leur d\u00e9voir, et leurs proc\u00e9d\u00e9s auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 sans valeur. Non seulement il n'y a pas eu en cela exc\u00e9s de pouvoir, mais en supposant m\u00eame que le compromis eut \u00e9t\u00e9 silencieux sur cette question, les amiables compositeurs avaient d'apr\u00e9s la loi et la jurisprudence le pouvoir de statuer sur le montant di \u00e0 l'une des deux parties sans exc\u00e9der leur juridiction suivant l'autorit\u00e9 de Dalloz ([5]):\n4\u00b0 Que charg\u00e9s de prononcer sur tous les diff\u00e9rends \u00e9lev\u00e9s entre les parties, ils peuvent s'il a lieu, ordonner des compensations entre elles sans exc\u00e9der leur mandat; ils peuvent en pareil cas, a dit la cour Royale, prescrire aux parties tout ce que, par voie de transaction, celles-ci auraient Pu faire (Angers ler juin 1822, m\u00eame esp\u00e8ce); c'est l\u00e0, on le voit, donner la plus grande latitude au pouvoir des amiables compositeurs; et certes quand on examine, et la nature des d\u00e9bats qui divisent les parties et l'intention manifest\u00e9e dans le compromis, on reste convaincu que le pouvoir des arbitres avait pu aller jusque-l\u00e0 ([6]).\nL'appelant s'est aussi plaint que la sentence arbitrale est nulle parce que les amiables compositeurs n'ont pas donn\u00e9 les motifs de leur decision. C'est m\u00e9connaltre compl\u00e8tement la loi qui r\u00e9git leurs fonctions que de les assimiler en cela aux cours ordinaires, en les pr\u00e9tendant soumis \u00e0 l'obligation que la loi ne leur impose nullement de donner les motifs de leurs decision\nBioche, ([7]).\nToutefois, le d\u00e9faut de motifs n'entra\u00eene pas la nullit\u00e9 si les arbitres sont amiables compositeurs.\nDans la cause de Allen v. Allen,([8]) la cour de Bordeaux a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 28 novembre 1835 que les amiables compositeurs n'\u00e9taient pas obliges de motiver leur sentence.\nL'appelant a invoqu\u00e9 un autre moyen pour attaquer la sentence en pr\u00e9tendant que les amiables compositeurs et les t\u00e9moins n'avaient pas pr\u00eat\u00e9 serment. C'est une \u00e9vidente erreur de faits. La sentence contient la formule du serment pr\u00e9t\u00e9 par les amiables compositeurs et la minute de leurs proc\u00e9\u00e9ss contient la formule de l'assermentation des t\u00e9moins.\nUn dernier moyen de l'appelant, encore moins fond\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9cedant c'est que la sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 Hull, au lieu de l'\u00eatre dans la cite de Qu\u00e9bec. Il est vrai que dans le compromis, il est dit que les amiables compositeurs rendront leur sentence \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, dans les quatre mois de sa date. Il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de fixer le d\u00e9lai dans lequel devait \u00eatre rendue la sentence. Cette formalit\u00e9 est \u00e9tablie par l'article 1344, code de proc\u00e9dure:\nL'acte de compromis extra-judiciaire doit designer les noms et qualit\u00e9s des parties et des arbitres, les objets en litige et le temps dans lequel la sentence arbitrale doit \u00eatre rendue.\nIl n'est nullement question de la fixation du lieu o\u00f9 la sentence doit \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e, ni dans cet article, ni dans aucune autre loi. Le fait que la sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 Hull, au lieu de Quebec, n'a aucune importance quelconque et n'affecte nullement les pouvoirs des amiables compositeurs. L'appelant est le dernier qui devait offrir une telle objection, puisque c'est \u00e0 sa demande que les amiables compositeurs ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, comme le prouve le t\u00e9moignage de Mr. Walter Shanly, l'un des amiables compositeurs. Il a acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 tons les pro\u00e9\u00e9d\u00e9s en y assistant en personne, en s'y faisant aussi repr\u00e9senter par son fr\u00e8re Robert McGreevy et par son conseil, Mr. Irvine. Si cette objection avait quelque valeur, le d\u00e9fendeur a, par sa conduite, formellement acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 la procedure des amiables compositeurs et renonc\u00e9 au droit, s'il en avait eu, de s'en pr\u00e9valoir. L'appel dolt \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The judgment appealed from in this case was rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec, reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, in the district of Quebec. The circumstances which have given rise to the present proceedings are as follows:\u2014\nThomas McGreevy, the present appellant, entered into a contract with the government of the Province of Quebec on the 24th September, 1875, for the construction of the eastern portion of the North Shore Railway. This railway was finally completed and handed over to the government in the month of Jan-nary 1880 During the course of the construction of the road various changes were made in the location of the line, causing extra expense and delay to the contractor, and at the period of the completion of the work and the delivery of it to the government, an esti-mate of the total cost of the road including allowance for extra work was made by Mr. Light, the government engineer. Thereupon various questions and difficulties arose between the government and the appellant, he claiming more than the amount allowed by the government, and the government offering him a less amount, and in the month of June, 1881, an agreement was made between the government and McGreevy that the matters in dispute between them should be referred to the arbitration of Mr. Walter Shanly, appointed by the government, Mr .Charles O'Dell appointed by the contractor, and Mr. Sandford Fleming agreed upon as umpire by the first named gentlemen. The submission to the arbitrators recites the agreement between the parties the variations in the location of the road and certain of the extra work which the appellant had been called upon to do, and the delays which various circumstances had caused in the construction of the work and that the parties had. agreed to refer the matter to arbitration in the way already mentioned. The matters referred to these arbitrators were:\u2014\nThat they should inquire into and determine the extent of the obligations of the contract passed between the government of Quebec and the said Thomas McGreevy; the alterations and modifications made in the plans, particulars and \"specifications mentioned in the said contract what influence the said alterations and modifications may have had on the obligations of the said Thomas McGreevy and on those of the government; the delays caused by reasons irrelevant to the action of the contractor; the pecuniary value whether for more or for less of the alterations or any increase in the works; and finally all things connected, with the matter and execution of the said contract and with regard to the charges and obligations of both the government and the said contractor, according to the terms of the said contract.\nThe submission then goes on to specify the manner in which the proceedings are to be carried on, the time within which the award is to be made and other particulars of minor importance.\nThe proceedings under this submission were held in the City of Ottawa.\nOn the 14th June, 1882, the arbitrators signed a document which was afterwards deposited with a notary as their award. The document, after reciting a portion of the submission, contains the following finding:\u2014\" That we find that the government of the Province of Quebec is indebted to the Honorable Thomas McGreevy in the sum of $147,473.\" This amount being very much less than the amount claimed by the appellant he is now asking, for the reasons given in the petition that this award should be held to be null and void. The Lieutenant-Governor having granted his fiat on the petition of right, proceedings were then taken in the usual way before the Superior Court, and on the 2nd March 1885 Mr. Justice Caron rendered a judgment in which he granted the Conclusion of the petition of right and declared the award to be null and void and of no effect whatever, mentioning as his reason that the award did not cover the matters referred to the arbitrators in the submission. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the petition of right. The judges have not given their reasons for this judgment, and the only consid\u00e9rant given in the judgment was a general one that the arbitrators had determined all the questions submitted to them, and that whatever irregularities there might have been in the proceedings of the arbifrators had been waived by the appellant.\nI am of opinion that we should restore the judgment of the Superior Court. The arbitrators were bound to dispose of all the points submitted to them, the adjudication which they had undertaken. The only matter decided of by them was the simple fact that in their opinion the government owed the appellant the sum of $147,473. Now in order to reach that final result, the submission provided that they should decide these several points:\n1st. The extent of the obligations of the contract passed between the Government of Quebec and the said Thomas McGreevy.\n2nd. The alterations and modifications made in the plans, particulars and specifications, mentioned in the said contract.\n3rd. What influence the said alterations and modifications may have had on the obligations of the said Thomas McGreevy and on those of the government.\n4th. The delays caused by reasons irrelevant to the action of the contractor.\n5th. The pecuniary value whatever for more or for less of the alterations or any increase in the works; and finally,\n6th. All things connected with the matter and the execution of the said contract and with regard to the charges and obligations of both the government and the said McGreevy according to the terms of the said contract.\nNot one of these points (the only matters referred to the arbitrators) was decided by them. They have simply struck a balance of account and stated the amount to which they considered the appellant entitled. The appellant, it seems to me, had the right to a decision on the various details mentioned in paragraph one of the matters submitted to the arbitrators. It was not sufficient, in my opinion, for the arbitrators to state that they had examined all the points referred to them. The submission obliged them to pass and determine on each of them which they have not done. On this ground alone I would allow the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The whole contention upon this appeal, as argued before us, was that the award which the appellant seeks to set aside as null and void purports to decide a point which, as is contended, never was at all submitted to the arbitrators, namely, the amount in which the government of the Province of Quebec are justly indebted to him upon his contract for the construction of a portion of the North Shore Railway; and that it does not determine certain points which, as is contended, were the only points submitted to the arbitrators to be determined.\nThe construction of the submission deed appears to me to be that the sole object of the reference to the amiables compositeurs was to obtain their final determination of the true and just amount (under the particular circumstances recited in the deed and having due regard to those circumstances) of the appellant's claims and demands against the government of the province of Quebec under his contract, which circumstances, in the examination of the matter in litigation,\" between the parties to the reference, that is, in the examination of the amount due to the contractor by the government, the amiables compositeurs were required to inquire into, and to be governed by, in making their award as to the amount of the contractor's claim against the Government which was \" the matter in litigation.\"\nThe deed recites the various circumstances which the appellant relied upon as increasing the amount of his claims, viz:\u2014the alterations in the route and plans of the railway from those originally designed when the contract was entered into; the delays alleged to have been caused to the contractor proceeding with the work which operated to his prejudice; the facts that, \" with the view of determining and settling as quick as possible the claims of the contractor,\" it was agreed between him and the provincial government, that final estimates should be prepared by the Chief Engineer of the provincial government, and that so soon as these estimates should be approved the government should pay all moneys which should appear to be due and owing to the contractor; that those estimates were prepared by the chief engineer, and that the contractor (the now appellant) never ceased to claim from the provincial government large sums of money for the execution of the said work, and that the minister, representing in that matter the provincial government, not feeling himself justified in taking upon himself the task of determining the value of the claims of the contractor, or of appreciating the definitive estimates of the chief engineer it was agreed between the contractor and the minister acting on behalf of and representing the provincial government to refer and submit all such claims and demands of the contractor to the decision of a board of arbitration. And in order to settle definitively all the controversies and difficulties existing in the premises, the appellant and the minister mutually covenanted and agreed to submit such controversies and difficulties with all questions connected therewith to the final decision of three amiable compositeurs named in the deed.\nNow, from these recitals and the submission thereupon made, it is abundantly clear that the whole matter in controversy between the parties to the submission was as to the amount of the just claims and demands which the appellant under the special circumstances recited in the deed had against the provincial government, an inquiry into which matter involved, of course, an inquiry into the correctness of the estimate of such amount as made by the chief engineer. The object of the reference plainly was that the persons named as arbitrators in the submission deed should, as competent experts and as amiables compositeurs, finally determine the amount of the contractor's just claims which the minister, feeling himself not qualified to make a just appreciation of the definitive estimates of the chief engineer declared himself to be incompetent to determine. It was \" the claims and demands \" of the contractor for the amount contended by him to be due to him by the Provincial Government which constituted the special matter expressly agreed to be referred to the decision of the experts (amiables compositeurs) and the parties to the reference covenanted, that they should respectively execute and perform in every respect the award to be made by them, or by a majority of them, as a final and conclusive judgment of the highest court of justice. Now from the terms of the deed of submission there does not appear to have been anything which can be suggested, nor has there been anything suggested, which the provincial government could be called upon to execute and perform, or which they could execute and perform in obedience to an award made in pursuance of the submission, unless it be to pay the amount which should be awarded as due by the provincial government to the appellant in respect of the contract in the deed of submission mentioned.\nThe award instead of being made defective by professinff to determine such amount would have been in my opinion, wholly defective, barren and useless, if it had not done so finally and conclusively, so that it should operate, as it was expressed by the deed of submission and intended that it should operate, as a final and conclusive judgment of the highest court of justice. The award upon its face declares (and the truth of what is stated in it is not disputed) that the amiables compositeurs, in their examination of the matter in litigation which as I have already said was, in my opinion, the true amount of the appellants' just claim against the government of the province of Quebec, did carefully inquire into and. take into their consideration the several matters which the appellant relied upon as increasing the amount of his claim, stating them seriatim as they are set out in the deed of submission, and that having done so they unanimously found the true amount in which the government of the province of Quebec were indebted to the appellant to be the sum of $147,473. They have thus, in my opinion, complied with the object and intent of the deed of submission and we should defeat the intention of the parties as expressed in that deed if we should pronounce the award to be null and void upon the ground urged, and as this was the only ground which was relied upon, the other points of objection stated in the petition of right not having been pressed, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH OF MANITOBA.\nConstitutional law\u2014B.N.A. Act, ss. 91 & 92\u2014Interest\u2014Legislative authority over\u2014Municipal Act\u201449 V. c. 52 s. 626; 50 V. c. 10 s. 43 (Man.)\u2014Taxation\u2014Penalty for not paying taxes\u2014Additional rate.\nThe Municipal Act of Manitoba provides that persons paying taxes before Dec. 1st in cities and Dec. 31st in rural municipalities shall be allowed 10 per cent, discount; that from that date until March 1st the taxes (shall be payable at par; and after March 1st 10 per cent, on the original amount of the tax shall be added.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the 10 per cent, added on March 1st is only an additional rate or tax imposed as a penalty for non-payment which the local legislature, under its authority to legislate with respect to municipal institutions, had power to impose, and it was not \u201c interest \u201d within the meaning of sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act. Boss v. Torrance (2 Legal News 186) overruled.\nAPPEALS from decisions of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Man) ([1]). The question raised on the three appeals is the same, namely, as to the power of the legislature of Manitoba to pass an act authorising municipalities to impose an addition of ten per cent, on taxes unpaid after a certain time from the assessment being made.\nThe act in question is sec. 626 of the act known as The Municipal Act of 1886, 49 Vic. ch. 52, as amended by 50 Vic. ch. 10 sec. 43. It provides that persons paying taxes before the first day of December in cities and the thirty-first day of December in rural municipalities shall be entitled to a reduction of ten per cent.; taxes unpaid on those dates shall be payable at par until the first day of March following; and if not then paid ten per cent, shall be added to the original amount.\nThe suit in Lynch\u2019s case was for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land by which the plaintiff agreed to pay the taxes assessed on the land and the balance of the purchase money in cash. In paying the taxes plaintiff paid the ten per cent, added on the amount on March 1st of each year and compounded in subsequent years and tendered to the defendant as the purchase money of the land the amount agreed less such taxes and interest. The defendant refused to accept this amount claiming that the addition of the ten Per cent was illegal. The appellant refused to pay more and brought his suit for specific performance.\nThe bill was dismissed without argument either on the hearing or before the full court, it being held that the case fell within the decision in Morden v. South Dufferin (1), which followed Schultz v. City of Winnipeg ([2]). The defendant appealed.\nIn South Dufferin v. Morden the taxes imposed on respondent\u2019s land were subject to the addition of 10 per cent., and respondent paid the addition under protest having tendered to the appellants: first, the original amount of the tax imposed; and secondly, such amount with six per cent, added, both of which were refused. The action was brought to recover the amount added to the assessment and judgment was given against the municipality, the act being held ultra vires so far as the addition to the tax was concerned. The municipality appealed.\nIn Gibbins v. Barber land was sold by the respondent to the appellant, the latter agreeing to pay taxes and deduct the same from the purchase money. The same question arises on a refusal by respondent to allow the 10 per cent, addition to be so deducted.\nThe three appeals were argued together.\nKennedy for the appellants in Lynch v. Canada North-West Land Co. The interest mentioned in the B.N.A. Act, as to which the Dominion Parliament only can legislate, is interest on commercial matters and means merely the rate of interest.\nValin v. Langiois ([3]) and P arsons v. Citizens Ins. Co. ([4]) settle the mode by which the B. N. A. Act is to be construed. The whole scope and object of the act is to be considered, and so construing it the word \u201cinterest \u201d in the 92 section cannot be held to apply to municipalities dealing with taxes.\nThe addition to the taxes provided for by the Manitoba act is not interest but merely a penalty.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C., and Tupper Q.C., for the respondent. Interest is compensation for delay in the payment of money due. Tested by this definition the provision in this case clearly relates to interest and is ultra vires the provincial legislature.\nThe legislature in this same act twice calls the addition to the taxes interest, which is some evidence of their intention in passing it. The cases of Ross v. Torrance (1) and City of Montreal v. Perkins (2) settle the law as we contend here.\nIn South Dufferin v. Morden Martin, Atty. Gen. of Manitoba, appeared for the appellants and MacTavish for the respondent.\nIn Gibbins v. Barber Tupper Q. C. for the respondent stated that the counsel had agreed to submit the case on the factums the facts being substantially the same as in the other cases.\nThe three cases were decided together and the following judgments were delivered.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It is obvious that the matter of interest which was intended to be dealt with by the Dominion Parliament was in connection with debts originating in contract, and that it was never intended in any way to conflict with the right of the local legislature to deal with municipal institutions in the matter of assessments or taxation, either in the manner or extent to which the local legislature should authorizes such assessments to be made, but the intention was to prevent individuals under certain circumstances from contracting for more than a certain rate of interest, and fixing a certain rate when interest was payable by law without a rate having been named.\nR. S. C. ch. 127. s. 1 provides:\u2014\n1. Except as otherwise provided by this or by any other act of the Parliament of Canada any person may stipulate for, allow and exact, on any contract or agreement whatsoever, any rate of interest or discount which is agreed upon.\n2. Whenever interest is payable by the agreement of parties or by law, and no rate is fixed by such agreement or by law, the rate of interest shall be 6 per centum per annum.\nThe statute then deals with the question of interest on monies secured on mortgage in sections from three to eight inclusive. The three next sections apply to Ontario and Quebec, the next six to the Province of Nova Scotia, and the next six to the Province of New Brunswick, then four to British Columbia, and three to Prince Edward Island.\nIt is abundantly clear that taxes are not contracts between party and party either express or implied, but they are the positive acts of the government through its various agents binding upon the inhabitants, and to the making or enforcing of which their personal consent, individually, is not required.\nDillon on Muncipal Corporations ([5]) has the following note:\u2014\nDenying that taxes are debts, for which, without statute authority, actions may be maintained, see Pierce v. Boston ([6]) and numerous other cases * * *. In an important case in the Supreme Court of the United States Justice Field states with clearness the distinction between \u201ctaxes \u201d and \u201cdebts. \u201d \u201cTaxes are not debts. It was so held by this court in the case of Lane County v. Oregon ([7]). Debts are obligations for the payment of money founded upon contract express or implied. Taxes are imposts levied for the support of the government, or for some special purpose authorized by it. The consent of the taxpayer is not necessary to their enforcement. They operate in invitum. Nor is their nature affected by the fact that in some states * * * an action of debt may be instituted for their recovery. The form of procedure cannot change their character. Augusta v. North ([8]); Camden v. Allen ([9]); Perry v. Washburn ([10]). Nor are they different when levied under writs of mandamus for the payment of judgments, and when levied for the same purpose by statute. The levy in the one case is as much by legislative authority as in the other. \u201d Meriwether v. Garrett ([11]). In Dubuque v. Ill. Cent. Ry. Co, ([12]) the text, section 815 (653) is quoted with approval and numerous cases are cited by the learned judge including The Dollar Sav. Bank v. United States ([13]).\nMeriwether v. Garrett (7). Field J:\nMunicipal corporations are mere instrumentalities of the State for the more convenient administration of local government. Their powers are such as the legislature may confer, and these may be enlarged, abridged, or entirely withdrawn at its pleasure. This is common learning, found in all adjudications on the subject of municipal bodies and repeated by text-writers.\nThe levying of taxes is not a judicial act. It has no elements of one. It is a high act of sovereignty, to be performed only by the legislature upon considerations of policy, necessity and the public welfare. In the distribution of the powers of government in this country into three departments the power of taxation falls to the legislative. It belongs to that department to determine what measures shall be taken for the public welfare, and to provide the revenue for the support and due administration of the government throughout the state and in all its subdivisions. Having the sole power to authorize the tax it must equally possess the sole power to prescribe the means by which the tax shall be collected, and to designate the officers through whom its will shall be enforced.\nCity of Augusta v. North ([14]).\nAppleton C. J.:\nBut a tax duly assessed is not a debt. It is an impost levied by the authority of the state upon the citizens. There is no promise on their part to pay. The proceedings throughout are in invitum. A debt is a sum due by express or implied agreement. It was held in Pierce v. Boston ([15]), that taxes being neither judgments nor contracts, were not the subject of set-off.\nNor are taxes [observes Shaw C.J.] contracts between party and party either express or implied, but they are the positive acts of the government through its various agents, binding upon the inhabitants, and to the making and enforcing of which their personal consent, individually, is not required.\nIn Shaw v. Peckett ([16]) it was held that the assessment of taxes did not create a debt that could be enforced by suit, or upon which a promise to pay interest could be implied. In Lane County v. Oregon ([17]) it was decided that the clauses in the several acts of congress of 1862 and 1863, making United States notes a legal tender for debts, had no reference to taxes imposed by state authority, the court holding that congress had in contemplation \u201cdebts originating in contracts or demands carried into judgment, and only debts of this character. \u201d\nChase CJ. says in Lane County v. Oregon ([18]):\u2014\nThe next case was that of the City of Camden v. Allen ([19]). That was an action of debt brought to recover a tax by the municipality to which \u201cit was due. The language of the Supreme Court of New Jersey was still more explicit: \u201c A tax, in its essential characteristics,\u201d said the court \u201c is not a debt nor in the nature of a debt, A tax is an impost levied by authority of government upon its citizens, or subjects, for the support of the state. It is not founded on contract or agreement. It operates in invitum. A debt is a sum of money due by certain and express agreement. It originates in and is founded upon contracts express or implied. \u201d\nWe cannot attribute to the legislature an intent to include taxes under the term debts without something more than appears in the acts to show that intention.\nThe Supreme Court of California, in 1862, had the construction of these acts under consideration in the case of Perry v. Washburn ([20]). The decisions which we have cited were referred to by Chief Justice Field, now holding a seat on this bench, and the very question we are now considering, \u201cwhat did Congress intend by the act \u201d? was answered in these words:\u2014\nUpon this question we are clear that it only intended by the terms debts, public and private, such obligations for the payment of money as are founded upon contract.\nIn the local legislature is vested the power to create municipal corporations and deal generally with municipal institutions, and to confer the right to impose or levy local rates, taxes and assessments upon the inhabitants and upon all property within the limits of the designated taxing district and to regulate the levying and collecting of such taxes in any manner it may deem most efficient. I care not by what name this 10 Per cent, may be called; it was to all intents and purposes, in the case before us, an additional tax as the words of the act appear to me most unquestionably to indicate:\nAll taxes remaining due and unpaid on the 1st or 31st day of December (as the case may be) shall be payable at par until the 1st day of March following at which time a list of all the taxes then remaining unpaid and due shall be prepared by the treasurer or collector (as the case may be) and the sum of 10 per cent, on the original amount shall be added on all taxes then remaining unpaid.\nWhat is this but an addition to the tax originally imposed? But we are asked to read this as not an additional tax but as interest for an indefinite period without the slightest indication of any such intention except the fact that 10 per cent, is to be added to the tax, and thus producing the most unreasonable result that if the tax was paid the next day (say the 2nd day of March) the interest imposed would be 10 per cent, for the forbearance of payment for one day, a proposition to my mind too unreasonable to suppose the legislature ever could have contemplated such a consequence. But treating it as an increased assessment, imposed to stimulate the ratepayers to pay promptly, and if they do not then approximately to equalize the assessment rendered necessary by reason of the delinquency of the ratepayers, no such difficulty arises. It may be too large or it may be too small for the accomplishment of either of these purposes, but with this we have nothing to do. The legislature has vested in the municipality the power to impose taxes, and if they have acted within the power confided to them no court has a right to say that the amount imposed is too large or too small. But had it been specifically named as interest I am of opinion that it was an incident to the right of taxation vested in the municipal authority and, though more than the rate allowed by the Dominion statute in matters of contract, in no way in conflict with the authority secured to the Dominion Parliament over interest by the British North America Act, but must be read, consistently with that, as within the power given to the local legislature under its power to deal with municipal institutions.\nAs I said in The City of Frederic ton v. The Queen ([21]) approved by the Privy Council in Russell v. The Queen ([22]) in reference to the Dominion Parliament, so with reference to the Local Legislature:\u2014\nThe general, absolute, uncontrolled authority to legislate in its discretion in all matters over which it has power to deal subject only to such restrictions, if any, as are contained in the British North America Act and subject of course to the sovereign authority of the British Parliament.\nIn this case I can see no limitation with respect to municipal matters, which necessarily embraces the levying of taxes for municipal purposes and therefore falls within one of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 92, and assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces. Does not the collocation of number 19 \u201cinterest\u201d with the classes of subjects as numbered 18 \u201cBills of Exchange,\u201d and 20 \u201clegal tender \u201d afford a strong indication that the interest referred to was connected in the mind of the legislature with regulations as to the rate of interest in mercantile transactions and other dealings and contracts between individuals, and not with taxation under municipal institutions and matters incident thereto? The present case does not deal directly or indirectly with matters of contract. The Dominion Act expressly deals with interest on contracts and agreements as the first section conclusively shows. The Chief Justice quotes, apparently with approval, the language of Mr. Justice Johnson in Ross v. Torrance (3) as follows: If they can give the corporation of Montreal, by thus merely changing the name of the thing, a legal right of 10 per cent, in the absence of an agreement between the parties, they can give it to the Bank of Montreal or any other creditor they choose to designate and the plain provisions of the constitution would become a dead letter.\nIn my opinion this is a non sequitur entirely unwarranted; limited as I have suggested no such result could possibly arise.\nBut it is alleged, as I have said, that it conflicts with the subject of interest secured by section 91 to the Dominion Parliament. But as was said in Parsons v. The Citizens Ins Co. ([23]):\u2014\nSections 91 and 92 must be read together and the language of one interpreted, and where necessary modified, by that of the other.\nAnd again:\u2014\nThe true nature and character of the legislation in the particular instance under discussion must always be determined in order to ascertain the class of subjects to which it really belongs.\nIn the present case the legislature was not dealing or professing to deal with the question of interest but was dealing exclusively with taxation under municipal institutions, and the extra tax which the court below has chosen to call interest the legislature has not so denominated, but which the legislature imposed, no doubt, as I said before, as a means of securing payment, and also of approximately equalizing the rate between defaulters and those paying promptly. How can this be considered in any other light than as incidental to the power to levy the assessment as authorized by law, the principal matter of this act being municipal taxation and not interest, and so prevent the defaulter from gaining an undue advantage over the ratepayer who pays promptly? And who more competent to apportion this than the local legislature, and who more incompetent to deal with this purely municipal matter than the Dominion Parliament charged with the affairs affecting the peace, order and good government of the Dominion?\nThe British North America Act having given the power of legislation over direct taxation within the Provinces in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, and over municipal institutions in the Provinces, exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures why should those bodies be restricted or limited as to the manner or extent to which those powers should be exercised? Why should they not be allowed to provide for the contingency of a failure to pay the taxes on the days and times fixed, and to make provision in such an event for an additional rate or tax, so that those failing to pay should be placed as nearly as may be on a footing, with those who have paid promptly, equality being the rule dictated by justice and inherent in the very idea of a tax.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court below.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER JJ. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that section 626 of the Municipal Act imposes an addition of ten per cent, on unpaid taxes once for all and as a penalty. I would allow these appeals.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014These cases all depend upon the construction of section 626 of the Manitoba Municipal Act, 49 Vic. ch. 52, as amended by 50 Vic. ch. 10, and they raise the question whether that section is, or is not, ultra vires of the Provincial legislature. By sections 602 and 603 of 49 Vic. ch. 52 it was enacted that every municipality shall in each year after the final revision of the assessment roll pass a by-law for levying a rate on all the property on the said roll liable to taxation, such rate to be levied equally on all the taxable property in the proportion of its value as determined by the assessment roll in force. Section 625 of 49 Vic. ch 52 as amended by section 42 of 50 Vic. ch. 10 enacts that:\u2014\nThe Council of any municipality may by by-law make the taxes payable by instalments at such times as they may think proper and fix and allow a discount for prompt; payment of such instalments.\nBy section 634 of 49 Vic. ch. 52:\u2014\nThe taxes or rates imposed or levied for any year shall be considered to have been imposed and to be due on and from the first day of January of the then current year, and end with the thirty-first day of December thereof, unless otherwise expressly provided for by the enactment or by-law under which the same are directed to be levied.\nThe words \u201cand end with the 31st day of December thereof \u201d do not seem to have been inserted very aptly or grammatically, but what the section means, I apprehend, is that in whatever period of a year the taxes are in point of fact imposed they shall, for the purposes of the act, be considered to have been imposed and due on the first day of January of that year, but cannot be levied by process of law until after the 31st day of December of that same year.\nThen the 626 section of 49 Vic. ch. 52, as amended by the 43 section of 50 Vic. ch. 10, enacts that:\u2014\nIn cities and towns all parties paying taxes to the Treasurer or Collector before the first day of December, and in rural muncipalities before the thirty-first day of December, in the year they are levied shall be entitled to a reduction of ten per cent, on the same, and all taxes remaining due and unpaid on the first or thirty-first day of December, (as the case may be) shall be payable at par until the first day of March following, at which time a list of all the taxes then remaining unpaid and due shall be prepared by the Treasurer or Collector (as the case may be), and the sum of ten per cent, on the original amount shall be added on all taxes then remaining unpaid, and in cities a rate of \u00be per cent at the end of each month shall added be upon overdue taxes, the same to commence on the first day of January from and after the year in which the rate shall have been levied and accrued due, whether the said taxes are due upon the ordinary collector\u2019s roll or upon any special tax of any nature whatever such as frontage tax for street improvements or any other tax collectable by cities.\nThen section 647 of 49 Vic. ch. 52 enacts that:\u2014\nWhen interest is due and payable on taxes in arrear such interest may be added to the taxes and shall be considered to form part of the taxes so in arrear.\nNow what the municipal authorities did in Lynch v. N. W. Land Co. and in The Municipality of South Dufferin v. Morden, the lands there referred to being in rural municipalities, was this:\u2014To the tax imposed for the year 1886, and which, as we have seen by the act, was declared to have been due on and from the first day of January in that year, they upon the first day of March, 1887, added 10 per cent., and upon the amount ascertained by the addition of these two sums with the tax imposed in 1887 they on the first March, 1888, added other 10 per cent., and so likewise on the first of March, 1889, upon the sum total of all the previous sums added together they added further 10 per cent.\nIn the case of Gibbins v. Barber, the land rated being in the city of Winnipeg, what was done was that to the rate imposed in 1889 they on the first day of January, 1890, and on the first day of each month until and including the month of June, 1890, added \u00be of one per cent. And the question is whether the imposition of these additional sums to the rates imposed by the municipalities was legal; that is to say, whether the sections of the acts purporting to authorize such additions to the imposed rates are intra vires of the Provincial legislature.\nIt becomes necessary, therefore, to inquire under what item of section 92 of the B. N. A. Act the sections objected to are to be ranked. The learned Attorney General of the Province of Manitoba, who was the counsel for the appellant in the Municipality of South Dufferin v. Morden repudiated all idea of the sections being attributed to, and of their having been passed under the authority of, any item other than that which enables the legislature of the Province to make laws in relation to municipal institutions in the Province. Upon the part of all the appellants it was insisted that the additional sums objected to were not and could not be regarded as being interest upon the rates imposed. Concurring with the learned judge, now Chief Justice, of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec in Ross v. Torrance ([24]) I am of opinion that whatever name may be given to the charges they can be regarded in no other light than as sums charged by way of interest at the rate in rural municipalities of ten per cent, per annum for default in payment of the rates imposed within two months after the expiration of the year in which the tax is imposed, and so on at the same rate upon the whole sum from time to time remaining due on the first of March in each year until the land shall be sold for all arrears, thus charging ten per cent, compound interest per annum which is claimed as authorized by the above section 647, and in cities at the rate \u00be of one per cent, per month commencing on the first day of January in the year next following that in which the tax was imposed and fell due, that is to say, by the express terms of the act, on the first day of January of the year in which it was imposed. That this \u00be of one per cent, per month is charged by way of interest upon the rate imposed there can, I apprehend, be no doubt, and I can see nothing in the section to justify the construction that the ten per cent, added once in each year in rural municipalities should be regarded as different in any respect in character from the monthly charge of \u00be of one per cent, in cities, which would seem to have been considered about equivalent to ten per cent, per annum paid in one sum in each year until the land should be sold for the arrears. But that the sums so charged must be regarded as interest is, to my mind, clear from several sections of the original act and of that passed in amendment of it. Upon the completion of the tax roll the rate imposed in each year became a debt due to the municipalities, and by section 623 a notice is required to be immediately served upon each person rated whose residence is known demanding payment of the rate imposed, which notice\u2014\nshall mention the time when such taxes are required to be paid and when the percentages herein mentioned will be allowed and charged.\nThe rate imposed by the municipality is the only sum recoverable as tax; the \u201cpercentage \u201d spoken of in the section is something deducted from or added to the tax as the case may be. Now the section 647 already quoted provides that:\u2014\nWhen interest is due and payable on taxes in arrear such interest may be added to the taxes and shall be considered to form part of the taxes so in arrear.\nThere does not appear to be anything in the act which can come, under the term \u201cinterest \u201d as used in this section unless it be the percentages added as above. Then section 655 of 49 Vic. ch. 52 as amended by section 48 of 50 Vic. ch. 10 enacts that:\u2014\nIf the land when put up for sale will not sell for the full amount of arrears of taxes due and charges the said Treasurer may then and there sell for any sum he can realize, and shall in such case accept such sum as full payment of such arrears of taxes; but the owner of any land so sold shall not be at liberty to redeem the same except upon payment to the Treasurer of the full amount of taxes due together with the expense of sale with a sum equal to ten per centum thereof, and the Treasurer shall account for the amount realized in such cases over and above all charges and the cost of publication, and in the event of redemption as aforesaid to the purchaser for the amount of his purchase money with twenty per centum thereon.\nThe ten per centum which upon redemption is thus added to the sum total of arrears of taxes calculated as directed by section 647, and the costs attending the sale is provided in identical language with that used as to the ten per centum added to the amount of tax imposed in each year, and section 652 clearly shows that this ten per centum added on redemption is interest upon the amount composed of taxes in arrear added to the cost of sale and nothing else, for it enacts that:\u2014\nWhen two or more lots or parcels of land have been assessed together the same may be advertised and sold together, but the owner of any such lot or parcel may redeem the same within the time hereinafter provided upon payment of a proportionate part of the taxes and charges for which the said lots or parcels were sold together with a proportionate part of the interest required to be paid on the redemption of same.\nThen in connection with this section 652 the 667th section provides for redemption of lands sold for nonpayment of arrears of taxes, namely, that the owner, his heirs, &c, may at any time within two years from the date of sale redeem the estate sold by paying or tendering to the treasurer for the use and benefit of the purchaser or his legal representative the sum paid by him, and all sums, if any, paid by the purchaser for taxes thereon since the sale, together with a sum amounting to ten per centum thereof if reedemed at any time within one year, and if not so redeemed within one year then with the addition of a further and additional sum equal to ten per centum thereof, &c. Now these sums of ten per centum so added on redemption, and which are provided for in language similar to the ten per centum added to the rate imposed in each year, if not paid before the first of March in each succeeding year, are what is spoken of in section 652, under the words \u201ca proportionate part of the interest required to be paid in the redemption of same \u201d Then section 672 of 49 Vic. ch. 52 enacts that no deed executed upon a sale for arrears for taxes shall be invalid, for any error or miscalculation in the amount of taxes or interest thereon in arrear. There is nothing in the act to which the word \u201c interest \u201d as here used can apply unless it be to the said percentages added for default in payment of the taxes imposed at the time paid by the act for that purpose in each year.\nThen sec. 53 of 50 Vic. ch. 10 enacts that all patented lands subject to taxation in any rural municipality shall be liable to be disposed of for \u201c taxes, interest and charges \u201d unpaid thereon up to the time of making up the list of lands so in arrears for the then current year which list the treasurer of every rural municipality is required to make as directed in the act. The word \u201cinterest \u201d as here used can apply only to the percentage added for default in payment of the rate imposed in each year within the time specified in the act for that purpose as aforesaid. Then there are the sub-sections of this section which authorize the Government of the Province of Manitoba to become speculator general in the acquisition of all lands in rural municipalities liable to be sold for arrears of taxes.\nSub-sec. 2 requires the list required to be prepared by the Treasurer to be advertised in a prescribed manner once a week for three consecutive weeks within two months preceding a day to be named in the advertisement, which advertisement, sub-sec. 3 provides, shall contain a notification that unless the arrears of taxes and costs are sooner paid the treasurer will proceed to the disposal of the said lands on a day named in the advertisement. Then sub-sec. 4 enacts that when interest is due and payable on taxes in arrear such interest may be added to the taxes and shall be considered as part of the taxes in arrear. Then sub-section 6 enacts that on the day appointed in such notice the treasurer shall transmit a copy of such list authenticated by the seal of the municipality attested by the signature of the reeve, the clerk and treasurer thereof to the Provincial Treasurer with a statutory declaration as to the correct amount of arrears of taxes, interest and costs then remaining due upon each lot or parcel of land mentioned in the list, to which shall be annexed a certificate under the seal of the municipality to the effect, among other things, that the taxes, interest and costs therein mentioned are still due, wherefore the reeve and treasurer of the municipality did grant, bargain and surrender unto Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, to and for the uses of the Province of Manitoba, all these certain parcels of land mentioned in the schedule thereunto annexed, and the sections then declare that such certificate shall have the effect of vesting absolutely all the lands in such schedule in Her Majesty to and for the uses of the Province of Manitoba. Then sub-section 7 enacts that upon the receipt by the Provincial Treasurer of such list, declaration and certificate the municipality shall be entitled to be paid the whole amount of arrears, interest and costs shown therein as still due, owing and unpaid out of the consolidated revenue fund of the province. Then the 54th section provides for the redemption of the several lands mentioned in the list by payment at any time within two years to the Provincial Treasurer of the sum paid by him to the municipality as taxes, interest and costs on such lands respectively, and all sums, if any, paid by the Provincial Treasurer under the act since then, together with a sum amounting to ten per cent, thereof if redeemed within one year, and if not so redeemed then with the addition of a further and additional sum equal to ten per centum thereof. Then the 57 section enacts that:\nIn each year during the two years in which redemption of such lands may be effected as above provided, the Provincial Treasurer may pay out of the consolidated revenue fund of the province to the municipality in which such lands are situate, on the 1st day of May of each year, a sum equivalent to what the taxes, without interest, on said lands would have amounted to had they been held as private property and subject to taxation, and any amount so paid shall be included in the amount payable for the redemption of such lands and interest thereon as hereinbefore provided.\nNow the amount which would have been due on the first of May in each year if the land had been held as private property would have been the tax imposed in the previous year with the ten per centum thereon added on the 1st of March following; this ten per centum is the only sum which can supply the word \u201c interest \u201d as there used, without which the municipality is compelled to accept payment from the Provincial Treasurer under this section, and the word \u201c interest \u201d as used in the last sentence of the section in connection with the words \u201c thereon as hereinbefore provided \u201d can mean nothing else than the sums of ten per centum by the 54th section required to be paid in each of the two years within which the lands may be redeemed. In fine it is, I think, quite clear from the manner in which the word \u201c interest \u201d is used in all of the above sections of the act that the percentages which the act purports to authorize to be added to the original tax imposed in each year if not paid at or be\u00b0 fore the time specified in the act for that purpose can be regarded in no other light than as interest charged for default in payment at the appointed time of the debt incurred by the imposition of the tax in each year. There is nothing in the clause of the British North America Act empowering Provincial legislatures exclusively to make laws relating to municipal institutions which requires the construction that the power assumed is authorized by that section. Municipal institutions as to taxes in arrear are creditors of the ratepayer by whom the tax is due, and if the power assumed exists in the case of municipal institutions in respect of a tax in arrear I can see no reason why it must not exist in the case of all creditors. The courts of the Province of Manitoba have, therefore, in my opinion, rightly held that the attempt to regulate the rate of interest which should be chargeable and recoverable by a particular creditor or a particular class of creditors against a particular debtor or particular class of debtors, for that and nothing else is what the section assailed, in my opinion, professes to do, is a usurpation of a power vested in the Dominion Parliament under the clause of the British North America Act which empowers that parliament to exercise exclusive legislative authority over the subject of interest.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeals in all three of the above cases should be dismissed with costs. The Provincial Legislatures can undoubtedly pass an act authorizing the issue by the Provincial Government of debentures payable with any rate of interest that may be agreed upon between the Government and its creditors or persons advancing money to the Government upon the security of such debentures, for such an act would be in the nature of a contract or legislative affirmation of a contract, and any rate of interest may be made payable by contract inter partes. But that is a case wholly different from the present.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The respondents in these appeals maintain that a certain provision of a statute of Manitoba is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature. The statute is 49 Vic. ch. 52. The 626th section of that statute, as amended by 50 Vic. ch. 10, sec. 43, holds out by way of inducement to the taxpayer to pay his taxes promptly the advantage of a reduction of the assessed amount if paid before a named day, and imposes, for the same reason, an increase on the assessed amount if not paid by another day which is mentioned.\nIf paid before the first day of December in cities and towns, or before the last day of December in rural municipalities, a deduction of ten per cent, is allowed. Between those dates and the first day of the following March the taxes are payable \u201cat par,\u201d which means at the assessed amount. At the first of March a list of all the taxes then remaining unpaid and due is prepared by the treasurer or collector, and ten per cent, is added to the original amount of all taxes remaining unpaid. It is this addendum of ten per cent, that has been held to be unauthorised because it is considered to be interest on the assessed tax, and because \u201c interest \u201d is the designation given by section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, to one of the classes of subjects assigned to the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of Canada, The deduction of ten per cent, is not treated as objectionable. The offence against the constitutional act is discovered only in the added ten per cent., yet it is not at once apparent why one is not as much an encroachment as the other. The Manitoba act regulates the amount payable by each tax payer, according to the time he pays his taxes, in the ratio of 90, 100 and 110. If the computation which raises the 100 to 110 is to be classed with \u201c interest,\u201d as that word is used in article 19 of section 91, I do not see why the computation which raises the 90 to 100, or reduces the 100 to 90, escapes from the same class. It is pretty much the same thing whether you add a percentage and call it interest or deduct a percentage and call it discount. I have no idea that either process, as employed in the adjustment of the amount to be exacted under the enactment in question, is a subject of the class denoted by the word \u201c interest \u201d in article 19.\nWe find that article associated with others numbered from 14 to 21 ([25]), all of which relate to the regulation of the general commercial and financial system of the country at large. No. 19 is ejusdem generis with the others and does not, in my judgment, include the matter of merely provincial concern with which we are now dealing. This is a phase of the subject which it does not appear to me that we are required to consider exhaustively at present. Nor need we definitely decide whether the imposition in question, which is not a percentage accruing de die in diem, but is the same on the second day of March as a year later, or any length of time later, is properly called interest. It is not so called in the section by which it is imposed though it is referred to in some other sections by the name of interest. The use of the word in the Manitoba act as a convenient name for the added percentage, or even as an appropriate name, is, of course, by no means conclusive of the thing so designated being interest within the meaning of that word as used in article 19 of section 91 of the B: N. A. Act. We must see what the thing really is. It is clearly something which the Manitoba taxpayer who does not pay his taxes when due is made liable to pay as an addition to the amount originally assessed against him or his property. It is a direct tax within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, and as such is indisputably within the legislative authority of the Province. B. N. A. Act, 1867, sec. 92, art. 2.\nI agree with the members of the court who have expressed that view and I do not attempt to elaborate it. But the imposition may, not improperly, be regarded as a penalty for enforcing the law relating to municipal taxation, and in that character it comes directly under article 15 of section 92.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nLynch v.

Ritchie C J and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nSale of goods by weight\u2014Contract when perfect\u2014Damage to goods before weighing\u2014Possession retained by vendor, effect of\u2014Depositary\u2014-Arts 1063, 1064, 1235, 4, 1710, 1802 C. G.\nHetd, Per Ritchie C. J., Strong and Fournier JJ., affirming the judgment of the court below that where goods and merchandise are sold by weight the contract of sale is not perfect and the property of the goods remains in the vendor and they are at his risk until they are weighed, or until the buyer is in default to have them weighed; and this is so even where the buyer has made an examination of the goods and rejected such as were not to his satisfaction.\nHeld also Per Ritchie C J Fournier and Taschereau JJ., that where goods are sold by weight and the property remains in the possession of the vendor the vendor becomes in law a depositary, and if the goods while in his possession are damaged through his fault and negligence he cannot bring action for their value\nPer Patterson J. dubitante whether there was sufficient evidence of acceptance in this case to dispense with the writing necessary under art. 1235 C.C. to effect a perfect contract of sale.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in and for the District of Montreal ([2]).\nThis was an action brought by the appellant to recover from the respondent the sum of $9955.49 which he alleged to be the loss tesulting to him on the resale of a certain quantity of cheese damaged after the cheese was at the purchaser's risk. The plaintiff, present appellant, by his declaration alleged that on the 9th of April 1886, he through William Fuller, sold the defendants 1642 boxes of cheese, then stored on Fuller's premises, at 10\u00bd cents a pound, cash on delivery; that defendant selected, examined and set apart the cheeses, ordered a large number to be removed from the second floor to the ground floor and coopered a large number of boxes; that it was agreed that the weights should be tested according to mercantile usage that the price of cheese immediately afterwards fell, and the defendant offered to re-sell the cheese; that the defendant refused to remove or pay for the cheese and was protested on the 25th April, to have the weights tested on the 27th and to remove the cheese before the 29th on \"pain of the sale of the cheese at his risk; that he disregarded the protest and the cheese was tested on the 27th by the City weigher, the sale was advertised and held, and the cheese sold; that after the purchase of the cheese, the portion of it which defendant had caused to be removed to the ground floor of Fuller's warehouse was wet by reason of the flood on the 17th April, the cause being beyond the plaintiff's control, and it became necessary to dry it, and to purchase new boxes; that the plaintiff paid for the handling and re-boxing of the cheese the sum set forth in the declaration the total claim for depreciation in price and money laid out and expended amounting to $2946. 45.\nTo this, the defendant pleaded, besides a general denial, a special plea that there was never any contract but only a proposition to sell the cheese to defendant, he to take delivery at his own time, but the proposition was never carried out and the property never passed; that the cheese was never tested in accordance mercantile usage, and he was never called upon to test it until after it had become damaged that the defendant never had any control ever the cheese; that .whatever agreement there was between the parties did not constitute a complete contract of sale, but a mere agreement to buy; that by law and the universal custom of trade existing between and recognised by all merchants carrying on trade and business in the City of Montreal and elsewhere such agreement to buy could not and did not produce the effect of a complete sale, and could not and did not pass the property in the said cheese to the defendant, but the same, until the completion of the said contract by the doing of all the things above mentioned, remained and was the property of the plaintiff.\nThe plea further says that, consequent on the damage by the flood, the defendant was not hound to carry out the agreement, and denies expressly that he caused the removal of any part of it from the second flat to the ground floor, or caused any part to be coopered, or did an act of ownership.\nThe case was tried in the Superior Court before Torrance J. who gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff. In the Court of Queen's Bench this judgment was reversed, and the plaintiff's action dismissed, Tessier & Boss\u00e9 JJ. dissenting.\nAbbott Q.C. and campbell for appellant.\nThe intention of the parties was to pass the property, and by law the sale of the cheese was perfect and if so the risk of loss was on the respondent. Art. 1474 C. C and arts. 1585 and 1586. C. N. compared Delamarre and Lepoitevin ([3]); Gilmour v. Pupple ([4]); Logan v. Lemesurier ([5]); Campbell on Sales ([6]); and authorities cited by Torrance J. in his judgment in the Superior Court in Ross v. Hannan, ([7]) As to whether the sale had been sufficiently proved the verbal proof which was tendered was sufficient. Munn v. Berger ([8]).\nDoherty Q.C. for respondent.\nThere is in the record no legal evidence whatever of the alleged sale from appellant to respondent.\nAppellant's evidence consists entirely of parol testimony-that of his agent, Mr. Fuller, being the principal,' indeed, almost the sole, evidence relied on as proving the sale.\nNeither is there legal evidence of any such delivery or acceptance as would suffice to take the alleged con-tract out of the operation of the provision of the Statute of Frauds as embodied in the civil code of Lower Canada by article 1235 of that code.\nEven if parol evidence of the contract were admissible that adduced in this cause does not establish the existence of any completed or perfect sale, such as would transfer ownership or place the object sold at the risk of the respondent.\nThat such a sale leaves the goods up to the time of the weighing or testing at the risk of the vendor clearly results from the term of article 1474 C. C. above cited. The sale is not perfect; the property remains in the vendor; the purchaser has no recourse, failing recovery, but his action in damages.\nThat this is both the French and the English law a brief examination of the authors who have written under both systems will clearly demonstrate.\nThat such was the law in France previous to the cod\u00e9 Napol\u00e9on is undoubted. Pothier, Vente ([9]) makes this perfectly clear, and shows, moreover, that the sale now in question is in its nature a sale by weight, and governed by the rule above stated. The commentators on the code Napol\u00e9on, respondent submits, equally support his position. Troplong, Vente ([10]) and following, under article 1585, of the code H Napol\u00e9on, has a very full exposition of the doctrine of the French law upon the subject which bears out perfectly respondent's contention. Marcad\u00e9, on the same article (1585) of the code Napol\u00e9on ([11]) also sustains the pretension of respondent, as does Mourlon ([12]).\nIt is true there exists a divergence of opinion among the authors who have commented on the French code resulting from the apparently limited terms of article 1585 of that code., as to whether or not in such a sale the property does or does not pass to the purchaser before weighing. All, however, are agreed that at all events the goods are up to the time of weighing at the risk of the vendor.\nA third ground which respondent would submit as entitling him to a dismissal of appellant's action is the gross negligence of appellant's s agent who had possession of the cheese and to which is directly attributable the loss resulting from the flood. It is proven that the approach of the flood was known in time to give ample opportunity to put the cheese up stairs in a place of safety. The evidence of Fuller on this subject shows that he knew in time of the approaching flood, but took no precaution what soever to protect the cheese. Had he but had it removed upstairs there would have been no damage. Whether the cheese belonged to respondent or appellant, whether it had been brought down by respondent's orders at a time when no flood was anticipated \u2014 or not, it was clearly the duty of the vendor, as whose agent Fuller held the cheese, to use ordinary prudence in keeping it safe\u2014and the fact that being on the spot and able to prevent it, he willfully neglected to do so, and stood by inactive and saw the damage done, is alone sufficient to justify respondent's refusal to accept and pay for the damaged goods. Appellant in his declaration recognized his obligation to prevent the damage if he could, and alleges that \"he could not prevent it.\" The testimony of his agent in the transaction shows that he could have prevented, but would not.\nCampbell in reply\u2014referred to Aubry et Rau ([13]); and Frigon v. Busselle ([14]).\nSir W.. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The article agreed to be sold in this case was uncertain and indeterminate until the weight of the cheese was determined, and the objectionable cheese separated, and I cannot think that the intention was that the property should pass until the amount secured by the warehouse receipt and the balance of the cash was paid. At any rate, even if the property had passed it was in the possession of the seller as depositary and he was bound to take reasonable care for its preservation, which I think the evidence clearly shows he did not do. In fact he admits that he did nothing towards preserving the property which might have been done had the proper steps been taken. I therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Was of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be affirmed,\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelant demandeur en cour Sup\u00e9rieur r\u00e9clamait par son action $2,955.99 de dommages, lui r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution par l'intim\u00e9 d'un contrat pour I'achat de 1643 bottes de fromage \u00e0 10\u00bd centins la livre. ll all\u00e9guait que la vente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l'interm\u00e9diaire de W. M. Fuller, chez qui elles \u00e9taient en entrep\u00f4t que l'intim\u00e9 les avait choisies et mises \u00e0 part, et ensuite transport\u00e9es du deuxi\u00e8me au premier H \u00e9tage o\u00f9 il les avait fait coopered, r\u00e9parer,\u2014qu'elles devaient \u00eatre pes\u00e9es pour s'assurer de leur exacte pesanteur.\nIl all\u00e9guait encore que par prot\u00eat notari\u00e9, en date du 25 avril ii avait notifi\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 d'avoir \u00e0 faire peser le fromage, le requ\u00e9rant en m\u00eame temps d'en payer le prix et de l'enlever de l'entrep\u00f4t de Fuller, avant le 29 avril \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi il le ferait vendre \u00e0 l'encan public et r\u00e9clamerait la diff\u00e9rence entre le montant que rapporterait cette vente et celui de la vente faite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9; que l'intim\u00e9 ayant refus\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 cette notification, la vente avait eu lieu \u00e0 une perte de $2,995.55, qui'l r\u00e9clamait par son action.\nL'intim\u00e9 plaida \u00e0 cette action qu'il n'y avait pas eu vente du fromage en question, mais de simples pourparlers, que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en \u00e9tait toujours rest\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant; que le fromagen' avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ni pes\u00e9ni d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0l'intim\u00e9; que celui-ci n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure de peser le from age qu'apr\u00e8s l'inondation mentionn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9claration de l'appelant, pendant laquelle le fromage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement endommag\u00e9 et d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9; que s'il y avait eu promesse d'acheter le dit fromage, cette promesse ne constituait pas un contrat de vente,\u2014mais tout an plus;\nAt most an agreement requiring for its completion the doing of certain things.\net sp\u00e9cialement la v\u00e9rification de la quantit\u00e9 et la livraison du fromage; que le fromage \u00e9tant demeur\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appeleant et ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9 par l'inondation, l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 d'en payer le prix.\nIl Y a en une d\u00e9fense en droit partielle dont l'examen n'est pas important pour la d\u00e9cision de la cause.\nLa contestation \u00e9tant li\u00e9e et la preuve faite la cour Sup\u00e9rieure rendit jugement en faveur de l'appelant, mais ce jugement fut plus tard infirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine. C'est ce dernier jugement qui est maintenant soumis \u00e0 la revision de cette cour.\nLa premi\u00e8re objection de l'intim\u00e9 est \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la preuve. Le contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l'appelant est sans doute d'une nature commerciale et la preuve en doit \u00eatre faite conform\u00e9ment aux articles du code civil et sp\u00e9cialement aux articles 1233 \u00e9t 1235. Ii n'y a eu aucun \u00e9crit ou m\u00e9morandum de ce contrat entre les parties. Toute la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par les t\u00e9moins et plus particuli\u00e8rement par Fuller, l'agent de l'appelant. Il n'y a pas en non plus de commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, bien que l'intim\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin de l'appelant. Les seules questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites out rapport \u00e0 l'agence de William Hannan avec qui Fuller a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 cette vente. L'intim\u00e9 a admis cette agence. Mais en prenant la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite comme \u00e9tant-l\u00e9gale cette preuve \u00e9tablit-elle une vente parfaite transf\u00e9rant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose vendue \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 et la mettant \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils ? Telle est la seule question que pr\u00e9sente cette cause.\nLa preuve de l'appelant consiste dans le t\u00e9moignage de Fuller qui d\u00e9clare que William Hannan, agissant pour l'intim\u00e9, convint d'acheter 1643 boites de fromage de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de 10\u00bd cts la livre, le fromage devant \u00eatre pes\u00bd et le montant du prix \u00e9tabli avant la livraison. C'est une vente de choses mobili\u00e8res faite an poids suivant l'article 1474 du code civil qui dit:-\nLorsque des choses mobili\u00e8res sont vendues an poids, an compte ou \u00e0 la mesure, et non en bloc, la vente n'est parfaite que lorsqu'elles out \u00e9te pestes, compt\u00e9es ou mesur\u00e9es.\nEn prenant la version de la convention donn\u00e9e par Fuller il s'agirait de la vente d'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de fromage avec la condition que le poids en serait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 (tested). Une telle vente ne peut \u00e9tre parfaite qu'apr\u00e8s que les choses vendues out \u00e9t\u00e9 pes\u00e9es et le montant de la vente \u00e9tabli; la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 demeure an vendeur, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de livraison l'acheteur n'a que son recours en dommages. Notre article 1474 declare qu'une ' telle vente n'est pas parfaite, adoptant la doctrine de Pothier, de Marcad\u00e9 et Troplong, qui sont les auteurs cites par les codificateurs sur cet article\nLa r\u00e8gle est la m\u00eame dans le droit anglais. Lord Blackburn dans son trait\u00e9 du contrat de vente la formule ainsi ([15])\nThe second [rule] is that where anything remains to be done to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price as by weighing, measuring or testing the goods where the price is to depend on the quantitv or quality of the goods, the performance of these things, also, shall be a condition precedent to the transfer of the property, although the individual goods be ascertained, and they are in the state in which they ought to be accepted. (After discussing ti is rule he declares it to be firmly established as English law as having been adopted directly from the civil law.)\nIl cite nombre de causes au soutien de cette doctrine et entre autres celle de Logan v. Lemesurier ([16]) de Qu\u00e9bec d\u00e9cid\u00e9e au conseil priv\u00e9, comme directement applicable. Benjamin ([17]), approuve la r\u00e8gle d\u00e9finie par Lord\nBlackburn et cite nombre de d\u00e9cisions qui l'ont confirm\u00e9e.\nAinsi la vente, telle qu'al\u00e9gu\u00e9e n'a pas en l'effet de transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la chose vendue \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ni de la mettre a ses risques et p\u00e9rils jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pes\u00e9e. Avant que cela n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et avant m\u00eame aucune d\u00e9marche de l'appelant pour mettre l'intime en demeure de le faire l'inondation envahit l'entrep\u00f4t o\u00f9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le fromage et l'endommagea.\nL'appelant p\u00e9rtend que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait alors en d\u00e9faut de ne pas avoir pris livraison du fromage. C'est sur ce fait que le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieur est fond\u00e9 mais la cour du Bane de la Reine d\u00e9clare que c'est \u00e9videmment une erreur de fait. Fuller admet dans son t\u00e9moignage que l'intim\u00e9 avait jusqu'au 26 d'avril pour enlever le fromage. L'autre partie \u00e0 ' la n\u00e9gociation dit que Hannan avait deux semaines \u00e0 compter due avril. L'inondation qui a caus\u00e9le dommage a en lieu le 17 avril et ce n'est que le 24 du m\u00eame mois que l'appelant a somm\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 de prendre le fromage et m\u00eame une plus grande quantit\u00e9 que celle vendue.\nL'appelant pretend faire ressortir la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 des faits que quelques-uns de ses employ\u00e9s out aide \u00e0 cooper, r\u00e9parer les boites de fromage, et \u00e0 les descendre dans le premier \u00e9tage du magasin. L'appelant pretend au contraire qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 coopered par les employ\u00e9s de l'appelant, mais que Wilson, ami intime de Fuller qui \u00e9tait alors malade, a surveill\u00e9 l'ouvrage pour ce dernier, et lui \u00e9pargner du trouble.\nLa circonstance que le fromage a \u00e9t\u00e9 descendu du premier \u00e9tage n'a aucune importance; ii est prouv\u00e9 que le fromage \u00e9tait entass\u00e9 de telle mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de l'examiner, ni de r\u00e9parer les caisses La chose a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sous l'ordre de Wilson qui repr\u00e9sentait 1 intime.\nL'intim\u00e9 avait aussi plaid\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait un usage bien \u00e9tabli dans le commerce de fromage que la vente n'en \u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8te, et ne transf\u00e9rait pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avant la v\u00e9rification de la quantit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9paration des boites; quoique la d\u00e9fense en droit faite \u00e0 cette partie du plaidoyer ait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e,\u2014l'enqu\u00eate ayant en lien devant un autre juge,Ila permission d'en faire la preuve en a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Cependant cette question se trouve sans importance maintenant, attendu qu'il n'y a pas en vente.\nUn autre moyen que l'intim\u00e9 pent invoquer contre l'action de l'appelant c'est la n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re de son agent qui \u00e9tait en possession du fromage. Ii est prouv\u00e9 que l'inondation n'est pas venue subitement et qu'il a en amplement le temps de mettre le fromage en s\u00fbret\u00e9. Fuller lui-m\u00eame dit qu'il a eu connaissance du progr\u00e9s de l'inondation. S'il eut seulement fait remonter le fromage en haut, il e\u00fbt \u00e9vit\u00e9 tout dommage. Dans tous les cas, que le fromage appartienne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 on \u00e0 l'appelant, qu'il sit \u00e9t\u00e9 descendu on non, par l'ordre de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 un temps o\u00f9 il n'y avait pas encore apparence d'inondation, ii \u00e9tait indubitablement du devoir du vendeur dont Fuller \u00e9tait l'agent d'user de la prudence ordinaire pour la conservation du fromage, et le fait qu'\u00e9tant sur les lieux et \u00e0 port\u00e9e de le sauver, il a volontairement refus\u00e9 de le faire et est demeur\u00e9 tranquille spectateur du dommage, est suffisant pour justifier l'intim\u00e9 de refuser d'accepter le fromage endommag\u00e9. L'appelant a reconnu dans son action qu'il \u00e9tait oblige de pr\u00e9venir le dommage s'il \u00e9tait en son pouvoir de le faire. Le t\u00e9moignage de son agent fait voir qu'il aurait Pu l'emp\u00eacher, mais qu'il ne l'a pas voulu.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014[His Lordship after stating the effect of the pleadings as hereinbefore given proceeds as follows:]\nAssuming as the appellant contended that the sale was perfect to the fullest extent, and that the ownership had passed to the defendant, yet I do not see how he can maintain his action. The vendor who agrees to retain the possession of moveable goods till the vendee is ready to take them is a depositary and as such bound to apply in the keeping of the thing deposited the care of a prudent administrator. 1802 C.

N..\nNow it is proved clearly here that, if Fuller for the plaintiff had acted as a prudent administrator, to use the terms of the code, this cheese would not have been damaged by the flood. Fuller admits it,\nQ. On what day was it that the water rose in your store?\nA. It was on Saturday I think.\nQ. For a day or two previous this water had been rising towards your store?\nA. Of course it was setting back, some water was coming into the street.\nQ. You were aware of that ?\nA I could not be otherwise, sir.\nQ. And you took no steps to remove the cheese ?\nA. I had nothing to do with it, I had no right to lay a hand on it.\nQ. You took no precautions whatever ?\nA. I had nothing to do with it, as I said before, Mr. Hannan knew where the cheeses were.\nQ. You were in the store on that flat, on that Saturday?\nA. I was untll I had to get a Grand Trunk team to take me out.\nHe never notified Hannan that the cheese was in danger.\nOliver in his examination, says \u2014\nQ Do you recollect the circumstance of that flood occurring?\nA. I do, sir.\nQ. Did the water rise or give indication of rising a sufficient time previous to its actually coming into Mr. Fuller's store, to enable him if he had used prudence to remove any goods that were on the lower floor?\nA. I think there would have been time for a man to put the pile of cheese up higher, to raise it up to the next flat.\nQ. You consider that ail ordinarily prudent man would have done that?\nA.

Voulez-vous dire si les indications de cette inondation n'\u00e9tait pas telles le Samedi qu'un homme,. usant de la prudence ordinaire aurait enlev\u00e9 des- marchandises qui se seraient trouv\u00e9es au premier \u00e9tage?\nR. Pas avant le Samedi.\nQ. Mais le Samedi?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Croyez-vous que si Mr. Fuller avait employ\u00e9 la diligence ordinaire il aurait Pu transport\u00e9 le fromage en question du bas en haut et le placer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter l'inondation ?\n(Object\u00e9 \u00e0 cette question comme ill\u00e9gale. Objection maintenue.)\nA rather extraordinary ruling.\nIt does not make the least diff\u00e9rence that this cheese was in Fuller's actual possesion and not in appellant's. The case must be determined as if Fuller was out of the question\u2014as if that store where the cheese was had been appellant's own store. So that even if the sale is to be considered perfect on the 16th, the appellant having agreed to keep these goods for the respondent, in law he became a depositary.\nNothing turns on the fact that Hannan or appellant brought them down to the lower flat. It is evident that it was done by both parties It had to be done for the cooperage and taking of weights, but even if it was Hannan who had brought them down, yet, they remained in appellant's possession, who would not allow Hannan to take possession and remove them till payment.\nI am of opinion that this appeal should he dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014i have given to this case a full and careful consideration without being able to feel as clear as I should desire upon all the questions that - have been raised. This does not arise so much from the uncertainty in which some questions of law which have been debated would seem to be involved as from the difficulty of forming a sufficiently distinct opinion upon the facts. In the result I am unable to say that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is in my opinion erroneous.\nThe acts done on the part of the purchaser in handling the goods, inspecting them, rejecting some and approving of others, are in themselves strong evidence of acceptance of the goods; but on the other hand there are the facts that there was no delivery to him, and no intention of giving him control of any part of the goods until the price was ascertained and paid, or at least enough paid to recoup the advance for which the goods were held under a warehouse receipt. On this account I hesitate to say that the writing which is required by article 1235 C.C., unless the buyer has accepted or received part of the goods, or given something in earnest to bind the bargain, was dispensed with.\nThe acts done in the warehouse of Mr. Fuller in the examination of the cheese, whether the removal of the boxes from the upper floor to the lower for the convenience of handling them were done by the servants of the \"purchaser with the consent of the vendor, or by the vendor for the ' convenience of the purchaser, do not strike me, having regard to all the circumstances as proving delivery or acceptance, or as necessarily amounting to more than steps which might reasonably be taken as preliminary to the delivery and acceptance that would change the property from the one man to the other.\nThe discussion respecting the nature of the sale, whether a sale by weight, number, or measure, or a sale in the lump within the meaning of those terms as used in article 1474 is in this view of the question of delivery and acceptance, somewhat irrelevant, or at all events the subject of the necessity for finally ascertaining the price by settling the exact number of pounds of cheese, is not reached. The authority of Pothier ([21]) and other writers referred to by the respondent would certainly put a sale of an entire lot at so much a pound on the same footing as a sale at so much a pound of so many pounds out of a larger bulk, as opposed to a sale per aversionem or en bloc. I do not find it easy to grasp the principle on which that doctrine rests, and there may be good ground for the appellant's contention against its being accepted as being now the law, but the present case scarcely calls for a determination of the question.\nIt has been argued that even if the property passed, yet it remained until the final delivery, which was postponed to a day that had not arrived when the flood occurred, at the risk of the vendor. In the Superior Court where the judgment was in favor of the vendor it was considered that from the 15th which was before the flood, and which was the day on which, as at first arranged, the goods were to have been paid for and removed, the goods remained in the warehouse at the request and for the convenience of the purchaser, and that the vendor was for that reason relieved from responsibility for the damage caused by the water. I am not able to take that view. I think that the completion which was to have been effected on the 15th was deferred, at the request, no doubt, of the purchaser, but still it was the completion of the sale that was deferred. I notice this topic because I do not assent to the proposition that, assuming the property to have passed, the negligence of the vendor, who had thus become bailee for the purchaser, would afford an answer to the action. His liability as bailee would be limited to the damage actually sustained by the cheese, which was very trifling, plus the cost of drying and. re-boxing those that had been wet. The incident would not have justified the purchaser (who ex hypothesi had become the owner,) in refusing to take his property. The authorities referred to on the subject, including the passages cited from Pothier, which are found under the heading \"Aux risques de qui est la chose vendue,\" are more applicable when the thing sold has been wholly destroyed' or lost than when it has only been damaged.\nIt is manifest that the question on which the case must turn is: Was there a change of property from the vendor to the purchaser ? If there was such a change it must have been effected by a delivery and acceptance. If there was not a delivery and acceptance then inasmuch as there was no payment in earnest, and no writing, there was no contract to support an action for refusing to accept and pay for the goods.\nI agree in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Abbotts, campbell & Meredith\nSolicitors for respondent: Doherty & Doherty.\n[1] M.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nReceipt\u2014Error\u2014Parol evidence\u2014Arts. 14, 1234 C.C.\nS. brought an action to compel V. to render an account of the sum of $2,500, which S. alleged had been paid on the 6th October, 1885, to be applied to S.'s first promissory notes maturing and in acknowledgment of which V.'s book-keeper gave the following receipt: \"Montreal, October 6th 1885. Received from Mr. D. S. the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars to be applied to his first notes maturing. M.V., per F.L.\" and which V. failed and neglected to apply. Y. pleaded that he never got the $2,500 and that the receipt was given in error and by mistake by his clerk. After documentary and parol evidence had been given the Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, dismissed S.'s action.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, 1. That the finding of the two courts on the question of fact as to whether the receipt had been given through error should not be interfered with.\n2. That the prohibition of Art. 1234 C. C. against the admission of parol evidence to contradict or vary a written instrument, is not d'ordre public, and that if such evidence is admitted without objection at the trial it cannot subsequently be set aside in a court of appeal.\n3. That parol evidence in commercial matters is admissible against a written document to prove error. \u01fctna Insurance Company v. Brodie, (5 Can. S.C.R. 1), followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada (appeal side), ([1]), confirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the action of the appellant was dismissed with costs.\nThe action was brought by the appellant to compel the respondent to render an account of the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars, which appellant alleged he paid to the respondent, and in default of rendering the said account that the respondent be condemned to pay this sum of money to appellant with interest.\nThe receipt upon which the action was based reads as follows:\n\"MONTREAL, October 6th, 1885.\n\" Received from Mr. D. Schwersenski the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), to be ap- plied to his first notes maturing.\n\"$2,500.00.\n\u2018M. VINEBERG,\n\"Per F. L.\"\nAt the trial the appellant's books of account were produced as well as a judicial abandonment made by the plaintiff in January 1886, and by such abandonment it appeared that the respondent was entered as his creditor for the sum of $5,300, and after hearing the witnesses the Superior Court found as a matter of fact that the sum of $2,500 for which the receipt had been given had not been paid to respondent and dismissed the plaintiff's action. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nJ. P. Cooke for appellant contended that the evidence did not support the finding of the courts below, and that the parol evidence admitted to contradict the receipt was illegal; art. 1234 C. C.; Bell v. Arnton ([2]); and also cited and relied on the fol-lowing authorities: Chamberlain v. Ball ([3]); West v. Fleck ([4]); Lemontais v. Amos ([5]); Dominion Oil Cloth Co. v. Martin ([6]); Ulster Spinning Co. v. Foster ([7]); Anderson v. Battis ([8]); Lynn v. Cochrane & Nivin ([9]); Leduc v. Prevost ([10]); Rousseau v. Erans ([11]); Decelles v. Samoisetle ([12]); Gilchrist v. Lachaud ([13]); Rowell v. Newton ([14]). Ordinance of 1667, table 20, art. 2; article 1341 C. N.; Taylor on Evidence ([15]).\nHutchinson for respondent contended that the parol evidence was admissible: Brodie v. \u01fctna Insurance Co. ([16]); Whitney v. Clark ([17]); Grenier v. Pothier ([18]). If so the courts below having found as a fact that the receipt had been given in error the appeal should be dismissed\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014For the reasons assigned in the consid\u00e9rants of the judge of the Superior Court I think this appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment of the Superior Court affirmed with costs in all the courts.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER JJ. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The plaintiff, appellant, claims from the respondent a sum of $2,500 upon a receipt for that amount dated October 6 1885, which sum, as the appellant alleges, the respondent failed to apply as agreed upon. The respondent pleads that this receipt was given through error, and that he never received the $2,500 from the appellant. The judge of the Superior Court who heard the witnesses viv\u00fb voce held that the respondent had clearly proved his plea and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal confirmed that judgment. Now, the appellant asks us to reverse on that question of fact. We intimated at the hearing that not only could we not see in this case anything to take it out of the well settled rule of this court on appeals on questions of fact, but that the evidence that this receipt had been given through error seemed to us overwhelming. The appellant then contended for the first time that parol evidence against this receipt had been illegally admitted. He never objected to the evi-deuce at the trial, and never even mentioned the point in the Court of Appeal. Now, in France, an objection of this nature cannot be taken for the first time in the Cour de Cassation ([19]). And why ? Because the objection is not based on a law of public order. The weight of authority seems to be now that the prohibition of article 1284 C. C. against the admission of parol evidence to contradict or vary a valid written instrument is not d'ordre public, and that, consequently if such evidence is admitted without objection the party to whom it is opposed cannot subsequently impeach its legality. Article 14 C. C. which enacts that prohibition laws import nullity does not alter the question, or rather is nothing but the same question, whether it is a nullil\u00e9 d'ordre pub-lic, or a nullil\u00e9 relative only, or one which can be waived or not ([20]). The authorities pro and con are collected in Sirey's Codes annot\u00e9s, under art. 1341, Nos. 4 & 5, and an arr\u00eat of the Cour de Cassation ([21]). However, independently of this consideration the appellant's contention is untenable. According to the case of \u01fctna Life v. Brodie ([22]), and in this court ([23]) it is settled law that the evidence now objected to here by the appellant was perfectly legal and rightly admitted, and that in commercial matters parol evidence can be adduced to prove error in a written instrument. How far this rule as to proof of error in writing can be extended to noncommercial matters as falling within the cases in which the party claiming could not procure proof in writing, we have not here to consider.\nPatterson J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

There was, in my opinion, ample evidence to show that after the fire the defendant's wall was in a dangerous condition, and that the defendant, though notified of the fact, neglected to take any reasonable precautions, or in fact any precautions at all, to secure or support the wall or to take it down so as to prevent it falling and injuring his neighbors, but on the contrary allowed his wall to remain in this dangerous state (though there was ample time to have it made safe by adopting one or other of the courses suggested) until it was blown down and fell on the house of the plaintiff, whereby he sustained large damages. In my opinion the decision of the judge of first instance, confirmed as it has been by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should not be disturbed but should be confirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs in all the courts.\nSTRONG J.-I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFournier J.\u2014Le present appel esfinterjet\u00e8 d'un jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine si\u00e8geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e8al confirmant unjugement de la cour Sup\u00e8rieuee qui avait condamn\u00e8. l'appelant \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, la somme de $2,638577 de dommages, caus\u00e9s dans les circonstances suivantes:\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant connue sons le nom de Nordheimer Hall, situ\u00e8e, rue Saint-Jacques, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, fut incendi\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e8cembre 1886.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e8 ouest, adjoignant le \" Nordheimier Hall,\" appartenait \u00e0 Made. Campbell, (Dame Margaret Hutchison), et \u00e8tait occup\u00e8e depuis plusieurs ann\u00e8es par l'intim\u00e9 comme restaurant et boutique de confiserie. Cette b\u00e2tisse avait une trentaine de pieds de hauteur, l'autre en avait soixante. Le mur de division des deux b\u00e2tisses \u00e8tait mitoyen jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de la maison de l'intim\u00e9. Sur ce mur mitoyen l'appelant avait construit un mar d'environ trente pieds qui \u00e8tait sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive.\nLe 24 d\u00e8cembre 1886, environ une semaine apr\u00e8s l'incendie une partie de ce dernier mur s'\u00e9crouaa et tomba sur cette partie de la b\u00e2tisse occup\u00e8e par l'intim\u00e9 comme restaurant et salle \u00e0 diner. bes meubles, la vaisselle, ustensiles de cuisine et autres effets aussi bien que le fond de commerce de l'intim\u00e9 en biscuits, confiseries, etc, furent ou compl\u00e8tement d\u00e8truits ou consid\u00e8rablement endommag\u00e8s par Ia chute du mur.

L'intime a souffert en outre des dommages consid\u00e9rables par la suspension de son commerce, et par la perte d'un grand nombre de ses habitu\u00e9s.\nMadame Campbell avait aussi \u00e8t\u00e8 poursuivie, sous l'impression qu'elle \u00e8tait propri\u00e8taire conjointe de la partie du mur \u00e8croul\u00e8, mais la preuve ayant \u00e8tabli que cette partie du mur \u00e8tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e8 exclusive de l'appelant, l'action fut renvoy\u00e8e quant \u00e0 elle. Il n'y a pas d'appel quant \u00e0 elle; la contestation est maintenant limit\u00e9e entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9.\nLaappelant a plaid\u00e9 que l'accident avait \u00e8t\u00e8 icaue\u00e9 par la force majeure sur laquelle il n'avait aucun contr\u00f4le, que le mur avait \u00e8t\u00e8 bien construit et que m\u00e8me apr\u00e8s le feu ii \u00e8tait en bon \u00e8tat et nullement en danger de tomber, mais que dans la nuit du 24 d\u00e8cembre, un changement subit de temperature \u00e8tait survenu et une temp\u00eate s'\u00e9tant \u00e8lev\u00e8e tout \u00e0 coup fit tomber une partie du mur. Il al l\u00e8gue aussi qu'il n'a pas \u00e8t\u00e8 notifi\u00e9 que le mur \u00e8tait dans un \u00e8tat dangereux, ni requis de le d\u00e8molir, que l'avis qu'il a recu de l'inspecteur de la cite n'avait rapport qu'\u00e0 d'autres murs de la b\u00e2tisse.\nL'intim\u00e8 a ni\u00e9' que l'accident avait \u00e8t\u00e8 cause par force majeure et cas fortuit; que les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e8s ne constituaient pas un cas de force majeure; que lors m\u00eame que l'appelant n'avait pas \u00e8t\u00e8 notifi\u00e9, ii n'en serait pas moins responsable du dommage cause par son fait de sa n\u00e8gligence.\nLes questions soulev\u00e9es par la contesaation se r\u00e8sument ainsi i\u20141\u00b0 Le mur \u00e8tait-il dans Un \u00e8tat dangereux apr\u00e8s le feu; 2\u00b0 l'appelant a-t-il recu avis et a-t-il \u00e8t\u00e8 mis en demeure de le d\u00e8molir et un tel avis \u00e9tait-il n\u00e8cessaire; 3\u00b0 l'accident a-t-il \u00e8t\u00e8 cause par force majeure?\nLe mur de division des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s n'avait que vingt pouces \u00e0 sa base seize an centre et douze an haut C'\u00e9tait \u00e0 peine suffisant, mais taut que les diff\u00e9reness murs \u00e8taient relies ensembee pour former le corps de la b\u00e2tisse, il n'y avait pas alors grand danger \u00e0 redouter. Mais ii n'en \u00e8tait plus de m\u00e8me apr\u00e8s le feu. Les trente pieds construits andessus de la partie mitoyenne du mur furent laiss\u00e8s sans aucun appui tous les poutres et liens qui servaient \u00e0 le retenir avaient \u00e8t\u00e8 d\u00e8truits par le feu; il penchait du hant et avait \u00e8t\u00e8 consid\u00e8rablement endommag\u00e9 par la chaleur, et on y voyait de grandes fissures.\nLa preuve \u00e8tablit que le mur \u00e8tait dans un \u00e8tat dangereux et aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e8moli, ou au moins \u00e8tan-conn\u00e8 afin d'\u00e9virer l'accident.\nL'inspecteur de la cite, M. L. Lacroix d\u00e8crit ainsi l'\u00e9tat du mur.\nR. Tout le mur n'est pas tomb\u00e8. Il y a une certaine hauteur qui est tomb\u00e9e, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s quinze ou dix-huit pieds de hauteur, sans mesure precise. Le mur me para\u00eet avoir pli\u00e9 au centre, et le pied du mur est tomb\u00e8 d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, et la partie sup\u00e8rieure de l'autre c\u03cct\u00e9, et c'est la base de la partie qui est tomb\u00e9e qui a effondre la b\u00e2tisse Hutchison.\nQ. A quelle hauteur au-dessus de la maison Hutchison le mur est-il tomb\u00e9?\nR. A une vingtaine de pieds.\nQ. De sorte qu'il est tomb\u00e8 un exc\u00e8dant d'une vingtaine de pieds au-dessus?\nR. Une vingtaine de pieds au-dessus de la maison. La partie du mur qui est tomb\u00e8e tait bien plus mince que la partie qui est rest\u00e9e, et c'est cette partie-l\u00e0 que je demandais de faire d\u00e8molir. Je craignais dans cette ligne-l\u00e0.\nQ. Jusqu'\u00e0 l'instant o\u00f9 le mur est tomb\u00e8, il y avait urgence de d\u00e8molir ce mur-l\u00e0, ou de l'etan\u00e7onner. ou de prendre les precautions n\u00e8cessaires pour l'emp\u00eacher de tomber, n'est-ce pas?\nR. Certainement\nR. Et \u00e0 votre connaissanee on n'a pris aucune pr\u00e8caution pour l'emp\u00eacher de tomber, n'est-ce pas?\nR. On n'a rien fait.\nR, Lorsuee le feu a eu lieu, il faisait un froid tr\u00e8s s\u00e8v\u00e8re, une quantit\u00e9 \u00e8norme d'eau avait \u00e8t\u00e8 jet\u00e9e sur ces murs et les avait plus ou moins congel\u00e8s. Les boss de liaison dans le mur \u00e8taient br\u00fbl\u00e9s, ce qui laissait une bien mo indre \u00e8paisseur de brique pour soutenir ce mur. Cela r\u00e9uni \u00e0 la crainee d'un d\u00e9gel possible chose qui est arriv\u00e9e le vingt-quatre, me faisait craindre certainement pour ce mur-l\u00e0, dans n'importe quelle condition de temps ou de temp\u00e9rature o\u00f9 on pouvait se trouver.\nQ. Il' y avait dons les murs de cette maison-l\u00e0 des bois de liaison? R. Oui, il y avait des boss de liaison de 4 pouces d'\u00e9paisseur sur toute la longueur du mur.\nQ. Etait-il tout br\u00fbl\u00e9?\nR. Il \u00e8tait tout plus ou moins calcin\u00e9.\nQ. En sorte qu'il n'y avait aucuee solidit\u00e8 dans le mur?\nR. Ii n'y avait rien pour le retenir dans un cas fortuit, par exemple, dans un coup de vent.\nPar le juge:\u2014\nQ. Il n'y avait rien pour retenfr le mur?\nR. Non, le mur avait une profondeur d'une centaine de pieds et il n'y avait plus rien pour le retenir.\n[Mr. Fowler, an architect, a witness for the appellant, says as to the condition of that wall:]\nQ. Mr. Fowler, would the mere height of the wall be in any way dangerous?\nA. No doubt it would.\nQ. Do you mean to say that it would be likely to fall without any extraordinary reason, or would it merely be that the height of the wall would make it more dangerous in case of a high wind?\nA. In case of a high wind, the height of the wall would make it more dangerous.\nQ. And you made up your mind, the three of you together (viz.:\u2014 The three experts appointed by the Insurances and Nordheimer) that the wall required to be demolished?\nA. Yes, it required to be demolished.\nQ. On account of the damage caused to it by the fire?\nA. Yes, by the fire.\nQ. And still, you said just now that you did not see any immediate danger?\nA. No.\nQ. But you saw apparent danger on account of this crack in this twelve-inch wall?\nA. The wall stood alone, without any support.\nQ. On either side?\nA. On either side. Of course, it was in danger of falling in case of a high wind.\nA. The portion of that wall which we measured and the thickness of which I have given had to be taken down.\nQ. In order to rebuild?\nA Yes in order to rebuild Q.\nBut not because it was in danger? A. Yes, in the course of time there would be danger.\nQ. Do you think that it would have been a wise precaution to have braced this wall, to stop it from falling after the fire?\nA. If it had been under my care I think I would, have done so.\nQ. It would only have been the ordinary precaution to be taken for such a high wall?\nA. Yes.\nAnd in re-examination he says further:\u2014\nQ. Now, you say that if you had had charge of that wall, you would have ordered it to be taken down?\nA. I would have braced it, or done something to prevent such an accident.\nLe t\u00e8moin Roberts dit:\u2014\nQ. By the Court\u2014was it possible from the time of the fire to the time of the falling of the wall, assuming that it had been in a dangerous position, to put it in a safe condition?\nA. It was possible to put it in a safer condition, I mean, because I consider that it was safe.\nQ. You speak after the time of the fire?\nA. From the time of the fire on the eighteenth.\nCes extraits de la preuve suffisent \u00e0 faire voir que le feu avait mis le mur dans un \u00e8tat extr\u00e8mement dangereux. L'appelant n'ignorait pas le danger, et c'\u00e9tait une grossi\u00e8re negligence de sa part de laisser ce mur dans un tel \u00e8tat de ruine sans prendee aucune des pr\u00e9-cautions n\u00e8cessaires pour pr\u00e8venir un accident. Cela suffit pour rendre l'appelant responsable des cons\u00e8-quences de l'accident d'apr\u00e8s l'article 1053 du code civil.\nUne trop grande importance a \u00e8t\u00e8 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de savoir si avis de d\u00e8molir avait \u00e8t\u00e8 donn\u00e8 \u00e0 l'appelant car cet avis n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire dans le cas actuel pour le rendre responsable. Mais il n'est pas inutile toutefois d'\u00e9tablir la v\u00e8rit\u00e8 \u00e0 ce sujet.\nL'intim\u00e9 ayant \u00e8crit \u00e0 l'inspecteur de Ia cit\u00e8 pour savoir si les murs incendi\u00e9s \u00e8taient dans un \u00e8tat dangereux, celui-ci en fit la visite et donna \u00e0 l'agent de l'appelant avis, le 20 d\u00c9cembre 1886, quatre jours avant l'\u00e9croulement du mur l'avis par \u00e8crit que l'on trouve \u00e0 la page au dossier d.avoir \u00e0 d\u00e8molir immediate-ment le mur de division (celui qui s'est \u00e9croul\u00e9) et une partie de celui de Fortification Lane\nM. Saffrey, l'agent de l'appelant, a pr\u00e8tendu que Lacroix dans sa visite, le matin du 20, lui a indique comme \u00e8tant dangereux et devant \u00eatre d\u00e8moli, le mur de derri\u00e8re sur la Fortification Lane et le mur du centre de la b\u00e2tisse, parall\u00e8le \u00e0 la rue Saint-Jacques. Ce dernier mur \u00e8tant \u00e0 50 pieds en arri\u00e8re du front de la rue ii est \u00e8vident qu'il se trompe et qu'il n'a pas compris Lacroix qui, au contraire, jure positivement que les murs dont ii a ordonn\u00e9 la demoltiion sont les murs de division entre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des parties et celui de Fortification Lane. Il ajoute que ce sont les seuls qu'il avait le pouvoir de faire d\u00e9molir pour la protection du public. Il dit aussi avoir conseill\u00e9 la demolition du mur central dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la s\u00fbret\u00e8 des ouvriers mais qu'il ne pouvait donner d'ordre officiel quant \u00e0 ce mur.\nDe ces deux versions, il est clair que celle de Lacroix qui est tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e8sint\u00e8ress\u00e8 et n'appara\u00eet dans cette affaire qu'en qualit\u00e9 d'officier public, doit \u00eatre accep\u00e8e. D'ailleurs elle est conforme \u00e0 l'avis par \u00e8crit qui indique positivement le mur de division et celui de Fortification Lane comme les deux qui doivent \u00eatre d\u00e8molis. Il est evident que l'avis n'a pas rapport au mur du centre qui ne pouvait pas \u00e8tre d\u00e9crit comme le mur de division \u00e0 partir de la rue Saint-Jacques. Saffrey reconna\u00eet que l'avis se rapporte au mur en question, mais qu'il ne s'accorde pas avec les instructions verbales de Lacroix. Il est evident qu'il se trompe, et ii ne pent pas y avoir de doute que l'appelant a re\u00e7u avis de d\u00e8molir non seulement verbalement mais aussi par \u00e8crit et dans un temps suffisant pour pr\u00e8venir l'accident s'il se fut conform\u00e8 \u00e0 l'avis.\nD'ailleurs cette difference entre l'avis par \u00e8crit et les instructions verbales, m\u00eame si elle existait, ne pourrait aucunement exon\u00e8rer l'appelant de sa responsabilit\u00e9. Ind\u00e8pendamment de tout avis, l'appelant \u00e8tait oblig\u00e8 de maintenir son mur en bon \u0141tat, et aucune mise en demeure n'\u00e9tait n\u00e8cessaire pour le rendre responsable des consequences de sa negligence. Les obligations de l'appelant r\u00e8sultent du droit civil voir Sourdat de la Responsabilit\u00e8 ([18]).\nLe voisin menac\u00e8 de la chute du b\u00e2timent peut se borner \u00e0 faire, par acte extra judiciaire, sommation au propri\u00e8taire d'avoir \u00e0 reparer on d\u00e8molir.\nCet avertisement n'est point n\u00e8cessaire, sans doute, pour engager la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire. Si sa maison s'\u00e9croule, l'article 1386 l'oblige sans distinction \u00e0 indemniser les tiers du dommage qui en r\u00e8sulte pour eux. C'\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui de veiller \u00e0 la conservation de sa chose. Mais un pareil acte peut produire d'utiles effets et lever plusieurs difficult\u00e9s. Il met le propri\u00e9taire en demeure et rend sa faute inexcusable. Il l'emp\u00eache de pr\u00e8texter cause d' ignorance; il donne lieu de presumer fortement que les degradations d\u00e8 l'\u00e9difice sont la v\u00e9ritabee cauee de sa ruine, puisqee ces degradations \u00e8taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 telles que les voisins s'en \u00e8taient aper\u00e7us.'\nLa pr\u00e9tention est que la chute du mur a \u00e8t\u00e8 caus\u00e9e par force majeure resultant de l'incendie d'un change-ment subit de temperature, accompagn\u00e8 d'un vent violent.\nLes faits de la cauee ont contredit ce moyen de defense.\nSans doute que l'accident est le resultat de l'incendie, du changement de temperature et du vent de temp\u00eate, mais ces trois faits n'ont pas en lieu en m\u00e8me temps. L'incendie aeu lieu le 18, et le changement de temp\u00e9rature et le vent le 24, jour de l'\u00e9croulement. Il y avait du temps du 18 au 24 pour prendre les pr\u00e8cau- sions n\u00e8cessaires pour pr\u00e8venir l'accident. Ce ne peut \u00eatr\u00e8 un cas fortuit, 16 code civil, article 17, s. 24 le d\u00e9finit;\u2014\nLe cas fortuit est un \u00e8v\u00e9nement impr\u00e8vu cause par une force majeure \u00e0 laquelle ii \u00e8tait impossible de r\u00e8sister.\nD'apr\u00e8s le dangereux \u00e8tat dans lequel les murs ont \u00e8t\u00e8 laisses apr\u00e8s 1 incendie, ii \u00e8tait facile de pr\u00e8venir un accident, et rien n'\u00e9tait plus facile que d'\u00e9viter un accident, soit en d\u00e8molisant ou en \u00e8tan\u00e7onnant le mur.\nL'article 1072 declare que le d\u00e8biteur n'est pas tenu de payer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00e8ts, lorsque 1 inex\u00e9cution de l'obligation est cause par cas fortuit ot force majeure, sans aucune faute de sa part, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne s'y soit sp\u00e8cialement oblig\u00e8 par le contrat. Ces dispositions font voir que pour se pr\u00e8valoir de la d\u00e9fense du cas fortutt ou de la force majeure ii faut que cc soit un \u00e8v\u00e8nement qu'il ait \u00e8t\u00e8 impossible de pr\u00e8voir et d'emp\u00e8cher. 11 faut aussi qu'il origine de ce qu'aucuns soins ni previsions humaines n'ont Pu l'emp\u00e8cher et qu'il n'ait \u00e8t\u00e8 precede, accompagn\u00e8 ou suivi d'aucune faute qui puisse \u00eatre imput\u00e9e an d\u00e9biteur.\nTroplong, du louage, ([19]) mentionne comme cas fortuits, les tremblements de terre, chaleur excessive, des chutes de neige extraordinaire, les gel\u00e8es, la gr\u00eale, les temp\u00eates sur mer et sur terre, les \u00e9clairs, le feu, etc. Mais au n\u00b0 207 il ajoute que ce serait une erreur de mettre an rang des cas fortuits des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ne sont que le r\u00e8sultat ordinaire du cours naturel des choses.\nAinsi, dit-il, la pluie, les vents, la neige, le chaud ne sont pas des cas- fortuits; ce sont l\u00e0 des accidents n\u00e8cessaires de l'ordre des saisons, des alternatives inevitables dune temp\u00e9rature normale. On ne les \u00e8l\u00e8ve an rang de cas fortuit qu'autant que lar leur intensit\u00e9 et leur force excessive ils sortent de la marche accoutum\u00e9e de la nature\nEn un mot, les saisons ont leur ordre et leur d\u00e8rangement: le derangement seul d\u00e8g\u00e8n\u00e8re en cas fortuit.\nDans notre pays les temp\u00e8tes et les changements subits de temperatures sont des \u00e8v\u00e8nements tr\u00e8s ordinaires. Pour donner auvent qu'il faisait le 24 d\u00e8cembre le caract\u00e8re de cas fortuit ou de force majeure ii faudrait que le vent e\u00fbt \u00e8t\u00e8 d'une violence au .del\u00e0 du cours ordinaire et d'une intensit\u00e8 telle que si le inur e\u00fbt \u00e8t\u00e8 appuy\u00e8, il se fut \u00e8croul\u00e8 tout de m\u00e8me. La preuve n'a pas \u00e8tabli ce fait; le t\u00e8moin Ball dit que la plus grande vitesse du vent a \u00e8t\u00e8 ce jour l\u00e0 37 milles \u00e0 l'heure et qu'il atteint souvent une plus grande v\u00e8locit\u00e8. Pour que ce soit un vent de temp\u00e8te, le t\u00e9moin Hamilton dit qu'il faut que ce soit un vent qui -ait au moins 40 milles \u00e0 l'heure.\nIl faut en consequence en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion des t\u00e8moins que le mur n'est tomb\u00e8 que parce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas support\u00e8. Le vent peut avoir \u00e8t\u00e8 la cause imm\u00e9diate de la chute du mur, mais la negligence de l'appelant \u00e0 prendre les precautions n\u00e8cessaires pour le prot\u00e9ger est certainement la cause mediate de l'acci-dent. C'est cette n\u00e9gligence qui constitue l'appelant en faute et le rend responsable de tous les. dommages soufferts par l'intim\u00e9.\nAubry et Rau, ([20]) apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu'en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le d\u00e8biteur n'est responsable des cas fortuits on de la force majeure, ajoute:\u2014\nAinsi, lorsque cette execution (de l'obiigation) n'a Pu avoir lieu par suite, soit d'un accident de la nature, soit du fait d'une personne ou d'uiie chose dont le d\u00e8biteur n'a pas \u00e0 r\u00e8pondre, et qu'il na pu emp\u00e8cher,. celui-ci se trouve d\u00e8charg\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e8, pourvu que cet accident ou ce fait n'ai pas \u00e8t\u00e8 precede ou accompagn\u00e9 de -quelque faute qu'il lui soit imputable.\nEt il dit de plus ([21]):\u2014\nToutes lea fois que le dCbiteur aurait Pu, en donnant \u00e0 l'accomplissement de l'obligation les soins qu'il, devait y apporter, emp\u00eacher le cas fortuit on du moins en att\u00e9nuer les effets, l'inex\u00e9cution r\u00e8guli\u00e8re de l'obiigation se trouve entrav\u00e9e, moins par le cas fortuit que par une faute dont le d\u00e8biteur doit n\u00e8cessairement r\u00e8pondre.\nDemolombe, des contrats, ([22]):\u2014 Il est been entendu. d'ailleurs que le d\u00e8biteur ne se trouve d\u00e8charg\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 raison de la force majeure ou du cas fortuit. qu'autant que l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement n'a pas \u00e8t\u00e8 pr\u00e8c\u00e8d\u00e9, accompagn\u00e9 ou suivi de quelque faute qui lui soit imputable.\nCar il serait an contraire passible de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats s'il avait pu, en apportant a l' accomplissement de son obligation le soin qu'il devait y apporter, avant, pendant ou apr\u00e8s l'accident, soit pr\u00e8venir l'accident lui-m\u00eame soit en pr\u00e8venir ou att\u00e8nuer les effets dommageables. A plus forte raison, le d\u00e8biteur serait-il responsable si, au lieu de pr\u00e8venir le cas fortuit on de force majeure il l'avait lui.m\u00e8me provoqu\u00e8.\nLaurent, ([23]):\u2014\nQuand le cas fortuit a \u00e8t\u00e8 amen\u00e8 par une faute, il devient imputable sous le droit commun: une pluie d'orage est g\u00e8n\u00e8ralement un accident dont personne ne r\u00e8pond, mais si ceux qui ex\u00e8cutent les travaux laissent le terrain sans defense contre l'action des eaux, les\u00e8boulements qui en r\u00e8sultent leur sont imputables.\nProudhon, droit d'usufruit, ([24]);\u2014\nOn entend, en g\u00e8n\u00e8ral, par cas fortuit dont personne n'est respon-sable, tout accident qu'on a pu pr\u00e8voir et dont on n'a pu arr\u00eater le coup.\nEt l'auteur ajoute ([25]);\u2014\nMais il est possible que le cas fortuit qui entraine imm\u00e8diatement la perte de Ia chose ait \u00e8t\u00e8 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ou accompagn\u00e9 d'une faute de la part de celui aux soins duquel elle \u00e8tait confi\u00e9e, et que pour cette raison il ne cesse pas d'\u00eatre responsable de la perte dont sa faute est m\u00e9diate de la cause, comme, par exemple, si un incendie a consume une maison parce qu'on n'avait pas en la pr\u00e8caution de faire ramoner la chemin\u00e9e o\u00f9 il a pris naissance, et m\u00eame dans le cas ou un incendie a \u00e8t\u00e8 allum\u00e8 par le feu du ciel, si l'on a pu en air\u00eater le progr\u00e8s et qu'on ait n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d' y mettie obstacle. Dans tous ces cas et autres semblables, chaque fois qu'il y a faute jug\u00e8e suffisante pour servir de fondement \u00e0 une juste garantie, son auteur doit \u00eatre condamn\u00e8 aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats soufferts par la partie l\u00e8s\u00e8e.\nL'auteur alors se demande s'il suffit au d\u00e8biteur de prouver la force majeure, ou s'il ne dolt pas de plus faire voir que cet \u00e8v\u00e8nement n'est compliqu\u00e8 d'aucune faute ou n\u00e9gligence de sa part; il est d'opinion que lorsque le d\u00e8biteur a \u00e8tabli le cas fortuit sa t\u00e2che est accomplie et qu'il n'est tenu \u00e0 prouver rien de plus.\nCette opinion, cependant, est condamn\u00e8e par la majorit\u00e9 des commentateurs.\nTroplong, de la vente ([26]), dit:\u2014\nL' obligation du vendeur est de prouver le cas fortuit qu'il all\u00e8gue; mais y a-t-il preuve de cas fortuit ou d'accident, tant qu'il n'est pas \u00e8tabli que c'est le hazard pur ou une force irresistible qui a amen\u00c9 la perte de la chose? La preuve est-elle faite quand on peut tout aussi bien penser que la faute de l'homme a concouru avec le fait \u00e9tranger? Puisque la force majeure est celle \u00e0 laquelle on- n'a Pu r\u00e8sister par aucune prevision, n'est-il pas n\u00e8cessaire de prouver qu'on a resister par de sages previsions, et qu'on a \u00e8t\u00e8 vaincu?\nDonc en remettant la chose, le d\u00e8biteur doit prouver que si elle est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e, ce n'est pas par sa faute. Eh ! bien, je demande s'il satisfait \u00e0 cette obligation en pr\u00e8textant d'un fait qui n'exclut pas n\u00e8cessairement la faute; d'un fait qui n'est fortuit qu'autant qu'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e8 que la negligence de l'homme ne l'a pas amen\u00e9?\nDemolombe, des contrats ([27]), dit aussi:\u2014\nC'est le d\u00e8biteur \u00e8videmment qui doit prouver le cas fortuit qu'il all\u00e8gue; car il affirme, et c'est a celui qui affirme qu'est impose le fardeau de la pieuve, et puisqu'il dit qu'il est lib\u00e8r\u00e8 de son obligation, il faut qu'il prouve l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a produit cette liberation.\nLe m\u00eame principe a lieu en mati\u00e8re de bail et oblige l'occupant, en cas d'incendie, \u00e0 prouver qu'il n'y a ni faute ni negligence de sa part.\nVoir aussi C. C. Arts. 1629 and 1631:\u2014\nEt les articles correspondants du Code Napoleon qui sont les articles 1733 et 1734.\nArt. 1733 dit que le locataire est responsable de l'incendie \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve qu'il est arriv\u00e9 par cas fortuit ou force majeure, ou par vice de construction, ou que le feu a \u00e8t\u00e8 communiqu\u00e9 par une maison voisine.\nL'article 1734 dit:\u2014\nS'il y a plusieure locataires, tous sent solidairement responsables de l'incendie, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne prouvent que l'incendie a commenc\u00e9 dans l'habitation de l'un d'eux, auquel cas ceux-l\u00e0 n'en sent pas tenus.\nToullier, ([28]):\u2014 Si dans le reste de la France coutumi\u00e8re on ne trouve pas de loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui \u00e8tablisse la pr\u00e8somption l\u00e9gale de culpabilit\u00e9 contre les habitants de Ta maison incendi\u00e9e, elle n'en \u00e8tait pas moins presque universellement recue et observ\u00e8e, comme le prouve la jurisprudence des arr\u00eats attest\u00e9e par les auteurs fran\u00e7ais les plus recommandables.\nAubry et Rau, ([29]): \u2014\nL'article 1733 C. N. ne contient point une d\u00e8rogation. au droit commun, en ce qu'il met \u00e0 la charge du preneur l'obiigation de prouver les faits tendants \u00e0 faire cesser sa responsabilit\u00e9. Les incendies en effet ne sont point par eux-m\u00eames, et n\u00e8cessairement, des cas fortuits ou de force majeure. Ils sont plus fr\u00e8quemment le r\u00e8sultat d'une imprudence ou d'un d\u00e8faut do surveillance que d'un cas fortuit proprement dit. Il en r\u00e8sulte que le preneur, tenu de veiller \u00e0 la conservation de la chose lou\u00e9e, et de justifier, le cas \u00e8ch\u00e8ant, de l'accomplissement de cette obligation, ne peut d\u00e9cliner la responsabilit\u00e9 d'un incendie qu'en prouvant que cet \u00e8v\u00e8nement provient d'une cause qui ne saurait lui \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 faute. La condition du locataire est, Sons ce rapport absolument la m\u00eame que celle de toute autre personne obiig\u00e8e, en vertu de Ia loi ou d'une convention, \u00e0 veiller \u00e0 la conservation de la chose d'autrui. Mais si cet article ne renferme pas \u00e0 ce point de vue, une derogation an droit commun, il s'en \u00e8carte \u00ee\u00e9elle-nient en ce que, pour donner an bailleur une garantie plus efficace, il restreint le cercee des moyens de justification du preneur. Et sous ce rapport, la disposition qu'il contient ne doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e- qu'en mati\u00e8re de bail.\nL'intim\u00e9 a aussi cite les causes suivantes:\nRapin v. McKinnon ([30]); B\u00e9langer v. McCarthy ([31]); S\u00e9minaire de Quebec v. Poilras ([32]).\nNotre article 1071 correspondant \u00e0 l'article 1147 du code Napol\u00e9on resume comme suit la doctrine.\nThe debtor is liable to pay damages in all cases in which he fails to establish that the inexecution of the obligation proceeds from a cause which cannot be imputed to him., although there be no bad faith on his part.\nL'appelant ne pouvait \u00e8viter les cons\u00e8quences de la responsabilit\u00e9 envers l'intim\u00e9 qu'en \u00e8tablissant que l'accident \u00e8tait le result at, Io d'un cas fortuit ou de force majeure 20 qu'il n'y avait aucune faute ou n\u00e9gligence de sa part. Mais loin de l\u00e0, la preuve a \u00e8tabli qu'il n'y avait pas eu de force majeure et que l'accident n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e8 que six jours apr\u00e8s l'incendie et par la faute et n\u00e8gligence de l'appelant.\nQuant au montant des dommages \u00e8valu\u00e8s par les deux cours \u00e0 la somme de $2,638.77, ii est suffisamment \u00e8tabli par la preuve. L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e8 avec d\u00e8pens.\nGWYNNE J. concured.\nPatt\u00e9rson J. I do not see any sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment in which the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench concurred.\nThe facts of this case do not enable the appellants to derive much aid from the doctrine of vis major which has been so much relied on, and the citations made from writers of authority, illustrating the application of the doctrine when a person has suffered injury from the fall of his neighbor's house, support the judgment of the court below.\nThe fire that burnt the appellant's house may be admitted, but without sodeciding, to have been a fortuitous event or an irresistible force which under article 1072 of the Civil Code, would have saved- the appellant from responsibility for damage caused by the fall of the wall if the fire had caused it to fall assuming of course as demanded by article 1072, that the fire occurred \" without any fault on his part.\" But the fire occurred on the 18th December and there remained, not a house but an unsupported wall which stood until the 24th, when it was blown down and injured the respondent's property. The breeze that blew down the wall cannot be treated as vis major within the doctrines relied on unless it appears that the accident could not have been foreseen or prevented. In that particular all the authorities agree\nThe term \" fortuitous event\" is defined by the Civil Code ([33]) as o one which is unforeseen and caused by superior force which it was impossible to resist.\"\nThe article of the Code Napoleon which corresponds with article 1072 is No. 1148. Laurent, commenting on that article, asks in one of the passages cited to us:\nQuand a till ca fortuit ou force majeure ([34])?\nAnd, after mentioning tempest, lightning' and earthquake, he adds:\nLa loi les qualifie de force majeure pour marquer que l'homme y est soumis fatalement, en ce sens qu'il ne peut les pr\u00e9voir ni y register.\nA similar definition of the equivalent phrase \" act of God \" was given, in terms almost as concise, by Lord Justice James in an English case ([35]) where the liability of a common carrier was in question;\nA. common carrier, he said, is not liable for any accident as to which he can show that it is due to natural causes directly and exclusively, without human intervention, and that it could not have been prevented by any amount of foresight and Pains and care reasonably to be expected from him.\nNo doubt it was the wind that blew down the wall; and the defendant may not have supposed that the wind would be so high just at that time, if he thought at all about danger from the wind. Perhaps the fire had weakened the wall more than he was aware of, though a new wall left unsupported as this was, has been known to fall before a good breeze. The danger existed and the defendant took the risk of it; whether he was led to do so by miscalculation of the danger, or from erroneous information, or simply from want of care and forethought, matters very little to the plaintiff. Article 1053 of the code declares that every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill. This covers, to my mind, the omission to take proper steps during the six days following the date of the fire to avert the danger caused by the unsupported wall.\nWe cannot, as I have already remarked, regard this wall as a building, so as to make the authorities appealed to on the subject of vis major fit the facts. If we could so regard the wall we should bring it within article 1055 where it is said that the owner of a building is responsible for the damage caused by its ruin where it has happened from want of repairs or from an original defect in its construction. It is beyond dispute that something might have been done, and doubtless something would have been done, during the 6 days, either by supporting the wall or taking part of it down to put it in a state to withstand the gale which, though violent, was not of unusual violence, if danger of the kind had been thought of. The wall required repairs and fell for want of them.\nThis topic is treated of in another passage cited to us from Demolombe's Comments ([36]) on article 1886 of the Code Napoleon which is followed by article 1055 of the Quebec Code. Referring to the two defects, neglect to repair and faulty construction, for which the proprietor is responsible, he says: \"Mais de ceux-l\u00e0 il est responsable de plein droit, sans qu'il puisse \u00eatre admis \u00e0 prouver qu'il n'a pas pu emp\u00e8cher la ruine qui est r\u00e8sult\u00e8 de l'une ou de l'autre de ces causes parce qu'il aurait \u00e8t\u00e8 tromp\u00e8 ou qu'il les ignorait.\"\nAnother citation is from Sourdat ([37]) where the effect is discussed of a notice given by a neighbor who is in danger from a building, calling on the proprietor to repair it, of which the author remarks, among other things, that the giving of the notice makes it more easy, in case of the destruction of the building by a hurricane, for the neighbours to prove that the storm only hastened the fall of the building, which was not strong enough to withstand it, though it might have done so if it had been kept in repair. So in the remaining passage, cited from Larombi\u00e8re (1), the author shows that freedom from responsibility for the fall of a building can be claimed, on the ground of force majeure, only:\u2014\nSi le propri\u00e9taire n'avaic point neglige de l'entretenir et qu'il l'eut constreite suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art.\nThus the authorities relied on for the appellant tell against the appeal.\nThe damages awarded to the respondent have, no doubt been assessed on a liberal scale. The evidence has been shewn, on the part of the appellant, to be capable of justifying an estimate 01 considerably smaller amount but unless we can say that the larger award is not justifiable we ought not to interfere with the decision of the trial judge sustained as it has been by the Court of Appeal.\nI may refer to Phillips v. Martin ([38]) as a recent case in which the Judicial Committee followed Metropolitan Railway Co.v. Wright ([39]) in holding that a verdict ought not to be disturbed as being against evidence, unless it is one which a jury, viewing the whole of the evidence reasonably, could not properly find.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: T.

C. Jones to respondent was made under private signature and was never proved as having been executed by the said T. C. Jones.\nCivil Code article 1222; Demolombe ([2]) on Art. 1322 C. N.\nPothier, Obligations ([3]).\nDalloz Rep. de Jur. ([4]).\nRespondent's action is based on the assumption that the words \" I also assume that the lands are properly conveyed and the full conditions of the prospectus carried out and if not that my money will be at once refunded \" contained in Hamilton's letter of the 20th March made it incumbent upon appellant not to use the amount of the draft unless (1) the twenty shares had all been subscribed for (2) the property had been properly conveyed to trustees for the second syndicate and (3) a secretary-treasurer had been elected and had opened an account for said syndicate for the deposit of all moneys which was not the case and is not borne out by the correspondence and the facts as proved on record.\nSuch an interpretation of the words above quoted would be incompatible with the facts that the draft itself was made payable to Coolican that it was drawn and paid at a time when Hamilton knew that the whole of the shares had not yet been taken up and that a secretary-treasurer was intended to be elected only after all the shares had been subscribed, as expressly mentioned both in letter of the 10th of March and in the accompanying prospectus.\nThe letter of the 20th of March should be read with that of the 10th, and as conveying Hamilton's consent to buy one-fortieth of the Cauchon property at the price of $7,125 and to pay immediately one-third thereof, in cash, on the assumption that the lands were properly conveyed and that the facts were as represented in the prospectus.\nIn his suit in Winnipeg T. C. Jones did expressly allege that \"the property was bought by appellant and others at the price of $285,000 divided into shares of $14,2.0 each, one-third of which was to be paid in cash; that Hamilton accepted appellant's offer of his share for $7,125, payable upon the said terms as those expressed in the said agreement from the said Cauchon; and that he paid, at appellant's request, to James S. Coolican the sum of $2,375, being one-third of the purchase money of the said share.\"\nIf the words \" and the full condition of the prospectus carried out,\" were to be taken as making it incumbent upon appellant to see that the twenty shares were subscribed for it might as well be said that it likewise applied to the statement, as contained in the prospectus, that the property would sell at the prices therein mentioned.\nIn any case the respondent is estopped from complaining as he adopted what was done by the institution of T. C. Jones's actions in Winnipeg. Art. 1720, C.C. Story on Agency ([5]); Dalloz Jur. G\u00e9n. ([6]). MacLaren Q.C. for respondent. As to the transfer it was admitted and if there is any irregularity about it it should have been specially set up. Art. 144 0. P C. County of Pontiac y. Ross ([7]).\nOn the question of ratification it is quite clear that all the facts were not known to the respondent, and therefore the authorities cited by appellant do not apply. See Troplong, Mandat, ([8]). Moreover it was at the special request of the appellant that the action in Winnipeg was taken. The respondent's agreement was not to purchase any particular portion of said land, but to join with others in purchasing the whole on certain conditions which were never fulfilled.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014For the reasons assigned in the consid\u00e9rants of the judge of the Superior Court I think this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Superior Court affirmed with costs in all the courts.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER JJ. concurred in the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed. There is only one point which was not disposed of at the argument. That is the objection taken by the appellant that the transfer sous seing priv\u00e9 by T. C. Jones to the respondent had not been proved. A close scrutiny of the record has convinced me that the appellant must fail on this point as on the others. The appellant pleaded the general issue, it is true, but at the same time he pleaded that the transfer alleged in the declaration is irregular insufficient and null and that there is no privity of contract between himself and the respondent. This is of itself an admission of the existence of the transfer. Then, the appellant himself was called as a witness by the respondent, and admitted that he was before the institution of this action, served with a duplicate of the transfer, and he filed it with his deposition as respondent's Exhibit Z. The fact that it was a duplicate that he was served with, and not a copy, is not without importance; he knew T C. Jones'' signature so well, as results from the voluminous correspondence they had had together, that his not making any objection or remarks whatever as to his signature on that transfer is a clear, though only implied, admission by him of the genuineness of that signature. Then, later on in the case, the appellant puts the respondent in the witness box and examines him to prove that he, the respondent, has given no consideration for that transfer and that he is only a pr\u00eate-nom. Now that is, it seems to me, another clear admission of the existence of that transfer.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It appears to me to be free from doubt that the judgment of the learned judge of the Superior Court rendered in this case is well founded, and that therefore this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with Costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : B\u00e9ique, Lafontaine & Turgeon.\nSolicitors for respondent : MacLaren, Leet, Smith & Smith.\n[1] M.

Ritchie C. J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nBank stock given to another bank as collateral security\u2014Banking Act-34 Vic ch. 5 s. 40 42 Vic. ch. 45 s. 2 35 Vic. ch. 51 (D) 43 Vic. ch. 22 s. 8 46 Vic. ch. 20 ss. 9 10 Arts. 14, 1970, 1973, 1975 C.C.\nThe Exchange Bank in advancing money to F. on the security of Merchants' Bank shares caused the shares to be assigned to their managing director and an entry to he made in their books that the managing director held the shares in question on behalf of the bank as security for the loan. The bank subsequently credited F. with the dividends accruing thereon. Later on the managing director pledged these shares to another bank for his own personal debt and absconded.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that upon repayment by F. of the loan made to him the Exchange Bank was bound to return the shares of pay their value The prohibition to advance upon security of shares of another bank contained in the amendment to the general banking act applies to the bank and not to the borrower,\nPer Patterson J.\u2014Assuming that the subsequent amendment of the general banking act forbade the taking of such security by any bank the amendment did not alter the charter of the Exchange Bank 35 Vic ch. 51 (D), under which the Exchange Bank had power to take the shares in question in its corporate name as collateral security. To take such security may have become an offence against the banking law, punishable from the beginning as a misdemeanor and subject to a pecuniary penalty, but it was not ultra vires. Art. 14 C. C. which declares that prohibitive laws import nullity has no application to such a case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), by which the appellants were condemned to re-convey to the respondent one hundred shares of the capital stock of the Merchants Bank of Canada and in default of doing SO C within fifteen days to pay him the sum of $11,000, with , interest and costs.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson hereinafter given. See also report of the case in M. L. R. 7 Q. B. 11.\nThe questions which arose on this appeal were:\nFirst:\u2014Were the one hundred shares of Merchants Bank stock really placed under the control of the Exchange Bank as collateral security for an advance made by it ? and\nSecondly:\u2014Was this transfer so affected with nullity in law as to prevent Fletcher from recovering the shares ?\nMacmaster Q.C. for appellant contended that as to the first question the evidence showed:\u2014\nFirst, that Craig, the managing director, did not act as agent of the bank in the transfer of the shares made by Fletcher; and Fletcher, having knowledge that the transaction was illegal and beyond the power of the bank, dealt with Craig personally, and his recourse was against him, and not against the bank.\nSecondly, that the bank never had possession or control of the shares.\nThe bank could not take or hold these shares as collateral security. The agent could not by a moyen d\u00e9tourn\u00e9, in which he was aided by the borrower, increase the bank's powers. Art. 1704 C.C.; Smith's Mercantile Law ([2]); Booth v. The Bank of England ([3]) Bishop v. The Countess of jersey ([4]); Poullon v. The London & . South Western Railway Co. ([5]); McGowan v. Dyer ([6]); Bank of MonTreal v. Rankin ([7]); The British Mutual Banking Co. v. Charnwood Forest Go. ([8]); Johansen v.

Archambault Q.C. and Lacoste Q. c. for respondent, contended that the manager had acted within the scope of his authority when requesting and accepting, in his discretion the shares as security for the moneys he advanced in the name of. the bank.

La Banque Jacques Cartier ([21]); Morse on Banking ([22]); Banque Nationale v. City Bank ([23]); Pardessus Droit Commercial ([24]).\nThe 100 shares of the Merchants Bank were used to help in supporting the appellants' credit and standing before the public. The bank got the dividends and the transfer was made for its benefit.\nIf the directors were aware of these facts they were all the more guilty. If they ignored such a state of things it was due to their neglect to inspect the books regularly.\nJones on Pledges ([25]); Morawetz on Corporations ([26]); Sedgwick on Statutory and Constitutional Law ([27]).\nEven if this transaction is to be held illegal for the bank by the statute, the bank alone which infringes the prohibition is liable to penalty, and not the party entering into the prohibited transaction with the bank; the nullity and penalty consequently only refer to the bank which therefore could not hold or demand securities of the description prohibited. But the nullity is not absolute and a nullit\u00e8 d'ordre public, and to deny the respondent the right of claiming his shares back is not a sound interpretation of the law, which only prohibits the transfer and not the redeeming of bank stocks which might have been so transferred. Besides the general principle nul ne. peut s'enrichir aux d\u00e8pens d'autrui finds an application here.\nMacmaster Q. C. in reply. There was no express knowledge in the directors of this being a loan made for the benefit of the bank.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J- I have entertained some doubts in this case but not sufficiently strong to dissent from the judgment, which I understand all my brothers entertain that the appeal should be dismissed\nSTRONG and FOURNIER; JJ. concured in the opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed TASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must he dismissed. I entirely adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in the Superior Court. and of Mr. Justice Tessier in the Court of Appeal. The judgment condemning the bank, appellant, to return to respondent the one hundred shares of the Merchants bank, or to pay him the value thereof, &11,000, is the only one that could be rendered in the case. The single fact that the bank, appellant, received the dividends accruing upon these one hundred shares, paid them by its cheques to the respondent and credited the respondent for the same in the bank books and in the respondent's pass book is, in my opinion, conclusive against the appellant. I cannot see that the illegality of the transaction can affect the respondent's claim. How can the bank be justified in contending that it will keep these shares because it got them illegally? If it had not failed and if Craig had not absconded would the illegality of the transaction have authorized it to keep these shares ? Is it not quite the converse ? If the transaction was illegal the shares must be returned to Fletcher for that reason alone. It is to my mind an additional reason why they should return them. The simple question is one of fact: Did the bank get these shares or not? upon the evidence there seems to me no room to doubt that he did. What Craig loaned to Fletcher was the appellants' monies. The hundred shares of Merchants bank stock he got from Fletcher were transferred as security for the appellants' monies so lent. The fact that the transfer was to him personally is not material. He held the shares for the bank, appellant. When Craig received the dividends on these shares he received them for the appellant, not for himself and he duly entered them in the bank's books to the credit of the respondent as received by the bank for the respondent. The reasoning on the part of the appellant, in this court as well as in the court below, seems to be based on the illegality of the transaction and amounts to the contention that the bank did not get these shares because it was illegal to take them as collaterals. The fallacy of this argument seems to me apparent. In fact, I can see no argument in it at all.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Thomas Craig was, in January, 1880, cashier or managing director of the Exchange Bank. Fletcher applied to him for a loan of $20,000 on his promissory notes indorsed by his father. Craig required further security and Fletcher offered one hundred shares of the stock of the Merchants' Bank. Craig explained to him that the bank could not legally advance money on the security of bank stock, but suggested that the stock should be transferred to George W. Craig, a brother of Thomas not connected with the Exchange Bank. Fletcher accordingly transferred the stock to George and Thomas, acting for the bank, advanced him the money. The transfer was made on the 28th of January, 1880. Fletcher does not appear to have known anything more of the stock, except that the dividends on it found their way in regular course to his credit in his account with the Exchange Bank. until after the bank had gone into liquidation and Thomas Craig had absconded when having paid off the loan and desiring to have the stock re-transferred to him he learned that the Craigs had fraudulently made away with it.\nThis action is brought to recover the value of the stock from the Exchange Bank.\nThe details of the dealing with the stock are unimportant. The result was what I have stated. George transferred it to Thomas on the same day of the transfer from Fletcher. They were dealing honestly then. Nemo repenle fuit turpissimus. A week or so later Thomas noted in one of the books of the bank that he held 100 shares of Merchants' Bank stock as security for the loan to Fletcher; but in April 1883 he transferred the shares, acting by his brother George as his attorney, to George and a Mr. Greene who forthwith transferred them to the City and District Savings Bank as security for a debt of Thomas Craig, for which they were afterwards sold.\nThe question of the liability of the Exchange Bank to account to Fletcher for the shares has given rise to difference of opinion in the court below, and it is certainly one of some difficulty.\nMuch of the discussion has turned on the circumstance that the Bank Act forbids, and did in January 1880 forbid the bank to lend money directly or indirectly upon the security of bank stock. The law was contained in the Bank Act 34 Vic. ch. 5, s. 40. Under the 51st section of that act the bank might have taken the shares of another bank as collateral security, but that privilege was cancelled in 1879 by the amending act 42 Vic. ch. 45 s. 2 which was in force in January 1880. No alteration material to the questions in dispute has been since made in the law. A subsequent statute ([28]) attaches a pecuniary penalty to the violation of section 40 or other specified sections, preserving at the same time the liability of any bank to be punished as for a misdemeanor for any contravention of the Bank Act.\nWhen I speak of section 40 forbidding the bank to lend money on the security of bank stock, I adopt, for the purpose of this argument, the construction which both parties have put upon the statute. I should not myself have understood section 40 to refer to any stock but that of the bank lending the money. \"The bank shall not * * * lend money * * * upon the security or pledge of any share or shares of the capital stock of the bank.\" That is the language of the section. Section 51 which declares that nothing in the act contained shall prevent the bank from acquiring and holding certain securities, including the capital stock of any other bank, as collateral security, implies an idea that the act might be construed to prohibit the taking of such securities, but there is no such direct prohibition unless it is contained in section 40. The striking out in 1879 from section 51 of the words the shares of the capital stock of any other bank\" was a further indication of the understanding of the legislature that the power to take security on that class of personal property depended on that section. That idea was made more clear by section 51 ([29]) as redrawn and re-enacted in 1880, where, among the securities which nothing in the act contained was to prevent the bank from taking, we find \"the stock, bonds or debentures of municipal or other corporations, except banks.\" But there is still no direct or express prohibitory enactment except what is found in section 40.\nWhen the Exchange Bank was incorporated in 1872 ([30]) its charter providing that the act of 34 Vic. ch. 5 and all the provisions thereof should apply to the new bank in the same manner as if it were expressly incorporated with that charter, there can be no doubt that its corporate powers included the right to take the stock of another bank as collateral security for an advance of money\nSections 40 and 51 of the Bank Act as they originally stood are to he read as if inserted in the act of incorporation of the Exchange Bank. When they are appealed to as indicating some limitation of the corporate powers of the bank, they must be read as thus forming so much of the terms of the bank charter. Doubtless they made it a transgression of duty for the bank to lend money on certain classes of property\u2014 '\"mortgage or hypothecation of any lands or tenements, or of any ships or other vessels, nor upon the security or pledge of any share or shares of the capital stock of the bank, or of any goods, wares or merchandise, except as authorised in this act\"\u2014but nothing in the act contained, or, reading section 51 as part of the bank charter nothing in the charter contained was to prevent the taking of securities of the classes mentioned in section 51. Thus it is clear that, testing the powers of the bank by the terms of the charter, it was not ultra vires to take bank stock as collateral security for money lent. When, several years after the incorporation of the bank, the general Banking Act was amended so as to forbid the taking of such security by any bank\u2014conceding that to he the effect of the amendment\u2014I do not understand the amendment to have altered the charter of 1872. To take such security may have become an offence against the banking law, punishable from the beginning as a misdemeanor and subject by later legislation to a pecuniary penalty, but it was not ultra vires. A contract made in contravention of the act would be one which, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Tessier in the court below the courts would not enforce at the instance of the bank just as they would refuse to enforce at the instance of an individual a contract founded on an illegal consideration but that is a different question from the capacity of the individual or of the corporation to make the contract.\nIt is scarcely necessary to cite authority for these opinions, but I may refer to Brice on ultra Vires ([31]), where the author lays it down as the result of the English authorities that corporations-certainly those for commercial purposes\u2014have by implication all capacities and powers which, being reasonably incidental to their enterprise or operations, are not forbidden them either expressly by their constating instruments or by necessary inference therefrom.\nThe cases leading to this result are examined by the learned author. I shall not refer to them beyond quoting she language of Blackburn J. in Taylor v. Chichester and Midhurst Railway Company ([32]), which is said to be now established as the true mode of expressing the doctrine It is this\nI think, therefore, we are entitled to consider the question to be, not whether the present defendants had, by virtue of the acts of incorporation, authority to make the contract, but whether they are by those statutes forbidden to make it.\nThe emphasis is on the prohibition being to be looked for in the act of incorporation or constating instrument. So it was in Riche v. Ashbury Railway company ([33]), where the same distinguished judge gave a judgment in the Exchequer Chamber which was adopted in the House of Lords and is quoted from by my brother Gwynne in Bank of Toronto V. Perkins ([34]) in which case also the prohibition in question was contained in the charter of the bank\nThe constating instrument of the Exchange bank did not forbid, but expressly permitted, the taking of bank stock as collateral security. But if We concede, though only for argument's sake that not only did the amending act of 1879 forbid all banks taking such securities but that the Banking Act as thus amended became part of the Exchange Bank's Act of incorporation, we should have a prohibition similar to one which was pronounced upon by the judicial committee of the Privy Council in Ayers v. South Australian Banking company ([35]). A clause in the charter of that company said it should not he lawful for the bank to make advances on merchandise. The judicial committee held that whatever other effect that prohibition might have, it did not prevent the property in merchandise on which the bank had made advances from passing to the bank, and the bank was accordingly held entitled to recover in trover for the merchandise. There is nothing inconsistent with that decision in the case of national Bank of Australasia v. Cherry ([36]), which is cited in The Bank of Toronto v. Perkins ([37]).\nA point has been made by reference to article 14 of the Civil Code which declares that \"prohibitive laws import nullity, although such nullity be not therein expressed.\nThe point made is irrespective of any question peculiar to corporations, and irrespective also of the doctrine of ultra vires. It would apply to the act of an individual as well as to the act of a corporation.\nFor several reasons, and leaving out of sight for the moment the doubt as to the existence of the asserted prohibition, I do not think the article applies in the case The Banking Act must receive the same construction in all parts of the Dominion. What it allows or prohibits in Quebec it must allow or prohibit in all the other provinces. If the article enunciates a rule of law peculiar to one province which is to govern in that province the operation of this statute, each province may also establish a rule of interpretation to prevail within its borders, and the uniformity of the law on this important branch of trade and commerce which was to be secured by confiding it to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, will be in peril. The Provincial Legislature has no power to modify the operation of a Dominion statute by formulating a new canon of construction. It happens, however, that the article enunciates a rule which is also a well established rule of English law. It will be found stated and illustrated by reference to decisions in Maxwell on Statutes, chapter 13. It is unnecessary to enter on a discussion of the effect of the rule because the reasoning on which it was held in Ayers V. South Australian Banking Company (9) that the prohibitive words of The bank charter did not prevent the property from passing, as well as the decision of that case, make it Clear that it does not affect the present discussion.\nNow, what is the present transaction ?\nThe bank, acting by its competent agent, advances money to Fletcher on the security of the two names of himself and his father and takes as collateral security an assignmentent of bank stock. The stock if it had been transferred to the bank by its corporate name, would have passed to the bank. It was not, in my view of the statutes ultra vires of the bank to take it but even if the transaction had been a violation of the terms of its charter the property would nevertheless have passed It did pass to the person named on the part of the bank to hold the pledge on its behalf, viz., the managing director of the bank who took it on behalf of the bank and who when he noted in the book that he held the shares as security for the loan, merely put on record a fact which might have been proved by other evidence. The bank was bound to restore the property when the debt was paid. Fletcher's contract was with the bank, not with either of the Craigs Article 1973 of the Civil Code lays it down that the creditor is liable for the loss or deterioration of the thing pledged, according to the rules established in the title \" Of Obligations.\" Article\n(1) L. R. 3 P. C 548. 1970 recognises the validity of a pledge placed in other hands than those of the creditor himself. By article 1063 an obligation to give involves the obligation to deliver the thing and to keep it safe until delivery. The delivery in this case was the restitution of the thing pledged, which, as mentioned in article 1915, Fletcher was entitled to claim when he paid his debt. In respect of that obligation to deliver or restore the stock Fletcher became the creditor and the bank the debtor, and by article 1065 every obligation renders the debtor liable in damages in case of a breach of it on his part.\nI do not attach so much importance to the inquiry whether the bank can be said to have had control of the stock as was done in the court below by the dissenting judges. I think the bank had control of it. Whether this director or that director knew about it or not the corporation knew of it, for it had the knowledge of its manager and agent who took the property as security for the loan. But having in fact made the loan on the security of the pledge it incurred the obligation to restore the property when the money was repaid. That was the Contract of the bank with Fletcher. It matters little whether the restitution could be effected by a direct corporate act of the bank itself or whether the act of restitution had to be performed by Thomas Craig. \"A person......may contract in his own name that another shall perform an. obligation, and in this case he is liable for damages if such obligation be not performed by the person indicated.\" ([38])\nI have merely to add that I do not adopt the theory, which was relied on to some extent by the appellants, that the bank did not benefit by what was done. The bank is no:, in my opinion, entitled to say that it had not security for its money by the pledge of the stock. I think the judgment should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Macmaster & McGibbon.\nSolicitors for respondent: Archambault & St. Louis.\n[1] M.

J.

No indemnity having been claimed during the lifetime of the husband the widow, acting for herself as well as in the capacity of executrix for her minor child, brought an action for compensation within one year after his death.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the courts below, (Fournier J. dissenting): 1. That the respondent's right of action under art. 1056 C.C depends not only upon the character of the act from which death ensued, but upon the condition of the decedent's claim at the time of his death, and if the claim was in such a shape that he could not then have enforced it, had death not ensued, the article of the code does not give a right of action and creates no liability whatever on the person inflicting the injury.\n2. That as it appeared on the record that the plaintiff had no right of action the court would grant the defendant's motion for judgment non obstante veredicto Art. 433 C. P. C.\n3. That at the time of the death of the respondent's husband all right of action was prescribed under art. 2262 C.C. and that this prescription is one which the tribunals are bound to give effect to although not pleaded. Arts. 2267 and 2188 C.C.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) which confirmed the judgment of the Court of Review ([2]) dismissing three motions of the appellants, (1st) for judgment non obstante veredicto; (2nd) in arrest of judgment; and (3rd) for a new trial; and granting the respondent's motion for. judgment upon the findings of the jury upon a second trial in this cause.\nThe action was instituted on the 17th day of May, 1884, by the respondent, acting as well for herself as in her capacity of tutrix to her minor daughter, then a child of about eight years of age, to recover damages consequent on the death of Patrick Flynn, the husband of the respondent and father of her minor child which death had been caused by the fault and negligence of the appellants.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully given in the report of the case (in Review) ([3]).\nA. Lacoste Q.C. and H. Abbott Q.C. for appellants.\nThe questions which arise upon this appeal are: \u2014\nFirst, whether the plaintiff has any right of action, it appearing from the allegations of her declaration that more than a year elapsed between the date of the accident and the death of her husband without any action having been taken, it being contended by the appellants that all liability and all rights of action resulting from the bodily injuries received by the deceased were prescribed and extinguished by the lapse of one year, under article 2262 of the code; and if so whether it was necessary to plead prescription;\nSecondly, whether the defendants are entitled to a new trial.\nUnder article 1056 the right of action is given to the consort and relations only in the case when the person dies \" without having obtained indemnity or satisfaction.\" It follows from this that if the deceased had obtained indemnity or satisfaction from the appellants during his lifetime neither the widow nor his relations would have had any right of action. thus showing that the right of action is the same in favor of the deceased and of his consort and relations, though the measure of damages is different; the deceased in the one case being entitled to damages for the suffering and injuries personal to himself and his consort and relations being entitled to damages for the pecuniary loss suffered by his death. But the foundation of the night of action is the same-viz., the bodily injuries which are alleged to have caused his death. It follows from the article that if that right of action and the liability of the appellants were extinguished before the death of the deceased it cannot be revived in favour of his consort or relations. The principle has been upheld in England in the interpretation of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, from which act our article is drawn: Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co. ([4]); Pulling v. Great Eastern Railway Co, ([5]); Pym v. Great Northern Ry. Co. ([6]); Senior v. Ward ([7]); Haigh v. Royal Mail S.S. Packet Co. ([8]); Merlin Rep Vo. Injures ([9]). And this Court has held in this very case ([10]), following the Privy Council in Trimble v. Hill ([11]) and the House of Lords in City Bank v. Barrow ([12]) that the construction by the courts in England upon the English statute should be adopted by the courts of this country. See also Dibble v. New York & Erie Railway Co. ([13]). It is, therefore, submitted with confidence, that the appellants have the right to urge under art, 1056 any matter, such as prescription, which extinguished their liability before the death of the injured person.\nIt may be urged that the plaintiff has a right of action independently of the statute, which the code practically is; but tins has already been authoritatively decided by this court in this case, holding that the enactments of our code leave clearly, for an injury caused by death, nothing but the action given by art. 1056, and that the statutory action only now lies. But it is objected by Mr. Justice Davidson that the prescription of the right of action is not equivalent to indemnity or satisfaction, because the prescription is not founded upon a presumption of payment but on the higher reason of public policy. The learned Judge has evidently misunderstood the contention of the appellants. They did not contend that this prescription created a presumption of indemnity or satisfaction but that it was evident from the terms of the article 1056, that if the liability were extinguished in any way, whether by payment, prescription or otherwise, there was no new liability and no new right of action in favor of the widow created by the decease of the husband.\nThat the widow's right of action depends upon the existence of a valid right of action in the husband at the time of his death is clear not only from the language of the code making her right dependent upon the question as to whether he had received indemnity in his lifetime, but also from the undoubted principle that the negligence of the deceased would be a good answer to her action.\nIt is submitted that if the right of action can be extinguished by payment to the injured person during his lifetime, it can also be extinguished by lapse of time, provided that the law has fixed such lapse of time as a limitation to the right to recover damages resulting from the injuries received. The lapse of time establishes a presumption jurls et de jure of the extinction of the obligation or cause of action. Fuchs vs. Legar\u00e9, ([14]); Caron v. Cloutier, ([15]). the question, therefore, now arises whether it is the prescription of twoye ars established by article 2261, or of one year by article 2262, which should govern in an action for damages arising from bodily injuries. Two of the Judges of the Court of Review (Davidson and Wurtele, J.J), after careful consideration, came to the conclusion that the prescription was that of one year established by article 2262. On the other hand Mr. Justice Taschereau held that it was evident from the French version, which speaks of \" injures corporelles\" that this prescription could only apply to injuries resulting from an assault, or wrongful overt act; in other words, that the word \" injures \" means only \" injuries inflicted with malice: to wit, an offence,\" to use the language of Judge Davidson, and that, as the hurt was done without malice to wit a quasi offense, the prescription established by 2261 should govern. Article 2261 speaks of damages resulting from offences or quasi-offences where other provisions do not apply. It may be true that in common parlance the word i injure \" has the signification attached to it by the learned judge, but reference to the dictionaries will show that it has also the same meaning as the English word \u201cinjuries,\" as applied to the effects of storms, convulsions of nature etc. and we frequently hear the expression \" injures corporelles \" applied by French-speaking members of the bar to the ordinary action for damages resulting from injuries to the person. Moreover, it would, seem extraordinary that the codifiers could have so mistranslated the expression \"injures corporelles \" as to make it read \"bodily injuries,\" if the interpretation of the French version by the learned judge is correct. It is sub-mitted that the use of the word \"corrporelles\" in conjunction with the word '' injures is sufficient to show that the meaning of the codifies is correctly expressed in the English version, for it is doubted if the expression \" injures corporelles \" can be found in the work of any legal writer as applied to injuries to the person. It is contended that the codifiers used these words in order to express as clearly as possible the idea of bodily injuries. Article 2261 covers all damage resulting from offences or quasi-offences, whenever other provisions do not apply. Immediately following, we have provided a shorter prescription for damages resulting from bodily injuries, saving the cases regulated by special laws, and the special provisions contained in article 1056. Now it is clear that article 1056 applies to both offences and quasi-offences; and it is contended that this saving clause can have only one meaning, namely, that while actions for such damages are prescribed by one year, should the injured person die within that period the widow and surviving relatives should have another year within which to bring their action. But surely it could not be held to mean that if the injured person lived, for say ten years, they would still have a right of action for another year. This would be a reductio ad absurdum; for if the liability of the person causing the injury is extinguished by prescription it is extinguished towards all the world; and it cannot be contended that it can be revived by the subsequent death of the person injured. As to the cases regulated by special laws there are none except those regulating prescription of just such actions as this one\u2014viz., actions for damages resulting from quasi-offences. such are the provisions of the Railway Act, of ch. 85 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada and of the charters of many of our cities and towns establishing prescriptions of six and three months in such cases. But a reference to the language of the codifiers themselves, in their third report, book 3, title of prescriptions, makes it incontestable that the codifiers intended to establish a separate prescription for all bodily injuries, whether resulting from offences or quasi-offences. It will he seen that they grive as one of their reasons that there was already is existence, by statute, a short prescriptions in such cases in favor of commercial corporations. This language could only refer to such special enactments as have already been mentioned. At the time the report was written there was in existence, by the then Railway Act, a prescription of six months in favor of railway companies, and there were also short prescriptions established in favor of certain commercial corporations. The prescriptions so established could not possibly have been confined to actions resulting from offences only. In fact, it would be only in very rare and exceptional cases that a corporation could be held to be guilty of an offence (d\u00e9lit) occasioning injury to the person.\nIt only remains to consider the point raised by the Court of Queen's Bench, that the prescription of actions for damages resulting from torts causing injuries to the person only begins to run from the date of the cessation of the injury. This is a new contention, never raised by the respondent, and, it is submitted, entirely contrary to principle, and to the formerly existing jurisprudence of the courts of the province ([16]). Were this doctrine once admitted, there would be no end to litigation arising from injuries to the person, and the object of the law in establishing a limitation of such actions would be defeated; so long as the injured person lived and suffered from the consequences of the injuries received, he would be entitled to continue taking actions against the party liable. Many bodily injuries result in permanent disablement, and a consequent continuous damage during life. Can it be seriously contended that it is the policy of the law to continue the right of action so long as the damage continues? The contrary is confidently contended for by the appellants. The liability attaches from the instant the tort is committed, and is extinguished by the lapse of time from that moment within which is fixed by law the limit of the right to take action. If the tortious acts were continuous the limitation would only begin to run from their cessation. As for instance in cases of damage to property caused, for example, by the deprivation of access to a street, where the cause of damage is continued, the courts have always held that the right of action is not prescribed till the cause is removed, Grenier v. city of Montreal ([17]); Corporation of Tingwick v. G. T. By. Co. ([18]). But in a case of bodily injuries such as this, though the resulting damage may continue through life, there is but one act which caused it and the prescription must run from the date of its commission. Such has always been the interpretation of the laws of limitations in England and America. Wood's Limitations of Actions ([19]); Fetter v. Beale ([20]); Whitehouse v. Fellowes ([21]); Addison on Torts ([22]) In France it is the rule adopted by the code in matters of d\u00e9lit ([23]) and was the rule of the law before the code, Jousse Id\u00e9e G\u00e9nerale de la Justice Criminelle ([24]).\nNo jurisprudence can be cited to sustain the holding of the Court of Queen's Bench on this point.\nIt is therefore submitted that the motion for \"judgment non obstante veredicto should have been granted by the courts below, or at least judgment arrested because it was apparent, on the face of the plaintiff's declaration, that her husband having died more than a year after the bodily injuries were received without. having taken suit, the liability of the appellants resulting from such injuries was extinguished under article 2262 by prescription, and that consequently the plaintiff had no right of action under article 1056 to recover the damages caused to her by his death resulting from such injuries.\nAs to the absence of any plea of prescription we con-tend that prescription may be relied on at any stage of the case even in appeal, and is not presumed to be renounced by pleading to the merits. Arts. 2188, 2267 C.C. Grenier v. City of Montreal ([25]); Pigeon v. City of Montreal ([26]); Breakey v. Carter ([27]); Dorion v, Crowley ([28]); Leduc v. Desmarchais ([29]); Corporation of Sherbrooke v. Dufort ([30]),\nThe learned counsel also argued that, at all events, there should be a new trial on the ground of excessive damages, citing the previous report of this case ([31]), and Corner v. Byrd ([32]).\nGeoffrion Q.C., and Halton Q.C. for respondent.\nThe respondent's right of action only arose on the death of her husband and did not cease to exist until a year after his death even if his rights of action had become prescribed before his death, which is denied Arts. 1056 and 2262, s. 2, CO., Laurent ([33])\nArticle 2262 of the Civil Code only refers to injuries inflicted with malice, as prescribed by one year those inflicted without malice being quasi-offences, like the injury in question, coming under the provision of article 2261 which are prescribed by a lapse of two years. The French version of the code refers to \" injures corporelles\" and the word \" injures\" means injuries inflicted with malice, not as in the present instance. See also Lord Mackenzie's Roman Law ([34]).\nEven if the respondent's rights were prescribed as alleged, prescription should have been specially pleaded. Art. 2188 C. C.\nThe respondent's right of action only arose on the death of her husband Prior to his death she had no right of action. How then could a right be prescribed before it came into existence? Yet this is the pretension of the appellants. The respondent is not claiming any successive rights. She had a right of action quite different from any right which her husband might have had, provided he did not during his lifetime obtain indemnity or satisfaction from the appellants. It is not a successive right as representing her husband, but a right given to her by special legislation. There is no pretension that respondent's husband did obtain indemnity, but the appellants now pretend that prescription against his rights having been acquired it must be assumed to be equivalent to payment.\nIn the recent case of Marchelerre v. The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company for damages, although the defendants had not pleaded prescription, Mr. Justice Johnson, in the Superior Court ([35]) dismissed the plaintiffs action holding that under the Consolidated Railway act 42 Vic. cap. 9 sec. 27 and Consolidated Statutes of Canada, cap. 109, sec. 27. the action was prescribed by the lapse of six months inasmuch as that section \"provides that it is sufficient to plead the general issue. The case was taken to the Court of Review, composed of Justices Grill, Mathieu and Davidson, and the judgment reversed on the ground that the defendants had renounced prescription through having paid for medical attendance upon the injured person.\nAs to the application for a new trial for excessive damages, the learned counsel cited and relied on Can\" non v. Huot ([36]), Levi v. Reed ([37]), Lambkin v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([38]), and Stephens v. Chauss\u00e9 ([39]).\nSir W J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed I rely upon the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau and concur in his reasons for my decision.\nSTRONG J.\u2014When this cause was before this court on a former occasion on an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench dismissing the appeal from the judgment refusing a new trial, I expressed the opinion that the action founded on article 1056 of the Civil Code of Quebec was the same action as that authorized by chapter 78 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, which was itself a re-enactment of the Imperial statute known as Lord Campbell's Act. I adhere to that opinion and I must therefore hold that the present action is subject to the same conditions as a similar action would be under the Imperial statute referred to, except in so far as express provision to the contrary may have been made by the code. It has been determined in England that the action under Lord Campbell's Act is not the same action as that which the deceased person would have himself had at common law, if he had survived, but a new action given by the statute. Seward v. Vera Cruz ([40]). Pym v. Great Northern By. Go. ([41]). It has, however, been decided. as the language of the statute plainly\" requires, that the right to maintain an action under the statute is subject to the condition that the deceased person himself should have been at the time of his death entitled to maintain an action for the injury. This principle is clearly established by many authorities and it applies as well to cases in which, there having been originally a good cause of action, it has been extinguished by release, acceptance of satisfaction or in any other manner as to cases in which there was originally no cause of action. The application of this principle is shown by the following cases. In Haigh v. Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. ([42]), a ticket was sold by the defendants to a passenger subject to a condition that the company would not be responsible for injury arising from perils of the sea, though the negligence of the defendants' servants might have contributed to it. The passenger having been drowned in consequence of a collision caused by neglect of the officers and crew of the ship, it was held that as the company would not have been liable to the passenger himself they were consequently not liable in an action on Lord Campbell's Act brought by his executors. In Senior v. Ward ([43]) it was held that contributory negligence by the deceased was a defence to an action under the statute brought by his widow. In Griffiths v. Earl of Dudley ([44]), the deceased was a workman in the employ of the defendant who had expressly contracted that the defendant should not be liable in the case of an injury such as that which caused his death, and it was held that no action could be maintained under the statute. In Read v. Great Eastern Ry. Co. ([45]), Blackburn J. treats a bar of the right of action by the deceased by the operation of the Statue of Limitations, six years having elapsed in the interval between the injury and the death without any action having been brought, as equivalent to a bar by satisfaction or release, saying\nMr. Codd was driven to argue that the present right of action did not arise till the death of the deceased, and that although six years elapsed before the party died from the effects of the wrongful act, neglect or default, and although he in his lifetime received compensation, his executors might bring another action after his death but that would be straining the words of the statute.\nIt is to be remarked that this case of Read v. Great Eastern Ry.Co. is also reported in Law Reports 3 Queen's Bench 555, but that the passage just quoted is not to be found in that report. Best and Smith however appear to have been the authorised reporters to the Court of Queen's Bench at the time of the decision and their report is therefore to be regarded as the more authentic.\nNow, the question we have to determine in the present case, which in this aspect of it comes before us on an appeal from the judgment of the court below on the motion in arrest of judgment, or for judgment non obstante made by the defendants in the Court of Re\u00b0 view, is '. whether the deceased husband and father of the plaintiffs retained up to the time of his death a good right of action against the defendants in respect of the injury he had received, or whether the right. to maintain such an action had not been extinguished by the prescription of the article 2262.\nThe procedure on a motion for judgment non obstante is provided for by article 433 of the Code of Procedure and article 431 regulates the proceedings on a motion in arrest of judgment. As I understood the argument it was not disputed by the learned counsel for the respondents that it did appear upon the record both from the pleadings and the evidence (all of which are open for consideration on motions of this kind,) that more than a year had elapsed in the interval between the injury received by the deceased and the time of his death, and that any objection founded on this was open on these motions. It was, however, strenuously contended on the part of the respondents that the action of the present plaintiffs was in no way dependant on the subsistence of a right of action in the deceased up to the date of his death inasmuch as their action was an entirely new and independent one,) and further that even if it were, the respondents (plaintiffs) had notwithstanding, under the express provision of article 1056, the right to maintain an action begun at any time within a year after the death of the deceased, and lastly, that at all events the defence, that the action of the deceased had been extinguished by prescription, could not be set up inasmuch as it had not been pleaded.\nAs I have before said I am of opinion that the action being of the same nature, and indeed the same action in all respects, as that conferred by Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, it must as an action on that statute is considered in England, be deemed to be a new action, hut still a new action dependent on the condition that the action of the deceased had not at the time of his death been barred or extinguished.\nIt therefore only remains to consider the other propositions advanced by the respondents. That the provisions of article 1056 do not entitle the consort and relations mentioned in the article to sue in a case where the original action of the party deceased was extinguished before his death by satisfaction or release is I think, abundantly clear from the English authorities decided under Lord Campbell's Act. No case appears to have arisen in England in which the right of action of the deceased had been barred by the Statue of Limitations, but in the passage which I have before quoted from Mr. Justice Blackburn's judgment in Read v. Great Eastern Railway Co. ([46]), he puts the case of the action having been barred by the statute as one in which it would be s straining the words of the statute \" to admit the action. Then it is to be observed that whilst the English Statue of Limitations only bars the remedy, leaving the right still subsisting, here the article 2262 is not merely a bar to the remedy but an actual extinguishment of the obligation arising from the delict, for the article 2267 expressly provides that in \" all the cases mentioned in articles 2250, 2260, 2261 and \"2262 the debt is absolutely extinguished and no action can be maintained after the delay for prescription has expired.\" If, therefore, the bar of the remedy by the Statute of Limitations would constitute a defence in England a fortiori must be the prescription of the article 2262, which not merely bars the remedy but is extinctive of the obligation, so operate in the Province of Quebec.\nThere is, however, contained in the article 2262 a saving of the special provision contained in article 1056. This unquestionably refers to the proviso in article 1056 that the consort or designated relations of the deceased shall have \" but only within a year after his death \" a right to bring an action. These words are, in my opinion, quite immaterial in the present case. It could not be pretended that they would apply so as to give a right to sue in a case in which the deceased had accepted satisfaction or released the action, and if so there is no more reason why they should apply in a case where his action had been before his death extinguished by prescription. Moreover, if the contrary interpretation were adopted and they should be held to apply in a case where the. death had been but a short time after the expiration of a year from the injury they would equally apply to save an action to the representatives when the death had occurred twenty years after the wrongful act. It never can be supposed that the legislature intended to leave such an action Uncovered by some prescription which would, however, be the result of attributing to the article the interpretation contended for by the respondents. The meaning of the article is, however, apparent; it applies to enlarge the period of prescription and to give the consort and relations a full year from the date of the death within which to bring their action without joining, as against them the time which may have elapsed in the lifetime of the deceased in a case in which the death of the deceased occurs before it has been barred by prescription.\nAs regards the question of pleading the defence that the action of the deceased had been prescribed I am of opinion that we are bound to take notice of that defence as fully as if it had been formally pleaded. We are told by the authors that it was always a question under the old law whether the court was bound to notice extinctive prescriptions when the parties had not pleaded them, the basis of the controversy having been the debated question whether prescription was founded on presumption of satisfaction or was a law of public order. The authorities, it seemed, differed upon this question ([47]). In order to settle the dispute it was enacted by the French Code that the prescription must be set up by the party art. 2223, but by article 2188 of the Quebec Code the question was solved the other way and it was provided that: \" The court cannot of its own motion supply the defence resulting from prescription except in cases where the right of action is denied.\" Then by the conjoint operation of the articles 2262and 2267 this right of action is most undoubtedly denied, the denial of the right of action thus referred to being intended to distinguish such cases of prescription as these to which the articles last mentioned apply from those in which the prescription amounts to no more than a mere presumption of payment.\nThis point as to the right of the court to act on a defence of prescription not pleaded has arisen in several cases both here and in the courts of the Province of Quebec and it has been decided more than once that the court must notice extinctive prescription though not pleaded. My brother Taschereuu will refer particularly to this point and to the authorities which support his view.\nIf then the court may, without plea, take ex officio notice of the prescription in a case where it is set up directly, as extinguishing the action before the court, I see no reason why it .should not be equally noticed without requiring it to be pleaded in a case like the present where it is relied on as shewing the extinction of the riot of action the continued existence of which to the death of the deceased is by the law made an indispensable condition to the maintenance of an action like that under appeal. I can see no distinction between the two cases. The same reason applies to both. Extinctive prescription does not require to be pleaded because it is a law of public order a reason which applies at least as strongly to a case like the present where it is used to show that no cause of action ever arose as to a case where it is admitted there was originally a cause of action, but one which has been extinguished by lapse of time.\nThis appeal also included the judgment refusing a new trial, and it was very strenuously insisted by Mr. Abbott, for the appellants, that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the amount of damages given by the jury. It is to me very manifest that this objection is well founded, but I do not enter upon a consideration of it for the reason that I think we must allow the appeal and order judgment to be entered for the appellants upon the other grounds before mentioned.\nAppeal allowed with costs to appellants in all the courts and judgment to be entered for defendants in the Superior Court non obstante vedicto.\nFOURNIER J. \u2014Le pr\u00e9sent appel est d'un jugement rendu \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 par la Jour du Banc de le Reine, le 19 janvier 1890, confirmant le jugement de la Cour de Revision si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, lequel avait renvoy\u00e9 les trois motions de l'appelante, 1 pour jugement non obstante veredicto; 2 en arr\u00eat de jugement, et 3 pour un nouveau proc\u00e8s et accord\u00e9 la motion de l'intim\u00e9e pour jugement conform\u00e9ment au verdict rendu par le jur\u00e9 sur un second proc\u00eas de cette cause.\nL'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e le 17 mai 1884, par l'intim\u00e9e, tant pour elle-m\u00eame qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 son enfant mineur, pour recouvrer les dommages leur r\u00e9sultant de la mort de Patrick Flynn mari de l'intim\u00e9e et p\u00e8re de son enfant mineur. Cette mort avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la suite d'un accident arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Flynn par la faute et n\u00e9gligence de l'appelante. L'intim\u00e9e concluait \u00e0 $10,000 de dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nL'appelante a plaid\u00e9 que l'accident en question n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cause par aucune faute ou n\u00e9gligence de sa part, ni de la part d'aucun de ses employ\u00e9s, mais qu'au contraire,\u2014il n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cause que par la faute et n\u00e9gligence du dit Patrick Flynn. Sur la contestation ainsi li\u00e9e, le proc\u00e8s eut lieu sous la pr\u00e9sidence de l'hon. juge Doherty, et un verdict fut rendu en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e pour $2,000 et de $1,000 en faveur de son enfant mineur. Jugement fut rendu par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour de Revision renvoyant la motion de l'intim\u00e9e pour jugement et accordait la motion de l'appelante pour un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Sur appel \u00e0 la Cour du Bane de la Reine ce jugement fut renserv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 des juges de cette Cour par un jugement accordant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e le montant de son verdict.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Bane de la Reine ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la revision de cette cour ii intervint le 20 janvier 1887 en faveur de l'appelante, un jugement lui accordant un nouveau proc\u00e8s, sur le principe que le juge avait err\u00e9 en disant aux jur\u00e9s \"qu'ils avaient le droit et pouvaient prendre en consid\u00e9ration dans l'\u00e9valuation des dommages les angoisses et les peines d'esprit de la m\u00e8re et de l'orpheline.\"\nLa cause \u00e9tant revenue devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour faire fixer un jour pour le proc\u00e8s, l'appelante apr\u00e8s plus, de trois ans de contestation fit motion pour amender son plaidoyer et obtint la permission de plaider de nouveau. Une nouvelle \u00e9nonciation de faits fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9e pour \u00eatre soumise au juge. Le proc\u00e8s eut lieu les 28 et 29 novembre, et le jur\u00e9 rendit un verdict do $4500 en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e et de $2000 en faveur de son enfant mineur.\nL'appelante fit alors \u00e0 l'encontre de ce verdict les trois motions mentionn\u00e9es plus haut. L'intim\u00e9e de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 fit motion pour jugement en sa faveur conform\u00e9ment au verdict.\nLes deux premi\u00e8res motions, celle pour jugement nonobstant le verdict et celle en arr\u00eat du jugement sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 fond\u00e9es sur les m\u00eames raisons savoir \u00b0. que le droit de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait \u00e9teint et prescrit des avantl'institution de son action, parce que Patrick Flynn, son mari ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de l'accident le 22 ao\u00fbt 1882, n'\u00e9tait mont que le 13 novembre 1883, plus d'un an et trois mois apr\u00e8s, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 une \u00e9poque ou l'action de Flynn, s'il e\u00fbt v\u00e9cu, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrite.\nCette pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante est toute nouvelle et est formul\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois sur le d\u00e9bats de ces motions. Il n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune mention dans les d\u00e9fenses \u00e0 l'action ni dans les plaidoiries orales. Les d\u00e9fenses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame amend\u00e9es sans qu'on ait soulev\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention. Les raisons invoqu\u00e9es an soutien de la motion pour un nouveau proc\u00e8s, \u00e9taient que la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve est en faveur de l'appelante; que Flynn ne fut pas bless\u00e9 pendant qu'il \u00e9tait an service et sous les ordres de l'appelante, mais par sa propre faute et n\u00e9gligence; que le verdict est irr\u00e9gulier et d\u00e9fectueux, parce que les r\u00e9ponses sont vagues incertaines et contradictoires et que le montant accord\u00e9 est excessif.\nDevant la Cour de Revision on a fort savamment d\u00e9battu la question de savoir laquelle des deux prescriptions de celle d'un an en vertu de l'article 2262 on de celle de deux ans en vertu de l'article 2261 doit s'appliquer au cas du quasi-d\u00e9lit dont le mari de la demanderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Mais avant de rechercher la solution de cette question, il laudrait d'abord \u00e9tablir qu'il s'agit dans cette cause du droit d'action du mari. Tel n'est pas le cas ii n'est nullement question ici de la r\u00e9clamation que le mari aurait en s'il e\u00fbt v\u00e9cu. il s'agit uniquement de l'action donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, par l'article 1056, action qui ne peut exister qu'apr\u00e8s la mort du mari sans avoir re\u00e7u de compensation pour ses dommages.\nL'action donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e dans les circonstances de cette cause est de date assez r\u00e9cente. Elle a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite par le statut C.S.C. ch. 78 qui lui m\u00eame n'\u00e9tait pour ainsi dire que la copie du statut imp\u00e9ria 19-10 Vic ch. 93 commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 le Lord Campbell's Act. Ces dispositions l\u00e9gislatives font maintenant partie du code civil dans lequel elles sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9es SOUS l'article 1056. C'est dans cet article seul que l'on doit trouver Ia source du droit de l'action de l'intim\u00e9e. Ii lui est accord\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re suivante:\n1056. Dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re, mere et enfants ont pendant ' l'ann\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e9s, droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l'auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants pour les dommages-int\u00e8r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e8c\u00e8s.\nL'action dont il s'agit n'est pas celle qu'aurait eu Flynn pour dommages lui resultant de ses blessures et des souffrances qu'il avait eu \u00e0 supporter; c'est l'action sp\u00e9ciale accord\u00e9e \u00e0 sa veuve pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats lui resultant de la mort de son mari. Elle lui est accord\u00e9e personnellement et non en aucune qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentante de son mari. Elle ne r\u00e9clame pas du chef de son mari comme \u00e9tant \u00e0 ses droits, soit comme l\u00e9gataire ou autrement, l'indemnit\u00e9 qu'il aurait en droit d'avoir. Non elle exerce l'action qui lui est donn\u00e9e par i'article 1056, ind\u00e9pendamment de tous droits pouvant appartenir \u00e0 son mari, elle ne derive son droit d'action que du statut, c'est-\u00e0-dire du code, et nullement de son mari Son action n'existe m\u00e8me pas du vivant de son mari; comment peut-on dire qu'elle depend de i'existence du droit d'action de son mari, et que s'il a laiss\u00e9 \u00e9teindre ou prescrire son droit autre-ment que par l'acceptation d'une indemnit\u00e9, la perte de son droit entraine aussi celle du droit de sa femme qui n'est pas son h\u00e9riti\u0141re ou repr\u00e9sentante l\u00e9gale, et qui n\u00e9 r\u00e9clame pas de son chef, mais quelle poss\u00e8de en vertu d'une disposition toute sp\u00e9ciale et personnelle en sa faveur. Une telle pr\u00e9tention est si \u00e9videmment fausse qu'elle se refute d'elle-m\u00e8me.\nCe droit d'action reconnu \u00e0 la femme est un droit conditionnel. Pour qu'il existe ii faut d'abord que son marni n'ait pas accep\u00e9\u00e9 de compensation pour les cons\u00e8- quences du d\u00e9lit ou quasi d\u00e9lit dont ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s qu'apr\u00e8s de son mari que le droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l'auteur, pour les dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats resultant de tel d\u00e9ces, prend naissance par 1 existence do la condition.\nSon marl \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 13 novembre 1883 sans avoir accep\u00e9\u00e9 ii re\u00e7u aucune compensation pour ses dommages, ce n'est qu'\u00e0 compter du moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s quo le droit d'action de, l'intim\u00e9e a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exister. Mais d'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9trange proposition de l'appelante que le droit d'action du marni \u00e9tait prescrit celui de Ia femme doit \u00e9galement l'\u00eatre, et m\u00eame avant d'avoir exist\u00e9, puisqu'au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari le droit de ce dernier \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 prescrit. Que fait-on de Ia disposition qui accorde \u00e0 Ia femme son droit d'action pendant l'ann\u00e9e, seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s? On l'ignore tout simplement, ou mieux encore on a recours \u00e0 une subtilit\u00e9 aussi ing\u00e9nieuse que pen honn\u00eate, pour d\u00e9truire son droit d'action en pr\u00e9tendant qu'il n'\u00e9tait que le m\u00eame droit que celui de son mari, ayant pour origine le m\u00eame quasi-delit et que le mari ayant laiss\u00e9 prescrire son action, celle de la femme l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement. D'abord, il n'est pas vrai que l'action du mari soit Ia memo que celle de la femme. Elles no naissent pas en m\u00eame temps et la nature en est diff\u00e9rente. Cello du mari prend naissance imm\u00e9diatement apr\u0141s l'accident, et tant qu'elle existe la femme n'a elle-m\u00eame aucun droit d'action. L'action du mari a pour objet do r\u00e9clamer ses dommages lui resultant do ses blessures, perte do temps, etc., etc. Cello do la femme est limit\u00e9e aux dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats resultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s do son mari.\nComment pout-on appliquer la memo proscription. que ce soit celle d'un an on do deux ans et los faire courie do la date do l'accident contre los actions respectives du mari et do la femme? Si c'est celle d'un an; dans le cas actuel, le mari \u00e9tant mort plus de quinze mois apr\u00e8s l'accident, l'action de la femme \u00e9tait prescrite avant la naissance de son droit d'action, que la loi ne lui accorde cu'\u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s C'est d\u00e9truire en entier l'effet de l'article. La vraie date de la prescription de l'action de la femme est Si clairement et positivement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le code, qu'il me parait absurde de chercher \u00e0 en \u00e9tablir une autre: c'est, dit l'article 1056, pendant l'ann\u00e9e seulement, \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, que la femme aura droit de poursuivre l'auteur du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Tant qu'iI ne s'est pas \u00e9coul\u00e9 un an depuis le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari, la femme a droit d'exercer son action, comme dans le cas actuel, et ii est tout \u00e0, fait indiff\u00e9rent pour ce qui la regarde que la prescription, soit dun an on de deux ans, quant \u00e0 l'action qu'aurait que son mari. Son action \u00e0 elle qui nait an d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari ne peut pas durer plus d'un an et n'est nullement li\u00e9e an sort du droit d'action de son mari. Les tribunaux n'ont pas le droit d'\u00e9tendre ni de diminuer la dur\u00e9e de son action elle a droit de l'exercer pendant toute l'ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari. Puisque tant que son mari n'est pas mont la femme ne peut exercer aucun droit d'action son action ne peut donc \u00eatre prescrite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la maxime contra non, valenlem agere nulla currit presciptio.\nCette action de la .femme me para\u00eet assez, solidement appuy\u00e8e sur l'articl\u00e9 1056, pour qu'il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter les questions de savoir si ce n'est pas plut\u00f4t la prescription de deux ans de l'article 2261, que l'on doit appliquer au cas actuel. En effet l'accident dont il s'agit n'est qu'un par quasi-d\u00e9lit, dans lequel l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de la malice n'entre nullement\nL'hon. juge en chef Sir A. A. Dorion, apr\u00e8s avoir exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que la prescription de l'action du mari dans le cas actuel, ne devait commencer \u00e0 courir qu'apr\u00e8s l'expiration des quinze mois pendant lesquels ii a surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 l'accident, s'exprime ainsi, dans son jugement sur cette cause au sujet de la prescription de l'action de la femme.\nThis is not an action by the injured person, but a different action. The civil code, article 1056, gives to the widow and children of one who dies from injuries received from the negligence of another, an action against the guilty party. This action is not given to them in any representative quality, and the article expressly provides that it may be brought within a year from the decease of the injured party. The prescription against the action of the decease did not therefore apply to the action of the wife and children This was the opinion of the majority of the Court; of Review, and it will be unanimously affirmed by this court.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J. By section 1 of ch. 78 C.S. C., it is enacted that:\u2013\nWhenever the death of a person has been caused by such wrongful act, neglect or default, as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof in such case the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death has been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony\nSince this case was before this court in 1887 as reported in 14 Can. S. C. R. 105 that statute has been expressly repealed by the Revised Statutes of Quebec, appendix A; hut under 50 Vic. ch. 5, ss. 5, 6 and 7, such repeal could it otherwise do so, does not affect the present case. Then, I do not see that it adds anything to the repeal enacted by article 2633 C. C. of all previous laws on maters upon which express provision is made in the code. So that for our determination of the controversy as it is now presented, the law is precisely the same as it was when the case first came to us. Now, I take it to be concluded by the judgment of this court, upon that first appeal, that this action. avowedly brought under article 1056 of the code, is nothing else but the statutory action given in England by Lord Campbell's act, and consequently that, in expounding the law as to its nature and the. principles upon which it rests, we must be guided by the same consideration and governed by the same rules, that have been authoritatively adopted and re-cognized in the construction of that act. And one of these rules I would say to-day an uncontroverted one, is that under the act the widow or other relatives therein mentioned have no action if, at the time of his death the deceased had none.\nThe leading case on the question is Read v. Great Eastern Railway Jo. ([48]), where it was determined, upon that principle that if the deceased has accepted any compensation in satisfaction of his claim against the defendant, his personal representatives are debarred from bringing any action under the statute. The statute does not give any new right of action, or a fresh cause of action said the court and if the deceased has received compensation he could not have maintained an action and recovered damages in respect thereof in the very words of the statute so this plaintiff has herself no action.\" And as Lush J. said in the same case, as reported in 9 B. & S.:\u2014\nThe statute gives a light of action when there was at the time of the. death a subsisting cause of action.\nIn Haigh v. Royal Mail Steam Packet Co, ([49]), Brett M. E. speaking of the same statute said:\u2014\nUnder which it is 'clear the executors can only recover if the deceased man could have recovered, supposing that everything did happen to him which, had he not been killed, would have entitled him to bring an action. I refer also to Armsworth v. South Eastern R R. Co. ([50]), Tucker v. Chaplin ([51]), Boulter v. Webster ([52]), Griffiths v. The Earl of Dudley ([53]), on the same principle. Again it was held that, if the deceased, being a workman, had contracted for himself or his representatives with his employer not to claim compensation for personal injury, whether resulting in death or not his widow had no action under Lord Campbell's act for the damages resulting to her from his death. The plaintiff had argued that the act gives a separate and independent right to the widow and children of a person killed, a right wholly separate from any right existing in the decedent's legal representatives, to recover for injuries to his personal estate But said Field J.:\nRead v. Great Eastern ([54]) is a clear decision that Lord Campbell's act did not give any new cause of action, but only substituted the right of the representative to sue in. the place of the right which the deceased himself would have had if he had survived\nAnd Cave J. added:\nIt was argued that whether or not the deceased could have bargained away his own right to recover damages, he could not bargain away the right of his family under Lord Campbell's act. That act was passed because it was thought a hardship that, where a man sustained personal injuries, and died without having himself recovered compensation leaving behind; him persons incertain degrees of relationship, those persons should not be entitled to bring an action. Read v. Great Eastern (5) has decided that the act gives no new cause of action to the relatives, but only a right in substitution for the right of action which the deceased would have had if he had survived.\nAnd in Senior v. Ward ([55]) Lord Campbell C.J. said:\nWe conceive that the legislature in passing the statute upon which this action is brought intended to give an action to the representatives of a person killed by negligence only where, had he survived, he himself at the common law. could have maintained an action against the person guilty of the alleged negligence. It is true that in Pym v. Great Northern railway Go ([56]) in the Exchequer Chamber, Erie C.J. said:\nThe statute, as appears to me, gives to the personal representative a cause of action beyond that which the deceased would have had if he had survived and based on different principles.\nbut that sentence is used, merely in reference to the extent of the damages that can be recovered on an action under the act and the words c cause of action,\" as the context of the judgment dearly shows, simply refer to those damages. The same remark applies to Blake v. Midland ([57]) where it was Said that:\nThe statute does not transfer this right of action to the representatives but gives him a totally new right of action.\nIn that case also the only question under consideration was the nature and extent of the damages recoverable on an action under the act\nIn Seward v. The Vera Cruz ([58]), in the House of Lords where the point under consideration was, whether the Admiralty Court had jurisdiction on an action under the act, though Lord Seaborne said that the act gives a new cause of action, and Lord Blackburn (who in Read v. Great Eastern ([59]) had said, \"the statute does not give a new right of action \") added \" an action new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principle, and in every way new,\" there was not a single expression thrown out that could be interpreted as questioning this decision in Read v. Great Eastern (), or as casting the least doubt on the doctrine that to maintain an action under the act, there must have been at the time of the death for which damages are claimed a subsisting cause of action, and that when the deceased, either voluntarily or involuntarily, had placed himself in a position that, had he survived, he could not at the time of his death, have brought \u201can action for his personal injury, no new right of action had been conferred to replace that which, through his own conduct, had never arisen or had been extinguished. Beven on Negligence ([60]).\nIn the Untied States a similar statute has received the same construction in the following cases: in Dibble v. New York ([61]) the defendants had settled with the deceased his claim for his injuries. The judge at the trial had charged the jury that this settlement could not affect the widow's action which was given to her by the statute for the damages She had sustained by reason of her husband's death. But the court held that such was not the law, and that \"the right to such an action depends not only upon the character of the act from which death ensued but upon the condition of the decedents claim at the time of his death, and if the claim was in such a shape that he could not then have enforced it had death not ensued. the statute gives the executors no right of action and creates no liability whatever on the \"part of the person inflicting the injury.\"\nJohnson J., for the court, said:\nWhen death ensued, therefore, the deceased had no subsisting cause of action; nor could he have maintained any action and recovered any damages, in respect of the act or the injury, if death had not ensued.\nThe right of action which he might have enforced had he survived the injury, upon his death accrues to the personal representative. And it is given for the same wrongful act or neglect. That is the essential foundation of the action in either case. The wrong to be redressed is the same in both cases, but the injury flowing from the wrong to be compensated is different. The person injured is compensated for the injury to his person, the others for the injury they sustained from the death of the injured person. If the person injured obtained satisfaction by action or by voluntary settlement and payment before death ensues, the wrongful act which caused the injury, and all the consequences past and future, are included, and the whole cancelled together, and the liability of the person inflicting the injury ended The object of the statute was to continue the cause of action for the benefit of the widow and next of kin, to enable them to obtain their damages resulting from the same primary cause, and not create an entirely new and additional right of action.\nAnd Comstock O.J., in the same case, in appeal, reported in Whitford v. The Panama Ry. Co. ([62]), said:\nNo new cause of action is created by the legislature, hut the cause which by the rules of the common law, has become lapsed or lost by the death of the person to whom it belonged, is continued and devolved upon his administrator. The opposing argument is founded wholly on the idea that the cause of suit by the administrator is the death of the party, and not the wrongful assault or negligent conduct by which it is occasioned In the view of the statute, therefore, the right to be enforced is not an original one, springing into existence from the death of the intestate, but is one having a previous existence, with the incident of survivorship derived from the statute itself. The true point of inquiry is whether a wrong of this nature, resulting in death, affords more than a single cause of action. Now to affirm that, in cases of this nature two causes of suit arise one in favor of the decedent in his lifetime, the other founded on his death, is to depart from the plainest legal analogies.\nIn Littlewood v. The Mayor, &, of New York ([63]) also where the deceased had recovered before his death for his damages aft action by his widow was held not to be maintainable.\nRapallo J., for the court, said;\nIt seems to me very evident that the only defence of which the wrongdoer was intended to be deprived was that afforded him by the death of the party injured, and that it is, to say the least, assumed throughout the act that, at the time of such death, the defendant was liable. The statute may well be construed as meaning that the party who at the time of the bringing of the action, would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action notwithstanding the death.\nIn Fowlks v. The N. & D. Ry. Co. ([64]) the statute governing the case decreed, in one of its sections, that the right of action which a person who dies from injuries received from another, or where death is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another would have had against a wrongdoer, in case death had not ensued, would not abate or be extinguished by his death, but was to pass to his personal representative for the benefit of his widow and next of kin. There was no statute of limitation expressly applicable to that class of cases. But by another section of the statute it was provided that action for personal injuries should be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued. The court held that under this last section the cause of the survivors'' action accrued when the injury was received or at the time of the wrongful act or omission, and that consequently, as to their action, the statutory limitation of one year began to run from that time as it would have for the decedent's action itself had he survived his injuries.\nTheir action, say the court is bought for the same cause as if the injured party had himself brought the action, and it is not the death of the injured party that is the cause of the survivors' action The-argument that the action allowed by the statute is a new action given to the personal representative, an action that the injured party could not have maintained and that the action is given on account of the death, through plausible, is not sound.\nNow, applying these considerations to the present case, I am of opinion that the respondent's argument here in answer to the appellants' motion that her action is not an action transmitted to her by the deceased, but that it is a new action entirely different from that which the deceased had in his lifetime for his injuries is, as against the motion, unfounded in law and cannot support her claim Of course her action was not transmitted to her by the deceased. He never had an action for damages resulting from his own death. And her action is different in this that she claims the damages resulting from his death, whilst he would have claimed the damages resulting from the injury to himself; in other words, he would have \u2022 claimed his damages whilst she claims her own damages. Pym v. Great Nothern ([65]). But what is the cause of action in both cases \"Where did it originate? What gave birth to any right of action at all against the appellants? Is it not their negligent act from which the deceased suffered an injury y Is not the respondent's action for her damages based, as it could not but be, on that negligent act, as an action by the deceased for his own damages must itself have been? There is unquestionably only one article of the code under which the appellants' liability as tort feasors attaches; that is, art. 1053, which enacts that every person is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another. On that article only did an action by the deceased lie and on that article only does the basis of the respondent's action rest. The action is a new action in one sense as to her. It is the creature of the statute, or of art. 1056, and is new, entirely hew, in that respect. It originated for her at her husband's death, and is for damages that, for him, did not exist. But the measure of her right to have the appellants declared responsible towards her is to be ascertained by the rights the deceased himself had against them; and there is attached to her right of action the implied statutory condition that at the time of his death, her husband himself had a right of action. If his right was then gone, if the appellants were freed from any liability towards him she has no claim. The statute and the article of the code extend the remedy to her hut do not revive the appellants' liability if it had been extinguished. They simply give her the right to avail herself of the right to the action the deceased had at his death, enlarging its scope so as to embrace the actual pecuniary damages resulting to her from the death. The article of the code may not be so clear on this as the statute was, but in construing it, as it is not given as a new law, it has to be taken as a purely declaratory enactment, ([66]) and as such conferring no new or additional rights, apart from the damages, upon the widow and other surviving relatives therein mention- ed. And the fact that it was not in the code, as presented to the legislature, but was subsequently inserted by the commissioners as an omission in their report of a subsisting law, is confirmatory of that view. They cannot be presumed to have intended to make in that law a change they had no power to make, and before coming to the conclusion that they have inadvertently done so we must carefully ascertain that there is no room whatever for a different construction. Moreover, when by an express enactment, given as pre-existing law two years before the decision in Read v.Great Eastern ([67]) the code decreed that payment and satisfaction to the deceased for his damages bars the survivors' action for their damages, it clearly recognized that their action is not the so totally separate and independent one that the respondent would have us declare it to be.\nNow, in the present case, could Flynn, the respondent's husband at the time he died, but for his death have maintained an action against the appellants for the damages resulting to him from the accident in question under art. 1053 C. C., that is to say, after the expiration of one year from the time of the accident? I am of opinion that he could not.\nBy art. 1138 C. C. \" all obligations become extinct by prescription,\" and by art. 2183 \" prescription is a means of being discharged by lapse of time. Extinctive prescription is a bar to, in some cases precludes, any action for the fulfillment of an obligation or the acknowledgment of a right when the creditor has not preferred his claim within the time fixed by law.\" By art. 2262 actions for bodily injuries are prescribed by one year after the right of action accrued; and by art. 2267 after the lapse of one year the liability of the wrong doer is absolutely extinguished, and no action lies for the damages resulting from his offence or quasi. offence; or, in other words, no action lies for bodily injuries but during one year after the act of commission or omission by which they were caused, except in cases of continuous torts, d\u00e9lits or quasi-d\u00e9lits successifs, the doctrine as to which has no application in the present case. By art. 2188 the courts are bound of their own motion, to dismiss any action brought after the expiration of one year if limitation is not specially pleaded.\nThe respondent's contention that the only prescription that could have been opposed to an action by her husband, at the time he died, would have been that of two years under art. 2261 is unfounded. That article, in express terms, covers only offences and quasi offences where other provisions of the code do not apply.\nNow, when art. 2262 decrees that actions for bodily injuries are prescribed by one year, it means all actions for bodily injuries under art. 1053 with, of course, the limitative words of the article itself, s saving the special provisions contained in art, 1056 and cases regulated by special laws.\" The respondent, to support this contention that the prescription of two years under art. 2261 would have been the only one applicable to an action by Flynn, has based an argument on the French version of art. 2262. The words \" injures corporelles ' therein, she said, do not apply to a quasi' offence, but merely to an offence. There is no doubt that the word \" injures \" in this connection, is generally taken to mean an injure par vole de fait or an offence, d\u00e9lit ' yet Dareau ([68]) under the title \" Injures par action\" treats of the damages caused by the negligence of a carriage driver, or by an unskilful surgical operation and a case in our own courts Wood v. McCallum ([69]), used the terms an a action d'injures\" for malicious arrest of a person. .Another case of Smith v. Binet ([70]) says:\"The contents of a confidential letter are not the subject of an action d'injures.\" Even in the Roman law \" Quelquefois, le mot injure signifie dommage,\" says Thevenot-Dessaules ([71]).\nBut however this may be I do not attach any importance to it because the code itself gives an unmistakeable clue to the interpretation of the words as used in this article \"When the English version says \" bodily injuries,\" there is no room left for controversy. I take it that whether the article was first written in French or in English is immaterial if there is no absolute contradiction between the two versions In the case of ambiguity, where there is any possibility to reconcile the two one must be interpreted by the other. The English version cannot be read out of the law ([72]). It was submitted to the legislature, enacted and sanctioned simultaneously with the French one, and is law just as much as the French one is. Here the words bodily injuries leave no room for doubt, and we must conclude that injures corporelles mean bodily injuries, and that bodily injuries mean injures corporelles. In fact that is what the two versions of the code read together or by the light of one another, say in express terms.\nMoreover in this article 2262 itself there is intrinsically, and without reference to the English version, a clear interpretation of the term injures corporelles adverse to the respondent's contention on this point. The words therein s saving the special provisions contained in art. 1056 \" evidently and necessarily imply that the offences and quasi-offences mentioned in that article 1056 are both such as can be the cause of bodily injuries, or injures corporelles, for which art. 1053 gives an action and which that article itself (2262) decrees shall be prescribed by one year. Were the respondent's views to prevail it would follow that, as to offences, d\u00e9lits, causing death under art. 1056, the prescription of one year of art. 2262 would be the one to apply but that as to quasi-offences, quasi d\u00e9lits, causing death under the same article 1056, the only prescription applicable would be that of two years under art. 2261. I do not see anything in these articles that would justify such a distinction. I hold then that the majority of the Court of Review rightly came to the conclusion that, at the time of his death, Flynn's right of action was gone. Now, it must he conceded that, had he lived, and instituted an action against the company at any time after the expiration of a year, his action must have been dismissed even if the company had not contended it at all or if they had pleaded to the merits without invoking the prescription by the court itself of its own motion as I remarked before ([73]); and this even in a Court of Appeal, if it had escaped notice in the court of first instance. Such is the established jurisprudence of the province, and one which has received the direct sanction of this court in the two cases of Breakey v. Garter, and Dorion v. Crowley ([74]). In the recent case of corporation of Sherbrooke v Dufort ([75]) the Court of Queen's Bench has given anew full application to this doctrine. Now as to that saving clause itself of art. 2262 \"saving the special provisions contained in art. 1056 \" it is susceptible of only one construction, that is, that as to offences and quasi \u2014 offences followed by the death of the person injured thereby the widow and other relatives therein named are given a year after the death to bring their action, though at the time of the bringing of their action more than a year had elapsed since the offence or quasi \u2014 offence which caused the death, provided the deceased had not allowed his own action, given to him by art. 1053, to be extinguished by prescription. This construction is the only possible one if as I take it to be concluded by authority, it is in an essential condition of the survivor's right of action that the deceased, at his death, himself had a right of action. In the present case when Flynn died the company were freed from any liability for the consequence of their quasi \u2014 offence. It had been absolutely extinguished, and I do not see on what principle it could be contended that it was revived by his death in favor of his widow and child. That would be extending the right of the survivors under the act to an unlimited number of years, andas long as the injured party survives his injury, with one year additional, provided doctors could be found to swear, and a jury to find, that the quasi \u2014 offence was the immediate cause of the death. Now is that not against the very terms of art. 2267, which decrees that the liability of the wrongdoer is absolutely extinguished by effluxion of time and of art 2183 under which extinctive prescription precludes the action when it is not brought within the year? This saving clause of art. 2262 was undoubtedly inserted to obviate what would, otherwise, have evidently been a contradiction between the article itself and article 1056. Without it the widow would have had one year after the death, to bring her action only when the husband Would have died on the very day of the accident, and if he died, say ten months' after the accident she would have had only two months. With it she has one year after his death if he dies at any time within the twelve months and perhaps though unnecessary to decide here, if he dies after the twelve months but the prescription as against him has been interrupted by an action or otherwise. It was not in the article as passed by the legislature, and was inserted therein subsequently, as pre-existing law, by the commissioners, as was art. 1056 itself. The commissioners had not the power to make any amendments to the code as passed by the legislature, and therefore, in the construction of the two articles read together, as I previously remarked as to article 1056, we are bound to declare, as nothing directly to the contrary appears therein, that the law is precisely the same as it was before the code (except as for the time required for the prescription of actions for bodily in-juries which was specially enacted as new law), and consequently that under the code, as it was previously under the statute, any objection which would have been fatal to an action by the decedent at the time when he died must be fatal to an action by the survivors.\nNow, as to the contention that the prescription should have been pleaded by the company. On this point also I think the respondent fails. The argument that her action is based on art. 1056 and that consequently, prescription should have been pleaded as art. 2262 and art. 2267 do not apply to the said art. 1056 is based on a confusion of the matters in controversy. The basis of her action is art. 1058 not art. 1056 and the appellants do not at all contend that her action is prescribed. But they say that as Flynn's action, given to him by art. 1053 was by article 2262 prescribed when he died, and as by art. 2267, coupled with art. 2188, their liability was absolutely extinguished and he had then in law no right of action, consequently as art. 1056 only extends to her the right of action he had when he died she in law, has no action. The maxim contra non valentem agere nulla currit prescriptio, cited by the respondent, has no application whatever. it is not a new fact, but one resulting from the respondent's own declaration upon which the appellants rely in support of their motion l and they simply contend that upon the findings of the jury, assuming their absolute correctness, she has no claim against them. Troplong ([76]). They have pleaded a general d\u00e9n\u00e9gation, besides a plea, in an exception, that they were not indebted towards the respondent in any sum of money whatever. That was as unequivocally as could be, putting the respondent's right of action in issue. It has been argued that, had the appellants specially pleaded that the action had been prescribed before Flynn's death, the respondent might in reply have alleged facts to show that the prescription had been interrupted or renounced to. But that is precisely the ground of one of the allegations of her declaration, as follows:\u2014\u2014\nThat since the occurrence of the said accident and. since the death of the said Patrick Flynn the said plaintiff, acting for herself and her child, has been in continuons communication With the said defendants who have from time to time promised and agreed to compensate her for her great loss and damage, by reason of which the present action has been delayed, the said plaintiff believing in the good faith of the said defendants, but they failed and neglected, notwithstanding, to com-comply with their undertakings all of which the said plaintiff is ready and willing to establish.\nNow, of that allegation not only has the respondent made no proof whatever and is there no finding by the jury, but she obviously abandoned it altogether by assenting to an assignment of facts in which there is not a word, of it. Then apart from this such a contention, assuming Walker v. Sweet ([77]) to be correctly decided, if it were to prevail here, would, put an end. to the so-well established, right of invoking, these short prescriptions in ex parte actions, or without a special plea, at any stage of the proceedings and this even in appeal, for the first time. In every such case the plaintiff might also urge that, had prescription been pleaded, he would have been able to reply and prove that it had been interrupted. And is it quite sure that a plaintiff would be allowed by a replication such a departure from his original demand? Would not this be a new ground of action? If a plaintiff declares upon facts which in law do not show a right of action he has no locus standi; and if he base his demand on a right prima Sadie absolutely prescribed, and on which the law says he cannot maintain an action but relies upon other facts to rebut the prescription, he must allege these other facts in his declaration, and if he alleges them, but does not prove them, he must also fail, whether the prescription was pleaded or not. It seems to me here, upon this motion, that if by the respondent's declaration, aside from the allegation of promise to pay which she has abandoned as I said, it appears that, at his death, her husband had no action, as I think it clear it does the question is at an end. It was not necessary for the appellants to plead by exception p\u00e9remptoire a point of law which arises from the respondent's own allegation of fact Or to put the question in another shape, would not this action, but for that allegation of promise to pay, have been demurrable? Compare Lavoie v. Gregoire ([78]) and Filiatrault v. Grand Trunk ([79]). If a debt extin- guished by peremptory prescription be transferred, could it be contended on an action by the transferee that prescription must be specially pleaded by the debtor? Unquestionably not, and the transferee plaintiff could not ask the court not to give effect to the prescription, on the ground that had it been pleaded he might in reply have alleged interruption by the ' defendant in his dealings with the transferree. Now I think I am justified by the cases I have cited at the opening of my remarks to assimilate, in this respect, the action conferred on the survivors, by the statute, to an action by a transferree. By the statute, construed as I think it must be the wrongdoer has the same right to oppose to an action by the survivors the grounds of defence that he would have had against an action by the deceased that a debtor has to oppose to a transferee all the grounds of defence he would have had against the transferree. That must be so, if it is law as Read v. Great Eastern ([80]), and Griffiths v. The Earl of Dudley ([81]) held it to be, that no action lies under the statute if at the death there was not a subsisting cause of action.\nBy art. 431 C.P.C., the defendant has the right to move in arrest of judgment upon the verdict, whenever it appears on the face of the record that, notwithstanding the verdict, the plaintiff has no right to recover any sum. And by article 433, the court may non obstante veredicto, reader judgment in favor of the other party, if the allegations of the party who got the verdict are not sufficient in law to sustain his pretensions. These enactments, it seems to me, expressly recognize that it is not necessary for a defendant to plead questions of law which appear on the face of the record. There is no ambiguity in their terms that I can see and if they do not entitle the appellants here to the right to these motions I am at a loss to understand, what they mean. As to the contention of the respondent that she is entitled to invoke the appellants' pleading and sub sequent proceedings in the case as a waiver of their right to these motions, there is nothing in it. It is also evidently based on a misconception of the ground taken by the appellants as if they were relying on the prescription of the present action. Now, I repeat it, that it is not at all the ground they take. They simply deny that, upon the findings of the jury, she ever had a right of action. And I cannot conceive that their pleas or other proceedings could give her a right to an action which, as appears on the face of the record, they, ab initio put in issue, and which she never had and never can have.\nThere is one point upon which it is unnecessary to pass upon, yet which I must mention least my silence might be construed as an acquiescence to the propositions of law that were enunciated thereon in the course of the argument. Both parties seem to have taken it for granted that the prescription of art.\" 2262 was not based on a presumption of payment, but only on grounds of public policy. I would have thought it based on both. However, as the question was not argued I refer to it merely to remark, without coming to any determination whatever on the point that all that the commissioners say about it in their report could it affect the law, is that it is grounded upon the higher reason of public policy rather than on the presumption of payment. And it would seem to me that, in any liberating or extinctive prescription, even those falling under art. 2267, the element of presumption of payment is not to be considered as entirely eliminated. Domat says:\nToutes ces sortes de prescriptions qui font perdre des droits sont fond\u00e9es sur cette pr\u00e9somption que celui qui a. demeur\u00e9 si longtemps sans exiger sa dette en a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ou a reconnu qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait rien d\u00fb.\nI refer also to Pothier ([82]); Marcad\u00e9 ([83]); Boileux ([84]) Bigot-Pr\u00e9ameneu ([85]); Troplong ([86]); and authorities in Sirey ([87]) which is held by the commentators and the jurisprudence, to be grounded, as our art. 2262 is, less on a presumption of payment than on reasons of publie policy. Compare also Fuchs v. Legar\u00e9 ([88]), Jaron v Cloultier ([89]) and Giard v. Giard ([90]).\nIn the view I take of the case, it would be also unnecessary for me to refer to the evidence given at the trial. I will say a word, however, as to the contention argued at some length before us, on the part of the respondent, that the company had, by its conduct acknowledged its liability for this accident, and had thereby interrupted the prescription of Flynn's action, though in law it has no bearing on the case as it is presented to us, and is even not now open to the respondent, as by the assignment of facts no issue on this fact, by consent, was submitted to the jury. It is in evidence it is true, that Dr. Girdwood did make some offers to the deceased on the part of the company, but he distinctly swears that these offers were merely made as a gratuity and to relieve his immediate wants, without acknowledging any obligation whatever. Mr. Armine Nicholls likewise testifies that offers made to him as acting for Flynn by Mr. Drinkwater for the company were made without any acknowledgment of liability. Under these circumstances the following cases are entirely applicable here; L'ouvrier opposerait vainement comme ayant eu pour effet d'interrompre la prescription, le fait de la reception de secours donn\u00e9s par le patron, ces secours n'impliquant pas n\u00e9cessairement que le patron ait entendu reconna\u00eetre la r\u00easponsabilit\u00e9 qu'on pr\u00e9tend faire d\u00e9clarer \u00e0 sa charge.\nQu'\u00e0 supposer m\u00eame que la compagnie ait donn\u00e9 quelques secours \u00e0 Billebault, on ne saurait y voir une reconnaissance du droit de cet ouvrier, mais un acte de bien faisance fort naturel et que c\u00e9 serait arr\u00eater les louables elans de la charite que leur donner une portee qu'uks n'ont pas par eux-m\u00eames Bill\u00e9bault v. comp. de mines de Blanzy ([91]).\nL'action en r\u00e9sponsibilit\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e devant un tribunal. civil contre un patron \u00e0 raison d'un accident servenu a l'un do ses ouvriers dans la cours de son travail.\nEn pareil cas la prescription n'est ni suspendu par la minorit\u00e9 de l'ouvrier, ni interrompu par un-secours donn\u00e9 par le patron, accord\u00e9 a titre de commis\u00e9ration et ne pouvant impliouer Ia reconnaisance d'une dette In re Androit c Schneider et comp. ([92])\nI refer also \"to Dalloz ([93])\nThe formal judgment of the Court of Review,Wurtele J. dissenting, is based upon the ground that the prescription of Flynn's right of action should have been pleaded, and that by their pleas and subsequent proceedings in the cause the appellants had waived their right to now invoke such prescription. By the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal it does not appear that this judgment was confirmed upon other grounds; and I would have assumed that when the court merely says c considering there is no error, doth affirm,\" they had come to the same conclusion as the court below upon the same grounds. In the printed case submitted to us there are unfortunately no notes from any of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal. We have been referred, however, to what purports to be the opinion of the learned Chief Justice Dorion speaking for the court in M. L. R. 6 Q. B. 118 by which it would appear that their ratio decidendi taking a different ground from that of the first court, was that the prescription against Flynn's action did not at all apply-to the action of his wife and children the court there-by holding if I do not misunderstand them, that assuming that the appellants were freed from all liability towards Flynn before his death, and even if they had specially pleaded the prescription of Flynn's action, yet that the respondent was entitled to her action.\nI have come to the conclusion, after the best consideration 1 have been able to give to the case, for the reasons I have above given, that this judgment cannot be supported and that the motion of the respondent for judgment on the verdict should be dismissed, and the motion of the appellants for judgment in arrest of judgment or non obstante veredicto, should be allowed.\nAt the settling of the minutes it will be determined, after having heard the parties, if necessary, upon which of these motions judgment should be entered.\nGWYNEE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred with TASCHEREAU J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

(Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nPaul Huffman (Defendant) Respondent.\n1891: January 30; 1891: February 2; 1891: June 22.\nPresent: Sir W.J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Construction of railway\u2014Bond\u2014Condition\u2014Mutuality.\nH. tendered for the construction of a line of railway pursuant to an advertisement for tenders, and his offer was conditionally accepted. At the same time H. executed a bond reciting the fact of the tender and conditioned, within four days, to provide two acceptable sureties and deposit 5 per cent of the amount of his tender in the Bank of Montreal, and also to execute all necessary agreements for the commencement and completion of the work by specified dates, and the prosecution thereof until completed. These conditions were not performed and the contract was eventually given to other persons. In an action against H. on the bond:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the agreement made by the bond was unilateral; that the railway company was under no obligation to accept the sureties offered or to give H. the contract; that the bond and the agreement for the construction of the work were to be contemporaneous acts, and as no such agreement was entered into H. was not liable on the bond.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Armour C.J. at the trial.\nThe defendant submitted a tender for the construction of plaintiffs\u2019 line of railway and his tender was accepted. Then a bond was prepared and signed by the defendant which, after reciting the fact of defendant having so tendered, contained the following condition: \u201cNow the condition of the above written bond or obligation is such that if the said bounden Paul Huffman, to secure the completion of the said railway, shall, within four days from the date hereof, furnish two acceptable sureties to the said company, and deposit to the credit of the said company in Bank of Montreal at Brantford five per cent of the amount of his tender, and shall execute and complete all proper and necessary agreements for the construction and completion of the said railway by the fifteenth day of September now next, and the commencement of the construction of the said road by the fourth day of February now next, and the continuous prosecution thereof thereafter until completion, then the above obligation shall be null and void; otherwise shall remain in full force and virtue.\u201d\nThe defendant did not give the said security or make the deposit within four days, nor did he execute any agreement for the construction of the road, but he notified the company that he abandoned the contract. The contract was afterwards given to other parties and an action was brought against defendant on the said bond.\nThe action was tried before Armour C.J., who held it not maintainable, there having been no tender to defendant of the agreement to be signed. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nLash Q.C. and Wilson Q.C. for the appellants. In a suit for specific performance the defendant could have been compelled to execute the agreement. Sanderson v. Cockermouth Railway Co.[2]; Hart v. Hart[3]; Robertson v. Patterson[4]. The obligation to prepare the agreement was on the defendant. Parker v. Watt[5].\nOn the defence set up that defendant did not know his position when he signed the bond there was an issue for the jury. Ashby v. Day[6]; Hunter v. Walters[7]; Tamplin v. James[8].\nAt all events, the court had no power to order plaintiffs, who obtained a verdict for nominal damages, to pay defendant\u2019s costs. Wills v. Carman[9]. That would not make the appeal one for costs merely, but deals with a matter of principle.\nOsler Q.C. and Harley for the respondents. As to the question of costs it cannot be urged successfully, as the court will never interfere on such ground. Beatly v. Oille[10].\nThe defendant was induced to execute the bond without understanding its nature and scope. Vivers v. Tuck[11]; Duke of St. Albans v. Shore[12].\nThe company had made no financial arrangements for building the road when the bond was signed and was not in a position to assign the performance of the work by contract.\nThe following cases were referred to: Mackay v. Dick[13]; Budgett v. Binnington[14]; Marshall v. Berridge[15]; Pearce v. Watts[16]; Brundage v. Howard[17].\nSIR W. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the bond in this case was of a most unqualified, unilateral character. There was no acceptance by the plaintiffs of the defendant\u2019s tender, nor was there any binding contract on the part of the plaintiffs to give the defendant the contract. The company could give the contract to anyone they pleased until \u201call proper and necessary agreements for the construction and completion of the railway\u201d had been entered into. And as the resolution of the board of directors says \u201ca proper agreement satisfactory to the board\u201d had not been entered into, I cannot see how the defendant could furnish two acceptable sureties to secure the fulfilment of a contract which never had an existence, and which might never have an existence, and which the plaintiffs never prepared or tendered, as it seems to me they should have done. The terms of the contract were never settled and agreed on. It is true the commencement of the construction of the railway was to be on the 4th of February, and its completion by the 15th of September. To this day it does not appear that the terms of those proper and necessary agreements had been fixed, ascertained or agreed upon, and until the tender was accepted and these terms had been mutually aranged, surely the defendant was not to deposit 5 per cent. of the amount of his unaccepted tender, or to furnish two accepted sureties to secure the completion of the railway for the construction of which no contract had been agreed on.\nFor these reasons and for those given by the judges in the court below I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER JJ. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with Mr Justice Osler\u2019s reasoning in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The bond which the plaintiffs procured the defendant to sign appears to me to have been a clumsy mode adopted by the plaintiffs to extend the time for the defendant putting his tender into such a shape that it should be entertained by the plaintiffs. This the respondent, I have no doubt, understood, and I think he had good reason to understand, to have been the object and intent of the plaintiff in procuring him to execute the bond. The plaintiffs certainly had not entered into any obligation to give the defendant a contract to build their road; they not only reserved to themselves the right at their pleasure or caprice of rejecting the sureties the defendant might offer upon the pretence that they were not acceptable to the plaintiffs, but the terms of the contract were to be matters of subsequent negotiation, which might lead to nothing as the plaintiffs had not bound themselves to anything, as has been ably pointed out in the judgments of the chief justice of the Appeal Court for Ontario and Mr. Justice Osler, to which I can add nothing and in which I entirely concur.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Wilson & Watts.\nSolicitors for respondent: Harley & Sweet.\n[1] 18 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTitle to land\u2014Possession\u2014Nature of\u2014Statute of Limitations\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action against O. to recover possession of land it was shown that O. had been in possession for over twenty years; that he was originally in as caretaker for one of the owners; that afterwards the property was severed by judicial decree and such owner was ordered to convey certain portions to the others; that after the severance O. performed acts showing that he was still acting for the owners; and that he also exercised acts of ownership by enclosing the land with a fence and in other ways.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restoring that of Rose J. at the trial, that the severance of the property did not alter the relation between the owners and O.; that no act was done by O. at any time declaring that he would not continue to act as caretaker; and that his possession, therefore, continued to be that of caretaker and he had acquired no title by possession. Ryan v. Ryan (5 Can. S.C.R. 487) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment in favor of the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts of this case, which are stated at length in the report of the Court of Appeal are briefly as follows:\u2014\nThe action was one to recover possession of land claimed by defendant under title by prescription. The land had belonged to the father of plaintiffs, and the plaintiff Francis Heward had for several years been in possession of it exercising various acts of ownership, when in 1866 a suit was brought against him by the other heirs of his father resulting in a decree by which the land was declared to belong to the plaintiffs as tenants in common, and the said Francis was ordered to convey to the others their proportions.\nThe defendant was first put in possession of the land in 1853 by one Munro, who had purchased timber from F. Heward, to look after such timber and prevent its being stolen. The evidence showed that he remained in possession ever since, and that in several acts which he performed he professed to be acting under instructions from Heward. Nothing was proved as indicating an assertion of ownership in himself until about 1884 when he fenced a large portion of the land.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the decree made in the suit in 1866 effected a severance of the property, and that from that time the possession of the defendant ceased to be that of the plaintiffs, who could not, thereafter, contend that he was in as their caretaker. Accordingly, they reversed the judgment of the trial judge and held that the defendant had acquired title by possession. The plaintiffs appealed.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and MacMurchy for the appellants. O\u2019Donohoe originally took possession of the property as caretaker, and never having disclaimed that position he must be supposed to retain it. Lyell v. Kennedy[2].\nThe leading case in Ontario is Harris v. Mudie[3]; Ryan v. Ryan[4] is decisive in our favor.\nTrustees and Agency Co. v. Short[5] and Wall v. Stanwick[6] were also cited. Reeve Q.C. for the respondent referred to Sands v. Thompson[7]; Lewin on Trusts[8]; and Beckford v. Wade[9] to show that O\u2019Donohoe could not be considered a trustee for the owners of the land; and Coyne v. Broddy[10] as reviewing all the cases on the subject of title by possession.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J., Fournier and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice GWYNNE.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014For the purposes of this case it is quite unnecessary to inquire into the title or condition of the land which is the subject of this action prior to the suit in Chancery of Heward v. Heward mentioned in the case, which was a suit instituted in the court of chancery at Toronto by the brothers of the late Mr. Francis Heward, of one of whom, since deceased, the present plaintiffs are the children and heirs at law, against the said Francis Heward, to have him declared to be seized of the legal estate in fee of certain land mentioned in the pleadings in the Township of Scarboro, in the County of York and Province of Canada, in trust to divide and convey the lot to and among his brothers and himself in certain proportions. In that suit a decree was made on the 5th October, 1866, whereby it was in short substance and effect declared and adjudged that the said Francis Heward was seized of the legal estate in fee in the said land in trust as to one-eighth part thereof to the use of each of his brothers named respectively William B. Heward, John D. Heward, Stephen Heward and Augustus Heward, and as to the balance or four-eighths to his own use, and he was by the said decree ordered to convey the several one-eighth parts to his said respective brothers, free from all incumbrances done or suffered by him, and it was referred to the master to divide the said lot of land into the several parcels aforesaid, and it was ordered that each of the parties to the suit should execute mutual conveyances of their respective portions to each other, and the master was further directed to inquire as to incumbrances, and if there should be any the said Francis was directed to indemnify the other parties in respect thereof, and to account for rents and profits. Now that the defendant, at the time of the above decree having been made, was in the occupation of an old log house and of about half an acre of land around it, situate upon that portion of the said lot which is the subject of the present suit, solely by the mere license and permission of the said Francis Heward whose servant he was, to look after and protect the whole lot from trespassers, and that he had no possession otherwise than as such servant and caretaker of the said Francis Heward, has been found as a fact by the learned judge who tried the present case, the correctness of which finding is moreover, I think, established by the most undoubted evidence. In fact the defence of Francis Heward to the suit in chancery was that he had acquired title to his own absolute use by reason of his possession of the lot by the defendant as his servant and caretaker, and the defendant who was called by him in that case as a witness in support of that contention himself gave evidence that he was on the land solely by the permission of the said Francis Heward without any other claim to possession.\nBesides this evidence of the defendant himself in that suit there was most ample evidence given in the present action, altogether unimpeachable, which I think most conclusively establishes that both before and long subsequently to the making of the above decree, and during the lifetime of the said Francis Heward, the defendant continued to act and claimed the right to act in the same manner after the decree as before against persons whom he considered to be trespassing on the lot, and in the character of caretaker of and for the said Francis Heward or, as he in 1874-5 and 6 described himself and his occupation on the lot, as caretaker of the Heward \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201cestate.\u201d\nAt the time then of the above decree having been made it must be taken as conclusively established that the defendant\u2019s connection with the said land and his occupation of the old log house and the half-acre or thereabouts enclosed round it was solely as the servant of the said Francis Heward and caretaker of the property for him. Now as the said Francis Heward was by the decree declared to be a trustee for his four brothers as to their respective one\u2011eighth shares and was bound by the decree to convey, and to give possession of, those several one-eighth parts, when ascertained, to his said brothers respectively and their heirs, his servant could never set up any title by possession in himself as against any of those to whom the said Francis Heward, his master, was bound to convey their respective shares so long as he contested the decree or failed to fulfil the requirements thereof by conveying their respective shares to the parties declared by the decree entitled to have the legal estate therein vested in them. From the above decree Francis Heward appealed to the Court of Appeal, and in the meantime Augustus Heward, one of the brothers of Francis, having died an order of revivor was made on the 23rd of October, 1867, whereby the above plaintiffs, other than Frances Marie Heward, together with another brother of theirs, also named Augustus but since deceased, being the children and heirs at law of Augustus Heward then deceased, were made parties to the said suit in his stead; and thereupon and pending the said appeal of Francis Heward proceedings were instituted in the master\u2019s office under the references and inquiries directed by the decree. Upon the 30th June, 1868, the master reported among other things that he had divided the lands in the decree mentioned and that he had set apart four-eighth parts by metes and bounds for Francis Heward and the remaining four-eighths parts by metes and bounds for Francis Heward\u2019s three brothers William B. Heward, John D. Heward and Stephen Heward, and the children of the deceased Augustus Heward, who had been made parties to the suit by order of revivor. During the progress of the inquiries before the master it appeared that Francis Heward had mortgaged the property to one Col. Atcherley, which mortgage remained in full force unpaid and unsatisfied. By the decree Francis had been adjudged and directed to indemnify the other parties to the suit from all incumbrances done and suffered by him. He was, therefore, bound to have all the land, except so much as had been set apart for his own use, released from the operation of this mortgage. The master in his said report further reported that he found that there was due from Francis in respect of monies received for the piece of a portion of the land sold and conveyed by him, to the Grand Trunk Railway Company, and for timber growing on the land and sold by him., the sum of $3,004.87 over and above the amount payable by him upon the security of the said mortgage. When this report was made the appeal of Francis was still proceeding and continued so pending until the 22nd of January, 1869, when an order was made therein by the Court of Appeal, whereby the said cause was remitted back to the Court of Chancery to inquire whether the said defendant Francis Heward had, since the death of his father, had a continuous unbroken possession for twenty years of the land and premises in question in the said cause; and the court did further order that in case the evidence of such continuous and unbroken possession of the said Francis should be satisfactory to the said court the bill should be dismissed with costs, but that in case the said evidence should not be satisfactory as to such continuous and unbroken possession then the said appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThis order was made an order of the Court of Chancery on the 22nd February, 1869, and thereupon the case was again tried upon the issue by the said order in appeal directed to be tried. At this trial the defend ant was again examined as a witness on the part of Francis Heward, and gave his evidence to the like effect as that given by him upon his examination at the previous trial of the case. This trial resulted in an order being made in the said Court of Chancery whereby it was adjudged and declared that the said Francis Heward had not had such continuous and unbroken possession of the said land and premises. The case subsequently appears to have been again remitted to the master\u2019s office for the purpose of procuring effect to be given to the decree, for by a report made by the master dated the 23rd September, l873, he reported that he had divided by metes and bounds the west half of the said lands and premises in the decree mentioned among the then parties to the suit other than the defendant Francis Heward according to their respective rights and interests therein as declared by the said decree, and that he had allotted the parcel of land described and set out in a schedule annexed to his report as parcel No. 2 to the children of Augustus Heward deceased, who had been made parties defendants by the order of revivor, as tenants in common. This last piece of land is that which is in question in the present ac- tion, and it contains ten acres of land. One of the parties to whom it was allotted, who was also named Augustus, died at the city of Montreal on the day before that on which the above report bears date. The others are plaintiffs in the present action.\nIn what condition the mortgage to Col. Atcherley was at this time does not appear in the appeal case as laid before us, otherwise than it is said in the judgment of one of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal at Toronto that the mortgagee executed the statutory certificate of discharge of the mortgage so far as it effected the premises other than those allotted to Francis himself shortly after the date of the master\u2019s report, which report is not said but it would seem to be that dated the 23rd Sept., 1873, which is meant, for it is not likely that Francis should have procured to be executed, or that the mortgagee would have executed, a certificate of the discharge of the mortgage as to the part of the premises mentioned while Francis was insisting upon his own absolute title to the whole, and was contesting the claim of his brothers to have any interest whatever therein. But whenever the certificate of discharge was executed it only operated, when registered, as a conveyance or release to the mortgagor himself of the original estate which he had when he executed the mortgage; and that estate the decree in the original suit, and in that upon the inquiry directed by the Court of Appeal, has conclusively established to have been as to three several one-eighth parts in trust for three of his brothers, and as to another one-eighth part in trust for the children of his deceased brother Augustus, who had been made parties to the suit by the order of the court.\nA certificate of discharge of a mortgage when registered operates as a release of the mortgage and a conveyance of the original estate of the mortgagor to the mort- gagor, his heirs or assigns, or any person lawfully claiming by, through or under him or them; but neither the brothers of Francis Heward, the mortgagor, nor the plaintiffs, children of his deceased brother Augustus, with whom alone we are concerned in the present action, were ever in the position of persons claiming as the assignees of Francis, the mortgagor, nor by, through or under him. Their claim was of quite a different nature, and wholly independent of Francis, quite hostile in fact to him, and adverse to the claim asserted by him. Their claim was founded upon the decree made in the chancery suit against him and which he resisted to the utmost, and during his life never obeyed by executing conveyances of the portions of which the decree adjudged him to hold as a trustee upon the trust to convey to the plaintiffs the children of Augustus, with whom alone we are concerned, and to the others the several shares to which they were by the decree declared to be entitled, when the same should be ascertained and set apart by metes and bounds in the manner directed by the decree. No estate passed or was conveyed to the plaintiffs, children of Augustus, by force of Col. Atcherly signing the certificate of discharge mentioned in the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton, the plaintiffs, the said children, not having been persons claiming as assignees of the mortgagor or by, through or under him. The effect of the certificate of discharge was simply to revest in Francis, the mortgagor, the original estate which he had in that portion of the lands mortgaged which was mentioned in the certificate; which estate, the decree of the Court of Chancery conclusively adjudged to be, so far as the plaintiffs, the children of Augustus, are concerned, as trustee upon trust to convey to them the share which the decree adjudged them to be entitled to. It has been objected that the decree inaccurately declared Francis to hold the lands as trustee for himself and his brothers, whereas as was contended no one could be a trustee for himself, but refined criticisms of this nature cannot prejudice the rights of the plaintiffs in the present action for the obvious substantial meaning and effect of the decree is to declare that although the legal estate in possession was in Francis he held such estate as a trustee only, and upon trust to divide the property with his brothers and himself in certain stated proportions and upon trust to convey to his brothers respectively and their heirs their several portions when ascertained by metes and bounds in the manner directed in the decree. Upon the execution of the certificate of discharge of the mortgage by Francis\u2019s mortgagee Francis remained as much affected and bound by the decree as if the mortgage had never been executed by him, and he continued so to be until his death in 1880 in so far as the plaintiffs, the children of his deceased brother Augustus, were concerned, a trustee for them of their share, for he never during his life fulfilled the requirements of the decree by conveying to them the portion assigned to them by the master\u2019s report of the 23rd September, 1873, and as the defendant occupied the old log house only by permission of Francis, and as his servant, he could not, without showing clearly that relationship to have ceased, of which no evidence whatever was given, convert, at his pleasure, that possession into one which during the life of Francis, the trustee, could mature into a statutory title good against the cestuis que trustent of Francis. But there was, I think, abundant evidence that in point of fact the defendant had not, and that he did not claim to have, at any time between the making of the decree in the suit in which he had given his evidence and the death of Francis in 1880, nor for some years after his death, any possession whatever of any part of the ten acres in question in this suit other than the old log house and the patch of garden ground around it, which was enclosed with an old brush fence; all the rest had grown up into a wild waste piece of ground covered with scrubby bush of second growth, unenclosed; and that he still claimed to occupy the old log house by no other title than as caretaker of the property by permission of Francis, and for him or the Heward estate, as he sometimes spoke of his position in connection with the property, of the condition of which he seems to have been well aware. In conversation he spoke of the old log house as being on the piece of the land allotted to the children of a brother of Francis who had died in Montreal, and whose children still resided in Montreal, and that their portion could not be sold until the youngest should come of age. This referred to the plaintiffs, children of Augustus, three of whom at the time of the conversation referred to taking place were under age. He seems also to have been well aware that Mr. John Heward was looking, after the interests of these children, so far as the taxes upon the land set apart for them were concerned, and there was evidence also that the defendant claimed to be acting by the authority of Mr. John Heward, equally as of Francis, as caretaker of the property and to protect it from trespass and injury for all parties interested in the \u201cHeward estate\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d as he called it.\nMr. John Heward paid all the taxes assessed on the ten acres from 1876 to 1884 inclusive, but the defendant appears to have been taxed and to have had himself assessed for the old log house independently of the ten acres under the circumstances following.\nIn 1877 the defendant was assessed for the old log house and garden as one-tenth of an acre, and the ten acres were assessed as wild unoccupied land. In 1878 the defendant was assessed in like manner for the one-tenth of an acre, and by his direction Mr. John Heward was entered upon the assessment as the owner of the piece so assessed, and the ten acres were assessed as wild unoccupied land. In 1879 John O\u2019Donohoe, jr., was the name entered on the roll for the log house and garden, one-tenth of an acre, and John Heward as owner, as in 1878. Both the defendant and his son John directed the assessor to enter John Heward as owner. The ten acres were again assessed this year as wild unoccupied land. In 1880 the defendant was assessed for the house and garden one-tenth of an acre, and John Heward as owner, and the ten acres were assessed as in the year previous as wild unoccupied land; the same precisely was the assessment in 1881 and 1882. In each year the assessor always asked the defendant whether there was any alteration to be made in the mode of assessment from that in which it was made when he was directed to enter John Heward on the roll as owner, and being informed that there was not he entered the assessment on the roll accordingly. In 1883 a change was made the origin of which it will be convenient to state here. In that year the defendant had a conversation with one Melbourne who had purchased some land adjoining to the ten acres, part of the land allotted to Francis Heward; and the defendant, (apparently afraid that Melbourne would buy the ten acres upon which the log house in which he lived was situate, which possibly he himself contemplated buying when the youngest of the plaintiffs should come of age,) said to Melbourne, \u201cyou wont buy this place over my head,\u201d to which Melbourne replied that he would not, that he was going no further than he already had. In another conversation with Melbourne the defendant suggested that he thought he could make a claim to the ten acres; Melbourne replied that he did not think the defendant could make any claim to the place. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d said the defendant; to which Melbourne replied: \u201cDid you not go to the court and swear that you were in charge of it for Heward?\u201d Melbourne then advised him that if he wanted to get the place he must get himself assessed for it and pay the taxes some years and that he should fence in the place. Melbourne also said to the son John that unless they put a fence round the place they never could do any good, that is as to getting a title to the place\u2014that the only way was by fencing the place round and getting assessed for it; and he advised the defendant and his wife and his son John, all together, that they should have the land assessed in the son John\u2019s name, so that in case a title should be got for it he, who was a support to the father and mother in their old age, should have it. In accordance with this advice the defendant and his son John set about fencing the ten acres, which then for the first time was enclosed during the time that Melbourne knew it, namely, from 1872. This fencing was done some time in 1884. Now, in 1883 a change was made in the assessment and that change in perfect accordance with Melbourne\u2019s advice, namely, the son John O\u2019Donohoe, jr., was entered upon the roll and assessed for the ten acres; no separate assessment this year for the log house and garden. This change was made at the request of the son with the consent of his father; both were present when the assessment was entered on the roll, and both of them were consulted by the assessor as to its correctness as soon as it was made. In the following years down to 1888 the assessment was made in the same manner. Mr. John Heward in May, 1886, without any knowledge of the above mode of assessment, paid at the treasurer\u2019s office the taxes for 1883 and 1884. He did not pay for 1885 or subsequent years, because for those years the defendant or his son paid the taxes.\nNow, the plain conclusion, in my opinion, to be deduced from the evidence is:\u2014\n1st. That the plaintiffs never had the legal estate in the ten acres in question vested in them until the vesting order in their favor was issued by the Court of Chancery in the suit of Heward v. Heward in 1888.\n2ndly. That until 1884, when the defendant first enclosed the ten acres, he was not, in point of fact, in possession or occupation of any part of the ten acres other than the old log house and garden attached, which he had assessed to himself in 1877 and subsequent years as one\u2011tenth of an acre; and\n3rdly. That during the lifetime of Francis Heward, at any rate, as whose servant the defendant was in occupation as caretaker in 1869, he had not, in point of fact, nor did he claim to have, any possession of the log house otherwise than as such caretaker by the permission of Francis Heward for him and the parties for whom he was by the decree in the suit of Heward v. Howard adjudged to be a trustee, and that during the life of Francis the possession which the defendant had of the log house was the possession of Francis Heward as trustee for the plaintiffs, his cestuis que trustent under and by force of the decree in the chancery suit, and therefore the appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned judge who tried the case, in favor of the plaintiffs, restored.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in allowing this appeal. I do not propose to add anything to what has been said respecting the facts and the law as applied to those facts. I think the decision of Ryan v. Ryan[11] in this court covers the ground as far as the law is concerned. That decision reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, of which I was then a member. I delivered a dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal[12], and I refer to the report of it as containing a pretty full exposition of views upon some of the provisions of the Ontario statute of limitations to which I adhere, and which I believe to be substantially those acted upon by this court in allowing the appeal in that case.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Wells & McMurchy.\nSolicitors for respondent: Reeve & Woodworth.\n[1] 18 Ont.

In a conversation between the plaintiff, Smeaton, and the defendant, McRae, before the work was begun Smeaton was given to understand that the standard of the second class masonry to be built by plaintiffs was to be equal to that on the \u201cLoop Line\u201d another part of the Grand Trunk system, and shortly after McRae wrote to plaintiff instructing them to go on with the work \u201caccording to the plans and specifications furnished by the company.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs had completed a portion of their work when they were informed by the engineer in charge that the quality of second class masonry was to be of a higher standard than they had supposed, which would increase the cost of construction from twenty-five to thirty per cent, whereupon they refused to pro- ceed until Smeaton, who was present at the time, told them to go on and finish it as directed by the engineer and they would be paid. They then pulled down what they had built and proceeded as directed. When the work was nearly done Smeaton tried to back out of his agreement to pay the increased price, but renewed it on plaintiffs again threatening to stop the work. He refused to pay it, however, when the work was completed and an action was brought to recover it, in which the plaintiff obtained a verdict which was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal.\nThe Supreme Court held that on the evidence plaintiffs were justified in assuming, from the conversation between McRae & Smeaton, that the standard of quality for the second class masonry was to be that of the Loop Line; that their claim against the defendants was a bon\u00e2 fide one and the decision in their favor should be affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nBain Q.C. and Laidlaw Q.C. for the appellants.\nOsler Q.C. for the respondents.\n"

The Municipality of Varennes by their action prayed to have the by-law or proc\u00e8s verbal in question set aside on the ground of certain irregularities. The above was maintained and the by-law set aside.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld,\u2014that the case was not appealable and did come within sec. 29 or sec. 24, \" g \" of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act no future rights within the meaning of the former section being in question and the appeal not being from a rule or order of a court quashing or refusing to quash a by-law of a municipal corporation.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming a judgment of the Court of Review.\nIn 1866 the municipal council of the Corporation of Vercher\u00e8s adopted a proc\u00e8s verbal defining who were to be liable for the building and maintenance of a certain bridge over a small stream separating the municipality of the Village of Varennes and the municipality of the County Verch\u00e8res.\nIn 1888 the appellant municipality homologated a proc\u00e8s verbal made by one Joseph Geoffrion, otherwise defining who were to be liable for the building and maintenance of the said bridge. Thereupon the res-pondent municipality instituted before the Superior Court for Lower Canada, a common law action to have the proc\u00e8s verbal homologated by the appellant municipality, set aside and quashed.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the respondent's action hut the Court of Review reversed the decision of the Superior Court, and set aside the proc\u00e8s verbal, and on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) that court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Review.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nArchambault Q.C. for respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from was in an action to set aside a proc\u00e8s verbal and not a by-law, from which no appeal lay, and that there was no question of future rights within the meaning of sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, and cited and relied on Bank of Toronto v. LeCur\u00e9, etc., de la paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 de la Ste. Vierge ([1]); and Gilbert v. Gilman ([2]).\nAllan for appellant relied on sec. 30 and sec. 24 \" g\" of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case comes up on a motion to quash the appeal. This motion must clearly be allowed. The appellant claims the right of appeal, and obtained leave before one of the judges in the Court of Queen's Bench, on the ground that rights in future may be bound by the judgment against him. This is again what happens so often unfortunately for the litiganss notwithstanding the numerous decisions of this court on the subject, reading the words \" where the rights in future might be bound \"in sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act without reference to the preceding words \" such like matters or things.\" Gilbert v. Gilman ([3]). Now here there is no controversy as to rent or revenue payable to Her Majesty or as to any title to land, or annual rent or such like matter or things. The municipality of the County of Verch\u00e8res passed a by-law, or proc\u00e8s verbal, defining who were to he liable for the rebuilding and maintenance of a certain bridge. The municipality of Varennes, by their action in this case demand the setting aside of that by-law or proc\u00e8s verbal on the ground of certain illegalities therein. The judgment appealed from maintains their action and sets aside the by-law or proces verbal. That judgment is not appealable either under sec. 29 or sec. 24 sub sec. g of the Act. McManamy v. Sherbrooke ([4]). This is not a case of a rule or order to quash. It may be analogous, or have the same consequeness.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Founder Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nJurisdiction\u2014Appeal\u2014Future rights\u2014Title to lands\u2014Servitude\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Court\\s Act. sec. 29 (b).\nBy a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) peal side) the defendants in the action were condemned to build and complete certain works and drains within a certain delay, in a lane separating the defendants' and plaintiff's properties on the west side of Peel street, Montreal, to prevent water from entering plaintiff's house which was on the slope below. The question of damages was reserved. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\nHeld, that the case was not appealable, there being no controversy as to $2,000 or over, and no title to lands or future rights in question within the meaning of sec. 29,sub-sec. (b) of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe words title to lands in this sub-section are only applicable in a case where a title to the property or a right to the title may be in question. The fact that a question of the right of servitude arises would not give jurisdiction.\nWheeler v. Black (14:Can. S.CR. 242) referred to.\nGilbert v. Gilman (16 Can. S. C. R. 189) approved.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau herein after given.\nThe appeal to this court was taken after the following order had been obtained by the appellant from a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench: \u201cSeeing that the judgment from which an appeal is sought disposes as a finality of real rights, and also that the rights in future of the parties may be bound by it and seeing that the said appellants, Dame Sophie Wineberg et vir, have given security to the. extent of five hundred dollars as required by the 46th section of chapter 185 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, (The Supreme and Exchequer Court\\s Act, 1886) that they will effectually prosecute their appeal and pay such costs and damages as may be awarded against them by the Supreme Court.\n\" The appeal to the Supreme Court is hereby allowed reserving to the respondent the right to urge before the said court his objection to said appeal by motion or otherwise.\"\nBethune Q.C. moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction the case not being appealable under section 29, of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nRobertson Q.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The respondent moves to quash this appeal on the ground that the judgment is not appealable. I am of opinion that this motion should he allowed.\nThe parties own adjoining properties on the west side of Peel street This street is at right angles to Sherbrooke street and has a general direction of north and south, the ground rising as you go northward. The properties are separated by a lane of ten feet in width which belongs to Wineberg. Hampson's property is to the south of Wineberg's and therefore on a lower level. The ground here, is rock with a very slight covering of soil. The surface descends with a considerable inclination towards Sherbrooke street. It also declines but with less angle towards Peel street, Wineberg's house was built before that of Hampson. It is the southern one of a block of four houses built originally by the same proprietor, and being on a higher level than Hampson's the natural flow of the surface water would be from Wineberg's to Hampson's. To drain the flow of water from the four houses there was constructed what is called a French drain of loose stones passing through the yards of these houses southward until it reached the lane between the two properties ; it then turned eastward through the land until it reached the main corporation sewer in Peel street, at a depth of 4 to 6 feet underground in the lane.\nHampson, who built after Wineberg's houses were constructed and who excavated his foundations to a depth of from 4 to 5 feet below the level of the drain, found that his basement was inundated by a heavy flow of water proceeding, as he conceived, from the French drain. He consequently instituted the present action against the present appellants claiming that they should cease to use the French drain in such manner as to be a source of danger or damage to his, Hampson's, adjoining property, and should pay him $10,000 for his damages. The appellants by their plea contended that the drain was made for the protection of the properties from the natural descent of the water from the upper properties ; that no part of it entering the French drain escaped into Hampson's house; and if any water came into his cellar it was from the natural flow from the higher to the lower ground escaping through fissures in the rocks, a servitude to which all like situate properties were liable, and to which Hampson especially exposed his property by digging his foundations so deep.\nThe Superior Court after various procedures and judgments finally appointed three scientific experts, Hannaford, Shanly and Brown. The last two reported adversely to the appellant in separate reports, and that he should make certain works to prevent the flow of water in the respondent's cellar. The Superior Court adopted this report, and ordered the appellant to make certain works and drains within fifteen days from the judgment, the court, however, reserving judgment as to the damages claimed. This judgment was confirmed in appeal. Now, there is no condemnation in that judgment to any damages; there is, consequently, no controversy on this appeal as to $2,000 'or over; Ontario v. Marcheterre[1]. And the controversy does not relate to any title to land, annual rent or such like matters or things, where the rights in future might be bound. We have often held that the words \"where the rights in future might be bound\" are governed by the preceding words \"such like matters or things;\" Gilbert T. Gilman[2]. That is the difference between the right of appeal to the Privy Council and the right to appeal to this court, as art. 1178 of the code of procedure says \"other matters\" not \"such like matters.\"\nThe appellant, in order to sustain his appeal, contended that a question of \"real rights\" arose in this suit. I cannot find such an expression in the Supreme Court Act. The fact that in this case a question of a right of servitude arose would not give us jurisdiction. In Wheeler v. Black[3] the objection to the jurisdiction of this court was not taken by the respondent and was not noticed by the court. The words \"title to lands\" are only applicable in a case where a title to the property or a right to the title are in question. Hypothec as well as servitude can more or less affect a title. Nevertheless the jurisprudence has not recognized appeals in a case in which the mortgage alone is in controversy, the amount of the mortgage being under $2,000. See Bank of Toronto v. Le cure, &C., de la paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 ([4]).\nI could also add that I doubt whether the judgment is final. It appears however that it was executed.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bethune & Bethune.\n[1] 17 Can. S. C.

J. Ritchie C. j., and Strong, Founder, Taschereau and Patterson JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, MANITOBA.\nConstitutional law\u2014Education\u2014Authority to legislate with respect to\u2014Denominational schools\u201453 Vic. c. 38 (Man.)\u201433 Vic. c. 3 (D).\nThe exclusive right to make laws with respect to education in the Province of Manitoba is assigned to the Provincial Legislature by the constitution of the province as a part of the Dominion (33 Vic. ch. 3) with the restriction that nothing in any such law \u201c shall prejudicially affect the rights or privileges with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law or practice in the province at the union.\u201d The words \u201c or practice \u201d are an addition to, and the only deviation from, the terms of section 92 sub-sec. 1 of the B. N. A. Act, under which the New Brunswick Public Schools Act was upheld.\nPrior to the union the Roman Catholics of Manitoba had no schools established by law, but there were schools under the control of the church for the education of Catholic children.\nIn 1890 the legislature of Manitoba passed an act relating to schools (53 Vic. ch. 38), by which the control of all matters relating to education and schools was vested in a department of education consisting of a committee of the Executive Council and advisory boards established as provided by the act; the schools of the pro\u00advince were to be free and non-sectarian and no religious exercises were to be had except as prescribed by the advisory boards ; and the ratepayers of each municipality were to be indiscriminately taxed for their support.\nA Catholic ratepayer moved to quash a by-law of the city of Winnipeg for collecting these school rates showing by affidavit the position of Catholic schools before the union, the practice of the church to control and regulate the education of Catholics and to have the doctrines of their church taught in the schools, and that Catholic children would not be allowed to attend the public schools.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that thk act 53 Vic. ch. 38, by depriving Catholics of the right to have their children taught according to the rules of their church, and by compelling them to contribute to the support of schools to which they could not conscientiously send their children, prejudicially affected rights and privileges with respect to their schools which they had by practice in the province at the union, and was ultra vires of the legislature of the province. Ex parte Renaud [1 Pugs. (N.B.) 273] distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench Man. ([1]) holding the Public Schools Act ([2]) of the Province to be intra vires.\nThis was an application by the appellant, a ratepayer of the city of Winnipeg and a Roman Catholic, to quash by-laws numbers 480 and 483 of the city council passed to levy an assessment upon the real and personal property in the city for the year 1890 for municipal purposes and for the city schools. The ground of the application was stated to be \u201cbecause by the said by-laws the amounts to be levied for school purposes for the Protestant and Roman Catholic schools are united, and one rate levied upon Protestants and Roman Catholics alike for the whole sum.\u201d\n1. The question at issue is whether the Manitoba Public School Act, 53 Vic. cap 38, is void, as offending against the following provision in the constitutional act of Manitoba, 33 Vic. ch. 3 (D.) which assigns to the provincial legislature the exclusive right to make laws with respect to education: \u201c Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law or practice in the province at the union.\u201d\nThere is a similar provision in the B. N. A. Act, sec. 92 subsec. 1, under which the Public Schools Act of New Brunswick was held intra vires; Ex parte Renaud, (1); but that provision does not contain the words \u201cor practice\u201d which are found in the Manitoba Act.\nIn support of the application to quash the by-laws an affidavit made by the Archbishop of St. Boniface was read as showing the position of Catholics in regard to education prior to the union and the doctrines of the church in respect thereto. The affidavit contained the following clauses:\n\u201cPrior to the passage of the act of the Dominion of Canada passed in the thirty-third year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, ch0 3, known as The Manitoba Act, and prior to the order in council issued in pursuance thereof, there existed in the territory now constituting the Province of Manitoba a number of effective schools for children. These schools were denominational schools, some of them regulated and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, and others by various Protestant denominations.\u201d\n\u201cThe means necessary for the support of the Roman Catholic schools were supplied to some extent by school fees paid by some of the parents of the children who attended the schools, and the rest was paid out of the funds of the church contributed by its members.\u201d\n\u201cDuring the period referred to Roman Catholics had no interest in or control over the schools of the Protestant denominations, and the members of the Protestant denominations had no interest in or control over the schools of Roman Catholics. There were no public schools in the sense of state schools. The members of the Roman Catholic Church supported the schools of their own church for the benefit of the Roman Catholic children, and were not under obligation to, and did not, contribute to the support of any other schools.\u201d \u201cIn the matter of education, therefore, during the period referred to Roman Catholics were, as a matter of custom and practice, separate from the rest of the community, and their schools were all conducted according to the distinctive views and beliefs of Roman Catholics as herein set forth.\u201d\n\u201cRoman Catholic schools have always formed an integral part of the work of the Roman Catholic Church. That church has always considered the education of the children of Roman Catholic parents as coming peculiarly within its jurisdiction. The school, in the view of the Roman Catholics, is in a large measure the 4 Children\u2019s Church,\u2019 and wholly incomplete and largely abortive if religious exercises be excluded from it. The church has always insisted upon its children receiving their education in schools conducted under the supervision of the church, and upon their being trained in the doctrines and faith of the church. In education the Roman Catholic Church attaches very great importance to the spiritual culture of the child, and regards all education unaccompanied by instruction in its religious aspect as possibly detrimental and not beneficial to children. With this regard the church requires that all teachers of children shall not only be members of the church but shall be thoroughly imbued with its principles and faith; shall recognize its spiritual authority and conform to its directions. It also requires that such books be used in the schools with regard to certain subjects as shall combine religious instruction with those subjects, and this applies peculiarly to all history and philosophy.\u201d\n\u201cThe church regards the schools provided for by 4 The Public Schools Act\u2019 being chapter 38 of the statutes passed in the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, in the fifty-third year of her raign, as unfit for the purpose of educating their children, and the children of Roman Catholic parents will not attend such schools. Rather than countenance such schools, Roman Catholics will revert to the system in operation previous to the Manitoba Act, and will establish, support and maintain schools in accordance with their principles and faith as aforementioned.\u201d\nThe first legislation in Manitoba for the establishment of a public school system was passed in 1871 (34 Vic. ch. 12), whereby a board of education, composed of not less than ten nor more than fourteen persons, was established, one-half of whom were Protestants and one-half Catholics. Each section of the board had a separate superintendent and, amongst other powers, had under its control and management the \u201c discipline \u201d,of the schools of the section and the prescribing of such books as had-reference to religion or morals. The moneys appropriated by the legislature for common school education were, after deducting the expenses of the board and superintendent\u2019s salaries, to be appropriated to the support and maintenance of common schools, one moiety thereof to the support of the Protestant schools and the other moiety to the support of the Catholic schools.\nBy subsequent legislation, enacted at various times up to the passage of the Public Schools Act (53 Vic. ch. 38), the powers of the Protestant and Catholic sections of the board of education were enlarged, whereby the entire control and management of the schools, their general government and discipline, were delegated to the section of the board to which the school belonged. Each section had power to select all the books, maps and o-lobes to be used in the schools under its control, and to approve of the plans for the construction of school houses, \u201c provided, however, that in the case of books having reference to religion and morals such selection by the Catholic section of the board shall be subject to the approval of the competent religious authority.\u201d See Man. Stat., 34 Vic. ch. 12; 36 Vic. ch. 22 ; 39 Vic. ch. 1; 42 Vic. ch. 2 ; 44 Vic. ch. 4.\nBy the act respecting the Department of Education (53 Vic. ch. 3t), and by the Public Schools Act (53 Vic. ch. 38), all prior legislation as to schools and education in Manitoba was repealed and a Department of Education created, to consist of the Executive Council, or a committee thereof, which,* with an advisory board to be elected in the manner prescribed by the act, practically replaced the old board of education. It was further provided that all public schools in the province were to be free schools (sec. 6), that all religious exercises in the public schools should be conducted according to the regulations of the advisory board (sec. 0), and that, except as above, no religious exercises would be allowed in the schools which were declared to be \u201c-entirely non-sectarian\u201d (sec. 8).\nIt is contended that this latter act is ultra vires of the Provincial legislature as prejudicially affecting the rights and privileges with respect to their schools which Roman Catholics had in the province at the union.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Man.) Dubuc J. dissenting, held the act intra vires. From that decision an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS. H. Blake Q C. and Ewart Q. C. (Brophy with them) for the appellant.\nIt is admitted that prior to the admission of Manitoba into the union Roman Catholics had entire control of the education of their children without any statutory enactment providing therefor, and had enjoyed such privilege for more than forty years. It is also admitted that the act passed in 1871, after the union, did not take away such right of control and was not objectionable to Catholics. The act of 1871 did not interfere with the system by which the Roman Catholics had the entire control over their own schools, and it is admitted that the present act does away with such control. Under it the schools in Manitoba are to be entirely non-sectarian, and the Roman Catholics will be obliged to support their own schools and to contribute to the support of Protestant schools, schools which they conscientiously believe to be not only negatively but positively injurious to the public good, or, as Lord Thesiger has said in reference to schools in which religious instruction has no place, that \u201cthe system means educating the people to be skilled villains instead of christians.\u201d\nThe position of the Roman Catholic Church in respect to education is presented to the court in this case by Archbishop Tach\u00e9 in his affidavit. He says \u201cRoman Catholic schools have always formed an integral part of the work of the Roman Catholic Church. * * * The school, in the view of the Roman Catholics, is in a large measure the 1 Children\u2019s Church,\u2019 and wholly incomplete and largely abortive if religious exercises could be excluded from it. * * * In education, the Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the spiritual culture of the child, and regards all education unaccompanied by instruction in its religious aspect as possibly detrimental and not beneficial to :children.\u201d\nThe affidavit also shows that Catholics, owing to the rules and doctrines of their church, cannot conscientiously send their children to the public schools established under the act in question in this case. ,\nWhen Manitoba became a part of the Dominion of Canada it was a part of the arrangement of union that Roman Catholics should be protected in the rights above outlined, which they claim have been, swept away by this act. The sections of the constitutional act (33 Vic. ch. 3), relating to education, are not precisely similar to the corresponding action of the British North America Act. The latter act only protects rights and privileges which any class of persons had by law, the Manitoba Act protects such rights as were had by law or practice. In New Brunswick it was held that Roman Catholics having had no schools established by law at confederation there were no rights to be affected. It might be argued that the word law should not be construed narrowly as meaning statutory law, but in the wide sense of usage, habit, custom, &c. Be that as it may we have in our act the words \u201cor practice\u201d so that we are not driven to this construction of the other word \u201c law.\u201d\nThe wishes of parents are entitled to the first consideration. This is the opinion of the Royal Commission on education appointed in England in 1886.\nIt is argued that Catholics will still have a right to their own schools and are not obliged to send their children to the public schools. But the act does not protect them against the abolition of their rights. If they have their own schools they will be taxed for the support of the public schools and will thus be \u201cprejudicially affected\u201d in their rights which the law does not allow.\nThis is an act which prejudicially affects this class of persons, as to their conscientious convictions, as to their pockets, in their relation to their church, in the most important matter of secular and religious education of their young. It is in most marked contradiction to the spirit of conciliation displayed in the act which dealt with these rights and to the wise spirit of toleration which is displayed in the enactment that was in force for 20 years, and offends against the spirit and the letter of the act which defends the rights of these persons and therefore will be held unconstitutional by this court.\nThe following cases were cited by the learned counsel : Bailey v. The Great Western Railway Company ([3]); Musgrave v. Inclosure Commissioners ([4]); Barlow v. Ross ([5]); Attorney General of Canada v. Attorney General of Ontario ([6]).\nGormully Q.C. and Martin for the respondents. The words \u201c by law or practice\u201d as used in the act can only mean some binding rute or obligation to which the inhabitants of the province were committed at the time of the union ; Ex parte Reriaud ([7]). There was no such rule or obligation here.\nAs to the meaning of the word \u201crights\u201d in a statute see Austin on Jurisprudence ([8]), and of \u201cprivileges\u201d ([9]). And see Fearon v. Mitchell ([10]).\nAccording to Archbishop Tach\u00e9 the right or privilege enjoyed by Catholics at the union was to have denominational schools supported by fees from parents or by the funds of the church. With this the Public Schools Act in no way interferes.\nIf the contention against this act is to prevail it follows that the legislature of Manitoba cannot pass any effective act relating to education.\nSinclair v. Mulligan ([11]), and The Duke of Newcastle v. Morris ([12]) were cited.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. This is an application to quash two by-laws of the municipal corporation of the city of Winnipeg, which were passed for levying a rate for municipal and school purposes in that city for the year 1890, and they assess all real and personal property in the city for such purpose. It is asked that these by-laws be quashed for illegality on the following among other grounds : That because by the said by-laws the amount to be levied for school purposes for the Protestant and Roman Catholic schools are united, and one rate levied upon Protestants and Roman Catholics alike for the whole sum.\nIt must be assumed that in legislating with reference to a constitution for Manitoba the Dominion Parliament was well acquainted with the conditions of the country to which it was about to give a constitution, and they must have known full well that at that time there were no schools established by law, religious or secular, public or sectarian. In such a state of affairs, and having reference to the condition of the population, and the deep interest felt and strong opinions entertained on the subject of separate schools, it cannot be supposed that the legislature had not its attention more particularly directed to the educational institutions of Manitoba, and more especially to the schools then in practical operation, their constitution, mode of support and peculiar character in matters of religious instruction. To have overlooked considerations of this kind is to impute to parliament a degree of short-sightedness and indifference which, in view of the discussions relating to separate schools which had taken place in the older provinces, or some of them, and to the extreme vigilance with which educational questions are scanned and the importance attached to them, more particularly by the Catholic Church as testified to by Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, cannot to my mind be for a moment entertained. Read in the light of considerations such as these must we not conclude that the legislature well weighed its language and intended that every word it used should have force and effect?\nThe British North America Act confers on the local legislature the exclusive power to make laws in relation to education, provided nothing in such laws shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege, with respect to denominational schools, which any class of persons had by law in the province at the union, but the Manitoba Act goes much further and declares that nothing in such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law or practice in the province at the union. We are now practically asked to reject the words \u201c or practice \u201d and construe the statute as if they had not been used, and to read this restrictive clause out of the statute as being inapplicable to the existing state of things in Manitoba at the union, whereas on the contrary, I think, by the insertion of the words \u201c or practice\u201d it was made practically applicable to the condition at the time of the educational institutions, which were, unquestionably and solely as the evidence shows, of a denominational character. It is clear that at the time of the passing of the Manitoba Act no class of persons had by law any rights or privileges secured to them; so if we reject the words \u201c or practice \u201d as meaningless or inoperative we shall be practically expunging the whole of the restrictive clause from the statute. I know of no rule of construction to justify such a proceeding unless the clause is wholly unintelligible or incapable of any reasonable construction. The words used, in my opinion, are of no doubtful import, but are, on the contrary, plain, certain and unambiguous, and must be read in their ordinary grammatical sense. Effect should be given to all the words in the statute, nothing adding thereto, nothing diminishing therefrom, as was said by Tindall C.J. in Everett v. Wells ([13]).\nThe legislature must be understood to mean what it has plainly expressed, and this excludes construction. See Rex v. Banbury (1).\nIt is a settled canon of construction that no clause, sentence or word, shall be construed superfluous, void or insignificant if it can be prevented. See The Queen v. The Bishop of Oxfora ([14]).\nWhile it is quite clear that at the time of the passing of this act there were no denominational or other schools established and recognized by law, it is equally clear that there were at that time in actual operation or practice a system of denominational schools in Manitoba well established and the de facto rights and privileges of which were enjoyed by a large class of persons. What then was there more reasonable than that the legislature should protect and preserve to such class of persons those rights and privileges they enjoyed in practice, though not theretofore secured to them by law, but which the Dominion Parliament appears to have deemed it just should not, after the coming into operation of the new provincial constitution, be prejudicially affected by the action of the local legislature?\nI quite agree with the cases cited by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba as to the rules by which the act should be construed. I agree that the court must look not only at the words of the statute but at the cause of making it to ascertain the intent. When we find the parliament of Canada altering and adding to the language of the British North America Act by inserting a limitation not in the British North America Act,, must we not conclude that it was done advisedly ? What absurdity, inconsistency, injustice, or contradiction is there in giving the words \u201c or practice\u201d a literal construction, more especially, as I have endeavoured to show, as the literal meaning is the only meaning the words are capable of and is entirely consistent with the manifest intention of the legislature, namely, to meet the exigencies of the country, and cover denominational schools of the class practically in use and operation ? If the literal meaning is not to prevail I have yet to hear what other meaning is to be attached to the words \u201cor practice.\u201d If the legislature intended to protect the classes of persons who had founded and were carrying on denominational schools of the character of those which existed at the time of the passing of the act I am at a loss to know what other words they could more aptly have used. They might, it is true, have said \u201cwhich any class of persons has by law or usage,\u201d but the words \u201cpractice\u201d and \u201cusage\u201d are synonymous. I agree, also, that we should ascertain what the language of the legislature means, in other words, to suppose that parliament meant what parliament has clearly said.\nIt cannot be said that the words used do not harmonize with the subject of the enactment and the object which I think the legislature had in view. If the legislature intended to recognize denominational schools how could they have used more expressive words to indicate their intention since the words used, read in their ordinary grammatical sense, admit of but one meaning and therefore one construction? And we should not speculate on the intention of the legislature that intention being clearly indicated by the language used in view of the condition of, and the state of education in, that country. The object the legislature must have had in view in using them was clearly to protect the rights and privileges with respect to denominational schools which any class or persons had by law or practice, that is to say, had by usage, at the time of the union. I cannot read the language of the act in any other sense.\nThe decision of the court of New Brunswick in the case of Ex parte Renaud referred to in the court below has no application in this case. That case turned entirely on the fact that The Parish School Act of New Brunswick, 21 Vic. ch. 9, conferred no legal rights on any class of persons with respect to denominational schools. It was there simply determined that there were no legal rights with respect to denominational schools, and therefore no rights protected by the British North America Act, a very different case from that we are now called on to determine. It may very well be that in view of the wording of the British North America Act and the peculiar state of educational matters in Manitoba the Dominion Parliament determined to enlarge the scope of the British North America Act, and protect not only denominational schools established by law but those existing in practice, for as I am reported to have said and no doubt did say, in Ex parte Renaud ([15]) that in that case: \u201c We must look to the law as it was at the time of the union and by that and that alone be governed.\u201d\nNow on the other hand, in this case, we must look to the practice with reference to the denominational schools as it existed at the time of the passing of the Manitoba Act.\nThat this was the view taken by the legislature of Manitoba would seem to be indicated by the legislation of that province up to the passing of the Public Schools Act which very clearly recognized denominational schools and made provision for their maintenance and support, providing that support for Protestant schools should be taxed on Protestants and for Catholic schools should be taxed on Catholics, and conferring the management and control of Protestant schools on Protestants and the like management and control of Catholic schools on Catholics. This denominational system was most effectually wiped out by the Public Schools Act and not a vestige of the denominational character left in the school system of Manitoba. Mr Justice Dubuc gives an accurate synopsis of the legislation prior to the passing of the Public Schools Act.\nThe only question, it strikes me, we are now called upon to consider is : Does this Public School Act prejudicially affect the class of persons who in practice enjoyed the rights and privileges of denominational schools at the time of the union ? Now, what were the provisions of the Public Schools Act? Mr. Justice Dubuc likewise gives a synopsis of the Public Schools Act as follows:\n[His Lordship here read that portion of the judgment of Dubuc J. and proceeded:]\nBut it is said that the Catholics as a class are not prejudicially affected by this act. Does it riot prejudicially, that is to say injuriously, disadvantageously, which is the meaning of the word \u201c prejudicially,\u201d affect them when they are taxed to support schools of the benefit of which, by their religious belief and the rules and principles of their church, they cannot conscientiously avail themselves, and at the same time by compelling them to find means to support schools to which they can conscientiously send their children,, or in the event of their not being able to find sufficient means to do both to be compelled to allow their children to go without either religious or secular instruction ? In other words, I think the Catholics were directly prejudicially affected by such legislation, but whether directly or indirectly the local legislature was powerless to affect them prejudicially in the matter of denominational schools, which they certainly did by practically depriving them of their denominational schools and compelling them to support schools the benefit of which Protestants alone can enjoy.\nIn my opinion the Public Schools Act is ultra vires and the by-laws of the city of Winnipeg, Nos. 480 and 483, should be quashed and this appeal allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have read the judgment prepared by the Chief Justice, and entirely concur in the conclusion at which he has arrived as well as in the reasons he has given therefor. I have nothing to add to what he has said.\nFOTJRNIER J.\u2014C\u2019est au moyen d\u2019une demande pour faire annuler les r\u00e8glements Nos. 480 et 483 adopt\u00e9s par le Conseil Municipal de Winnipeg que l\u2019appelant a soulev\u00e9 dans cette cause l\u2019importante question de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte 53 Vie, ch. 38, concernant les \u00e9coles publiques de Manitoba.\nPar les deux r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s en vertu du nouvel acte d\u2019\u00e9cole et des dispositions de l\u2019acte municipal une taxe de deux centins par dollar est impos\u00e9e sur la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re et immobili\u00e8re dans la cit\u00e9 de Winnipeg. La proportion de cette taxe appropri\u00e9e aux \u00e9coles est fix\u00e9e \u00e0 4 et un 1\/5 de mille dans le dollar.\nLe moyen de nullit\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 est que par les r\u00e8glements une seule taxe est pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e uniform\u00e9ment sur les catholiques et les protestants pour le soutien des \u00e9coles.\nCe moyen est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 en ces termes :\nBecause by the said by-laws the amounts to be levied for school purposes for the Protestant and Catholic shools are united and one rate levied upon Protestants and Catholics alike for the whole sum.\nCette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 l\u2019hbnorable juge Killam, qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en faveur de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte et de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des by-laivs en question. Son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour Supr\u00eame de Manitoba. C\u2019est ce dernier jugement qui est maintenant soumis \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration de cette cour.\nPar cet acte, 53 Vie, ch. 38, le syst\u00e8me des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, catholiques et protestantes, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019acte constitutionnel de Manitoba, 33 Vic, ch. 3, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pompl\u00e8tement aboli apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en force pendant dix-neuf ans.\nIl est important pour la d\u00e9cision de cette question de se reporter aux circonstances qui ont amen\u00e9 l\u2019entr\u00e9e de cette province dans la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne. On se souvient que c\u2019est \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une r\u00e9bellion qui avait jet\u00e9 la population dans une profonde et violente agitation, soulev\u00e9 les passions religieuses et nationales, et caus\u00e9 de grands d\u00e9sordres qui avaient rendu n\u00e9cessaire l\u2019intervention du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. C\u2019est dans le but d\u2019y r\u00e9tablir la paix publique et de concilier cette population que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral leur accorda la constitution dont ils ont joui jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\nLe principe des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es introduit dans l\u2019acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord par la section 93 fut aussi introduit dans la constitution de Manitoba, et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s\u2019appliquer aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es qui existaient de fait dans ce territoire avant son organisation en province. La population \u00e9tait alors divis\u00e9e \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s* \u00e9galement entre catholiques et protestants.\nTout en donnant \u00e0 la province le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer concernant l\u2019\u00e9ducation la sec. 22 ss. 1 ajoute \u00e0 la restriction de la section 93 de l\u2019acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du N ord de ne pr\u00e9judicier aucunement au droit et au privil\u00e8ge conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi relativement aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, celle de ne pr\u00e9judicier non plus aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es existantes par la coutume du pays (by practice).\nC\u2019est sur cette extension de la prohibition de la section 93 qui prot\u00e9geait les \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, \u00e9tablies par la coutume que la l\u00e9gislature de Mauitoba s\u2019est fond\u00e9e pour introduire le principe des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es protestantes et catholiques dans le premier acte des \u00e9coles qu\u2019elle a pass\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son organisation. Dans ce but, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cet acte que le lieutenant gouverneur en conseil aurait le pouvoir de nommer un bureau d\u2019\u00e9ducation compos\u00e9 de pas moins de dix et pas plus de quatorze personnes dont une moiti\u00e9 serait catholiques et l\u2019autre protestants et deux surintendants l\u2019un pour les \u00e9coles protestantes et l\u2019autre pour les \u00e9coles catholiques qui seraient les secr\u00e9taires conjoints du bureau.\nLes devoirs des bureaux sont d\u00e9finis comme suit :\u2014\n1\u00b0 de faire de temps en temps les r\u00e8glements qu\u2019ils jugeront convenables pour l\u2019organisation des \u00e9coles communes ; 2\u00b0 de choisir les livres, mappes, globes pour l\u2019usage des \u00e9coles communes, en ayant le soin de choisir les livres anglais, mappes et globes pour les \u00e9coles anglaises et des livres fran\u00e7ais pour les \u00e9coles fran\u00e7aises mais ce pouvoir ne devait pas s\u2019\u00e9tendre au choix des livres concernant la religion et la morale, ce choix \u00e9tant r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par une clause subs\u00e9quente ; 3\u00b0 de changer et de subdiviser avec la sanction du lieutenant gouverneur tout district d\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e9tablie en vertu de cet acte. La sous-sec. 12 donne au bureau le pouvoir de prescrire pour l\u2019usage des \u00e9coles les livres concernant la religion et la morale; parla sous-sec. 13, les argents appropri\u00e9s par la l\u00e9gislature pour l\u2019\u00e9ducation doivent \u00eatre divis\u00e9s \u00e9galement une moiti\u00e9 pour le support des \u00e9coles protestantes v et l\u2019autre pour celui des o \u00e9coles catholiques.\nLe premier bureau nomm\u00e9 par le lieutenant gouverneur en conseil \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de l\u2019Archev\u00eaque de St. Boniface de l\u2019Ev\u00eaque de la terre de Rupert, de plusieurs pr\u00eatres catholiques et de ministres protestants de diverses d\u00e9nominations et d\u2019une couple de la\u00efques pour chaque section. Ce statut a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 de temps en temps pour satisfaire \u00e0 de nouveaux besoins \u00e0 mesure que les \u00e9tablissements se d\u00e9veloppaient et que la population augmentait, mais toujours en conservant le m\u00eame syst\u00e8me d\u2019avoir des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es pour les catholiques et les protestants. Les seuls changements importants furent par l\u2019acte de 1875 viz : l\u2019augmentation du nombre des membres du bureau \u00e0 21, douze protestants et neuf catholiques, et la division des argents vot\u00e9s par la l\u00e9gistature entre les protestants et les catholiques en proportion du nombre d\u2019enfants en \u00e2ge de fr\u00e9quenter les \u00e9coles dans chaque district catholique ou protestant.\nA part de ces changements le syst\u00e8me des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es et l\u2019action ind\u00e9pendante des deux sections du bureau furent de plus en plus confirm\u00e9s par les statuts subs\u00e9quents. La sec. 27 de l\u2019acte de 1875 c. 27 dit que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans un district d\u2019une \u00e9cole d\u2019une d\u00e9nomination n\u2019emp\u00eachera pas l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une \u00e9cole d\u2019une autre d\u00e9nomination dans le m\u00eame district. Ce principe re\u00e7oit une certaine extension et est mis en pratique par les secs. 39, 40 et 41 de l\u2019acte de 1876 c. 1.\nTel est l\u2019\u00e9tat de choses qui a exist\u00e9 sous le rapport de l\u2019\u00e9ducation depuis l\u2019entr\u00e9e de la province de Manitoba dans la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. C\u2019est en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019acte constitutionnel, confirm\u00e9 par un acte du Parlement imp\u00e9rial, que tous les actes de la province \u00e9tablissant le syst\u00e8me des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit et r\u00e9gularis\u00e9.\nBien qu\u2019avant cette \u00e9poque il n\u2019y e\u00fbt pas \u00e0 proprement parler de syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation publique, les protestants et les catholiques \u00e9taient depuis longtemps dans l\u2019habitude de soutenir respectivement chacun pour son compte et \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens, des \u00e9coles qui, dans le fait \u00e9taient des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es o\u00f9 l\u2019enseignement se faisait suivant les principes de chaque d\u00e9nomination. Dans son affidavit \u00e0 cet effet, produit au soutien des pr\u00e9tensions de l\u2019appelant et dont les faits ne sont pas contest\u00e9s par la partie adverse, l\u2019Archev\u00eaque Tach\u00e9 d\u00e9finit l\u2019\u00e9tat de chose existant alors comme suit:\nAyant Pacte de la Puissance du Canada pass\u00e9 dans la 33m. ann\u00e9e du r\u00e8gne de Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine Victoria, ch. 3, connu sous le nom de PActe de Manitoba, et avant l\u2019ordre en conseil \u00e9mis en vertu de cet acte il existait dam le territoire formant maintenant la Province de Manitoba un nombre d\u2019\u00e9coles effectives pour l\u2019instruction des enfants. 3. Ces \u00e9coles \u00e9taient des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es (denominational) dont les unes \u00e9taient r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et contr\u00f4l\u00e9es par l\u2019\u00e9glise catholique et les autres par les diverses d\u00e9nominations protestantes. 4. Les moyens n\u00e9cessaires pour le soutien des \u00e9coles catholiques \u00e9taient fournis en partie par des honoraires d\u2019\u00e9cole, pay\u00e9s par les parents des enfants qui fr\u00e9quentaient les \u00e9coles, et le reste \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9glise \u00e1u moyen des contributions de ses membres. 5. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, les catholiques n\u2019avaient aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat ni contr\u00f4le dans les \u00e9coles protestantes et les protestants n\u2019avaient non plus aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat ni contr\u00f4le dans les \u00e9coles catholiques. Il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019\u00e9coles publiques dans le sens d\u2019\u00e9coles soutenues par l\u2019Etat. Les catholiques soutenaient les \u00e9coles de leur \u00e9glise pour l\u2019avantage des enfants catholiques, et n\u2019\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s de contribuer au soutien d\u2019aucune autre \u00e9cole. En ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9ducation, pendant cette p\u00e9riode les catholiques \u00e9taient par la coutume et la pratique s\u00e9par\u00e9s du reste de fa population et leurs \u00e9coles \u00e9taient conduites suivant les principes et les croyances de l\u2019\u00e9glise catholique.\u201d\nDans le m\u00eame affidavit l\u2019Archev\u00eaque d\u00e9clare que l\u2019Eglise consid\u00e8re les \u00e9coles \u00e9tablies en vertu du \u201cPublic School Act\u201d comme impropres \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants catholiques et que les enfants ne les fr\u00e9quenteront pas : que plut\u00f4t que d\u2019encourager ces \u00e9coles, les catholiques pr\u00e9f\u00e9reront retourner au syst\u00e8me existant avant l\u2019acte de Manitoba et qu\u2019ils \u00e9tabliront et maintiendront des \u00e9coles conform\u00e9ment aux principes de leur foi ; que les protestants sont satisfaits du syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e9tabli par le \u201c;Public School Act\u201d parce que ces \u00e9coles sont tout-\u00e0-fait semblables \u00e0 celles qu\u2019ils maintenaient avant la r\u00e9vocation des actes ant\u00e9rieurs admettant le syst\u00e8me des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es dont ils avaient le contr\u00f4le absolu,\nLes affidavits en opposition \u00e0 la motion \u00e9tablissent que les \u00e9coles existantes avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e du Manitoba dans la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration n\u2019\u00e9taient que des \u00e9coles priv\u00e9es, soumises \u00e0 aucun contr\u00f4le de la part du public et n\u2019en recevant aucun subside. Il n\u2019y avait pas de taxes per\u00e7ues par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 pour cet objet et il n\u2019y avait aucun moyen legal de forcer le public \u00e0 contribuer au soutien de ces \u00e9coles priv\u00e9es.\nLes affidavits donn\u00e9s de part et d\u2019autre ne se contredisent nullement et donnent une id\u00e9e correcte de la situation des \u00e9coles existantes dans le territoire qui a depuis form\u00e9 la province de Manitoba. Il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019il est clairement prouv\u00e9 que les \u00e9coles alors existantes, quoique non \u00e9tablies par aucune loi, \u00e9taient de fait, et dans la pratique des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es (denominational schools). C\u2019est cet \u00e9tat de choses qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 par la 22, sec. de l\u2019acte constitutionnel de Manitoba, par la d\u00e9claration que rien dans les lois qui seraient pass\u00e9es par la l\u00e9gislature ne devra pr\u00e9judicier \u00e0 aucun droit ou privil\u00e8ge conf\u00e9r\u00e9, lors de l\u2019union par la loi ou par la coutume \u00e0 aucune classe particuli\u00e8re de personnes dans la province, relativement aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es (denominadonal schools.)\nCette disposition est la source du pouvoir exerc\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature du Manitoba en vertu de l\u2019acte 34 Vie, ch. 12, confirmant et approuvant le syst\u00e8me des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es existant auparavant. On a vu par ses principales dispositions cit\u00e9es plus haut que le contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 parles protestants et les catholiques, sur leur \u00e9coles respectives, leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9 par cette loi et par les suivantes adopt\u00e9es, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019acte 53 Vie, ch. 38.\nA la session de 1890, la l\u00e9gislature a pass\u00e9 deux actes au sujet de l\u2019instruction, le premier, ch. 37, abolit le bureau d\u2019\u00e9ducation ci-devant existant ainsi que la charge de surintendant de l\u2019\u00e9ducation et cr\u00e9e un d\u00e9partement de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, form\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif ou d\u2019un comit\u00e9 pris dans son sein, nomm\u00e9 par le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil et d\u2019un bureau d\u2019aviseurs compos\u00e9 de sept membres, dont quatre nomm\u00e9s par le d\u00e9partement de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, deux par les instituteurs de la province et un par le conseil de l\u2019universit\u00e9. Entre autres devoirs le bureau des aviseurs a le pouvoir d\u2019examiner et autoriser les livres de texte et de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour l\u2019usage des \u00e9coles et des biblioth\u00e8que d\u2019\u00e9coles ; de d\u00e9finir les qualifications des instituteurs et des inspecteurs des \u00e9coles ; de nommer les personnes charg\u00e9es de pr\u00e9parer les programmes d\u2019examen ; de prescrire la forme des exercices religieux qui seront pratiqu\u00e9s dans les \u00e9coles.\nL\u2019autre acte est le \u201c Public School Act \u201d ch. 38, dont la constitutionnalit\u00e9 est attaqu\u00e9e. Il r\u00e9voque tous les statuts en force concernant l\u2019\u00e9ducation et d\u00e9clare par la section 3 que tous les districts scolaires protestants et catholiques, ainsi que les \u00e9lections et nominations \u00e0 aucun office, contrats, cotisations, faits ci devant au sujet des \u00e9coles catholiques et protestantes et en existence lors de sa mise en force seront soumis aux dispositions de cet acte ; la section 4 continue en office les syndics existants lors de sa mise en force comme s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lus en vertu des dispositions de cet acte ; section 5, toutes les \u00e9coles publiques seront libres et tous les enfants de l\u2019\u00e2ge de 5 \u00e0 16 ans dans les municipalit\u00e9s rurales, et de 6 \u00e0 16 ans dans les villes auront le droit de les fr\u00e9quenter. Section 6. Les exercices religieux dans les \u00e9coles publiques seront conduits conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8glements du bureau des aviseurs. Le temps pour ces exercices est fix\u00e9, et, si les parents ne d\u00e9sirent pas que leurs enfants y assistent alors ces derniers seront renvoy\u00e9s avant ces exercices. Par la sec. 7 les exercices religieux sont \u00e0 l\u2019option des syndics d\u2019\u00e9coles pour le district et sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019une autorisation \u00e9crite des syndics, les instituteurs seront oblig\u00e9s de faire ces exercices religieux: Les \u00e9coles publiques ne seront pas des \u00e9coles de sectaires et aucun exercice religieux n\u2019y sera permis except\u00e9 qu\u2019en la mani\u00e8re ci-dessus prescrite.\nL\u2019acte pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de districts scolaires dans les municipalit\u00e9s rurales et dans les villes et villages, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lection des syndics d\u2019\u00e9coles et \u00e0 l\u2019imposition de taxes pour les fins scolaires.\nLa sec. 92 d\u00e9clare que\nLe conseil municipal de toute cit\u00e9, ville et village pr\u00e9l\u00e8vera et collectera sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 imposable dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9 et en la mani\u00e8re prescrite par cet acte et par Pacte municipal et de cotisation telles sommes qui seront requises par les syndics pour les fins scolaires.\nSec. 108 contient au sujet de l\u2019octroi l\u00e9gislatif pour les \u00e9coles la disposition suivante :\nToute \u00e9cole qui ne sera pas conduite conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de cet acte, ou de tout autre acte alors en force ou conform\u00e9 nient aux r\u00e8glements du d\u00e9partm\u00e9nt de l\u2019\u00e9ducation ou d\u00fb bureau des aviseurs, ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 une \u00e9cole publique suivant la loi et n\u2019aura aucune part de l\u2019octroi l\u00e9gislatif.\nLa sec. 143 statue que les instituteurs n\u2019emploieront pas d\u2019autres livres d\u2019\u00e9coles que ceux autoris\u00e9s par le bureau des aviseurs et aucune partie de l\u2019octroi l\u00e9gislatif ne sera pay\u00e9 aux \u00e9coles employant les livres non autoris\u00e9s. Par la sec. 179 :\nDans les cas o\u00f9 avant la mise en force de cet acte, d\u00e8s districts d\u2019\u00e9coles catholiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis tel que mentionn\u00e9 dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (c.\u00e0.d.) couvrant le m\u00eame territoire qu\u2019un district protestant, tel district d\u2019\u00e9cole catholique, lors de la mise en force de cet acte cessera d\u2019exister et tout l\u2019avoir de tel district avec son passif appartiendront au district d\u2019\u00e9cole publique.\nL\u2019ensemble de ces dispositions a produit un changement complet dans le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation ; le statut a fait dispara\u00eetre non seulement les clauses de la loi ant\u00e9rieure \u00e9tablissant les \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es mais a m\u00eame proscrit jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019usage des termes \u201c d\u00e9nominations catholiques et protestantes.\u201d La sec. 179 dans les cas o\u00f9 un\u2019district catholique d\u2019\u00e9cole couvre le m\u00eame territoire qu\u2019un district protestant, va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la confiscation des biens du district catholique et transporte la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au district protestant d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom d\u2019\u00e9cole publique.\nPar cette analyse des principales dispositions de l\u2019acte 53 Vie, ch. 38, on voit que la l\u00e9gislature du Manitoba, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli conform\u00e9ment au pouvoir que lui en donnait sa constitution, un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, a compl\u00e8tement aboli ce syst\u00e8me et en a organis\u00e9 un autre directement en opposition au premier, dans lequel elle fait dispara\u00eetre le droit aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es tel qu\u2019il avait exist\u00e9 jusqu\u2019alors pour lui en substituer un autre, fond\u00e9 sur le principe non sedarian, excluant renseignement religieux des \u00e9coles et laissant aux syndics d\u2019\u00e9coles le choix des livres concernant la religion et la morale qui seront en usage dans ces \u00e9coles\nLe syst\u00e8me ainsi \u00e9tabli est tout-\u00e0-fait contraire aux id\u00e9es religieuses des catholiques et \u00e0 la doctrine de l\u2019\u00e9glise catholique romaine, et leur enl\u00e8ve le droit reconnu par l\u2019acte du Manitoba, d\u2019avoir des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es.\nCette l\u00e9gislation n\u2019exc\u00e8de-t-elle pas le pouvoir de la l\u00e9gislature ? N\u2019est-elle pas directement en opposition \u00e0 la section 22 de l\u2019acte du Manitoba et partant ultra vires ?\nLa section 93 de l\u2019acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, donnant aux l\u00e9gislatures des provinces le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9ducation y met la restriction suivante :\u2014\nRien clans ces lois ne devra pr\u00e9judicier \u00e0 aucun droit ou privil\u00e8ge conf\u00e9r\u00e9 lors de l\u2019union par la loi \u00e0 aucune classe particuli\u00e8re de per-sonnes dans la province relativement aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es (d\u00e9nomination schools.)\nCette disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite dans la Ire s. s. de la section 22 de l\u2019acte du Manitoba, avec la seule diff\u00e9rence de l\u2019addition des mots \u201c or practice \u201d ou par5 la coutume \u00e0 la suite des mots \u201cpar la loi,\u201d de sorte que cette section s\u2019y lit maintenant comme suit : -\nRien dans ces lois ne devra pr\u00e9judicier \u00e0 aucun droit ou privil\u00e8ge conf\u00e9r\u00e9 lors de l\u2019Union jDar la loi ou par la coutume \u00e0 aucune classe particuli\u00e8re de personnes dans la province relativement aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es (d\u00e9nominational scliools.)\nLa solution de la question repose donc enti\u00e8rement dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner aux mots \u201c ou par la coutume \u201d introduits dans la section 22, et qui ne se trouve pas dans la section 93 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord. Evidemment cette addition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans motifs, et l\u2019on doit en trouver la signification par l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des statuts donn\u00e9es par les autorit\u00e9s.\nUne des premi\u00e8res r\u00e8gles est que lorsque les termes d\u2019un statut ne sont susceptibles que d\u2019une seule signification la cour n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de rechercher l\u2019intention de la l\u00e9gislature pour interpr\u00e9ter un acte suivant ses propes notions de ce qu\u2019il aurait dii statuer. Maxwell on Statutes ([16]). York & Midland Railway Company v The Queen ([17]).\nLorsque le langage est pr\u00e9cis et sans ambiguit\u00e9, mais en m\u00eame temps incapable d\u2019une signification raisonnable et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019acte n\u2019est pas susceptible d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, une cour n\u2019a pas le droit de donner aux mots sur de simples conjectures, une signification qui ne leur appartient pas. Maxwell on Statutes ([18]). Cette r\u00e8gle ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux cas o\u00f9 le langage est pr\u00e9cis et susceptible que d\u2019une seule signification.\nLes mots \u201c ou par la coutume \u201d \u201cor practice \u201d ins\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la section 22 de l\u2019acte du Manitoba n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 une signification technique, quoique dans le langage ordinaire ils en aient une bien claire et peu susceptible d\u2019ambiguit\u00e9. On pr\u00e9tend cependant qu\u2019ils signifient que les catholiques romains, quoique forc\u00e9s de contribuer au soutien des \u00e9coles publiques, ont la permission de maintenir des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es comme \u00e9coles priv\u00e9es. C\u2019est une interpr\u00e9tation tr\u00e8s \u00e9troite et en contradiction avec les termes de la sec. 22. On pr\u00e9tend aussi qu\u2019ils assurent l\u2019exemption de l\u2019obligation d\u2019assister aux \u00e9coles publiques ; mais l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus lib\u00e9rale et la plus sens\u00e9e est sans doute que les \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es existant de fait lors de l\u2019Union, ces mots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits dans l\u2019acte du Manitoba pour leur donner une existence l\u00e9gale de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la l\u00e9gislature locale de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer \u00e0 leur d\u00e9triment.\nSi les mots \u201cpar l\u00e0 coutume \u201d ou \u201c by practice \u201d \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes on pourrait leur appliquer une ancienne r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui d\u00e9clare qu\u2019une chose comprise dans la lettre du statut n\u2019est cependant pas dans les limites du statut, si elle n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la l\u00e9gislature ([19]). C\u2019est donc l\u2019intention de la l\u00e9gislature qu\u2019il faut rechercher pour se faire une id\u00e9e juste de la signification des mots \u201cby practice.\u201d\nMaxwell dit en outre ([20]) :\nTo arrive at the real meaning, it is always necessary to take a broad general view of the Act, so as to get an exact conception, of its aim, scope and object. Is is necessary according to Lord Coke, to consider: 1. What was the law before the act was passed. 2. What was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided. 3. What remedy Parliament has appointed ; and 4. The reason of the remedy.\nCette r\u00e8gle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la cause de Heydon ([21]), d\u00e9cid\u00e9e sous le r\u00e8gne d\u2019Elizabeth et a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie depuis.\nIl faut souvent, pour trouver la v\u00e9ritable signification des mots employ\u00e9s dans un statut, remonter \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du sujet et examiner les circonstances particuli\u00e8res qui ont port\u00e9 la l\u00e9gislature \u00e0 adopter la disposition.\nDans la cause de River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson, (1), Lord Blackburn dit \u00e0 la page 763 :\nI shall state as precisely as I can what I understand from the decided cases to be the principles on which the courts of law act in construing instruments in writing, and a statute is an instrument in writing. In all cases the object is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used. But from the interpretation of language, it is impossible to know what that intention is without inquiring farther, and seeing what the circumstances were with reference to which the words were used, and that was the object appearing from the circumstances, which the person using them had in view, for the meaning of words varies according to the circumstances with respect to which they were used.\nDans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des statuts dit Maxwell (2) au sujet de la cause de Gorham v. The Bishop of Exeter (3) :\nThe interpreter in order to underotand the subject matter, and the scope and object of the enactment, must, in Coke\u2019s words, ascertain what was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided, that is, he must call to his aid all those external or historical facts which are necessary for the purpose, and which led to the enactment, and for those he may consult temporary or other authentic works and writings.\nIn Atty. Gen. v. Sillem (4) Lord Bramwell dit:\nIt may be a legitimate mode of determining the meaning of a doubtful document to place those who have to expound it in the situation of those who made it, and so, perhaps, history may be referred to to show what facts existed bringing about a statute, and what matters influenced men\u2019s minds when it was made.\nLord Turner dans la cause de Hawkins v. Gathercole (5):\nIn construing acts of Parliament the words which are used are not alone to be regarded. Regard must also be had to the intent and meaning of the legislature. The rule upon the subject is well expressed in the case of Stradling v. Morgan (6), and also in Eyston v. Studd (7). In determining the question before us, we have therefore to consider not merely the words of the Act of Parliament, but the intent of the legislature to be collected from, the cause and necessity of the Act being made from a comparison of its several parts, and from foreign (meaning extraneous) circumstances, so far as they can justly be considered to throw light upon the subject.\nIn Holme v. Guy ([22]), Jessel M. E. dit :\nThe court is not oblivious of the history of law and legislation. Although the court is not at liberty to construe an Act of Parliament by the motives which influenced the legislature, yet when the history of law and legislation tells the court what the object of the legislature was, the court is to see whether the terms of the section are such as fairly to carry out that object and no other, and to read the section with a view to finding out what it means, and not with a view of extending it to something that was not intended.\nPour \u00e9tablir la v\u00e9ritable signification des mots \u201c ou par la coutume \u201d \u201c by practice \u201d ces autorit\u00e9s nous justifient d\u2019examiner les circonstances et les motifs qui les ont fait introduire dans le statut.\nLa 93e section de l\u2019acte de l\u2019A. B. N. donne \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature de chaque province le pouvoir exclusif de faire les lois concernant l\u2019\u00e9ducation sujet toutefois \u00e0 certaines restrictions dont la premi\u00e8re est que rien dans ces lois ne portera pr\u00e9judice au droit ou privil\u00e8ge qu\u2019aucune classe de personnes poss\u00e8de en vertu de la loi. La Ire s.s. de la 22e section de l\u2019acte du Manitoba ajoute \u00e0 cette prohibition celle de pr\u00e9judicier aux droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la coutume \u00e0 aucune classe de personnes aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 ceux conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi.\nQuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la raison de l\u2019introduction de cette restriction dans la sec. 93 et pour quels motifs a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendue au droit qui ne reposait que sur la coutume dans Manitoba lors de la passation de l\u2019Acte 33 Vie, ch. 3?\nLorsque les provinces d\u2019Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, la Nouvelle-Ecosse et le Nouveau-Brunswick form\u00e8rent la conl\u00e9d\u00e9-ration chacune avait un syst\u00e8me complet d\u2019\u00e9coles publiques \u00e9tablies par la loi. Dans Ontario et Qu\u00e9bec la loi reconnaissait aux minorit\u00e9s d\u2019une croyance diff\u00e9rente de celle de la majorit\u00e9 le droit d\u2019avoir des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es. En \u00e9tablissant ces \u00e9coles les minorit\u00e9s \u00e9taient exemptes de contribution au soutien des \u00e9coles publiques et avaient droit \u00e0 une proportion de l\u2019octroi l\u00e9gislatif.\nDans le Haut-Canada (Ontario) la question des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es avait form\u00e9 le sujet de luttes vives et passionn\u00e9es entre protestants et catholiques, mais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enfin r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par l\u2019acte des \u00e9coles de 1863, qui avait r\u00e9tabli la paix et l\u2019harmonie dans la province.\nDans la Nouvelle-Ecosse et le Nouveau-Brunswick il en \u00e9tait autrement bien que de tait les catholiques y avaient leurs propres \u00e9coles en vertu de la loi des \u00e9coles communes ou \u00e9coles de paroisses, mais ces \u00e9coles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas reconnues comme \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es et les catholiques n\u2019y avaient aucun droit ou privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 ce sujet par la loi.\nLes auteurs de la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration afin d\u2019\u00e9viter le renouvellement de l\u2019agitation qui avait exist\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet dans l\u2019ancienne province du Canada entre les catholiques et les protestants, tout en reconnaissant aux provinces le droit de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9ducation adopt\u00e8rent sagement des dispositions pour la protection des droits et privil\u00e8ges des minorit\u00e9s, en prohibant toute l\u00e9gislation qui porterait atteinte aux droits et privil\u00e8ges existant sur le sujet.\nCette restriction devait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 toute nouvelle province qui entreraient plus tard dans la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 celles qui en firent partie originairement.\nUne question concernant l\u2019\u00e9tendue de cette restriction fut soulev\u00e9e dans le Nouveau-Brunswick. La loi en force \u00e0 ce sujet lors de la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration \u00e9tait l\u2019acte des \u00e9coles de paroisses de 1858. En 1871 la legislature passa un acte concernant les \u00e9coles communes auquel les catholiques romains firent beaucoup d\u2019objections. Des p\u00e9titions furent adress\u00e9es au parlement du Canada pour en emp\u00eacher la mise en force. Enfin la question fut port\u00e9e devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick et la cour dans un jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 par Sir W. J. Ritchie, alors juge en chef de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Nouveau-Brunswick, d\u00e9cida que les catholiques du Nouveau-Brunswick n\u2019avaient par la loi (by law) au temps de la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration aucun droit ou privil\u00e8ge concernant les \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es. Dans le cours de ses observations l\u2019honorable juge en chef s\u2019exprime ainsi :\nWhere is there anything that can,\u2019 with propriety, be termed a legal right ? Surely the legislature must have intended to deal with legal rights and privileges. How is it to be defined ? How enforced ?\nEt plus loin :\nIf the Eoman Catholics had no legal rights, as a class, to claim any control over, or to insist that the doctrines of their church should be taught in all or any schools under the Parish Schools Act, how can it be said (though as a matter of fact such doctrines may have been taught in numbers of such schools) that, as a class of peisoiis they have been affected in any legal right or privilege with respect to \u201cDenominational Schools \u201d construing those words in their ordinary meaning, because under the Common Schools Act, 1871, it is provided that the schools shall be non-sectarian ?\nCette d\u00e9cision fut plus tard confirm\u00e9e au Conseil Priv\u00e9. Il est facile de voir par les raisonnements donn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette d\u00e9cision et par l\u2019importance donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u201c legal rights \u201d que si les droits que les catholiques avaient par la coutume, eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement mentionn\u00e9s, comme ceux existant par la loi, que la d\u00e9cision e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente.\nM. Ewart, conseil de l\u2019appelant, ayant fait la remarque que les mots \u201cpar la coutume\u201d avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits dans l\u2019Acte du Manitoba pour pr\u00e9venir les difficult\u00e9s qui avaient eu lieu au Nouveau-Brunswick, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, fit remarquer que l\u2019acte des \u00e9coles avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pasl\u00e9 en 1871, un an apr\u00e8s l\u2019acte du Manitoba ; mais il aurait d\u00fb ajouter que ce projet de loi \u00e9tait depuis longtemps devant la l\u00e9gislature et le public, et faisait le sujet de discussions tr\u00e8s anim\u00e9es. L\u2019honorable Geo. A. King avait introduit cette mesure en 1869 pour la premi\u00e8re fois, et encore une seconde fois le 24 f\u00e9vrier 1870, lorsqu\u2019elle fut r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 un comit\u00e9 de toute la chambre et discut\u00e9e les 17, 22, 31 mars et le 1er avril. Cette loi ne devait venir en force qu\u2019un an apr\u00e8s son adoption.\nL\u2019acte du Manitoba pass\u00e9 par le Parlement de la Puissance n\u2019est devenu loi que le 12 mai 1870, plus d\u2019un mois apr\u00e8s la discussion de l\u2019acte des \u00e9coles du Nouveau-Brunswick et plus d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re introduction dans la l\u00e9gislature.\nY a-t-il rien d\u2019\u00e9tonnant \u00e0 ce que les discussions qui ont eu lieu sur le sujet \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques aient \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9es et comment\u00e9es par le public, comme c\u2019est ordinairement le cas, et soient parvenues \u00e0 la connaissance des membres du Gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et de la Chambr\u00e9 des Communes ? C\u2019est un fait que l\u2019agitation caus\u00e9e par ce bill \u00e9tait connue de toute la Chambre d\u00e8s Communes, et nul doute que c\u2019est pour pr\u00e9venir le retour de semblable agitation que les mots \u201c par la coutume \u201d ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s dans la 22e section de l\u2019Acte du Manitoba.\nL\u2019existence d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es dans le territoire du Manitoba avant l\u2019organisation de la province \u00e9tait connue, ainsi que le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune loi pour prot\u00e9ger les minorit\u00e9s catholiques ou protestantes qui auraient voulu conserver leurs \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es. Ces faits, on doit le pr\u00e9sumer,\u00e9taient connus des l\u00e9gislateurs. Comme il n\u2019y avait alors aucune loi concernant les \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es ni aucune autre esp\u00e8ce d\u2019\u00e9cole, la 1\u00e8re s.s. de la section 93, ou son introduction dans l\u2019acte du Manitoba n\u2019eut produit aucun effet. Les catholiques de cette province s\u2019y fussent trouv\u00e9s dans une situation pire qu\u2019au Nouveau-Brunswick, car l\u00e0 au moins ainsi qu\u2019il est constat\u00e9 par le jugement dans l\u2019affaire Renaud, les catholiques sans y avoir droit par la loi, faisait, cependant, enseigner leurs doctrines dans les \u00e9coles, existantes.\nLes auteurs de l\u2019acte du Manitoba ont d\u00fb \u00eatre frapp\u00e9s de cet \u00e9tat de choses et c\u2019est sans doute pour y rem\u00e9dier qu\u2019ils ont ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la section 22 les mots par la coutume \u201cby practice\u201d qui ne se trouvent pas dans la section 93, dans le but d\u2019assurer plus tard aux minorit\u00e9s catholiques ou protestantes le droit aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es dont elles jouissaient alors par la coutume \u201cby practice\u201d Aussi la l\u00e9gislature du Manitoba a-t-elle si bien compris l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en introduisant les mots \u201cby practice \u201d dans l\u2019acte du Manitoba, que par son premier acte concernant les \u00e9coles, elle a \u00e9tabli un syst\u00e8me complet d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es catholiques et protestantes, qui a exist\u00e9 pendant dix-neuf ans. Son interpr\u00e9tation des mots \u201c par la coutume \u201d a \u00e9t\u00e9 conforme \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la l\u00e9gislation et aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nSi la clause 22 n\u2019e\u00fbt contenue que les termes de la 1\u00e8re s.s. de la section 93, elle n\u2019e\u00fbt pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 les droits des minorit\u00e9s parce que les termes \u201crights and privileges by law\u201d n\u2019auraient pu s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de choses au Manitoba o\u00f9 les \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es n\u2019avaient pas d\u2019existence l\u00e9gale, mais \u00e9taient \u00e9tablies depuis longtemps par la pratique et la coutume du pays.\nL\u2019addition des termes par la coutume \u201cby practice\u201d \u00e9tait indispensable pour rencontrer le cas auquel il s\u2019agissait de pourvoir.\nS\u2019il est vrai que ces termes n\u2019ont point une signification technique, il n\u2019en est pas moins vrai que dans les circonstances o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s ils ont une signification claire et pr\u00e9cise et rendent exactement l\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019on a voulu exprimer d\u2019une chose qui, sans cons\u00e9cration l\u00e9gale, existait de fait par l\u2019usage et les habitudes du pays. C\u2019est une expression de langage ordinaire et qui doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans sa signification ordinaire et populaire. Les termes \u201cby law \u201d et \u201cby practice \u201d signifient \u00e9videment des choses diff\u00e9rentes et l\u2019addition des mots \u201c by practice \u201d fait clairement voir que la l\u00e9gislature avait l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tendre la prohibition afin de l\u2019appliquer au cas particulier de la province. Ces mots n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis l\u00e0 accidentellement et sans but. La position des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es existantes de fait \u00e9tait connue des auteurs de l\u2019acte au moins par les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s pour r\u00e9gler les conditions de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de la province dans la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. On a sans doute discut\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement la question et c\u2019est pour la r\u00e9gler d\u00e9finitivement qu\u2019on a ajout\u00e9 dans la sec. 22 les mots \u201c by practice \u201d de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 interdire toute l\u00e9gislation \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9judice.\nIl serait absurde de pr\u00e9tendre que le privil\u00e8ge garanti aux catholiques par les mots \u201cby practice \u201d doit s\u2019entendre de celui d\u2019avoir des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es comme \u00e9coles priv\u00e9es support\u00e9es par eux-m\u00eames. Ce privil\u00e8ge existant de droit commun ne requ\u00e9rait aucune l\u00e9gislation et les expressions \u201c by practice \u201d seraient alors tout \u00e0 fait inutiles et sans aucun signification. Tandis que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, connaissant l\u2019existence dans le territoire d\u2019\u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, et le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune loi les autorisant, a voulu en assurer l\u2019existence l\u00e9gale apr\u00e8s l\u2019union, il comprenait que les dispositions seules de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord ne suffiraient pas pour cet objet, C\u2019est sans doute pour ce motif que la section 93 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019addition des mots \u201cby practice\u201d C\u2019est alors une disposition qui au lieu de n\u2019avoir aucune signification comble sagement une lacune importante qui avait exist\u00e9 dans l\u2019organisation de la province.\nC\u2019est ici d\u2019appliquer la r\u00e8gle qui veut que lorsque le langage de la loi est susceptible de deux interpr\u00e9tations dont l\u2019une serait absurde et l\u2019autre raisonnable et d\u2019un effet salutaire on doit adopter la derni\u00e8re comme conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\nDans la cause de la Reine v. Monk ([23]), Brett L. J. dit:\nWhen a statute is capable of two constructions, one of which will work a manifest injustice, and the other will work no injustice, you are to assume that the legislature intended that which would work no injustice.\nLord Blackburn exprime la m\u00eame opinion dans la cause de Rothes v. Kirkcaldy Water Works Commissioners ([24]) lorsqu\u2019il dit :\nI quite agree that no court is entitled to depart from the intention of the legislature as appearing from the words of the Act because it is thought unreasonable, but when two constructions are open, the court may adopt the more reasonable of the two.\nII n\u2019est pas difficile de voir laquelle de ces deux interpr\u00e9tations est la plus raisonnable et la plus juste. Si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des mots \u201cby practice\u201d n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour leur donner droit de maintenir leurs \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, les catholiques seraient tax\u00e9s pour des \u00e9coles qu\u2019ils ne pourraient fr\u00e9quenter et dont les protestants auraient seuls le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice. Tandis qu\u2019au contraire si l\u2019on donne aux mots \u201c by practice \u201d leur v\u00e9ritable inter-pr\u00e9tation, les \u00e9coles des catholiques seront reconnues par la loi. Ces mots \u201c by practice \u201d n\u2019ont sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits dans l\u2019acte du Manitoba que pour assurer \u00e0 ceux qui le d\u00e9siraient le droit de maintenir leurs \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es et pour en consacrer l\u2019existence l\u00e9gale.\nCes raisons me paraissent suffisantes pour d\u00e9montrer que la loi dont il s\u2019agit constitue une infraction \u00e9vidente \u00e0 la disposition de la section 22, s. s. 1\u00e8re de l\u2019acte du Manitoba qui prohibe toute l\u00e9gislation de nature \u00e0 porter pr\u00e9judice aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es.\nC\u2019est encore une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui veut que pour correctement interpr\u00e9ter une loi, nous devions la consid\u00e9rer dans son ensemble et en comparer ses diverses dispositions entre elles afin d\u2019en saisir le v\u00e9ritable esprit. L\u2019acte du Manitoba ne comprend pas seulement la section 22 au sujet des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es. Il y a encore plusieurs autres dispositions \u00e0 ce sujet en partie prise dans la section 93 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, dont le but \u00e9vident est de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019exercice du droit aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es accord\u00e9 par la section 1\u00e8re.\nLa 2i\u00e8me sous-section de la section 22 accorde un appel au gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil de ,tout acte ou d\u00e9cision d\u2019aucune autorit\u00e9 provinciale affectant aucun des droits ou privil\u00e8ges de la minorit\u00e9 protestante ou catholique romaine des sujets de Sa Majest\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation.\nPar la sous-section 3 :\nDans le cas o\u00f9 il ne serait pas d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 telle loi provinciale que, de temps \u00e0 autre, le gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil jugera n\u00e9cessaire pour donner suite et ex\u00e9cution aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente section ou dans le cas o\u00f9 quelque d\u00e9cision du gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil, sur appel interjet\u00e9 en vertu de cette section ne serait pas mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 provinciale comp\u00e9tente,-alors et en tout tel cas, et en tant seulement que les circonstances de chaque cas l\u2019exigeront le parlement du Canada pourra d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter des lois propres \u00e0 y rem\u00e9dier pour donner suite et ex\u00e9cution aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente section, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 toute d\u00e9cision rendue par I\u0119 gouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de cette m\u00eame section.\nLa 1\u00e8re sous-section en parlant des \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es dit qu\u2019il ne sera port\u00e9 aucun jjr\u00e9judice au droit ou privil\u00e8ge existant par la loi ou la coutume, au sujet de ces \u00e9coles ; la deuxi\u00e8me donne un droit d\u2019appel de tout acte ou d\u00e9cision de la l\u00e9gislature ou de toute autre autorite provinciale de nature \u00e0 affecter les droits ou privil\u00e8ges des minorit\u00e9s catholiques ou protestantes au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Si ces minorit\u00e9s ont des droits ou privil\u00e8ges au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9ducation c\u2019est sans doute ceux qui concernent leurs \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es. C\u2019est donc qu\u2019ils ont des droits et privil\u00e8ges \u00e0 ce sujet puisque la loi leur accorde un droit d\u2019appel pour les prot\u00e9ger contre toute atteinte qni leur porterait pr\u00e9judice; Pourquoi un appel leur aurait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient aucun droit aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es ? N\u2019est-ce pas au contraire parce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession de ce droit, dans la pratique que le parlement en a consacr\u00e9 l\u2019existence l\u00e9gale par cette disposition, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 les prot\u00e9ger contre toute atteinte de la l\u00e9gislature ou de toute autre autorit\u00e9 provinciale ?\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e aux mots \u201cby practice \u201d se trouve ainsi confirm\u00e9e par les autres dispositions de la section 22 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne laisser aucun doute sur leur signification.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019acte 58 Vie. ch. 38 (Man.) concernant les \u00e9coles publiques est ultra vires et que les deux r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s en vertu de cet acte sont ill\u00e9gaux et doivent \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4te et l\u2019appel accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEUEAU J.\u2014L\u2019appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente instance attaque la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019Acte des Ecoles pass\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature de la province de Manitoba en 1890. Les proc\u00e9dures devant les cours provinciales et la forme sous laquelle la question nous est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 au long d\u00e9crites par mes savants coll\u00e8gues pr\u00e9opinants, et il serait oiseux de les redire. La question de droit elle-m\u00eame qui nous est soumise est restreinte \u00e0 un cadre assez \u00e9troit, car, tant par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province dans leur factum et leur plaidoirie \u00e0 l\u2019audience, que par les savants juges de la cour dont est appel dans leurs jugements, il est admis que les catholiques de la province ne sont pas, et n\u2019auraient pu \u00eatre, par le statut en question, priv\u00e9s du droit dont ils ont toujours joui, d\u2019avoir leurs \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es sans \u00eatre nullement oblig\u00e9s d\u2019envoyer leurs enfants aux \u00e9coles libres. C\u2019est uniquement sur les dispositions de ce statut qui soumettent les catholiques \u00e0 l\u2019imp\u00f4t pour l\u2019entretien des \u00e9coles libres qu\u2019il y a litige.\nLa section 22 de l\u2019acte organique de Manitoba de 1870 se lit comme suit dans la version fran\u00e7aise, qui, il ne faut pas l\u2019oublier, fait loi tout comme la version anglaise :\u2014\nDans la province, la l\u00e9gislature pourra exclusivement d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter des lois relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation, sujettes et conformes aux dispositions suivantes; Rien dans ces lois ne pourra pr\u00e9judicier \u00e0 aucun droit ou privil\u00e8ge conf\u00e9i\u00e9, lors de l\u2019Union, par la loi ou par la coutume (or practice) \u00e0 aucune classe particuli\u00e8re de personnes dans la province, relativement aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, (d\u00e9nominational schools).\u201d\nC\u2019est textuellement la reproduction de la sec. 93 de l\u2019acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, avec la simple addition des mots \u201c ou par la coutume.\u201d Ce sont donc les droits et les privil\u00e8ges dont jouissaient par la coutume les catholiques de cette r\u00e9gion, lors de l\u2019Union, relativement aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es (car de loi sur la mati\u00e8re il n\u2019en existait pas) auxquels la l\u00e9gislature ne peut porter pr\u00e9judice, et le pouvoir de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation ne lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019avec cette restriction. Ceci ne pouvait \u00eatre contest\u00e9, et le savant procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province n\u2019est en lice que pour soutenir avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que l\u2019acte de la l\u00e9gislature, tout en obligeant l\u2019appelant, et avec lui toute la population catholique de Manitoba, \u00e0 contribuer au fonds des \u00e9coles libres, ne pr\u00e9judicie pas par l\u00e0 \u00e0 aucun droit au privil\u00e8ge que la coutume leur conf\u00e9rait. Il nous faut donc en premier lieu rechercher au dossier la preuve de la coutume en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation dans cette partie du territoire avant l\u2019Union. Sa Grandeur Monseigneur l\u2019Archev\u00eaque de St. Boniface, dans un affidavit produit par l\u2019appelant la d\u00e9crit-dans les termes suivants :\u2014 Prior to the passage of the Act of the Dominion of Canada passed in the thirty-third year of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Chapter 3, known as The Manitoba Act, and prior to the order in council issued in pursuance thereof, there existed in the Territory now constituting the Province of Manitoba a number of effective schools for children. These schools were denominational schools, some of them regulated and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, and others by various Protestant denominations.\nThe means necessary for the support of the Roman Catholic Schools were supplied to some extent by school fees paid by some of the parents of the children who attended the school?, and the rest was paid out of the funds of the Church, contributed by its members.\nDuring the period referred to, Roman Catholics had no interest in or control over the schools of the Protestant denominations, and the members of the Protestant denominations had no interest in or control over the schools of Roman Catholics. There were no Public Schools in the sense of State Schools. The members of the Roman Catholic Church supported the schools of their own Church for the benefit of the Roman Catholic children, and were not under obligation to, and did not, contribute to the support of any other schools.\nIn the matter of education, therefore, during the period referred to, Roman Catholics were as a-matter of custom and practice separate from the rest of the community, and their schools were all conducted according to the distinctive views and beliefs of Roman Catholics as herein set forth.\nRoman Catholic Schools have always formed an integral j)art of the work of the Roman Catholic Church. That Church has always considered the education of the children of Roman Catholic parents as coming peculiarly within its jurisdiction. The School, in the view of the Roman Catholics, is in a large measure the \u201cChildren\u2019s Church,\u201d and wholly incomplete and largely abortive if religious exercises be excluded from it. The Church has always insisted upon its children receiving their education in schools conducted under the supervision of the Church, and upon them being trained in the doctrines and faith of the Church. In education, the Roman Catholic Church attaches very great importance to the spiritual culture of the child, and regards all education unaccompanied by instruction in its religious aspect as possibly detrimental and not beneficial to children. With this regard the Church requires that all teachers of children shall not only be members of the Church, but shall be thoroughly imbued with its principles and faith ; shall recognise its spiritual authority and conform to its diiections. It also requires that such books be used in the schools with regaid to certain subjects as shall combine religious instruction with those subjects, and this applies peculiarly to all history and philosophy.\nSa Gr\u00e2ce, plus loin, jure que :\u2014\nThe Church regards the schools provided for by \u201c The Public Sch mis Act \u201d and being chapter 38 of the Statutes passed in the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, in the fifty-third year of Her reign, as unfit for the purpose of educating their children, and the children of Roman Catholic parents will not attend such schools. Rather than countenance such schools, Roman Catholics will revert to the system of operation previous to the Manitoba Act, and will establish, support and maintain schools in accordance with their principles and faith as aforementioned.\nProtestants are satisfied with the system of education provided for by the said Act, \u201cThe Public Schools Act,\u201d and are perfectly willing to send their children to the schools established and provided for by the said Act. Such schools are in fact similar in all respects to the schools maintained by the Protestants under the legislation in force immediately prior to the passage of the said Act. The main and fundamental-difference between- Protestantsand, Catholics, with reference to education, is that while many Protestants would like education to be of a more distinctly religious character than that provided for by the said Act, yet they are content with that which is so provided and have no conscientious scruples against such a system, the Catholics on the other hand insist and have always insisted upon education being thoroughly permeated with religion and religious aspects. That causes and effects in science, history, philosophy and aught else should be constantly attributed to the Deity and not taught merely as causes and effects.\nThe effect of \u201cThe Public Schools Act \u201d will be to establish public schools in every part of Manitoba where the population is sufficient for the purpose of a school and to supply in this manner education to children free of charge to them or their parents further than their share, in common with other members of the community, of the amounts levied under and by virtue of the provisions contained in the Act.\nIn case Roman Catholics revert to the system in operation previous to the Manitoba Act, they will be brought in direct competition with the said public schools ; owing to the fact that the public schools will be maintained at public expense, and the Roman Catholic schools by school fees and private subscription the latter will labor under serious disadvantage. They will be unable to afford inducements and benefits to children to attend such schools equal to those afforded by public schools, although they would be perfectly able to compete with any or all schools unaided by law-enforced support.\nJohn Sutherland et Alexander Poison, dans deux affidavits produits par l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur son opposition pro-\u2019 duite en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant disent aussi, sur l\u2019\u00e9tat des \u00e9coles dans la province avant l\u2019Union :\u2014\nThat school which existed prior to the Province of Manitoba entering Confederation were purely private schools and were not in any way subject to public control nor did they in any way receive public support.\nNo school taxes were collected by any authority prior to the Province of Manitoba entering Confederation and there-were no means by which any person could be forced by law to support any of said private schools. I think the only public revenue of any kind then collected was the customs duty, usually four per cent.\nIl ressort clairement, comme fait, de ces affidavits, qui constituent l\u2019unique preuve au dossier, que, avant l\u2019Union, par la coutume, les catholiques de ce territoire jouissaient non seulement du privil\u00e8ge d\u2019avoir leurs \u00e9coles, mais aussi n\u00e9gativement, comme corollaire et partie essentielle de ce privil\u00e8ge, de celui de ne pas contribuer \u00e0 aucun autre syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9ducation. De fait, c\u2019\u00e9tait de ne pas \u00eatre oblig\u00e9s de contribuer \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9coles que les leurs, qui v\u00e9ritablement constituait pour eux un privil\u00e8ge. Le privil\u00e8ge seul d\u2019avoir leurs propres \u00e9coles aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 illusoire, ou plut\u00f4t, n\u2019aurait pu \u00eatre appel\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge ; avoir des \u00e9coles volontaires, c\u2019est de droit commun ; ce n\u2019est pas un privil\u00e8ge : et une coutume, qui leur eut fait soutenir et les leurs et celles des autres, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pour eux un singulier privil\u00e8ge. Le privil\u00e8ge en somme aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 celui des autres. C\u2019est bien l\u00e0 cependant, il me semble, le seul que l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans l\u2019instance voudrait conc\u00e9der maintenant \u00e0 la minorit\u00e9 catholique dans la province.\nLa loi de 1891, dit l\u2019intim\u00e9e, oblige bien, il est vrai, les catholiques de contribuer aux \u00e9coles libres, mais elle ne les oblige pas d\u2019y envoyer leurs enfants. Elle ne leur d\u00e9fend pas non plus d\u2019avoir leurs \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, donc elle ne pr\u00e9judicie en rien \u00e0 aucun des droits et privil\u00e8ges que leur conf\u00e9rait la coutume avant l\u2019union, donc, elle est intra vires. Je crois ce raisonnement tout \u00e0 fait erron\u00e9. De fait, j\u2019aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas le croire s\u00e9rieux, s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u la sanction du tribunal provincial. A quoi, en effet, se r\u00e9sume-t-il? A faire dire par la majorit\u00e9 non-catholique \u00e0 la minorit\u00e9 catholique : \u201c Vous avez le ,privil\u00e8ge d\u2019avoir vos \u00e9coles; nous vous le laissons, pourvu que vous nous aidiez \u00e0 maintenir les n\u00f4tres Vous ne pouvez envoyer vos enfants \u00e0 nos \u00e9coles ; mais nous ne vous y obligeons pas, tout ce que nous vous demandons, c\u2019est de payer pour instruire les n\u00f4tres.\u201d Je cherche en vain au dossier la preuve que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 la coutume avant l\u2019Union. J\u2019y trouve tout le\u201d contraire.\nEt peut-on d\u2019ailleurs, imaginer un syst\u00e8me semblable \u00e0 celui que l\u2019intim\u00e9e voudrait faire pr\u00e9valoir dans Manitoba, et en m\u00eame temps reconna\u00eetre \u00e0 la minorit\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 ses \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, droit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pouvait nier en face de la section 22 de l\u2019acte organique de 1870. Il est patent que le l\u00e9gislateur, par cette section, pr\u00e9voyant que, n\u00e9cessairement, dans l\u2019avenir, l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des deux classes, protestante ou catholique,\u2019devra dominer par le nombre dans la province projet\u00e9e, d\u00e9cr\u00e8te pour l\u2019un et l\u2019autre de ces cas. Elles \u00e9taient alors \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e9galement divis\u00e9es, si l\u2019on en juge par la premi\u00e8re l\u00e9gislation de la nouvelle province sur la mati\u00e8re, en 1871, o\u00f9 il appara\u00eet que le bureau d\u2019\u00e9ducation fut \u00e9galement compos\u00e9 de catholiq\u2019ues et de protestants, avec un surintendant pour chacune de ces deux classes et partage \u00e9gal entre elles de la subvention nationale. Dans cet \u00e9tat de choses, le parlement, par cette section 22 de l\u2019acte, pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019une et \u00e0 l\u2019autre de ces \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s. La sous-section premi\u00e8re, que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9e au long, assure \u00e0 la minorit\u00e9, soit catholique, soit protestante, les droits que la coutume lui avait conf\u00e9r\u00e9s jusqu\u2019alors, et la sous-section seconde lui donne le droit d\u2019appel au G-ouverneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil de toute l\u00e9gislation affectant aucun de ses droits sur la mati\u00e8re. S\u2019il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 que la population protestante f\u00fbt en minorit\u00e9, elle n\u2019aurait pu \u00eatre contrainte de contribuer au maintien des \u00e9coles catholiques. Elle aurait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 l\u2019exercice de son droit \u00e0 ses \u00e9coles, tel que ses co-religion-naires en jouissent dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans toute sa pl\u00e9nitude et sans entraves, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire avec exemption de taxes pour les \u00e9coles catholiques. Aujourd\u2019hui, les catholiques qui composent la minorit\u00e9 ne r\u00e9clament que le m\u00eame droit, et le libre exercice de ce droit. Je suis d\u2019opinion que leur r\u00e9clamation est bien fond\u00e9e. Us ont droit \u00e0 leur syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9coles, tel que leurs co-religionnaires en jouissent dans Ontario, ou sur le m\u00eame principe. C\u2019est dans ce but, et dans ce but seul, du moins je n\u2019en puis voir d\u2019autre, qu\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans l\u2019acte organique de 1870 cette disposition sp\u00e9ciale relative aux \u00e9coles s\u00e9par\u00e9es, reproduite de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, en y ajoutant les mots \u201c ou par la coutume,\u201d mots rendus n\u00e9cessaires, je l\u2019ai dit, pour compl\u00e9ter la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur et assurer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses volont\u00e9s par le fait bien connu qu\u2019il n\u2019existait alors sur la mati\u00e8re, dans ces r\u00e9gions, aucune loi, et que le tout y \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par la coutume, et par la coutume seule.\nLa corporation intim\u00e9e et le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral tout en reconnaissant \u00e0 la minorit\u00e9 le droit abstrait d\u2019avoir ses \u00e9coles, voudraient en g\u00eaner le libre exercice. Par le statut en question, en effet, toute la subvention de l\u2019Etat pour l\u2019\u00e9ducation est appropri\u00e9e aux \u00e9coles publiques, ou \u00e9coles libres ; toute allocation aux \u00e9coles de la minorit\u00e9 est refus\u00e9e ; sec. 108. Cette subvention, cependant, est prise sur le revenu public auquel la minorit\u00e9, a d\u00fbment contribu\u00e9 sa quote-part. Et c\u2019est l\u00e0, tout ce dont sa Grandeur Monseigneur l\u2019Archev\u00eaque de St.-Boniface se plaint dans le par. 11 de son affidavit, qu\u2019on a quelque part mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9. Sa Grandeur ne craint pas pour les \u00e9coles catholiques la comp\u00e9tition des \u00e9coles publiques si la l\u00e9gislature veut bien mettre les deux sur le m\u00eame pied devant la loi. Ce que Sa Grandeur dit, c\u2019est qu\u2019en maintenant les \u00e9coles publiques aux frais de l\u2019Etat, tout en laissant les \u00e9coles catholiques \u00e0 la merci de contributions volontaires, celles-ci se trouveront dans une position des plus d\u00e9favorables. Et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, il me semble, d\u2019arguments pour le d\u00e9montrer. Mais non-seulement, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, le statut en question donne aux \u00e9coles publiques seules le total de la subvention provinciale, mais il soumet les catholiques \u00e0 la taxe directe pour leur maintien. Et plus encore: non-seulement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de chaque contribuable catholique, mais chaque maison m\u00eame d\u00e9cote catholique, et toutes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s affect\u00e9es pour les fins de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de leurs enfants, par les catholiques, sont imposables pour le maintien des \u00e9coles libres.\nLe statut va m\u00eame par la section 179 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la confiscation au profit des \u00e9coles libres, en certain cas, de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 scolaire de la minorit\u00e9 catholique.\nJe suis d\u2019opinion que cette l\u00e9gislation est pr\u00e9judiciable aux droits et privil\u00e8ges dont jouissait cette minorit\u00e9 avant l\u2019Union, et par cons\u00e9quent ultra vites.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a cru trouver une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant dans l\u2019argument suivant : \u201c Il est possible, lit-elle, que cette l\u00e9gislation puisse pr\u00e9judicier aux Iroits de la minorit\u00e9, et que malgr\u00e9 cela, elle entre parfaitement dans le cadre des attributions de la l\u00e9gislature de Manitoba, comme par exemple, une taxe municipale ou autre peut bien indirectement, plus ou moins, priver les catholiques des fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour le maintien de leurs \u00e9coles, et, cependant, il leur faut bien s\u2019y soumettre.\u201d Ce raisonnement, il me semble, porte \u00e0 faux. D\u2019abord c\u2019est dans ses lois sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation que la l\u00e9gislature ne peut, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la section 22 de l\u2019acte f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de 1870, pr\u00e9judicier aux droits de la minorit\u00e9. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de lois sur aucune autre mati\u00e8re. Puis, dans le cas d\u2019une taxe municipale, la minorit\u00e9 est sur un pied de parfaite \u00e9galit\u00e9 avec la majorit\u00e9 et re\u00e7oit, comme elle, l\u2019\u00e9quivalent de ce qu\u2019elle contribue en participant, comme elle, aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de cette taxe. Tandis qu\u2019ici, l\u2019appelant se dit l\u00e9s\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il est contraint \u00e0 payer pour les autres, \u00e0 contribuer au soutien d\u2019\u00e9coles dont il ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera jamais. C\u2019est l\u00e0 tout ce dont il se plaint. On lui laisse bien, en th\u00e9orie, son syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9coles, mais on met des entraves \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de son droit. On ne lui en laisse qu\u2019un simulacre. Si l\u2019Etat pr\u00e9l\u00e8ve sur cette minorit\u00e9 soit $20,000, ou aucun montant quelconque pour le soutien des \u00e9coles libres, c\u2019est bien, il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident, autant de ressource dont elle est priv\u00e9e pour le soutien de ses propres \u00e9coles. Or, mettre des entraves \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit, l\u2019obstruer ou lui nuire, c\u2019est bien, il me semble, porter pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ce droit. Et c\u2019est l\u00e0, ce qu\u2019en termes non \u00e9quivoques, la l\u00e9gislature de Manitoba, par l\u2019acte d\u2019o\u00f9 elle puise exclusivement ses pouvoirs, n\u2019a pu faire.\nJe suis d\u2019avis d\u2019allouer l\u2019appel.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The statute of Canada which gave its constitution to the Province of Manitoba ([25]), declares, in section 22, that in and for the Province of Manitoba the legislature \u201c may exclusively make laws in relation to education subject and according to the following provision :\u2014\n\u201cNothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice at the union.\u201d\n\u201cLaw\u201d here evidently means statute law. The basis of the constitution given to the new province ([26]) was the British North America Act, 1867. It is declared that the act shall apply to the province except -ting, amongst other things, such provisions as are varied by the Manitoba Act.\nSection 93 of the British North America Act, which dealt with the subject of provincial legislation respecting education, was not intended to be applied to Manitoba without some variations. It was therefore re-written to form section 22 of the Manitoba Act, the original language being adhered to wherever no variation of the provisions was intendedc In this way I suppose it was that section 22 happens to refer to rights and privileges with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had in the province by law, when there was no statute touching such schools that affected Manitoba. The reference in section 93 was to statutory rights and privileges existing in some of the provinces entering into confederation. In sec. 22 it meant nothing. If that section, which is a transcript of section 93 with the interpolation of the words \u201c or practice,\u201d had not introduced those words it would have been inoperative for want of something to operate on. It is not an example of very precise or accurate drafting. The first question for us to decide is wThat the added words \u201c or practice\u201d mean, or whether they also mean nothing.\n\u201cWhich any class of persons have by law or practice\u201d\u2014in grammatical effect \u201chave by law or by practice.\u201d\nWhat is meant by having by practice ?\nTo have by law here means to have under some statutory provision, the preposition \u201c by \u201d pointing to the law or statute as the means or instrument by which the right or privilege was acquired. Are we obliged to understand the term \u201c by practice \u201d as intended to signify acquired by practice or user, involving some idea of prescription? It is arguable, and has in effect been argued, that that is the proper understanding of the term; that the word \u201c by\u201d must have the same force when understood in the one place as when expressed in the other ; leading- to the conclusion that, inasmuch as no rights or privileges in respect of denominational schools had been acquired in the territory in thai, manner, the clause in question is wholly inoperative.\nThe construction thus contended for may be capable of being supported by strict reasoning from rules of grammar or rhetoric, but it is not, in my judgment, appropriate to this clause. We have seen that precision and accuracy are not characteristics of the clause as a whole, and we cannot properly single out these particular words \u201c by practice\u201d for very critical and pedantic treatment.\nWe must credit the legislature with having intended that these words, which were added to those taken from section 93, should have some effect. I take the meaning of the clause to be that rights and privileges in respect of denominational schools existing by statute, if any such there had been, and rights actually exercised in practice at the time of the union, were not to be prejudicially affected by provincial legislation.\nThere were denominational schools maintained by different classes of persons, some by the Roman Catholic church others by Protestants. The right to establish and maintain such schools was not derived from statutory law. It was incident to the freedom of British subjects, and was independent of and anterior to legislation. The Manitoba Act did not assume to preserve that right merely as an abstract and theoretical right, but it did so in favour of such classes of persons as at the union were practically exercising it.\nIf this construction seems to do any violence to the language of the clause it is only by treating the word \u201cby \u201d where it is understood before the word \u201c practice,\u201d as not having precisely the same force as when expressed before the word \u201claw.\u201d But, as once remarked by one of the most eminent English judges, Lord Stowell, when Sir W. Scott\u2014\n\u201cCourts are not bound to a strictness at once harsh and pedantic in application of the statutes.\u201d ([27])\nDicta to the same effect, as well as examples of their application, abound in the books. Thus in a recent case, Salmon v. Duncombe ([28]) we find it laid down in the judgment of the judicial committee that when the main object and intention of the statute are clear it must not be reduced to a nullity by the draftman\u2019s unskilfulness or ignorance of law, except in the case of necessity or the absolute intractability of the language used.\nThe more literal construction of a statute, said Lord Selbourne in Caledonian Railway Co. v. North British Railway Co. ([29]) ought not ta prevail if it is opposed to the intentions of the legislature as apparent by the statute and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction by which that intention will be better effectuated.\nIn my opinion the Eoman Catholics are a class of persons who had, within the meaning of the statute, rights and privileges with respect to denominational schools in the Province of Manitoba at the union.\nThe rights and privileges preserved by the statute were only those peculiar to schools as denominational schools, or which gave the schools that character. Chiefly they were the education of their children under the control and direction of the church and the maintenance of their schools for that purpose.\nA point is made in the affidavit on which these proceedings are founded upon the fact that the schools of the Roman Catholic church were maintained by the Catholics by contributions in some form, as fees for tuition or as contributions to the general funds of the church, or possibly, though we are not told that it was so, as subscriptions for school purposes, and the schools of the Protestants were maintained by Protestants, neither body contributing or being liable to contribute to maintain the schools of the other. The fact is not without importance from a point of view which I shall presently notice, but I am not prepared ta hold that the immunity enjoyed from liability to support schools of another denomination, at a time when taxation for school purposes was unknown in the territory, was a privilege in respect of denominational schools.\nThe provincial statute of 1890 which is attacked as ultra vires renders every taxpayer liable to assessment for the support of the public schools. These schools are not denominational, and they are objectionable to the Roman Catholic church which insists upon the supervision of the education of the children of its members. The effect of the new statute and the grounds of objection to it are explained in the affidavit of Archbishop Tach\u00e9. I refer particularly to paragraphs 8, 10 and 11. Rather than countenance the public schools, he tells us in the 8th paragraph, Roman Catholics will revert to the system in operation previous to the Manitoba Act, and will establish, support and maintain schools in accordance with their principles and faith. In other words they will assert and act upon the privilege or right in respect of denominational schools which, as I construe section 22, they had as a class at the union. It is thus in effect asserted on the part of the applicant that the right or privilege has not been destroyed by the Public Schools Act of 1890. The same assertion is made on the part of the respondents who make it one of their grounds in support of the by-laws which are attacked, or rather in support of the provincial statute.\nBut the right or privilege may continue to exist and yet be injuriously affected. It is not the cancelling or annulling of the right that is forbidden. The question is : Does the statute of 1890 injuriously affect the right ? That it does so appears to me free from serious doubt. In one form or another the members of the church supported the schools of the church. As a class of people they bore the burden. We are not concerned to inquire how the burden was distributed among the individual members, or whether each one bore some part of it. The privilege in question appertained to the class of people and the burden was borne by the class. The bearing of the burden was essential to the enjoyment of the privilege. It is the maintenance of a school that is of value to the community or class, rather than the abstract or theoretical right to maintain it. In other words the value of the right depends upon the practical vise that can be made of it. Whatever throws an obstacle in the way of that practical use prejudicially affects the right. It is not conceivable that in any community, and notably among the settlers in a region like Manitoba, a burden of taxation for th\u00e9 support of public schools can be imposed on the people of any religious denomination without rendering it less easy for the same people to maintain denominational schools. The degree of interference is immaterial. If it occurs to any extent the right to maintain the denominational school is injuriously affected.\nIt has been objected that the argument against the public school tax on the ground of its making the people less able to support their denominational schools involves the denial of the right to impose ordinary municipal taxes, because those taxes also absorb their share of the means of the taxpayers. The objection is aside from the issue. The provision of the statute relates onty to legislation respecting education, and the restriction is upon the power to make laws on that subject. It is not, however, merely a question of pecuniary ability to do one\u2019s share in supporting a denominational school in addition to paying the public school tax. Assuming the ability in the case of every individual belonging to the denomination, which is an extravagant assumption, we must remember that one payment is compulsory and the other voluntary. When a man has under compulsion paid his money for the support of the public school it is natural that he should be less willing to avail himself of the privilege of paying for the support of the other, though his right to pay as well as his ability remain. The contest is over the right or privilege not of the individual but of the class of persons.\nWe are familiar with the expression \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d as used in the compensation clauses of the railway acts and in the English Lands Clauses Act. It would be labour lost to cite cases turning upon the application of the provisions for compensating persons whose lands are injuriously affected by works done under sanction of law. They are very numerous, and the English cases will be found collected in Cripps on Compensation ([30]) and several other treatises. The claim to compensation failed in many of the cases in which lands were injuriously affected for reasons arising on the statutes under which the claim was made, as e. g. because the injury was caused by an act that would not have given a right of action at common law, or because it was caused by the operation only and not bv the construction of the work : but all the cases ?agree in recognising as something that injuriously affects a man\u2019s property whatever interferes with his convenience in the enjoyment of it or of any right in respect of it, or prevents him from enjoying it to the best advantage, and whether the injury happens to be permanent or only temporary. The same principle makes it imperative to hold that the right of a class of persons with respect to denominational schools is injuriously affected if the effect of a law passed on the subject of education is to render it more difficult or less convenient to exercise the right to the best advan-tage. I mean the direct effect of the law, and I regard the prejudice to the denominational schools which is worked by making those to whom it looks for support pay the school tax as a direct effect of the statute. There may be indirect results by which the denominational school may suffer in its prestige or prosperity yet which cannot be taken to bring the statute under censure of section 22. One of these, viz., the competition of the public schools, is alluded to in the eleventh paragraph of His Grace the Archbishop\u2019s affidavit I am not quite sure that I fully understand that paragraph. I am not sure whether the objection it indicates extends to the establishment of any schools at the public expense, or only to the assessment of Roman Catholics for the support of public schools. I shall therefore merely say that, according to my present opinion, a public school may, by reason of superior equipment or of other advantages, compete with a denominational school to the disadvantage of the latter without thereby affording just cause for complaint.\nUpon the grounds which I have thus discussed I am of opinion that the act of 1890 transgresses the limits of the power given by the 22nd section of the Manitoba Act, and that the assessment which the appellant is resisting is illegal.\nIt may not be out of place to remark, though it is scarcely necessary to do so, that there is no general prohibition of legislation which shall affect denominational schools. The prohibition relates only to the rights and privileges of classes of persons, and to legislation which injuriously affects such rights. There is, therefore, room for legislative regulation on many subjects, as, for example, compulsory attendance of scholars, the sanatory condition of school houses, the imposition and collection of rates for the support of denominational schools, and sundry other matters which may be dealt with without interfering with the denominational characteristics of the school, and which, I suppose, were dealt with in the statutes of the province that were repealed in 1890 to make way for the system now complained of.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the by-laws of the city of Winnipeg, Nos. 480 and 483, quashed, the appellant having his costs of the appeal and also of all proceedings in the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Edwart and Brophy.\nSolicitors for respondents: Hough and Campbell.\n[1] 7 Man.

C P. and art. 1624 C. C. the defendant pleaded that he had held the property (valued at over $2000) since the expiration of his lease under some verbal agreement of sale. The judgment appealed from, reversing the judgment of the Court of Review, held that the action ought to have been instituted in the Circuit Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court,\nHeld, that as the case was originally instituted in the Superior Court and that upon the face of the proceedings the right to the possession and property of an immoveable property is involved, an appeal lies. Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, sec. 29 (b) and secs. 28 and 24. Strong J. dissenting.\nMOTION to quash appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe following is the judgment of the Registrar in Chambers upon the application on behalf of the plaintiff to give security for costs and for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench:\u2014\n\"This was an application by Mr. Duclos on behalf of the plaintiff Blackford, to have the security required to be given by sec. 46 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act approved, and an appeal thereby allowed from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) rendered on the 22nd of September last, dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\" \" The plaintiff by his declaration, dated the 6th September, 1889, alleges in substance that he leased to the defendants a certain lot of land (describing it) for one year from the 1st May, 1888, at a rental of $138 per annum, payable monthly, in instalments of$11.50 each; that the lease terminated on the 1st May 1889, but the defendants remained in possession and continued to use and occupy said premises against his will and consent and refused to vacate said premises, although duly notified to do so; that the defendants are indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $46 for the use and occupation of the premises for the months of May, June, July and August then last past, The plaintiff prays that a writ of saisie gagerie in ejectment issue, that defendants be condemed to pay to plaintiff the said sum of $\u01c26 with interest that the lease shall be declared to have-terminated on the 1st May 1889 and that the defendants be condemned to give up and forthwith deliver to the plaintiff the said premises, failing which that they may be ejected and plaintiff put in possession\u2014the whole with costs.\"\nThe defendant Dame Jessie McBain pleads to the action, denying that she holds the premises by virtue of the lease but under circumstances after set out alleging that she had always been willing to pay for the use and occupation of the premises the sum of $46, which she brings into court and is willing' the plaintiff should take upon discontinuing his action. She then sets out at considerable length that the plaintiff on or about the 3rd May then last agreed to sell and did in fact bargain, sell and convey over' to one Peter McFarlane the premises in question for $2,750 upon the terms she mentions; that it was agreed between the plaintiff and said McFarlane that a regular notarial deed of sale should be drawn and the said McFarlane thenceforth considered as proprietor of said premises; that the plaintiff and McFarlane in the presence of a notary stated the agreement and instructed him to draw a notarial deed of sale; that previous thereto to wit the latter part of April then last the defendant had agreed with McFarlane, that if said McFarlane should succeed in purchasing the property for anything under $2,800 she would pay him (McFarlane) for it said sum; that after the arrangement between plaintiff and McFarlane, to wit on the 3rd of May then last, the said McFarlane. after mentioning his agreement with the plaintiff, did 'agree to and .in fact bargain, sell and transfer and make over to her the said defendant,' the said property upon certain terms she sets forth; that it was agreed between her and McFarlane that a regular deed of sale should be drawn the ensuing week simultaneously with the deed from plaintiff to McFarlane, and that the terms and conditions were to be the same as those between plaintiff and McFarlane save as to price; that she paid said McFarlane $100 on account of the price; that it was agreed between her and McFarlane that she should remain in possession as proprietor; that relying upon McFarlane's promise she remained in possesion; that when the plaintiff demanded possession on the 1st May, 1889, she notified McFarlane, who said he would hold her to her bargain, and also the plaintiff to his bargain; that on the 7th of May McFarlane through a notary put plaintiff en demeure to carry out his agreement, and notified him he would hold him responsible for the breach of it, inasmuch as he had entered into negotiations with others for its sale, meaning to refer thereby to defendant; that the said McFarlane has wholly failed to carry out his agreement with her. notwithstanding a notarial protest on her part, and the plaintiff has wholly failed to carry out his agreement with said McFarlane; in fact that they are acting in concert, at the instigation of enemies of the defendant, to annoy the defendant by refusing to carry out their respective agreements; that the defendant does not hold under the lease but under the conditions set out, which the plaintiff knew, and that the proceedings taken were only taken to annoy and harass her, for which she reserves a recourse in damages and prays acte of her tender of the $46, and the dismissal of the plaintiff 's action with costs.\"\n\"On the 9th of October, 1889, by consent and under reserve of all plaintiff's rights, the $46 were taken out of the court. The case came before Mr. Justice Belanger of the Superior Court, when the defendants raised the objection that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction inasmuch as the case came within art. 887 of the C C Proc, and the claim of the plaintiff was limited by his declaration to $46, by reason whereof his demand and action came within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the jurisdiction of the Superior Court was ousted. This objection was sustained by the Superior Court but the judgment of that court was reversed by the Court of Review (Grill Tait and Tellier JJ.) on the grounds that the principal demand of the plaintiff was to obtain possession of his immovable property, not by rescinding the lease, but because the lease had terminated, and the claim for $46 was only an accessory, and that the jurisdiction of the tribunal is determined as well by the annual value of the immovable as by the fact that it was sought to obtain possession of the immovable and that such annual value exceeding $100 the Superior Court had jurisdiction.\"\n\"This latter judgment was reversed in appeal, and the plaintiff seeks to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\"\n\"Mr. Archibald Q. C. showed cause against the application and referred to article 887 of the C.C.P. Revised Statutes P.Q., p. 727, vol 2, and contended that the case did not come within section 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, because the question of the title to the property was not really in issue, that the plea of the defendant was clearly demurrable and could not in the form of action taken by the plaintiff be entertained; that the plaintiff ought to have brought his action in the Circuit Court, and if the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it this court had none, because the action to be appealable must originate legally in a Superior Court. He took no objection to the appeal on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed from was not a final judgment.\"\n\" Mr. Duclos, for appellant, contended that the action was properly brought in the Superior Court, for the reasons given in the Court of Review, and that if not originally properly brought in that court the plea of the defendant gave jurisdiction to that court, and that the title to the property was clearly in question. He filed and read four affidavits to show that the property was of a greater value than $2,000.\"\nIn my opinion the order for the approval of the security should go. The action, rightly or wrongly, has originated in a Superior Court; the question in controversy on the face of the pleadings (as to the validity of the defendants' plea I do not consider it necessary to express an opinion) seems to me to involve the right to the possession and property of the immovable specified in the plaintiff's declaration and the defendants' plea: the value of the property has been shown to be over $2000 and as to whether the action was properly originated in the Superior Court or not is the question and the only question which has so far been considered by the courts, and this question I consider I should not express an opinion upon but should leave to the Supreme Court to decide. In these circumstances I think the security should be allowed. The respondent whose duty it is to move to quash for want Of jurisdiction at the earliest opportunity, if he remains of the opinion that no jurisdiction exists, will be able to bring the question before the full court at its approaching session; the delay incurred will be trifling, and in the meantime he will have the benefit of the security offered by the appellant.\"\nThe respondent thereupon moved to have the appeal quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nArchibald Q.C. for respondent;\nDuclos for appellant.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J. This action was brought in the Superior Court and it is quite clear that a question involving the title to lands is raised by the pleadings and therefore section 29 (b) Supreme and Exchequer Court Act applies and the court has jurisdiction.\nSTRONG J. There are two distinct questions of jurisdiction involved in this case, but one only of these is raised by the present motion to quash the appeal. All we have to determine at present is whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, assuming that the Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction though it is manifest that if the appeal should proceed to a hearing the first question to be decided will be that as to the correctness of the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which dismissed the appeal to that court for defective jurisdiction. Our decision of this motion must depend on whether we can hold this to be an action of which under clause 29 lb) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act the Supreme Court can take cognizance. In other words whether we can say that this action instituted in the Superior Court for the District of Beauharnois involved any question \"relating to the right to any fee of office, duty, &c, payable to Her Majesty, or any title to land or tenements annual rents, or such like matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\"\nThe action is one of ejectment by which a landlord seeks to expel his tenant, the lease having expired. It is a personal and in no sense a real action. It has for its object to compel the tenant to perform his personal obligation, growing out of the contract of lease, to deliver up the premises to the landlord at the expiration of the term. That being so, no question of title to lands appears upon the record at all. It is true that the tenant has pleaded an exception which on the face of it is absurd and utterly untenable, setting forth some verbal agreement for the sale of the property by the landlord to a third party who has, it is pretended, verbally agreed to re-sell to the appellant, but this for obvious reasons can have no influence in conferring jurisdiction. It is, therefore, impossible to refer the claim of the appellant to have his appeal entertained by this court to any positive enactment of the statute and in default of that the appeal is entirely unwarranted.\nThe judgment in the court of first instance holding that the original jurisdiction was in the Circuit Court exclusively and quashing the action for that reason was reversed by the Court of Review, but restored by the Court of Appeal l if we allow the appeal to proceed that will be the preliminary question which we shall have to decide On the hearing, but I think that question cannot arise unless the appeal is admitted, and, therefore, I forbear from expressing any opinion on it now as it would be premature to do so. Therefore, exclusively upon the ground that this court has no jurisdiction, even supposing that the Court of Queen's Bench was wrong in determining that that court had none, I am of opinion that the present appeal must be quashed..\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014L'appelant, demandeur en cour inf\u00e9rieure avait poursuivi les intim\u00e9s pour se faire rendre la possession d'un immeuble qu'il leur avait lou\u00e9 et qu'ils d\u00e9tenaient apr\u00e8s l'expiration du bail. Il r\u00e9clamait $46, valeur de l'occupation apr\u00e8s l'expiration du bail, et il concluait en outre \u00e0 ce que les intim\u00e9s fussent \u00e9vinc\u00e9s de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 en \u00eatre mis en possession luim\u00e9me.\nUne premi\u00e8re action prise \u00e0 la cour de Circuit, dans laquelle ne fut pas soulev\u00e9e la question de juridiction, fut renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la forme. Pans la pr\u00e9sente action devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, il ne fut pas fait objection \u00e0 la juridiction par les parties mais la cour se d\u00e9clara d'ellem\u00e9me sans juridiction sur le principe que l'action n'\u00e9tait que pour $46. C'est devant la cour de Circuit qu'elle aurait d\u00fb \u00e9tre port\u00e9e. La cour de R\u00e9vision fut unanime \u00e0 renverser ce jugement.\nEn appel, la cour du Banc de la Reine, consid\u00e9rant qu'il n'\u00e9tait r\u00e9clame que $46 la cour de Circuit avait seule, et \u00e0 l'exclusion de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, juridiction pour entendre et decider cette cause, cassa le jugement de la cour de Revision.\nI appel de ce jugement devant cette cour les intim\u00e9s out fait motion pour faire renvoyer l'appel pour d\u00e9faut de juridiction.\nLa premi\u00e8re question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir quelle est la nature de la demande. Le but \u00e9vident du demandeur est de rentrer en possession de son immeuble que les intim\u00e9s d\u00e9tiennent malgr\u00e9 lui depuis l'expiration du bail. Sa demande de $46 pour la valeur de l'occupation depuis l'expiration du bail est ind\u00e9pendante de la demande de possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, tellement qu'il pouvait renoncer \u00e0 cette partie de sa demande, sans que ses contentions au sujet de la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en. fussent affec\u00e9es en aucune mani\u00e8re.\nSi la d\u00e9mande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 seulement pour la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, dont la valeur reconnue d\u00e9passe $2,000, elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 certainement bien port\u00e9e devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure; comment peut-il se faire que parce qu'il demande en outre de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 elIem\u00e9me, la somme de $46, le moutant de sa demande puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme diminu\u00e9 et tomb\u00e9 dans la juridiction de la cour de Circuit.\nComme le prouve le plaidoyer des intim\u00e9s, toute la contestation entre les parties est au sujet de la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et nullement quant aux $46 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en cour et retir\u00e9es par le procureur de l'appelant. La seule question qui reste \u00e0 juger entre les parties est celle de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble en question en cette cause soulev\u00e9e par le plaidoyer des intim\u00e9s Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment de la juridiction de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Comme il est admis que la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est au del\u00e0 de $2000 et que la contestation entre les parties est an sujet du titre de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9; pour ces deux motifs la cause est appelable \u00e0 cette cour en vertu des sections 24 28 and 29 de l'acte de la Cour Supreme\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis de renvoyer la motion avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case comes up on a motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. That motion must be refused. The jurisdiction of this court on the case is beyond controversy.\nThe appellant instituted an action with seizure in Procedure recaption in the Superior Court, at Beauharnois, under the lessor and lessee articles of the Code of P and Article 1624 of the Civil Code alleging that he had leased a certain property to the defendants, and that though the said lease had expired yet the defendants refused to quit the premises and continued in possession thereof.\nThe declaration concludes by asking that the defendants be condemned to pay $46 for their use and occupation since the expiration of the lease, and that they be ordered to give up and deliver the said premises to the plaintiff.\nThe defendants met that action by a plea in which they allege in substance that at the expiration of their lease the plaintiff sold or agreed to sell the premises in question to one McFarlane, who on the same day sold the same to them, the defendants, and that they now occupy and hold the said premises, as full Owners thereof\nThe Superior Court at Beauharnois declared itself incompetent ratione materice upon grounds with which we have now nothing to do and dismissed the action. The Court of Review reversed that judgment but the Court of Appeal restored the Superior Court's judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's action. From this judgment the plaintiff now appeals. Now to ascertain whether the appeal lies or not it is not to Articles 887 and 888 of the Code of Procedure that we have to refer; neither have we on this motion in the least degree to go into the merit of the question of jurisdiction between the Superior Court and the Circuit Court raised in the .case, and upon which the appeal is taken. All we have to do, to ascertain our own jurisdiction is to refer to section 29 of the Act under which this court sits Now that section, coupled with sections 24 and 28 clearly enacts that as to the Province of Quebec, an appeal lies from all final judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, in actions, suits or causes originally instituted in the Superior Court wherein the matter in contro versy relates to any title to lands or tenements where the rights in future might be bound. Now, this is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. It is in an action originally instituted in the Superior Court, and the matter in controversy clearly relates to the title to this land or tenement, and the case is one where the rights of both parties in future might be bound. Darling v. Ryan ([1]); Bank of Toronto v. Le Cur\u00e9 etc. ([2]); Gilman v. Gilbert ([3]); Chagnon v. Normand ([4]).\nThe respondent contends that the action was wrongly taken in the Superior Court, that the Circuit Court only had jurisdiction. That may be or not. We shall decide that when we come to hear the appeal. For the present it is sufficient that it is in fact in\u00b0 stituted in the Superior Court to give us jurisdiction; and I do not see how the respondents, who asked by their plea that the appellant's claim to the possession of these premises be dismissed on the ground that the appellant has parted with the title thereto, and that. they, the respondents, now are full owners thereof,. can contend on their motion to quash this appeal that the matter in controversy does not relate to the title to this property and is not one where their rights in future and the appellant's rights in future might be bound.\nPATTERSON J concurred with Taschereau J.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: McCormick, Duclos & Murchison.\nSolicitors for respondents: Archibald & Foster.\n[1] Cassels\u2019s Dig.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nExpropriation\u2014R. S.

S. Q. The demand for expropriation as formulated in their notice to arbitrate by the appellants was for the width of their track, but the award granted damages for three feet outside of the fences on each side as being valueless. In an action to set aside the award :\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the courts below, that the appointment of respondent's arbitrator was valid under the statute and bound both parties, and that in awarding damages for three feet of land injuriously affected on each side of the track the arbitrators had not exceeded their jurisdiction.\nStrong and Taschereau JJ. doubted if the amount in controversy was sufficient to give the court jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming a judgment of the Superior Court in favour of respondent ([1])\nThe following are the material facts of the case :\u2014 The railway built by the appellants traverses lands belonging to the respondent, in the parish of l'Ange-Grardien, county of Montmorency, and known as lots Nos. 20, 29. 36, 59 and 66 of the cadastre for said parish.\nIn order to obtain their right of way through said lots, on the 10th of November, 188 7\", appellants served on respondent a notice of expropriation informing the latter that for the building of their railway they required across the said lots a strip of land 62 feet (French measure) wide, by 651 feet long, forming a total area of 124\u00bd perches, or 1 arpent 24\u00bd perches.\nBy the same notice respondent was offered the sum of $125 as an indemnity for the said expropriation, and notified that should said indemnity not be accepted the appellants named as their arbitrator Louis Giroux, farmer, of Beauport.\nThe offer of the appellants was refused but on the 17th of November, 1887, an agreement was entered into by which appellants, on depositing double the amount of the indemnity offered, would have the right to take immediate possession of the land required by them from the respondent, reserving to respondent the right that if later on the parties should be unable to come to an amicable settlement, the respondent would be allowed to name his arbitrator, in the same manner as though the delay for him so to do had not expired.\nIn virtue of that agreement, on the 28th of November, 1887, appellants made a money deposit at the rate of $200 per superficial arpent, and took possession of their right of way through the lots of the respondent.\nSubsequently, it being impossible for the parties to determine amicably the indemnity, the appellants, on the 7th of March, 1888, served the respondent with a notice calling upon him to name his arbitrator, so as to \"proceed with the arbitration.\nOn the following day, the respondent replied to the appellants' notice as follows: \" The said Pierre Mathieu of. l'Ange-Grardien, farmer, without waiving' any of his rights, and without binding himself in any way by the present procedure, but with the sole object of watching' and having a watch on the arbitrator of the company, does hereby inform you that he has named and by these presents names Charles Toussaint Cote, of the municipality of St. Roch North, manufacturer, as his arbitrator.\"\nOn the 15th of the same month of March Louis Giroux, the arbitrator of the appellants, and the said C. T. Cote, acting as arbitrator for the respondent, named F. X. Berlinguet, of Quebec, architect, as third arbitrator, and the three arbitrators were sworn.\nTwo days later, the three arbitrators appeared before Angers, notary public, and there two of them, Giroux and Cote, declared that they had examined the plans and documents filed, heard the sayings of the parties, taken cognizance of the, incidental facts, and after mature deliberation, allowed to Pierre Mathieu, the proprietor, \"a sum of $474.25 for the land expropriated, as well as for three feet outside the fences, on each side of the railway line, lost to him for cultivation and that after having taken into consideration the increase of value resulting to the said lots from the building of a railway, they further allowed for damage and inconveniences resulting from the severing of lands which ought not to be divided, for the loss of time in the cultivation thereof on account of the passing of trains and of the crossing and re-crossing cattle over the said railway for grazing purposes, a sum of $90 yearly, representing a capital of $1,500 at six per cent, which is the amount fixed and allowed to the said Pierre Mathieu for all indemnity for said damages, after deducting said increase of value as aforesaid, in all $1,97 4.25 and costs.\" The third arbitrator, Berlinguet, finding the valuation exaggerated declined to concur in that award.\nBy notarial protest dated the 23rd of said month of March the respondent had said award served upon the appellants, informed them that he was ready to give them a title and requested from them the payment of the amount allowed by said award with the costs of the arbitration, under pain of being' sued therefor. Thereupon the appellants brought their action, to have said award set aside for the following reasons:\u2014\n1. The naming of an arbitrator by the respondent is null,\u2014and as a consequence, the naming of the third arbitrator is null and the tribunal which gave the award had no existence in law.\n2. The award was not given faithfully and impartially, nor with the essential formalities; but it is manifestly the result of a fraudulent agreement between Giroux and Cote and the respondent to rob the appellants.\n3. The award is null as bearing on matters not submitted to arbitrators and thus ultra vires in giving the company more land than wanted.\nThe respondent pleaded the general issue.\nThe questions raised by this action having been examined in another cause under exactly similar circumstances between the appellants and one Joseph Mathieu, and having been decided by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([2]), in favour of Joseph Mathieu, the coures below in this case followed the same ruling as in the case of Joseph Mathieu.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the principal grounds relied upon by counsel were that the award was void because the arbitrators had no authority .to value the indemnity for the two strips of land three feet wide on each side of the right of way and that the appointment by respondent of his arbitrator with restrictions and reservations was null.\nMr. Justice Strong and Mr. Justice Taschereau expressed a doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal, the amount of the award being under $2,000, and to make up the appealable amount either interest accrued after date of the award or the costs taxed on the arbitration proceedings would have to be added. The case however, was allowed to be heard on the merits.\nIrvine Q.C. and B\u00e9dard for appellants relied on Mr. Justice Andrews's judgment in the case of The Quebec, Montmorency, &c, Ry. Co. v. Mathieu ([3]).\nCusgrain Q.C. for respondent contended that by their award the arbitrators allowed so much for the inconvenience caused so much for the loss of land and so much for damage to the balance of the land not taken but rendered useless for the purposes of cultivation and as the award states clearly the sum awarded, and the lands or other property, right or thing for which the sum is to be the compensation, the requirements of the law have been complied with.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2013The moment, in reply to appellants' notice, the respondent named his arbitrator he named an arbitrator under the statute and could not limit in any way the authority of an arbitrator conferred by the statute. The moment he named such arbitrator the person so named become clothed with all the power and authority vested in the arbitrators by the statute, and the respondent had no right to limit this power or authority, and could not appoint an arbitrator\" only to watch over the arbitrator of the company.\" and if the award had been unsatisfactory to the respondent I do not think it would have been in his mouth to say that he was not bound by it on the ground that an arbitrator was not named by him; on the other hand the appellants having accepted the respondent's arbitrator as duly qualified, and the two arbitrators with the knowledge and express consent of the company having appointed an umpire and the appellants having furnished the arbitrators with all the information they required to enable them to discharge properly their duties, I do not see how it is possible for the appellants now to repudiate the action of the arbitrators on the ground that the respondent's arbitrator was not duly appointed.\nThe only point of the case that can raise any doubt, or that has raised any doubt in my mind, is as to the excess of jurisdiction by the arbitrators in reference to the three feet which it is alleged has been expropriated beyond the land required by the appellants. But the land expropriated is described in the award as the land described in appellants' notice. I think that the arbitrators having found that the three feet outside of and beyond and on each side of the land expropriated was lost to respondent as for the purpose of cultivation, and it not appearing' that it can be used for any other purpose, I cannot say that the arbitrators were wrong in estimating by way of damage the full value of the land if they were of opinion the land, by reason of the railway, had become valueless to respondent. The estimate of the value of the damages appears to be sustained by the evidence of several witnesses, though in the absence of fraud, I do not place reliance on this evidence because the statute ([4]) declares that\u2013 The arbitrators.......being Sworn ... .shall proceed to ascertain the compensation which the company must pay in such a way as they or a majority of them deem best, and the award of such arbitrators, or any two of them or of the sole arbitrator shall be final and conclusive.\n27. No award shall he invalidated for want of form or other technical objection\nOne of the arbitrators after pointing out how they arrived at the valuation, explained that they first established the value of the land then how the damage was established, and he goes on to explain that all these inconveniences or damage were assessed at $90 'a year, representing a capital at six per cent of $1,500, which with $474.25 for land taken and land injuriously affected, amounted to $1,974.25.\nUnder all these circumstances, I think no ground has been established for setting aside this award, and therefore the appeal must be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2013I am of the same opinion. I had come to that conclusion at the end of the argument. Assuming that we have jurisdiction, a point which I assume in deference to the opinion of the majority of the court, though I have doubts on the point myself, I am of opinion that upon the merits of the case, there is no ground for allowing the appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2013I am also of opinion on the merits that the appeal should he dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed, assuming, without deciding, that we have jurisdiction to entertain it. On the ground of fraud, the two courts below have found that there was no evidence of it, and we cannot interfere with that finding of fact, which is fully supported by the evidence.\nAs to the objections to the award as being irregular or excessive they have, in my opinion, been each and all of them rightly dismissed by the two courts below. This appeal, in fact, should not have been taken There was no reasonable ground for it.\nPATTERSON J. agrees that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Bedard, Dechene & Dorion.\nSolicitors for respondent : Casgrain, Angers & Lavery.\n[1] Following Mathieu v.

Manitoba), for liberty to sign final judgment for the amount so specially indorsed upon the said writ of summons.\nThis summons was heard before Mr. Justice Killam, a judge of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, who, upon the 4th of August, 1890, made an order allowing the plaintiffs to sign final judgment for the amount specially endorsed upon the said writ, together with interest and costs.\nThe defendants appealed to the full Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba from the said order of Mr. Justice Killam, and upon the 19th December, 1890, the said Court of Queen\u2019s Bench delivered judgment unanimously dismissing the said appeal and confirming the said order.\nThe rule of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench dismissing the appeal from the said order of Mr. Justice Killam was issued and is dated the 14th day of February, 1891.\nThe defendants sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the rule dismissing said appeal, and the security on appeal was approved of by the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba on the 14th of February, 1891. The plaintiffs moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, or if it was that the order of Mr. Justice Killam was one made in the exercise of judicial discretion.\nChrysler Q.C. for the motion. In Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange ([2]) a similar order to that made by Mr. Justice Killam was held to be an interlocutory order and not a final disposition of the cause.\nSee also Collins v. Vestry of Paddington (2); Nelson v. Thorner (3); and Collins v. Hickok (4).\nHogg Q.C. and Crawford opposed the motion citing Bank of Minnesota v. Page (5); Chevalier v. Cuvillier (6); Annual Practice 1890-91 (7).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I have no doubt that we should quash this appeal. The following cases, which deal with orders similar to the one in question here, establish that the judgment appealed from is not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d from which an appeal will lie to this court.\nStandard Discount Company v. La Grange. Bramwell L.J. says:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this preliminary objection must prevail. There cannot be an order which is neither final nor interlocutory; and therefore if the order before us is not final it must be interlocutory. Is it a final order? It is, like every other order, in one sense final so long as it is not appealed against, but it is not the final order of the court in the cause, because in order to entitle the plaintiffs to levy execution there must be a subsequent direction by the court. Therefore I think it is an interlocutory order.\nI only put these cases as possible. I may give another illustration: suppose judgment to be signed and an appeal brought on the judgment\u2014it is unnecessary to consider whether it would be successful or not\u2014it clearly must be brought from the time when judgment was assigned and not from the date of the order. Now, if there is a year within which to appeal from the order, and afterwards a like period to appeal from the judgment, that would give rise to a state of things which I think the legislature never intended.\nBrett L. J.:\u2014\nI agree that the order obtained by the plaintiffs is interlocutory. My reason for so holding is, that the order is not the last step which must be taken in order to fix the status of the parties with respect to the matter in dispute; it is in itself ineffectual, and until a further proceeding has been taken the plaintiffs cannot recover the debt sued for. Another step must be taken before the status of the parties can be fixed, and that step is the entry of the judgment. The order was not the final step in the action, and therefore it is interlocutory.\nI think that our decision may perhaps be founded upon another ground, namely, that no order, judgment, or other proceeding can be final which does not at once affect the status of the parties for whichever side the decision may be given: so that if it is given for the plaintiff it is conclusive against the defendant, and if it is given for the defendant it is conclusive against the plaintiff; whereas if the application for leave to enter final judgment had failed the matter in dispute would not have been determined. If leave to defend had been given the action would have been carried on with the ordinary incidents of pleading and trial, and the matter would have been left in doubt until judgment. I cannot help thinking that no order in an action will be found to be final unless a decision upon the application out of which it arises, but given in favour of the other party to the action, would have determined the matter in dispute.\nCotton L.J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this is an interlocutory order, and that the time for appealing against it is the shorter period of 21 days. The decision in White v. Witt (1) may not be our sole guide in determining this case; but at least it shows this, that an order may be interlocutory and subject to appeal only within the shorter period, although it really decides that on which the judgment of the court, admittedly final, is ultimately given.\nNow, it is no doubt the fact that if the order obtained by the plaintiffs be not set aside they will be able to sign judgment against the defendant; but White v. Witt, certainly shows that, although the effect of a final judgment will result from making an order unless it be set aside, still this circumstance does not prevent the order from being interlocutory, and subject to appeal only during the shorter period. Without using an exhaustive definition, it may be laid down that an order is interlocutory which directs how an action is to proceed; and the order before us is exactly of that kind. The rules of the Supreme Court, order 14, rule 1, allow a plaintiff, so soon as the defendant has appeared to a specially indorsed writ, to apply to a master or a judge, and to obtain an order which will prevent the action from going through its ordinary course, and will give the plaintiff liberty at once to sign judgment without taking the usual steps; the order, however, relates to the procedure, and therefore is only interlocutory.\nThis case was acted on in Salaman v. Warner ([3]). The court, Lord Esher M.R., Fry L.J. and Lopes L.J. thought that the true definition of a final order was that suggested by Lord Esher in Standard Discount Company v. La Grange ([4]).\nIn Collins v. Vestry of Padding ton ([5]):\nD. Seymour Q.C. and Bompas Q.C. (Croome with them) were called upon to argue for the plaintiff. First, the special case is completely disposed of by the decision of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division; the judgment of that court was final upon the rights of the parties as to the question submitted for its consideration; the reasoning of the Lords Justices in Standard Discount Company v. La Grange, shows that the judgment was no interlocutory.\nBagallay L.J.:\u2014\nThat case shows that where any further step is necessary to perfect an order or judgment, it is not final but interlocutory; its principle applies here: the case must go back to the arbitrator that he may make his award; the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division is not the final step in the cause.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be quashed. It is quite clear that such an order as was made in this case cannot be called a final judgment.\nFOURNIER and GWYNNE JJ.\u2014Concurred in quashing the appeal.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The 34th section of the Manitoba Statute, 48 Vic. ch. 13, resembles rule 739 of the Ontario Consolidated Rules of Practice, which follows rule 80 under the original Judicature Act of Ontario, that rule having itself followed one of the English Supreme Court rules of 1875, viz., order XIY, rule 1, as amended by a rule of May, 1877. When a defendant appears to a specially indorsed writ the plaintiff may, on an affidavit verifying his cause of action and stating his belief that there is no defence, call on the defendant to show cause why the plaintiff should not be at liberty to sign final judgment. Thereupon, unless the defendant satisfies the court or a judge that he has a good defence to the action on the merits, or discloses such facts as may be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend the action, an order may be made empowering the plaintiff to sign judgment accordingly. Such an order having been made in this case the defendant appeals, and his right to do so is contested on the ground that the judgment is not a final judgment within the meaning of that term in section 28 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. Without for the moment considering whether our jurisdiction depends entirely on the question, let us inquire whether this is or is not a final judgment.\nThat question must be decided upon the definition of the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d given in the interpretation clause of the act, which declares that in that act, unless the context otherwise requires, the expression \u201c final judgment \u201d means any judgment, rule, order or decision, whereby the action, suit, cause, matter, or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded. Decisions upon the English rules of the Supreme Court are as likely to mislead as to assist in the construction of this definition unless careful attention is paid to the difference between the legislation in the one case and the other. Most of those decisions in which the character of a judgment, as being final or interlocutory, is discussed, are under order LVIII, Rule 15, the numbers being the same in the rules of 1875 and those of 1883, which limits the time for appealing. The great point of difference is that the English rule does not define either \u201cinterlocutory judgment\u201d or \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d and the effort has been in each case to hit upon a definition that will carry out the object of the rule, while we have an exhaustive definition of \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d and have to say whether or not the particular case comes within it. The rule of 1875 happens not to contain the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d at all. Its words were \u201cno appeal from any interlocutory order shall, except by special leave of the Court of Appeal, be brought after the expiration of twenty-one days, and no other appeal shall, except by such leave, be brought after the expiration of one year.\u201d\nThe rule of 1883 introduced, after the words \u201cinterlocutory order,\u201d the words \u201cor from any order whether final or interlocutory in any matter not being an action.\u201d The leading word is \u201cinterlocutory,\u201d which does not occur in the clauses relating to the jurisdiction of this court. It is a technical word, and in reference to actions or suits denotes proceedings taken before the formal final judgment is reached. It is a convenient word to express the idea that a judgment is not a final judgment within the meaning of section 28, but we must guard against the fallacy of first adopting a term which is not in our statute as a convenient short name for a judgment that is not final, and then reasoning from its technical use in another situation as to what is a final judgment, in place of testing every judgment by the definition our statute gives. In the English cases the terms \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cinterlocutory\u201d are not treated as terms of precision to be rigidly applied without regard to modifying considerations. This is clear from several cases cited on the argument as well as from others, and chiefly from Salaman v. Warner ([6]), which was decided by the Court of Appeal since the argument in this case. The court there unanimously adopted the definition given fourteen years before by Lord Esher in Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange ([7]), as the right test for determining whether an order, for the purpose of giving notice of appeal under the rules, is final or not, holding that a decision, though it finally disposed of the matter in dispute, was not to be considered a final order for the purpose of the rules unless it would have finally disposed of the matter if it had been given the other way. Lord Esher M.R., and Fry and Lopes L.J.J., gave judgments to the same effect. I shall quote only a few words of Fry L.J., who remarked concerning the 3rd and 15th rules of order LVIII, that they\u2014\nHave raised considerable difficulties because they use the term \u201cinterlocutory order\u201d of which no definition is to be found in the rules themselves, or, so far as I know, by reference to the earlier practice either of the common law or chancery courts. These difficulties have been well illustrated by various cases that have been decided. We must have regard to the object of the distinction drawn in the rules between interlocutory and final orders as to the time for appealing. The intention appears to be to give a longer time for appealing against decisions which in any event are final, a shorter time in the case of decisions where the litigation may proceed further. I think the true definition is this: I conceive that an order is \u201cfinal\u201d only where it is made upon an application or other proceeding which must, whether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the action. Conversely I think that an order is \u201c interlocutory \u201d where it cannot be affirmed that in either event the action will be determined.\nThe rule thus adopted for the construction of the words \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cinterlocutory\u201d with reference to the limitation of time for appealing will, no doubt, be regarded as now definitely settled in the English courts, but it is obvious that a construction which classes under the head of interlocutory orders an order by which the question in controversy is finally decided against one of the parties is one which, though it carries out the object of the English rule, would not give effect to the intention of our statute, and could not be made to fit in with the definition of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d given in the interpretation clause.\nIn the case of Whiting v. Hovey ([8]) the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario was contested, under certain provisions of the Judicature Act, on the ground that an interpleader issue, the decision of which finally disposed of the dispute between the parties to the issue, was only an interlocutory proceeding. There was an equal division of opinion in the Court of Appeal in consequence of which the appeal went on. The case ultimately came to this court on its merits, and the question of the right to appeal being again raised the right was sustained. In that case I expressed, in the Court of Appeal, the opinion which has, I think, been confirmed by the late case of Salaman v. Warner ([9]), and a still later case which I am about to cite, that the word \u201c interlocutory \u201d in our statutes is not necessarily to be construed in the same way as under the English order LVIII, rule 15.\nThe discussion in Whiting v. Hovey turned mainly upon a case of McAndrew v. Barker (3) in which an interpleader issue was held to be an interlocutory proceeding, and an order under it to be appealable, under the rules of 1875, only within twenty-one days. In the very late case of McNair v. Audenshaw Paint and Colour Co. (4), the Court of Appeal held that it was the same under the rules of 1883, Bowen and Kay L.JJ. expressly pointing out that although the judge who tries the issue is clothed with the power of finally adjusting the rights of the parties and disposing of the whole matter, it does not follow that his decision on the interpleader issue is not an interlocutory order so far as regards the time for appealing.\nThen is this a final judgment as defined in the statute? I think it is. It is an order whereby the1 action is finally determined and concluded, and so is literally within the definition. The point so much insisted on by Bramwell L.J., in Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange ([10]), that the order, though finally adjudicating against the defendant\u2019s right to defend the action, was not a final order, because it merely gave the plaintiff leave to sign final judgment and was not itself a judgment on which, without something more being done, execution could be issued, might be made in this case also, but we must remember that the discussion in that case was that which I have already dealt with, not being whether the order did not finally dispose of the matter in controversy, but whether it was one which, under the policy of the rule of court, must be appealed from within the shorter period. In the case In re Riddell ([11]) the question was whether the dismissal of an action for want of prosecution, with award of costs to the defendant, was a \u201c final judgment\u201d which entitled the defendant to serve the plaintiff with a bankrutcy notice under the Bankruptcy Act, 1883. It was held by Cave J. and afterwards by the Court of Appeal that not being an adjudication of the merits between the parties, but only like a non-suit which left the parties at liberty to renew the litigation, it was not a final judgment as contemplated by the Bankruptcy Act. The order before us, besides coming literally within the statutory definition of a final judgment, has in its operation the attribute of finality that does not belong to a non-suit, because the defendant, cannot renew the contest.\nTherefore if the right to appeal followed from the finding that this was a final judgment I should hold the right to be established. But the 27th section of the statute has to be taken into account. It declares that, with exceptions which do not apply here:\nNo appeal shall lie from any order made in any action, suit, cause, matter, or other judicial proceeding made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court or judge making the same.\nI think this order is of that class, and that the case affords a good example of the beneficial character of section 27:\nThe object of the Manitoba statute evidently is to prevent a plaintiff to whose cause of action there is no real defence from being delayed by the setting up of a defence which is frivolous or pleaded merely to gain time.\nSpeaking of the corresponding provision in the rules of the Supreme Court, in Wallingford v. Mutual Society ([12]), Lord Selborne said:\u2014\nIt is a very valuable and important part of the new procedure introduced under the Judicature Act, that the means should exist of coming by a short road to a final judgment when there is no real bond fide defence to an action. But it is at least of equal importance that parties should not in any such way, by a summary proceeding in chambers, be shut out from their defence when they ought to be admitted to defend.\nIn two cases Nelson v. Thorner ([13]) and Collins v. Hickok ([14]), the Ontario Court of Appeal had to deal with orders like the one now in question. The appeals were from county courts whose procedure is regulated by the Judicature Act. The judgments of the court, delivered in both cases by Mr. Justice Osier, recognise the orders as being made in the judicial discretion of the judge, one of them expressly recognising, as did also the judgments in the House of Lords in Wallingford v. Mutual Society (1), the power of the judge to impose terms as a condition of allowing a defence to be pleaded, a power which is incident only to a discretionary jurisdiction.\nIt is worth while to notice that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear those cases depended on the decision or order of the county court judge being \u201cin its nature final and not merely interlocutory\u201d (2).\nThe power given to a judge in chambers, and which in England is exercised in the first instance by a master of one of the divisions of the High Court, and in Ontario by the master in chambers, of shutting out, by a summary order, a defence that appears not to be genuine or in good faith, is undoubtedly a useful and important power, but one in the exercise of which great caution is required, lest the examination of the genuineness and good faith of the proposed defence become in reality a trial of the merits, and the defendant be deprived of a trial by the ordinary methods and a resort to an ultimate court of appeal. There should be an effective means of reviewing the decision in chambers, but that may be found in the provincial courts without the necessity of protracting the litigation and adding to the costs by coming to this court. The exclusion of our jurisdiction by section 27 is therefore a salutary provision.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be quashed.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Campbell & Crawford.\nSolicitors for respondents: Perdue & Robinson.\n[1] 7 Man.

Molsons Bank v. Halter (18 Can.

The interpleader issue was to try the right to the possession of these goods.\nThe mortgage to the plaintiff was given on 8th December, 1888, under the following circumstances: He had had considerable dealings with Madell & Robinson and at this date he found that their account was getting too large to carry without security. A few days before 8th December he went to see Madell & Robinson about getting security, and on their stating that if they could get time to pay their debts until the spring trade opened they would be able to satisfy all their creditors, the plaintiff agreed to give them time and make further advances if they would give a chattel mortgage, which they agreed to do. At the trial there was conflicting evidence as to whether or not the plaintiff threatened at that time to sue if security was not given, but it was shown that he had been dunning them occasionally before that, and that he told them at the time the mortgage was given, or shortly after, that he would have issued a writ if the security had been refused.\nOn the 17th December the firm of Madell & Robinson was dissolved, Madell retiring and transferring his interest in the business to Mrs. Robinson, who carried it on until 5th February, 1889, when she made an assignment for the general benefit of her creditors. Prior to this assignment the respondents had obtained judgment against Madell & Robinson, and an execution was placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands on 26th January, 1889. The goods in the store of the judgment debtors having been seized under the execution this interpleader issue was ordered between Stephens as plaintiff, claiming under his chattel mortgage, and the respondents as execution creditors.\nOn this state of facts it is objected on behalf of the respondents, the execution creditors, that the chattel mortgage is void under \u201c The Act respecting Assignments for the benefit of Creditors,\u201d ([2]), as creating a fraudulent preference. That section provides as follows:\u2014\n\u201c 2. Every gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer, delivery over, or payment of goods, chattels or effects, or of bills, bonds, notes, securities, or of shares, dividends, premiums, or bonus in any bank, company or corporation, or of any other property, real or personal, made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors, or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors, or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect, shall as against them be utterly void.\u201d\nThe trial judge held that the chattel mortgage was not given by the debtors with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice their creditors, or to create a preference; he held, however, that it had the effect of creating a preference, and was, therefore, void under the act This decision was affirmed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. The plaintiff appealed to this court.\nMoss Q.C. and Wade for the appellant.\nThe Manitoba statute clearly is an act relating to bankruptcy or insolvency and is void. Clarkson v. Ontario Bank ([3]); Reg. v. Chandler ([4]).\nBy sec. 7 of the act only the assignee can sue. If he refuses, or if there is no assignment, a creditor may sue by leave of the court.\nThe appellant is within the saving clause. The evidence shows that he intended to make advances to Robinson and he gave him time to pay his debt which is equivalent to an advance. Rae v. McDonald ([5]).\nThis court has decided in Molsons Bank v. Halter ([6]) that the intent to delay or give a preference must still be shown in spite of the words \u201c or which has such effect\u201d in the statute. That being so there was clearly no such intent in this case. The matter of preference is very fully discussed in Slater v. Oliver ([7]). See also Ex parte Ellis ([8]), Ex parte Sheen ([9]).\nMorris Q.C. and Elliott for the respondents referred to Murtha v. McKenna ([10]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I entirely concur in the judgment of my brother Strong in this case, and for the reasons which he has advanced I would allow the appeal.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is one involving the validity as against creditors of a chattel mortgage given to the appellant by a firm of Madell & Robinson who were debtors of both the appellant and respondents, and it is worthy of remark at the outset that the result of the judgment appealed against is not to avoid this mortgage in favour of the general body of creditors, but merely to substitute the respondents, who are execution creditors, as creditors having priority, so far as regards the property comprised in the mortgage, over the appellant. The debtors having made an assignment for the benefit of creditors generally the assignee, Mr. Wade, who was originally made a party to the interpleader proceedings, submitted to be barred, and this interpleader issue was then directed to be tried between the appellant claiming under his chattel mortgage as plaintiff, and the respondents, the execution creditors, as defendants. On the trial of this issue before Mr. Justice Bain (without a jury) the learned judge found for the respondents, and upon an appeal being taken to the full Court of Queen\u2019s Bench the judgment of Mr. Justice Bain was sustained.\nThe specific ground upon which the security is impeached is that it was a preference, or had the effect of a preference, within the meaning of the Manitoba act 49 Vic. ch. 45 sec. 2. This enactment is as follows:\nEvery gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer, delivery over or payment of goods, chattels or effects, or of bills, bonds, notes, securities or of shares, dividends, premiums or bonds in any bank, company or corporation, or of any other property, real or personal, made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances or unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect, shall as against them be utterly void.\nOne of the appellant\u2019s contentions is that this clause is void as being legislation on the subject of insolvency and therefore beyond the powers of a provincial legislature. I am of opinion, however, that the appeal may be decided on other grounds, apart altogether from the question of the constitutional validity of the statute, and that we are therefore relieved from considering and pronouncing upon this latter point.\nThat the appellant was a perfectly honest creditor, whose debt had arisen in every respect in good faith, was in no way disputed.\nWhether there was or not notice to the appellant of the insolvency of the debtors is a point which, in the view I take of the meaning and construction of the statute, is not material to the decision of the present appeal.\nIt is clear, however, that notice has not been established. The trial judge found, and the court in banc sustained the finding, that the appellant had not notice of the insolvency of the execution debtors at the time he took his security. In appeal Mr. Justice Killam expressly says that there was evidence to support this finding and that there is no weight of evidence against it. In this court we may therefore well treat this question of fact as concluded by the concurrent findings of the two courts below.\nThe substantial ground upon which I am prepared to rest my judgment is the construction of the language of the statute in relation to the meaning of the words \u201cpreference\u201d and \u201ceffect of preference.\u201d\nThat by the second section of the statute before set forth it was intended in any way to attribute to the word \u201c preference\u201d a wider scope than previous decisions had given it, or to alter or interfere with the signification which had in accordance with its etymological meaning been affixed to the expression when used in bankruptcy and insolvency statutes by courts of the highest authority, in no way appears either from the section itself or from any context to be found in other parts of the statute. It is for the respondents to establish that the word is to receive some secondary meaning, differing from that which has always been placed upon it, before they can ask us to refuse to follow the authorities which, from the time of Lord Mansfield down to the decision of the case of Butcher v. Stead ([11]), have held that the word imports a voluntary preference and that an act of the debtor which is induced by the pressure of the creditor is in no sense to be deemed a preference.\nIn Butcher v. Stead Lord Cairns thus decisively expresses the view that the word \u201cpreference\u201d per se imports a voluntary preference, and that when there is pressure on the part of a creditor seeking payment or security for a debt honestly due there can be no fraudulent preference The passage I refer to is that to be found at p. 846 of the report, where the Lord Chancellor says:\u2014\nThe act appears to have left the question of preference as it stood under the old law, and indeed the use of the word \u201cpreference\u201d implying an act of free will would of itself make it necessary to consider whether pressure had or had not been used, and this appears to have been the opinion of the Lords Justices in the case of Ex parte Topham ([12]).\nCan then anything in the way of statutory enactment be pointed to, displacing this positive and authoritative declaration of the law delivered, by the Lord Chancellor of England so recently as the year 1875 ? Nothing to which we have been referred shows that there has been any change, and if the result would be, as in the present case, to bring about a mere interversion of the priorities of two rival creditors it is perhaps not to be regretted that no change has been made. It is not, however, to be supposed that this case of Butcher V. Stead stands alone as an authority upon the effect of pressure as rebutting a presumption of fraudulent preference. In the recent case of Long v. Hancock (3) Mr. Justice Gwynne in this court laid down the same doctrine, and the cases cited in the appellant\u2019s factum, of Kennedy v. Freeman ([13]), Slater v. Oliver ([14]), and re Boyd ([15]), are all to the same effect.\nAs I have said the doctrine had its origin as far back as the time of Lord Mansfield (see Harman v. Fishar ([16]) and Thompson v. Freeman) ([17]) and the books are full of cases down to recent times all recognizing the doctrine and treating it as one necessarily arising from the primary and natural import of the word \u201cpreference\u201d as meaning a voluntary act on the part of the debtor and therefore as a term which is not applicable to an act brought about by the active influence of the creditor. Two decisions of the Privy Council, both referred to in the appellant\u2019s factum, are so precisely in point that they seem to me conclusive. In the first The Bank of Australasia v. Harris ([18]) the words of a statute in the nature of an insolvency act which avoided acts \u201chaving the effect of preferring\u201d were identical with those in the present statute and it was held that this referred to fraudulent preferences only. The Jamaica case of Nunes v. Carter (V) is to the same effect. Both these cases recognize that the word \u201cpreference\u201d or \u201cpreferring\u201d referred to a voluntary and therefore fraudulent preference. In the notes to Harman v. Fishar ([19]), in Tudor\u2019s L. Cases on Mercantile Law ([20]), a long list of authorities which it would be useless to quote more particularly is to be found.\nThen as to what acts are sufficient to constitute pressure the decided cases are equally explicit. The cases on this head are also all collected in the book last referred to ([21]) and from them it appears that a mere demand by the creditor without even a threat of, much less a resort to, legal proceedings is sufficient pressure to rebut the presumption of a preference We need not, however, dwell longer on this part of the case, inasmuch as both Mr. Justice Bain at the trial and the court on appeal were of opinion that if pressure was in law sufficient to rebut any inference of fraudulent preference it was, in point of fact, sufficiently established. Mr. Justice Killam delivering judgment in appeal says:\nI understand the learned judge intended to find that there was such pressure as to rebut any presumption of an intent to prefer. The evidence fully warrants suck a finding. This effect of pressure has been so frequently accepted in this court as not to require to be now discussed.\nThen, and this perhaps is the main, argument relied on by the respondents, it is said that even if there was no intent to prefer yet the security given had \u201cthe effect of a preference\u201d within the meaning of those words as used in the statute. In the case of Molsons Bank v. Halter ([22]) I have already stated my own opinion as to the meaning which ought to be placed on this expression. 1 there said that I interpreted them as applying to a case in which that had been done indirectly which if it had been done directly would have been a preference within the statute. To this opinion I still adhere, and if I am correct in this, which is the literal construction, it is conclusive in the present case.\nIt has, however, been forcibly argued on this appeal, both in the appellant\u2019s factum and by his counsel at the bar, that if it is once demonstrated that the word preference means ex vi termini a voluntary preference then the class of contracts, deeds, instruments or acts which are to be avoided as having the effect of a preference must also be restricted to such as are spontaneous acts or deeds of the debtor. This argument appears to me irresistible, and even were it unsupported by authority I should deem it conclusive of the case. But in the case of The Bank of Australasia v. Harris (1), before the Privy Council, the very same point arose; the difference between the words of the statute, the construction of which was in question there, and the present statute are immaterial. It will be remembered that the words of the statute in that case (which I have already quoted) were \u201c having the effect of preferring,\u201d here they are \u201c or which has such effect,\u201d the relative word \u201csuch\u201d referring to the giving any one or more of his creditors a \u201cpreference\u201d over his other creditors. No reasonable or even sensible distinction can be made between the language of the two statutes, and it therefore follows that we have in this case of The Bank of Australasia v. Harris, a direct authority on this point of construction which we cannot refuse to follow without repudiating the authority of our own supreme court of appeal. And this same construction we have again substantially repeated in the case of Nunes v. Carter (2).\nTherefore it appears that both upon authority and principle the construction of the statute contended for by the appellant is that which ought to be adopted.\nHad it been the intention of the legislature to make such an alteration of the law as to avoid all transactions which might result in giving precedence to active and diligent creditors who should by pressing their claims obtain priority over others, it can hardly be supposed, in view of the well-established state of the then existing law to the contrary, that such a change would not have been enunciated in clear and explicit terms. As I have already pointed out it is found by both the courts below that the appellant had no notice of the insolvency of the debtor; but even if it had been otherwise I should have considered that inasmuch as the law as it had been settled in England did not make securities obtained by a creditor in priority to others a fraudulent preference, provided it was the result of pressure, even although the creditor had notice of the debtor\u2019s insolvency, and as this state of the law had not been altered by the statute, notice was immaterial.\nAs I have arrived at this conclusion it is unnecessary to notice two other points made by the appellant, one impeaching the locus standi of the respondents to attack the mortgage, a right which it is contended is given exclusively to the assignee, the other that there was a further advance by the appellant at the time of taking his security. Both of these objections seem to be of weight, but I express no opinion as regards either of them.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed and judgment entered on the interpleader issue for the appellant with costs in this court and also in the court below.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong for allowing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I cannot pronounce the judgment of the learned judge who tried the case upon the question of fact as to the perfect honesty of the transaction assailed and the bona fides of the parties to it to be clearly erroneous, and if I cannot, the established rule of the court is that I should not. In other respects also I entirely concur in the judgment of my brother Strong, to which I merely desire to add that in my judgment the case is concluded by the judgment of this court in Molsons Bank v. Halter ([23]).\nPATTERSON J.\u2014(After reviewing the evidence at some length his Lordship proceeded as follows): The result of all the evidence seems to me very plain.\nThe debtors being unable to pay their debts, but having hopes that if they could keep their creditors from interfering with their business they might be able to provide in the long run for paying them, transfer to one creditor all their assets, some by way of mortgage; some, viz., the book debts, by absolute assignment; and some, viz., the horse, both ways, the absolute sale being before the mortgage; having an understanding, vague enough and not amounting to an agreement, that he would assist them to keep their business going. He would not have engaged as far as he did, as he tells us, if they had not given him the security\u2014in other words made him better off than the other creditors. The most effective assistance looked for was evidently the keeping off the other creditors, or as Robinson phrased it when speaking of the book debts, \u201c to keep other people from jumping on to them, and to give me the same chance that I wanted in the first place,\u201d\u2014which is pretty much to the same effect as a statement of the plaintiff which I have already read when he said: \u201cGiving me a chattel mortgage would secure me and prevent any other creditors coming and seizing every thing, and give them time also to pay them all off. The understanding was that I was to take the security and give them all the time necessary to pay off the other creditors.\u201d\nThe respondents obtained judgment against Madell and Robinson on or before the 26th of January, 1889, and on that day seized the goods under a fi. fa. and they were, as already mentioned, sold under the interpleader order.\nThe mortgage is attacked under the following provision of the statute of Manitoba, 49 Vic. ch. 45 sec. 2:\n2. Every gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer, delivery over or payment of goods, chattels or effects, or of bills, bonds, notes, securities, or of shares, dividends, premiums, or bonus in any bank, company or corporation, or of any other property, real or personal, made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors, or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors, or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect, shall as against them be utterly void.\nIt has been held to be invalid by the unanimous judgment of the Court of, Queen\u2019s Bench in that province as having the effect of giving a preference to the appellant over the other creditors of Madell and Robinson.\nThere were two objections taken to the mortgage under the act respecting chattel mortgages, both of which were, I think properly, overruled in the court below. One was to the description of the goods; but the description satisfies the statute, as already decided in this court. The other was based upon the circumstance that the mortgage was given in part to secure the amount of current promissory notes, the contention being that the consideration ought, so far as that amount is concerned, to have been differently stated; and, consequent upon that, that there ought to have been a different affidavit of bona fides. But the security was not taken against the liability of the mortgagee as indorser of the notes. The amount of those notes was a debt directly due to the mortgagee as much as the amount of the overdue notes or of that part of the amount which had never been covered by a note. A promise to pay a debt at a future day does not alter the nature of the debt. We have therefore to consider only the statute of 49 Vic. ch. 45, and the questions under it are: Was the mortgage made with intent to give the mortgagee a preference over other creditors, or had it such effect?\nIn the first place what is a preference?\nIn investigating the meaning and force of that word as used in this Manitoba statute it is said that we are not at liberty to look beyond the construction applied by this court to the same word in a statute of the province of Ontario in the recent case of Molsons Bank v. Halter (1). If that position is correct we must understand the preference dealt with by the statute as being the voluntary and spontaneous act of the debtor uninfluenced by pressure, even to the extent of a request, on the part of the creditor. As expressed in that case by one of my learned brothers:\nTo constitute a preference it [i. e. the transfer of property] must have been given by the insolvent of his own mere motion, and as a favour or bounty proceeding voluntarily from himself.\nWith great, respect for the opinions of my learned brothers who formed the majority of the court at the hearing of Molsons Bank v. Halter, I venture to think a reconsideration of the question desirable, nor do I perceive any sufficient reason for treating the judgment in that case, even if the views alluded to had been those of the whole court, as making it our duty to apply the same construction to this Manitoba statute. The two statutes are, no doubt, very much alike, but in Molsons Bank v. Halter there were several questions that do not arise in the case before us. One of them turned on the relation of the mortgagor in the impeached, mortgage towards his mortgagee. It was held, upon the facts of the case, that those persons were not debtor and creditor, and it was further held that the statute avoided preferential transfers only when made by a debtor to his creditor. That decision took the case altogether out of the statute and i made the discussion of the word \u201cpreference\u201d unnecessary for the disposal of the appeal.\nBut I take it to be indisputable that, as a matter of principle, the reasons given by the court for its judgment in any case may properly be reconsidered and, if found to be erroneous, corrected when a similar question arises in another case. Whether that can be done by an ultimate court of appeal, such as the House of Lords, may perhaps not be free from question. We have the opinion of Lord Campbell expressed in Bright v. Hutton ([24]), and in Beamish v. Beamish ([25]), in one direction, and that of Lord St. Leonards in Wilson v. Wilson ([26]), taking the opposite view, while in the last named case Lord Brougham spoke of the question as questio vexata. The reasons on which the opinion of Lord Campbell is founded apply only to the court of last resort, and the power of every other judicial tribunal to correct an error (if it has fallen into one) in subsequently applying the law to other cases is recognised in express terms, particularly by Lord St. Leonards. I had occasion to consider the doctrine in re Hall ([27]), where I referred to the cases I have now cited with other authorities. Instances illustrating the point are often met with. One of them is afforded by the case Ex parte Griffith ([28]), in which the Court of Appeal departed from the rule of decision which had obtained in a series of cases beginning with Ex parte Tempest ([29]). I shall have to notice those cases more fully by and by, as I proceed with the consideration of the question: What is a preference within the meaning of the Manitoba statute? To one reading the statute the word does not seem hard to understand, yet it is urged that under the apparent simplicity of the expression there lurks a hidden qualification. A man whose mind is unwarped by legal subtleties, and who reads the statute in order to learn and be governed by its provisions, will instinctively act on the golden rule of construction and give to the language its ordinary grammatical meaning. The word \u201cpreference\u201d will not be to him an unfamiliar term in the vocabulary of business life. Preference shares in railway and other companies, and preferred creditors in insolvency or winding-up proceedings, he will probably know as subjects of legislation, if not in a more practical way. The clause of the Manitoba statute now before us is a reproduction, with some recent variations, of one enacted in the province of Canada over thirty years ago (1) and adopted in Manitoba where it was more than once re-enacted. It contained the word preference in the same sense as in the present clause (2), and had also a proviso excepting from its operations assignments made by debtors \u201cfor the purpose of paying and satisfying ratably and proportionably, and without preference or priority, all the creditors of such debtor their just debts.\u201d \u201cPreference and priority\u201d mean in these instances pretty much the same thing. One man gets paid in priority to another, or the other may get nothing at all. That is the sense in which the word is employed in this statute, and it is the ordinary force of the word as used in our legislation, as for example in the Ontario assessment laws which make the taxes a special lien on land, \u201chaving preference over any claim,\u201d &c. (3). But we are told that in this Manitoba statute it does not mean that. It is argued that to give one creditor an advantage over the others, in respect of the assets of his debtor, is not within the meaning of the statute to give him a preference unless it is done by the voluntary and spontaneous act of the debtor. This is a different thing from the \u201cintent,\u201d which under this law has usually been construed as the same word is construed in the statute 13 Eliz. ch. 5, and which, from the date of Wood v Dixie ([30]) through nearly all of the last half century, has given rise to so many contests. The contention is that the word \u201cpreference\u201d by its own proper force involves, and in this statute expresses, the idea of spontaneity on the part of the debtor who gives the preference. I entirely dissent from this suggestion. I regard it as unwarranted by anything necessarily conveyed by the word itself; as palpably opposed to the purpose of the statute; and as unsupported by the correct understanding of any English authority.\nThe term \u201cfraudulent preference\u201d as used in connection with the administration of English bankruptcy law, was not found in any statute. It was a term adopted by the courts to designate an act by which one creditor obtained an advantage over the others when two things concurred: first, that the act was voluntary on the part of the debtor; and secondly, that it was done in contemplation of bankruptcy. The word \u201cpreference\u201d in this compound term was used in the sense which I attribute to it in the Manitoba statute, and it was held to be fraudulent when the two things I have mentioned concurred. Then came the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, and afterwards the Bankruptcy Act, 1883. Each of those acts contained a clause, which was section 92 of the former and section 48 of the latter act, that\u2014\nEvery conveyance, &c, by any person unable to pay his debts as; they become due from his own money in favour of any creditor........ with a view of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors, shall, if the person making...... the same is adjudged bankrupt on a bankruptcy petition presented within three months after the date of making...... the same, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nThis enactment encountered the inertia that is induced in the judicial mind by long following a particular line of thought. It was at first held that it left the law unaltered, and that the preference forbidden by it was merely the old fraudulent preference of the judicial decisions which, as I have said, was never, defined by statute, and which included as one of its ingredients the voluntary and spontaneous action of the debtor. It was so laid down in Ex parte Tempest ([31]), in 1870. James L.J., speaking in that case of the old law, said:\nThe principle is that in order to constitute a fraudulent preference the act must be the spontaneous act of the debtor, not originating in a demand or some other step of the creditor.\nAnd again:\nThe motive of giving a security is always to make the second creditor safe and better off than other creditors. The question is: What is the motive of that motive?\nAnd further on:\nIt is said, however, that the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, sec. 92, alters the law and makes an application by the creditor immaterial. It appears to me that, to make that section apply, the transaction must be one which would have been an act of fraudulent preference under the old law.\nIn Ex parte Topham ([32]), in 1873, the Court of Appeal considered that the Chief Judge had given a perfectly accurate description of the state of the law when he said that\u2014 Unless it can be made clearly apparent, and to the satisfaction of the court which has to decide, that the debtor\u2019s sole motive was to prefer the creditor paid to the other creditors, the payment cannot be impeached, even though it be obviously in favour of a creditor.\nIn the case of Butcher v. Stead (1) which was before the House of Lords in 1875, the question decided was that a provision of section 92 saving the rights of a purchaser, payee or incumbrancer in good faith and for valuable consideration, extended to protect a person who received payment as a creditor, Lord Selborne disapproving of the construction thus put upon the statute, and expressing a fear that the decision opened a wide door to frauds upon the bankrupt law. The decision does not bear upon the present discussion, but Lord Cairns in the course of his judgment used language which may seem to do so. He said:\nThe act appears to have left the question of pressure as it stood under the old law, and indeed the word \u201cpreference,\u201d implying an act of free will, would of itself make it necessary to consider whether pressure had or had not been used, and this appears to have been the opinion of the Lords Justices in the case of Ex parte Topham (2).\nIt may be presumptuous to question the dictum of so eminent a jurist as Lord Cairns, even as to the meaning of an English word, but I humbly submit that the word \u201cpreference\u201d does not, ex vi termini, imply an act of free will, and that if the free will or voluntary act of the debtor is to be understood as an ingredient of the preference dealt with by these statutes that understanding must be derived elsewhere than from the word \u201cpreference\u201d itself. The word \u201c prefer \u201d is no doubt appropriate to denote an act of the mind, or the state of one\u2019s affections or choice, and possibly that may be the sense in which it is most frequently used in every-day conversation; but that is only one application of its meaning which is, literally, to bear or carry before, or to give the object of the preference a place before some other. We may safely appeal to the authorised version of the scriptures as a standard of accuracy as well as of elegance in the use of our language. We there find the word sometimes expressive of choice ([33]), as when Timothy is charged to do certain things \u201c without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.\u201d But it is more usual to find the word denoting only relative position, as in the Baptist\u2019s announcement \u201c After me cometh a man who is preferred before me \u201d ([34]), and when it is said that \u201cThis Daniel was preferred before the presidents and princes\u201d ([35]). In other versions the same meaning is conveyed by a different word. In Beza\u2019s latin translation of the passage from St. John, we have \u201cantepono\u201d\u2014Pone me venil vir qui anteposilus est mihi. In the vulgate we find \u201cante\u201d with \u201cfacio\u201d\u2014Qui post me venturus est ante me factus est. The revised version has it \u201cAfter me cometh a man which is become before me.\u201d In the passage from Daniel the vulgate uses the verb \u201csupero.\u201d\u2014Igitur Daniel superabat omnes principes et satrapas. And in the revised version it is \u201cThis Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and satraps.\u201d\nIn this sense, it seems plain to my understanding, the word prefer is used in these statutes; and in every place where it occurs in the judgments cited it conveys the idea of giving one creditor a position more advanced than the others, or precedence, in relation to the payment of his debt. In short, as before remarked, the words \u201cpreference\u201d and \u201cpriority\u201d are almost if not altogether interchangeable.\nWhen the English courts read into the new clause of the Bankruptcy Acts the old doctrines touching fraudulent preference they pursued a course of reasoning inapplicable to our statutes and to our conditions. We are not dealing with a bankrupt law; but if we were we should still remember that the English bankruptcy system under which, independently of statute law, the old doctrines and formulae had been established was not part of our jurisprudence. We may say of their rule of interpretation as applied to our statute, adopting language used by Lord Hobhouse in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([36]), that it would \u201crun counter to the common understanding of men on this subject, which is one main clue to the meaning of the legislature.\u201d But the construction given to the clause of the Bankruptcy Acts of 1869 and 1883 in Ex parte Tempest ([37]) and other cases was, after a while, challenged, and, as far as it dealt with the force of the word \u201cpreference,\u201d was abandoned.\nThe judicial inertia was at length overcome.\nEx parte Griffith ([38]) was decided in the Court of Appeal in February, 1883, by judges all of whom had gone on the bench after the act of 1869 had come into force. They were Jessel M.R. and Lindley and Bowen L. J. J. The principles settled by their decision are thus concisely stated in the head note of the report:\u2014\nIn determining whether a transaction amounts to a fraudulent preference the court ought now to have regard simply to the statutory definition contained in section 92 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869.\nThe decisions on the subject before the act may be useful as guides, but the standards laid down in them must not be substituted for that which is laid down in the act.\nIt was thus no longer held to be essential to the invalidity of a transaction that it was the spontaneous act of the debtor, or that his sole motive must be the intent to prefer the particular creditor.\nIt will be useful to quote one or two observations made by the judges in delivering their opinions. It would be instructive to read the whole of what was said by the Master of the Rolls, but I shall confine myself to one passage:\u2014\nI think it far better that we should in all these cases look to the intention of the clause in the act, and not entangle ourselves in an enquiry as to the precise views and intentions of the parties, in order to see what was the motive of the transaction and what the law was before the statute.\nLindley L.J. said:\u2014\nWhat we have to consider is the true construction of section 92. I emphatically protest against being led away from the words of the section by any argument that the standard which the legislature has laid clown is equivalent to the standard of the old law.\nSome remarks of Bowen L.J. are particularly worthy of note:\u2014\nI should like to pause, he said, in the current of judicial decisions for the last fifteen years on the subject of fraudulent preference, and to take note, so to say, of the position in which the court finds itself in relation to this subject. Everybody knows that originally there was no express statutory enactment in regard to fraudulent preference. But from the time of Lord Mansfield down to 1869 the courts considered that certain transfers of property were frauds upon the bankrupt law, though there was no statutory enactment on the subject. Then came the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, and in that act it was for the first time explained what was meant by fraudulent preference and the act uses very definite language. Now what is the method that has been pursued by judicial decisions since? I think it is very unfortunate. I do not say that it has led to any wrong decision, but I think that it has had a tendency to draw one\u2019s mind away from the true question. The first thing which the courts did was to discuss the question whether the act had altered the old law and introduced an entirely new law, and they came to the conclusion that it had not altered the old law. Then began what I may call the old metaphysical exploration of the motives of people. The courts first adopted a supposed verbal equivalent for the words of the statute, and then pursued the old enquiries as to what were the deductions that followed from the adoption of this verbal equivalent; and so we have been drawn into questions of pressure and volition, and at length in the present case have got into a discussion as to what is the motive of a motive, whatever that may mean. I think it is a wiser policy to go back, as do, in a humble spirit to the words of the statute, and, without discussing motives of motives, enquire whether the transaction was entered into with a view to give one creditor a preference over the other.\nI referred to this case of Ex parte Griffith ([39]) in a case of Brayley v. Ellis ([40]), in which I took part in the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1884, and cited also Ex parte Hill re Bird (3) which was decided shortly after the Griffith case, and I then expressed the opinion which I still hold, that with those decisions before us we were at liberty to give effect to the plain language of a similar statute to the one before us without fear of coming into conflict with rules or supposed rules of decision in the English courts. Some of my colleagues in the Court of Appeal did not take quite the same view as I did of the effect of Ex parte Griffith, which had been decided after the argument of the case of Brayley v. Ellis; but I find the decision, together with that in Ex parte Hill, spoken of in the third edition of the Messrs. Williams Treatise on Bankruptcy (4), published in 1884, as having considerably shaken the rules laid down informer cases as applicable to fraudulent preferences. The authors also remark that for some time prior even to the decision in Ex parte Griffith there had been a tendency to depart from the old notion that a bond fide demand negatived preference, and to disregard pressure and demands unless the position of the debtor was such that the demand or pressure might really influence him, citing two or three cases on the point.\nThe sensible and, practical rule laid down in Ex parte Griffith for administering the clause of the Bankruptcy Act I understand to have ever since been recognised as the proper rule. In Ex parte Taylor (5), in 1886, an attempt was made to carry it too far. It was argued that if a creditor was in fact preferred the motives of the debtor in giving him the preference were not to be enquired into; but that, as it was pointed out by the Court of Appeal, would be to strike out of the section the words referring to the intent. Lord Esher M.R. in the course of his observations remarked that:\nIt has been said that the court must be satisfied that the preferring of the creditor was the predominant view of the debtor\u2014that if he acted from mixed motives the court must find out which was the predominant view in his mind. That no doubt is so, though I should have been content to say that the payment must have been made with a view of preferring the creditor. What is meant by \u201cwith a view?\u201d It is the same thing as with an \u201cintent.\u201d * * *\nIt is impossible to lay down any exhaustive rule; the court must judge from the particular facts of each case whether the debtor did make the payment with a view or intent of preferring the creditor.\u201d\nLindley L.J. said:\nRegard must be had to the \u201cview\u201d with which the payment was made. * * * It is impossible to infer the debtor\u2019s view from the mere fact that the creditor was preferred.\nAnd Lopes L.J.:\nThe mere fact of making a preferential payment is not a fraudulent preference. The substantial motive of the debtor in making it must be looked at. If the substantial motive is to prefer the creditor the payment is a fraudulent preference. If the substantial motive is reformation for a wrong, or to avoid evil consequences to the debtor himself, the payment is not a fraudulent preference.\nThe rule seems to be settled that in order to save a preferential payment or transfer under section 48 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 something more must be done than merely to show that the transaction was not the spontaneous act of the debtor. A creditor cannot come, as Jessel M.R. described the creditors as coming in Ex parte Griffith (1), and as it seems to me the creditor came in this case, saying: \u201cCan\u2019t you give me a preference,\u201d and asking the debtor to assign property to him to secure his debt. What more has to be shown must depend on the circumstances of the case. In Ex parte Taylor ([41]) the payment was held to have been made without any view of preferring the creditors, but with the sole intent of averting a threatened exposure of the debtor. But a motive of that sort will not be found by inference or suggestion. For example, it will not do to show that you have done something for which you are liable to prosecution unless you go further and prove that you were threatened with proceedings. That was decided in 1889, in Ex parte Boyd ([42]). A son had received \u00a31,000 on behalf of a company of which his father was promoter and principal shareholder and had not accounted for the money. He transferred shares in the company to his father who paid off the \u00a3 1,000. It was held by a divisional court that there being no evidence of any criminal proceedings having been contemplated against the debtor in respect of his alleged defalcations, and the father being aware of the debtor\u2019s insolvent condition, the transaction was rightly set aside;\nThe English courts have thus receded from the notion that the term \u201cfraudulent preference\u201d as defined by the bankruptcy decisions is the equivalent of the word \u201cpreference\u201d in section 48, used as it is used there without the qualifying adjective; but I repeat that we are not dealing with a bankrupt law, and that the English bankruptcy system never was the law of Ontario or Manitoba. There is nothing in the Manitoba statute to require or justify the qualification which we are asked to apply to the word \u201cpreference,\u201d as in the5case of the Bank of Australasia v. Harris (3), where the word was held to be qualified by the effect of other parts of the statute in which it occurred. Our duty is to interpret our statute by giving to the language in which the legislative will is expressed its natural force. \u201cPreference\u201d so understood means an advantage given to or obtained by one creditor over others. It is not uncommon to find these words \u201c preference \u201d and \u201c advantage \u201d used one for the other. Thus James L.J. in Ex parte Tempest ([43]) speaks of one creditor getting an advantage over the others or being better off than the others; and in a very recent case, In re Skegg ([44]), Lord Justice Bowen paraphrases \u201c undue preference\u201d by \u201cundue advantage.\u201d\nThe plaintiff Stephens obtained by his mortgage an advantage over the other creditors. He was made better off than any of them, for he got everything and left nothing for the rest. The mortgage had the effect of giving him a preference and, therefore, by the plain words of the statute, it is void as against the other creditors.\nI am further of opinion that the mortgage was made with intent to give the mortgagee a preference, although as it had \u201csuch effect\u201d the statute dispenses with the necessity for enquiring into the intent.\nLet us realise what the transaction was as shown by the account given by the plaintiff and by T. B. Robinson, and with the additional light afforded by the dealing with the book debts.\nThe plaintiff Stephens, the largest creditor, had given orders not to renew any more of the paper of the firm, so that if other creditors seemed inclined to push matters he might save himself. No one should get a preference over him. Then he tells the debtors that something must be done. Three courses are talked of, viz.: the plaintiff may sue for his claim, a large part of which Was, however, not ripe for suit; or the debtors may make an assignment for all their creditors alike; or they may give the plaintiff a preference by mortgaging all their assets to him.\nThe three courses are practically only two, because under this Manitoba statute, a debtor who is sued can, by making an assignment, place all his creditors on an equal footing. The choice offered was, therefore, to as sign for the equal benefit of all, or to give a preference to the plaintiff over all the others. When Mr. Robinson says that on an assignment the creditors would not have realised over ten or fifteen cents in the dollar he differs widely from the plaintiff who paid 55 cents, and was prepared to bid 15, at the sheriff\u2019s sale. He doubtless bases his estimate on the idea of the stock being brought at once to the hammer, but that is not a necessary consequence of an assignment. See slater v. Badenach ([45]) in this court If an assignment had been made the creditors might be trusted to look after their own interests. The choice was made, and it was to make the mortgage, or in other words, to give the preference to the plaintiff. It would be childish to argue, and I do not think it has been argued, that a man who conveys everything that he has to one creditor does not do so with intent that that creditor shall be better off than the rest. We must not confound intent with wish or desire, and there is less danger of our doing so than when the doctrine of spontaneity obtained.\nBut while the object and design of giving the security was that the one creditor should be secured and that the others should run all the risks, was there not some other motive that predominated and to which the making of the mortgage ought to be ascribed?\nIt is the same question put by Lord Justice James in Ex parte Tempest ([46]), in 1870, and dealt with in the vigorous judgment of Lord Justice Bowen in Ex parte Griffith ([47]), in 1883\u2014the question of the motive of a motive.\nA person who conveys all his property to one of his creditors leaving nothing within the reach of the others will be apt to find it more difficult to assign a plausible motive for his act, if he desires it to appear to have been done with an intent other than the intent to give the preference which he has given, than if one piece of property were transferred or charged leaving other property free, or a payment made which took only a part of his means.\nThis question of motives necessarily envolves an enquiry into the action of certain influences on somebody\u2019s mind. Whose mind have we to discuss in this case? The debtors and mortgagors were Madell and Eliza Robinson; but Eliza had no mind of her own in connection with the business\u2014her own deposition proves that\u2014and Madell, the partner who was the tradesman and attended to the out-door work, was leaving the concern and taking $100 with him. T. B. Robinson who is spoken of as carrying on the business in the name of his wife, under whose power of attorney he acted, tells us that, as the sole member of the new firm of T. B. Robinson & Co., the wife carried on the business in his name. It seems that he is the only person whose motives we can discuss. He may have been sanguine enough to believe that, with time to work out the problem, the fortunes of the business could be retrieved, the creditors all paid, and something left. That hope must have been seen to have been unfounded when the affairs were analysed in connection with the trial; but assuming it to have existed when he decided on giving the mortgage in place of making an assignment its influence must have been due to the prospect of something remaining after paying the debts, rather than to solicitude for the creditors. The assignment would have suited the creditors better. But Robinson\u2019s plans required that the creditors should be kept off, and the mortgage was the only way to do that. It left the book debts exposed, and they were accordingly assigned to the plaintiff under the circumstances already detailed, the explanations given being, as we have seen, not entirely free from confusion and discrepancy. It was necessary also that some help should be given to keep any life in the business. Stephens agreed it may be said, though there was no definite agreement, to help them, but how? He would sell them such goods as they required, and as he had, provided they paid him promptly, on the usual terms of thirty days\u2019 credit. He advanced $200 or thereabouts, and he took an absolute assignment of $400 or $500 worth of good accounts. The precise relation between that assignment and the advances of money is involved in some confusion, but it is impossible to read what the plaintiff and Robinson say about the book debts without plainly perceiving that the main object\u2014we may even say the avowed object\u2014was to keep those accounts out of the reach of the other creditors. That design governed the whole transaction for it was \u201eone scheme throughout. It is not difficult to gather it from what is said about the mortgage, though not so plainly put as when the accounts are spoken of. We should, in my opinion, fail to give its due effect to the statute if we should affirm the good faith of this transaction and hold the motive to keep the creditors at bay while the debtors made the speculative, and not very hopeful, attempt to bring up their lee way sufficient to sustain this pledge and conveyance of the whole of their property to the one creditor. Were there, after all, two motives, a dominant and a secondary one ? It seems to me that we describe the same motive whether we say it was to prefer the one to the others, or to postpone all the others to the one.\nIt was urged on behalf of the respondents in connection with a branch of the case which I have not yet touched, viz.: the legislative authority of the province to pass the act in question, that if the, act was ultra vires the rights of the parties would have to be tested under a provision of an act passed in 1885 ([48]), which declared that every conveyance, &c, made by an insolvent person, or one unable to pay his debts in full, with intent to defeat or delay his creditors or any of them, or to give any one of them a preference over the others, should be void as against creditors, saving, as already noticed, assignments for the benefit of all the creditors. This follows the law of Upper Canada and Ontario which last appeared in the Revised Statutes of 1877 ([49]), but with a difference. As far as they dealt with preferential transfers the statutes were alike, and what I have said about the intent to prefer in this case, apart from the effect, applies under the act of 1885 as well as under that of 1886. But the difference between the Manitoba act of 1885 and the Ontario or Upper Canada law was in the other particular of defeating or delaying creditors. The Upper Canada and Ontario law was held to be in this respect like the statute of 13 Eliz. ch. 5, and not to avoid a conveyance to a creditor even though it defeated or delayed other creditors and was made with intent so to do. The Manitoba reproductions of the statute ([50]) seem designed to avoid that construction by introducing the words \u201cor any of them\u201d\u2014making the intent to defeat or delay any of the creditors as fatal as the intent to defeat or delay all of them. These words \u00abor any of them \u201d do not appear in the act of 1886 in connection with the defeating or delaying or prejudicing the creditors, wherefore under that act we have to discuss only the question of the preference. But if the validity of the mortgage had to; be tested under the act of 1885 I should without hesitation hold it to have been made with intent to delay the creditors other than the mortgagee, as well as with \u2018 intent to give a preference.\nRegarding the authority of the provincial legislature to pass the act in question I have merely to say that I retain the views I expressed respecting the cognate act of the Ontario Legislature in Edgar v. Central Bank ([51]).\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: F. C. Wade.\nSolicitors for respondents: G. A. Elliott.\n[1] 6 Man. L.

S. Q. art. 2055.\nUpon an application by appellant for a writ of mandamus to compel the respondents to establish a new school district in the Parish of Ste Victoire in accordance with the terms of a sentence rendered on appeal by the Superintendent of Education under 40 Vic. ch. 22 s. Il (P.Q.), the respondents pleaded inter alia that the superintendent had no jurisdiction to make the order, the petition in appeal not having been approved of by three qualified school visitors. The decree of the superintendent alleged that the petition was approved of by one L., inspector of schools, as well as by three visitors.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), that the petition in appeal must have the approval of three visitors qualified for the municipality where the appeal to the superintendent originated, and as one of the three visitors who had signed the petition in appeal was parish priest of an adjoining parish, and not a qualified school visitor for the municipality of Ste. Victoire, the .sentence rendered by the superintendent was null and void. Taschereau J. dissenting on the ground that as the decree of the superintendent stated that L., the inspector of schools, was a visitor, it was pria\u00fb facie evidence that the formalities required to give the superintendent jurisdiction had been complied with. C.S.L.C. oh. 15 s. 25; arts. 1863, 1864, R. S. Q.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nIn October, 1888, the appellant, with other interested parties, having been refused by the respondents the establishment of a new school district in a certain part of the municipality of the parish of Ste. Victoire, appealed to the Superintendent of Education for the province of Quebec, mentioning the refusal of the respondents and asking redress; their petition to the superintendent was approved by three school visitors, viz. '. The Reverends J. Noiseux and O. Desorcy, both priests of the Roman Catholic church and the Honourable J. A. Dorion, ex-member of the legislative council, residing in the parish of St. Ours.\nOn the 20th October, 1888, the superintendent rendered a sentence by which he allowed the demand of appellant and others, and ordered the respondents to form the new district demanded, to be know as \" District No. 7 \" to erect a school house in the same; and awaiting the erection of such school house to open the school in a temporary building to be furnished by the interested parties.\nThe sentence of the superintendent alleged that the petition in appeal was approved of by one B. Lippens, inspector of schools.\nThe sentence was served upon the respondents, and a convenient place offered by the interested school rate-payers for the temporary school.\nThe respondents formally refused to obey the order of the superintendent.\nThe appellant then applied for a mandamus to force the respondents to obey and execute the sentence,\nThe respondents pleaded in substance that the sentence of the 20th October 1888 was illegal informal null and void in law for the following reasons:\u2014\n1st. Because the respondents had not been summoned to appear before the superintendent to oppose the appeal, and because the appeal had been heard and decided ex parte, without proof.\n2nd. Because such appeal had not been approved of by three qualified school visitors of the municipality of Ste. Victoire, it being falsely alleged in the sentence, that the Reverend O. Desorcy (one of the three approvers) resided in Ste. Victoire, whereas in fact, he was a resident of St. Ours.\n3rd. Because the resolution of the respondents of the 1st of October, 1888, was not subject to appeal to the superintendent; that the superintendent was not invested by law with the authority of hearing and determining such appeal, and of establishing the new school district No. 7; and had no authority to order the respondents to establish a school in such proposed district.\nThe appellant replied that the superintendent had acted within the limits of his powers; that his sentence was conclusive and final to all intents and purposes, and had to be obeyed without discussion by his subordinates, the respondents.\nBy a written admission filed of record the respondents confessed the truth of all the allegations of facts contained in the petition for mandamus, and upon which the appellant based his demand.\nThe respondents examined as their witnesses, to prove the allegations of their plea, one A. P. Bouchard, who deposed to the following facts, viz.: 1. that the respondents had never been notified of the appeal to the superintendent; 2. that they got knowledge of it only by the reception of the sentence; 3. that the Rev. 0. Desorcy (one of the approvers), had never resided in Ste. Victoire., but had always been and still was the parish priest of St. Ours, and had always resided there; 4. that there was no model school in Ste. Victoire.\nThe Superior Court granted a peremptory mandamus, and ordered the respondents to obey the sentence of the 20th October, 1888, and in default thereof condemned them to pay appellant a fine of $2,000.00, and costs of suit, according to art. 1025 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada that judgment was reversed.\nOn appeal, to the Supreme Court of Canada the principal question which arose was: Whether an appeal to the superintendent has any legal value unless approved of in writing by three qualified school visitors for the municipality where it has originated.\nLacoste Q.C. and Germain for appellant cited and relied on 40 Vic. ch. 22 s. 11 (P-Q-); arts. 1943, 1945, 1947, 1951, 1952, 1976, 2118, 2119; 1863, 1864, R. S. Q.; arts. 1211, 1244 C.C., and Tremblay v. The School Commissioners of St. Valentin ([1])\nGeoffrion Q.C. cited and relied on arts. 2055, 1951, 5775, s. 16, R. S. Q.; Trudelle v. The School Commissioners of Charlesbourg ([2]) and arts. 1022, 1025, C. P.C.\nSir \"W. J. RITCHIE C. J. Article 2055 Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, provides for approbation of three visitors, and art. 1951 of the same statute, s. 2, provides that the priests are visitors of the schools of the municipality only where they reside. It appears from the evidence that the Rev. O. Desorcy, one of the signers of the act of approbation at the bottom of the petition of the plaintiff to the Superintendent of Public Instruction, has never resided in the parish of Ste. Victoire, and therefore was not, and could not he, a visitor. Consequently any approbation given by him was invalid and of no effect and the appeal made by the plaintiff to the superintendent was not according to the formalities prescribed by law; the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversing the judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Richelieu the 4th of April, 1889, was correct therefore, and should be affirmed, and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have read the judgment which will be delivered by brother Fournier, and I entirely concur in the reasons he will state for dismissing this appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelant to quelques autres contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9 de Ste-Victoire, s'\u00e9tant adress\u00e9s par requ\u00eate aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles pour en obtenir la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouvel arrondissement d'\u00e9cole ces derniers, par une r\u00e9solution, adopt\u00e9e le ler octobre 1888 refus\u00e8rent la demande de l'appelant et de ceux qui s'\u00e9taient joints \u00e0 lui.\nL'appelant en appela an Surintendant de l'Education, de la d\u00e9cision rejetant sa demande.\nL'appel \u00e9tait alors accord\u00e9 par 40 Vict. ch. 22 sec. 11, en ces termes:\n11. La be sous-Section de la, see section du chapitre 15 des Statuts Refondus pour le Bas-Canada, est retranch\u00e9e, et la suivante lui est Substitu\u00e9e :\n\" 8. Lorsque l'emplacement d'une maison d'\u00e9cole est choisi par les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles, ou qu'un changement est fait dans les limites d'un arrondissement d'\u00e9cole on qu'un nouvel arrondissement est \u00e9tabli dans une municipalit\u00e9 scolaire, on qu'un o plusieurs arrondissements \u00e9tablis sont chang\u00e9s ou subdivis\u00e9s, on lorsque les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles refusent on n\u00e9gligent d'exercer on remplir quelqu'une des attributions on devoirs pie leur conf\u00e8re cette section, les contribuables int\u00e9ress\u00e9s pourront en appeler en tout temps, an surintendant, par requ\u00eate sommaire; mais cet appel n'aura lieu qu'avec l'approbation par \u00e9crit do trois visiteurs autres que les commissaires on syndics d'\u00e9coles de la dite municipalit\u00e9: la sentence rendue par le surintendant sera finale, et il pourra ordonner par cette sentence, que les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles fassent ce qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 on ce qu'il leur ordonne de faire, ou s'abstiennent de le faire, ou ne le fassent qu'en tout bu en partie et aux conditions exig\u00e9es par la sentence.\"\nDepuis, cette section a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9e et remplac\u00e9e par l'article 2055 Statuts Revises (P.Q.), qui en est la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition textuelle avec la d\u00e9claration qu'il y aura aussi appel pour refus ou n\u00e9gligence d'exercer les fonctions et devoirs imposes par les articles 2032, 2049, 2050, 2051, 2052, 2053 2054. Aucun de ces articles n'affectent la question soulev\u00e9e en cette cause. Toutefois, il est important de faire observer que les Statuts Revis\u00e9s n' Present: Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ \u00e9taient pas en force lors de la sentence du surintendant et que cet art 2055 n'est devenu loi que le ler janvier 1889, tandis que la dite sentence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 20 octobre 1888. C'est donc sur la sec. 11 de la 40 Vict. ch. 22, qu'il faut s'appuyer pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause\nCet appel, quoique sommaire, ne peut cependant \u00eatre obtenu \u00e0 moins que l'appelant ne se soit conform\u00e9 \u00e0 une formalit\u00e9 indispensable pour donner juridiction au surintendant, c'est celle de faire approuver sa requ\u00eate d'appel par trois visiteurs d'\u00e9cole. La loi s'exprime ainsi l les contribuables int\u00e9ress\u00e9s pourront en appeler en tout temps, au surintendant par requ\u00eate sommaire; mais cet appel n'aura lieu qu'avec l\u2019approbation par \u00e9crit De trois visiteurs autres que les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles de la dite municipalit\u00e9.\"\nLa sentence ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e aux commissaires d'\u00e9cole et ceux-ci s'\u00e9tant refus\u00e9s de s'y conformer, l'appelant a demand\u00e9 et obtenu un bref de mandamus pour les faire contraindre \u00e0 la mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution. Devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l'appelant a eu gain de cause, mais en appel \u00e0 la cour du Bane de la Reine le jugement qu'il avait obtenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 cass\u00e9. C'est de ce dernier jugement qu'il y a appel \u00e0 cette cour. Les moyens oppos\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande du mandamus et donn\u00e9s au soutien du jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine sont les suivants:\n10.

Jos. Noiseux, Ptre Cur\u00e9, O. Desorcy, Ptre Cur\u00e9, et J. A. lorion. M. C. L., comme visiteurs d'\u00e9coles. Les deux premiers sont qualifi\u00e9s pr\u00eatres, tous deux r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Ste-Victoire et l\u2019'honorable J. A. Dorion, comme conseiller l\u00e9gislatif. Il est aussi fait mention de l'approbation de M. B. Lippens, inspecteur d'\u00e9coles, tous d\u00e9clar\u00e9s visiteurs d'\u00e9coles et approuvant la dite requ\u00eate.\nD'apr\u00e8s l'article 1951., S. R. (P.Q.) ss. 2, les pr\u00eatres catholiques sont visiteurs des \u00e9coles de la municipalit\u00e9 o\u00f9 ils r\u00e9sident seulement. Il est en preuve que l'un de ceux qui out sign\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9 la requ\u00eate, le R\u00e9v. M. Desorcy, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la sentence comme \u00e9tant de Ste-Victoire, n'y a jamais r\u00e9sid\u00e9; qu'il est depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es cur\u00e9 de St-Ours paroisse voisine. Evidemment, il n'avait pas la qualit\u00e9 de visiteur pour Ste-Victoire. C'est par erreur que cette qualit\u00e9 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, et le surintendant a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9 sur ce fait de toute importance, par la partie qui y avait int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nLa requ\u00eate ne portant l'approbation que de deux visiteurs le R\u00e9v\u00e9rend M. Noiseux et l'honorable Con- seiller l\u00e9gislatff, J. A. Dorion, se trouvait ill\u00e9gale et ne pouvait conf\u00e9rer aucune juridiction au surintendant, parce que la loi dit positivement que cet appel n'aura lieu qu'avec l'approbation par \u00e9crit de trois visiteurs, etc. etc. Sans l'accomplissement de cette condition, il ne peut pas y avoir d'appel,\u2014il est positivement d\u00e9ni\u00e9.\nEst-ce pour rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9faut de qualification du r\u00e9v\u00e9rend M. Desorcy que la sentence fait aussi mention de l'approbation de M. B. Lippens, inspecteur d'\u00e9coles, qui v est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi comme visiteur d'\u00e9coles. Le nom de M. Lippens n'\u00e9tait pas appos\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et rien ne prouve dans le dossier pourquoi et de quelle mani\u00e8re il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 dans la sentence. Si ce M. Lippens \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 visiteur d'\u00e9coles, son approbation aurait pu remplacer celle du r\u00e9v\u00e9rend Desorcy qui ne l'\u00e9tait pas, et alors la requ\u00eate serait en r\u00e8gle. En vertu de l'article 1953 des Statuts Refondus, P.Q., les inspecteurs d'\u00e9coles sont ex officio visiteurs d'acad\u00e9mies et d'\u00e9coles mod\u00e8les sous le contr\u00f4le des commissaires d'\u00e9coles dans leur district d'inspection Mais il est prouv\u00e9 qu'il n'y en a pas dans la paroisse de Ste-Victoire. Les pouvoirs des inspecteurs sont limit\u00e9s \u00e0 ces institutions. Il ne sont pas visiteurs des \u00e9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires sons le contr\u00f4le des commissaires et, par cons\u00e9quent, M. Lippens n'avait pas la qualit\u00e9 de visiteur pour donner l'approbation voulue. Si cette approbation a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 verbalement tandis que la loi exige qu'elle soit par \u00e9crit Il n'est pas non plus prouv\u00e9 que Ste-Victoire est dans son district d'inspection. La sentence en le qualifiant de visiteur, ne peut lui en donner la qualit\u00e9 ni en faire preuve cont\u00e9e l'article 1953, qui ne donne aux inspecteurs d'\u00e9coles, la qualit\u00e9 de visiteurs d'acad\u00e9mies et d'\u00e9coles mod\u00e8les que dans les limites de leur district d'inspection et nullement dans les \u00e9coles communes. Son approbation est en cons\u00e9quence nulle et d'aucun effet. Comme il ne reste que deux visiteurs qualifi\u00e9s-pour approuver la requ\u00eate, an lieu de trois que la loi exige, cette requ\u00eate \u00e9tait insuffisante pour donner juridiction au surintendant. Sa sentence, pour ce seul motif, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e nulle En cons\u00e9quence, il est inutile de s'occuper des deux autres moyens invoques par les intim\u00e9s.\nLa cause de Tremblay v. Les Commissaires, etc., de St-Valentin ([4]), invoqu\u00e9e par l'appelant, ne s'applique aucunement \u00e0. la cause actuelle. La pr\u00e9tention des commissaires d'\u00e9coles dans cette cause \u00e9tait que s'\u00e9tant soumis \u00e0 la sentence du surintendant en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant l'arrondissement qu'il avait ordonn\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir ils avaient ensuite le pouvoir d'en annuler les effets en r\u00e9unissant de nouveau los arrondissements s\u00e9par\u00e9s Il ne s'agissait l\u00e0 d'aucune informalit\u00e9 ni de d\u00e9faut de juridiction du surintendant apparaissant \u00e0 la face de sa sentence. Il en est tout autrement dans le cas actuel les requ\u00e9rants n'ayant pas accompli la formalit\u00e9 qui donnait juridiction au surintendant, il ne pouvait l\u00e9galement agir.\nEn cons\u00e9quence l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J. The appellant with other interested parties applied by petition to the respondents for the establishment of a new school Upon the rejection of that petition the appellant then appealed to the Superintendent of Education, who granted it, and rendered a decree ordering the respondents to establish the new school demanded. The respondents refusing to submit to the decree of the superintendent the appellant asked for a writ of mandamus to force them to do so. The Superior Court granted the appellant's conclusion but the Court of Appeal Church and Boss\u00e9 JJ. dissenting, reversed that judgment and dismissed the petition. Hence the present appeal. Three objections are urged by the respondents against the decree of the superintendent: 1st. That no notice of the application to him, and of his proceedings, was given to the respondents. 2nd. That under the statute, the superintendent had no power to order the establishment of a new school district. 3rd. That the petition in appeal to the superintendent was not accompanied with the approbation in writing of three school visitors, as required by the statute, as Mr. D\u00e9sorcy, one of those who gave the approbation to the appellant's s petition, was not a school visitor for the locality. The two first points were dismissed at the hearing, and we reserved judgment only upon the third one. This reduces the case to a narrow compass. The proceedings in question originated before the Revised Statutes came into force so that the contestation has to be determined under ch 15 C. S. L. C., as amended and in force in October 1888.\nAt the foot of the petition to the superintendent, the following approbation of three school visitors appears:\u2014\nNous approuvons cette requ\u00eate\n(Sign\u00e9)\nJos. NOISEUX, ptre cur\u00e9.\nVisiteurs.\n\"\nO. DESORCY, ptre cur\u00e9,\n\"\nJ. A. DORION, M. C. L.\nAnd the decree of the superintendent begins with the following recital:\u2014\nVu le Certificat des R\u00e9v\u00e9rends Joseph Noiseux et O. D\u00e9sorcy, pr\u00eatres, tous deux r\u00e9sidants \u00e0 Ste-Victoire, de l'Honorable J. A. Dorion, Conseiller L\u00e9gislatif, et aussi l'approbation de B\u201e Lippens, inspecteur d'\u00e9coles, tous visiteurs d'\u00e9coles et approuvant la dite requ\u00eate.\nThe respondents have proved that Rev. Mr. D\u00e9sorcy was not a resident of the parish of Ste. Victoire, the municipality within which this new school was to be erected, and contend that consequently, under sec. 21, ch. 36, 51-52 Vic, he was not a visitor duly qualified to sign the approbation of the appellant s petition, and it is upon this contention that they obtained the quashing of the mandamus in the Court of Appeal. The appellant contends, however, that, even if the Rev. Mr. D\u00e9sorcy was not qualified to give the required approbation to this petition, yet he had the approbation of three visitors, because it appears by the decree of the superintendent that Lippens, a school inspector, and also a school visitor, as stated in the decree, gave his approbation to it. I think that contention well founded. By sec. 25 of ch. 15 C.S.L.C.:\nEvery document or copy of a document, signed or certified by the Superintendent of Education, shall be prim\u00fb facie evidence of the truth of what is therein stated.\nNow, the superintendent having stated in his decree that Lippens was a school visitor, and there being no plea or evidence to the contrary we must take that fact as conclusively established. The respondent's contention that a school inspector is not a school visitor whether founded in law or not cannot affect this conclusion as it is clear that Lippens may have been a school visitor independently of his position as inspector under sec. 21 ch. 36. 51-52 Vic.\nThe respondent is in error when he says that the decree states that Lippens is a visitor because he is an inspector. The decree merely states that he is both. The respondent further contends that Lippens's approbation should have been in writing. But, assuming this to be required (the English version of sec. 11, 40 Vie. ch. 22 does not require it ) there is no issue on that point between the parties. If the respondents had pleaded that Lippens's approbation was not in writing the appellant would have been called upon to bring evidence of the fact. As the record stands they had not to do so. There is nothing in the decree by which it could be inferred that it was merely a parol approbation. Why should we presume it to have been so ? The presumption is all the other way, and in favour of the regularity of the superintendent's proceedings.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in all the courts against the respondent and restore the judgment of the Superior Court, less the condemnation to $2,000 which it is admitted was illegal.\nPATTERSON J. concurred with Fournier J. that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Germain & Germain.\nSolicitor for respondents : J.

C. afterwards gave to B. & Co. an order on defendant for the balance of the insurance money that would remain after paying his debt to defendant. B. & Co. endorsed the order and delivered it to plaintiff by whom it was presented to defendant, who wrote his name across its face. B. & Co. afterwards delivered to plaintiff a document signed by them, stating that, having been informed that the endorsed order was not negotiable by endorsement, to perfect plaintiff's title and enable him to obtain the money in defendant's hands, they assigned and transferred their interest therein and appointed plaintiff their attorney, in their name, but for his own use and benefit, to collect the same.\nThe defendant having received the amounts due C. on the insurance policies informed plaintiff, on his demanding an account, that there were prior claims that would absorb it all. Plaintiff then filed a bill in equity for an account and payment of the amount found due him to which defendant demurred for want of parties, alleging that the order, though absolute on its face, was, in fact, only given as security, and that an account between B. & Co. and C. being necessary to protect C.'s rights C. was a necessary party to the suit. The demurrer was overruled and the judgment overruling it not appealed from, and the same defence of want, of parties was set up in the answer to the bill.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Strong and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that the question of want of parties was res judicata by the judgment on the demurrer and could not be raised again by the answer. Even if it could the judgment was right as C. was not a necessary party. As between plaintiff and defendant the order was an absolute transfer of the fund to be received by defendant, and was treated by all the parties as a negotiable instrument. Defendant had nothing to do with the equities between C. and B. & Co., or between B. & Co. and plaintiff, but was bound to account to plaintiff in accordance with his undertaking as indicated by the acceptance of the order.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming a decree made by Mr. Justice Fraser sitting as a judge in equity.\nOne Chapman, by instrument under seal dated February 28, 1880, assigned to the appellant, as security for moneys due, his interest in certain policies of insurance on which actions were then pending in Chapman's name. Subsequently Chapman gave an order on defendant in favour of Belyea & Co. to whom he was indebted, in the following words:\u2014\n\"Liverpool, April 23, 1882.\n\"Please hold to the order of Messrs. Belyea & Co., to whom I have assigned it, any balance that remains of insurance money per 'Pretty Jemima' over and above the amount I owe, or may owe you, or to your firm of Carvill, McKean & Co., or Francis Carvill & Son, without making any further advances to me or on my account.\n\"J. H. CHAPMAN.\"\nBelyea & Co., being indebted to the plaintiff Jones, endorsed this order and forwarded it to him, and in May, 1882, it was presented by Jones to defendant who wrote his name across the face of it. Belyea & Co. in October, 1882, delivered to the plaintiff the following document:\u2014\n\"29 Red Cross Street,\n\"Liverpool, 3rd October, 1882.\n\"Hon. Thomas R. Jones:\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014Having endorsed to you the order drawn by J. H. Chapman upon George McKean, Esq., for any balance of insurance moneys in his hands when collected in our favour, we are informed the instrument is not negotiable by endorsement, not being a bill of exchange, and, therefore, in order to perfect your title, and to enable you to obtain the amount that may be in Mr. McKean's hands, we hereby assign and transfer our interest therein, both legal and equitable, and appoint you our attorney, in our names, but for your own use and benefit, to collect the same.\n\"We are, dear sir,\n\"Yours truly,\n\"BELYEA & Co.\"\nThe actions on the policies of insurance were determined in favour of Chapman in 1885 and plaintiff then applied to defendant for an account of the moneys received therefor, and of amount due defendant under the assigment from Chapman. No statement was rendered, but plaintiff was informed that there were prior claims that would absorb all the money. Plaintiff then filed a bill for an account and payment of the amount found due him.\nThe defendant demurred to this bill alleging that C. and also B. & Co. were necessary parties. The demurrer was overruled and the defendant did not appeal from the judgment overruling it, but raised the same defence by his answer. At the hearing a decree was made as prayed in plaintiff's bill, which was affirmed by the full court from whose judgment the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe only question raised by defendant in this appeal is that Chapman is a necessary party to the suit, alleging that the order in favour of Belyea & Co., though absolute on its face, was, in fact, only given as security and an account between Belyea & Co. and Chapman was necessary to protect the rights of Chapman. This involved the subsidiary question: Was the action of McKean, in writing his name across the face of the order to Belyea & Co., such an acceptance of the order as to constitute a binding legal agreement between him and Jones to pay the money due thereunder?\nBlair, Attorney-General for New Brunswick, and Hazen for the appellant. To treat the act of McKean as an acceptance would be to give the order the character of a bill of exchange. The order being a non-negotiable instrument the court can only treat the act of McKean as an acknowledgment that he has received notice of it.\nJones is only in the position of Belyea & Co., and is subject to all the equities which would attach to the order if still in Belyea & Co.'s hands.\nMcKean is not precluded by the judgment on the demurrer from raising this question of want of parties. Though the parties to the suit might be precluded the court is bound, before making a decree, to see that all necessary parties are before it, and could raise the question of its own motion.\nThe following authorities were cited:\nMalcolm v. Scott[1]; Liversidge v. Broadbent[2]; Burn v. Carvalho[3].\nWeldon Q.C. for the respondent referred to In re Central Bank; Morlon and Block's claim[4]; Richer v. Voyer[5]; Griffin v. Weatherby[6].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014There was a demurrer to the bill in this case on the express ground that Chapman was a necessary party. The learned judge decided this question and adjudged that it was not necessary that Chapman should be made a party. This judgment was not appealed from and therefore became, in my opinion, res judicata, and it is not now open to the defendant again to raise the same objection, but if it is I think Chapman was not a necessary party and the court was right in so holding oh the demurrer. It may be that the court might, on appeal, raise the question of the necessity of Chapman being a party, but I cannot think this is a case in which the court would, of its own motion, declare Chapman to be a necessary party because the defendant went into evidence as to the state of accounts between Chapman and Belyea & Co. Counsel for defendant cross-examined Belyea and examined their own witness Chapman. They went into the accounts as if Chapman had been a party to the suit, and the judge found that there was a large balance due from Chapman to Belyea & Co. So that, as affecting the result of this suit, it matters not even if the defendant's main contention is correct, that Jones took the assignment subject to the equities, the evidence shows and the judge finds that Chapman is argely indebted to Belyea & Co., and therefore there are no equities in his favour, although he had been party to the suit.\nNo one who reads the evidence could properly come to any other conclusion.\nBut independently of all this, however the transaction may have been between Chapman and Belyea, as between Belyea, or Jones representing Belyea, and McKean it was an absolute transfer of the fund in McKean's hands or to be received by him.\nThough not a bill of exchange it is obvious that Chapman, Belyea & Co., Jones and McKean all understood it to be so and so treated it; this is evident from the form of Chapman's order, viz.: \"hold\" not to Belyea & Co., but \"to the order of Belyea & Co. to whom I have assigned it,\" showing very clearly, it appears to me, that Chapman intended that Belyea & Co. could use it as a negotiable instrument; and, with reference to Belyea & Co. from the assigment and transfer of the 3rd of October, 1882, in which Belyea & Co. say in reference to the order, \"we are informed the instrument is not negotiable by endorsement not being a bill of exchange, and, therefore, to perfect your title and to enable you to obtain the amount that may be in McKean's hands we hereby assign,\" etc. And I think there can be no reasonable doubt that McKean likewise so understood it; that is, to my mind, apparent when on presentation, as he says in his answer, he accepted the order.\nIn answer to the third paragraph of the plaintiff's bill of complaint I say that somewhere about the month of May, A.D. 1882, said order or writing was presented to me and I thereupon accepted the fame and wrote my name across the face of the said order,\nthereby treating it as a bill of exchange, by which acceptance I think he clearly intended to intimate to the holder that he recognized his rights and would comply with the terms of the order and pay over to him the balance coming or to come to him, that is, after payment of his own claim and that of the estate of S. R. Thomson, which it was agreed by Jones should have priority over his.\nI think, therefore, that Jones, as holder of this order and as assignee of the money in the hands of McKean, was clearly entitled to an account of the moneys which came into his hands; and whatever the equities existing between Chapman and Belyea, or between Belyea and Jones, may be, with these McKean had nothing to do, but was bound to account in accordance with his undertaking as indicated by his acceptance of the order on presentation, leaving Chapman and Belyea & Co., or Belyea & Co. and Jones, to settle, or if need be litigate, any such matter between themselves; and in the meantime I can see no reason why McKean should refuse to account to Jones or retain the money in his hands.\nAs between Jones and McKean a complete decree can be made. The only account sought to be taken is the account between Jones and McKean. By accepting this order, absolute on its face, McKean undertook to account to the holder, and I cannot see why he should seek to encumber this simple suit against himself by requiring the taking of, possibly long and complicated, accounts of transactions between Chapman and Belyea & Co. and Belyea & Co. and Jones, with which he has nothing whatever to do. Should McKean account to Jones and afterwards be troubled by either Chapman or Belyea & Co., his answer is, to my mind, very simple. \"I have accounted to the party to whom you absolutely assigned and transferred the fund at my disposal, and you must look to him and not to me.\"\nIn re Agra and Masterman's Bank; Ex parte Asiatic Banking Corporation[7].\nSir H. M. Cairns L.J.\u2014\nGenerally speaking, a chose in action assignable only in equity must be assigned subject to the equities existing between the original parties to the contract; but this is a rule which must yield when it appears from the nature or terms of the contract that it must have been intended to be assignable free from and unaffected by such equities,\nIn re Northern Assam Tea Company; Ex parte Universal Life Assurance Company[8].\nLord Romilly M.R.\u2014\nThis is a chose in action, and the assignment of a chose in action is taken subject to the equities; but any person may release those equities who is entitled to the benefit of them, and he may do so either positively, by words, or by writing, or by the whole course of his conduct; and the real question in this case is, whether the company have or not released these equities. Upon the whole I have come to the conclusion that the company have released them, and by the course of conduct they have pursued have determined that the holders of these debentures should not take them subject to any of the equities which they had against Higgs.\nIn re Blakely Ordnance Company; Ex parte New Zealand Banking Corporation[9].\nSir John Rolt L.J.\u2014\nIn In re Agra and Masterman's Bank; Ex parte Asiatic Banking Corporation[10] it was held that the rule which makes assignments of choses in action subject to the equities existing between the original parties to the contract, must yield when a contrary intention appears from the nature or terms of the contract. I adopt that decision. I think it applicable, as above explained, to the facts of this case.\nAnd I think it is equally applicable to the case we are now considering.\u2014\nSo again, in Walker v. Rostron[11].\nLord Abinger C.B.\u2014\nThis is a case of a party engaging himself to appropriate the proceeds of the goods according to certain directions of the owner, and appears to us to fall within that class of cases where, when an order has been given to a person who holds goods to appropriate them in a particular manner, and he has engaged to do so, none of the parties are at liberty, without the cousent of all, to alter that arrangement.\nAnd in Griffin v. Weather by[12].\nBlackburn J.\u2014\nThe first question is, whether the circumstances are such as to entitle the plaintiffs to maintain an action against him for money had and received. Ever since the case of Walker v. Rostron (3) it has been considered as settled law, that where a person transfers to a creditor on account of a debt, whether due or not, a fund actually existing or accruing in the hands of a third person, and notifies the transfer to the holder of the fund, although there is no legal obligation on the holder to pay the amount of the debt to the transferee, yet the holder of the fund may, and if he does promise to pay to the transferee, then that which was merely an equitable right becomes a legal right in the transferee, founded on the promise; and the money becomes a fund received or to be received for and payable to the transferee, and when it has been received an action for money had and received to the use of the transferee lies at his suit against the holder.\nIf Chapman or Belyea & Co. have any equities as against Jones I do not think they should be enforced in this suit, but in proceedings to be taken by those parties or either of them against Jones; and this defendant cannot set up claims which, if the finding of the learned judge is correct, so far at any rate as Chapman is concerned, are wholly imaginary as a bar to accounting for the money in or coming into his hands, as his acceptance of Chapman's order clearly indicated he would do. If he accounts to Jones and pays over the balance in his hands as the order directed him to do, and either Chapman or Belyea & Co. think they have an equitable claim against Jones, on proceedings properly taken by one or the other, or both, of those parties against Jones their respective rights will be duly investigated and determined, but with the investigation and determination of those rights I cannot discover that McKean has anything to do. He has nothing to do with the drawer of the order, all he has to do is to transfer the fund he holds in obedience to the directions of the order and assignment of it.\nThis is not the case of McKean having any equities as against the assignor which he seeks to set up against the assignee. As was said in Phipps v. Lovegrove[13] by Sir W. M. James L.J.:\nIt is a rule and principle of this court and of every court, I believe, that where there is a chose in action, whether it is a debt or an obligation, or a trust fund, and it is assigned, the person who holds that debt or obligation, or has undertaken to hold the trust fund, has, as against the assignee, exactly the same equities that he would have as against the assignor. But this is not that case. McKean does not claim to have any equities against Jones or any other person but is attempting to set up an equity in Chapman with which I cannot see that he has anything to do.\nUnder all these circumstances I think the judgment of the court below right and the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is a suit in equity instituted in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick by the respondent against the appellant, and the present appeal is from the order of the Supreme Court in banc pronounced on an appeal from the decree of the primary judge, Mr. Justice Fraser, whereby that decree was affirmed. The judgments of the two courts below are impugned principally on the ground that the suit is defective for want of parties, and this objection must be decided according to the established rules of equity pleading. The facts disclosed by the pleadings and evidence are as follows:\nJoseph H. Chapman being interested in the proceeds of two policies of insurance effected on his shares in the barque \"Pretty Jemima,\" which vessel had been lost, and being indebted to the appellant, on the 28th of February, 1880, by instrument under seal of that date assigned his interest in the policies mentioned by way of mortgage to the appellant as security for his debt.\nOn the 28th of April, 1882, Chapman being then indebted to Belyea & Co. made a further and second mortgage of the same fund to that firm as security for the debt then due as well as for what might thereafter become due to them. This security to Belyea & Co. was effected by an order addressed to the appellant, and on its presentation the appellant wrote his name across the face of the document in the manner usual in accepting a bill of exchange. On the 3rd of October, 1882, Belyea & Co., being indebted to the respondent, made a derivative or submortgage of their security to him by an order or assignment bearing the last mentioned date. The respondent filed his bill to enforce his rights under the assigment to him and made the appellant the sole party defendant to the suit.\nIt was objected in the court below that both Chapman and the assignees of Belyea & Co. (who have since the assigment to the respondent become bankrupt) were necessary parties to the suit.\nI am of opinion that these objections are insurmountable and ought to have prevailed. There can be no doubt or question that all the assignments were merely by way of security and were none of them intended to be absolute. This appears beyond dispute from the evidence in the cause. The right of the respondent is, therefore, to be paid out of the residue of the fund remaining after the satisfaction of the debt due by Chapman to the appellant so much of the debt which may be found due by Chapman to Belyea & Co. as may be requisite to satisfy the debt due to the respondent himself from Belyea & Co. as security for which the sub-mortgage to the respondent was created by Belyea & Co. The respondent's rights must, beyond question, be restricted to this, for upon the facts in evidence it is impossible that in a court of equity either the respondent or Belyea & Co. can be regarded as absolute assignees of the fund or otherwise than as mere mortgagees; and the respondent's rights being merely derivative from and subordinate to those of Belyea & Co. any ultimate residue which may remain after satisfying the debt due to the latter firm by Chapman belongs to Chapman and must be paid to him, even though the debt due to the respondent by Belyea & Co. should exceed the amount of such residue.\nIt is obvious that the decree to be made upon such a state of facts must be framed upon the same principles, although it may differ in some details, as that which a court of equity would make in the case of two successive mortgages of land where the suit was instituted for foreclosure and sale by a sub-mortgagee deriving his security from the second mortgagee. Any differences between the two cases arise merely from the accident that in the latter case the fund would have to be realised by a sale of the security, whereas in the present case the subject of the successive mortgages is money, a fund already realised.\nThen it is obvious that the decree must of necessity involve the taking of three accounts. First an account of what is due to the first mortgagee, the appellant; secondly an account of what is due to the second mortgagee, Belyea & Co.; and thirdly an acccount of which is due to the respondent, the sub-mortgagee of Belyea & Co., by the latter. It is true that this latter account in no way concerns Chapman the mortgagor, and may be waived by the assignees of Belyea & Co. if they should admit that their debt to the respondent exceeds the residue of the insurance money remaining after satisfying the debt of the appellant. Then the indispensable parties to the taking of the first account, that between the mortgagor and the first mortgagees, are first Chapman the mortgagor, and the appellant the first mortgagee, next the assignees in bankruptcy, representing the second mortgagees, Belyea & Co., who are of course entitled to be present to see that the claim of the first mortgagee is kept within proper limits, and lastly the respondent. If Belyea & Co.'s representatives were parties and were to make the admission before mentioned, namely, that the amount due to the respondent by Belyea & Co. was in excess of any amount which he could receive from the fund, their presence might be dispensed with, but they are not parties and have made no such admission. Therefore, for the purpose of taking this first account, both Chapman and Belyea & Co. are necessary and indispensable parties.\nThen for the purposes of taking the second account, that of the amount due by Chapman the mortgagor to Belyea & Co. the second mortgagees, the former and the assignees of the latter are clearly necessary parties and on no principle that can be suggested can their presence be dispensed with.\nIt therefore appears plain that the suit is defective for want of parties, and that in order to remedy the imperfection in its constitution an order should have been pronounced at the hearing directing an amendment for the purpose of bringing the absent parties before the court.\nIt was contended on the argument of the appeal that inasmuch as the assignment by Chapman to Belyea & Co. was absolute in form, and as the appellant had accepted the order by which that assignment was effected, the suit might be regarded as one for enforcing an absolute equitable assignment of a debt. But it appears that there are two insurmountable objections to this. First, it would be impossible, in the face of the evidence which clearly establishes that the assignment to Belyea & Co. was by way of security merely, for a court of equity to give effect to the transaction according to its form disregarding the substance, and to derogate from the rights of Chapman to have the assignment to Belyea & Co. treated as, what in reality it was, a mere mortgage. This would clearly be the right of Chapman as against Belyea & Co. and the respondent, as assignee of a chose in action, can have no larger measure of right than his assignors Belyea & Co.\nNext, if the assignment to Belyea & Co. was to be treated as an absolute equitable assignment, which the respondent in turn claiming under an absolute assignment from them was entitled to enforce, there would be no ground for suing in equity; the remedy would, in that case, be at law by an action in the names of Belyea & Co. or their assignees, for it is well established that the assignee of a chose in action can thus sue, and that he cannot maintain a bill in equity in his own name merely by reason of the assignment. The doctrine of Mr. Justice Story to the contrary[14], referred to in the judgments delivered in the court below, is not a correct statement of the law upon this head as appears from the case of Hammond v. Messenger[15], where this point arose and was decided by Vice Chancellor Shadwell, who held that the assignee of a chose in action had no right, by reason merely of his title being equitable, to sue in his own name in equity, and that in order to enable him to do so it was essential that it should appear that the assignor refused to allow his name to be used in an action at law, or that some other difficulty to his suing at law had been interposed. And in a recent case in Massachusetts, Walker v. Brooks[16], in which all the authorities are reviewed, the decision in Hammond v. Messenger (2) was followed as \"being amply sustained by earlier authorities in England and in this country\" and the position of Mr. Justice Story was denied to be law[17]. Therefore it would be impossible to give relief on the principle contended for inasmuch as it would unjustly prejudice the rights of absent parties, or at least of an absent party (Chapman the mortgagor), and also because so to treat the case would be to make the bill open to demurrer for want of equity.\nIf there was any procedure in New Brunswick which entitled a plaintiff in a suit in equity to bring parties who were interested in the account merely, and not in any other matters embraced in the suit, into the master's office without making them parties to the bill, a practice which prevails in some jurisdictions where law and equity are still kept separate, the defect in the suit as regards the assignees of Belyea & Co. might possibly be remedied by adopting such a course, but we have not been referred to any authority for such a mode of proceeding. As regards Chapman the mortgagor, however, he is an indispensable party to the bill.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the decree pronounced in the court below discharged, and for it there should be substituted an order that the cause stand over with liberty to the plaintiff to amend by adding parties, and as the pleadings are very diffuse, and are otherwise not in a very satisfactory state, liberty to amend generally may well be added to this. The respondent must pay the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and also the costs of the day (i. e. the costs of the hearing only, not the general costs of the cause) before the primary judge in equity.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the reasons advanced by the Chief Justice for dismissing this appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given in the court appealed from. It would seem that, practically, this is an appeal only for costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Chapman having a claim on some policies of marine insurance which was in litigation in 1880, and which was not recovered until 1885, assigned the claim in 1880 to the appellant McKean as security for certain debts and liabilities. McKean received the insurance money in 1885, and after satisfying all his claims upon it a considerable sum remained in his hands. That sum would, of course, revert to Chapman, but Chapman had, in 1882, given to Belyea & Co. the following order which referred to the money in question:\u2014\nLIVERPOOL, 28th April, 1882.\nPlease hold to the order of Messrs. Belyea & Co., to whom I have assigned it, any balance that remains of insurance money pro \"Pretty Jemima,\" over and above the amount I owe or may owe to you or to your firm of Carvill, McKean & Co. or Francis Carvill & Son, without making any further advances to me, or on my account.\n(Sgd.) J. H. CHAPMAN.\nTo George McKean, Esq., Saint John.\nThat order was, about May, 1882, presented to the appellant who wrote his name across it by way of accepting the order. Later in the year 1882 Belyea & Co., by writing, assigned the order so accepted to the respondent on account of money which they owed him. It was not taken as payment of any specified sum but as thus explained by himself at the trial:\nThis was taken by you as a security for an indebtedness?\nFor an indebtedness. I was to place it to his credit when collected. We had a running account between us and I was to credit whatever I got out of it when paid. It was passed over to me as an asset.\nChapman had given the order to Belyea & Co. as collateral security for transactions on which they held other securities, and Chapman alleges that they have been fully paid and that they have no right to any part of the fund in the hands of the appellant. He gave notice to that effect to the appellant, forbidding him to pay over any of the money on the Belyea order. The appellant accordingly refused to pay the money to the respondent, who thereupon brought this suit in equity against the appellant praying that\nAn account may be taken of said claims and charges on the said fund prior to the said plaintiff's. And that the said defendant George McKean may be restrained by the injunction and order of this honour, able court from applying or paying out, or causing to be received or paid out, any part of the said fund contrary to the terms of the said assignment and orders, and that such amount as may be found in the hands of the said defendant after payment of such prior claims may be ordered to be paid to the plaintiff, and also that the plaintiff may have such other relief in the premises as to this honourable court may seem meet.\nThe dispute is really between Chapman and the respondent, each claiming the fund from the appellant who is merely stake-holder and who has no direct interest in the quarrel. But Chapman is not a party to the action and the main question is whether or not it is necessary to make him a party,\nThat question was raised by demurrer in the court below and was decided against the appellant. That decision was, however, on pleadings which did not disclose the fact that the order given by Chapman to Belyea & Co. was not an absolute assignment of the fund. That fact and Chapman's contention that his debt to Belyea & Co. had been satisfied appeared by the answer and the evidence, entered into the contest at the trial, and were dealt with in the judgments now in review; they come properly before us in this appeal notwithstanding that the appellant did not appeal from the judgment on the demurrer, even if that judgment, which was not a final judgment in the action, could have been made the subject of appeal to this court.\nChapman's claim for the insurance money was a chose in action assignable only in equity and not at law. Therefore under the well established and familiar rule of equity Belyea & Co. took the order on the appellant subject to Chapman's right to recall it in case the debt as security for which he gave the order was otherwise satisfied. The rule will be found stated and illustrated by decisions, to which we have been referred on the argument, in Pollock on Contracts[18], and in Lewin on Trusts[19].\nBelyea & Co. could not transfer to the respondent any better right than they had themselves unless that effect followed from the direction to the appellant to pay the money to the order of Belyea & Co., which apparently indicated an intention that the document should be negotiable, and might, in case the other incidents essential to the creation of an estoppel concurred, estop Chapman from disputing its negotiability.\nThe order could not be treated as equivalent to a bill of exchange, like the deposit receipts discussed by the Chancellor of Ontario in the case Re Central Bank[20] to which one of the learned judges in the court below refers, or like the order in question in Griffin v. Weatherby (3). The uncertainty of the amount is an insuperable obstacle to that view. Nor does the principle on which Walker v. Rostron[21] was decided, and which is affirmed in Griffin v. Weatherby[22], apply to the case. Those cases, on which some stress was laid in the court below, decide that an order to pay money, either money on hand or money yet to be received, constitutes, when accepted, an appropriation of the money which is binding on the giver and the acceptor of the order, and that an action at law for money received to the use of the payee of the order will lie against the acceptor of it.\nThey do not decide that either the giving of the order or the acceptance of it precludes the giver from resisting the payment of the money on any valid ground of law or equity, though it is true that such an order, absolute on its face and accepted without expressed qualification, might be difficult to resist in the hands of one who took it for value and without notice of any equities affecting it. That is the position which the present respondent asserts for himself. He says, and he has given evidence to prove, that he took the accepted order from Belyea & Co. without notice that it was not absolute as between them and Chapman. They did not assume to transfer it to him as a negotiable instrument. They understood that it was not so, and they correctly informed the respondent by their letter of the third of October, 1882, which formally authorised him to collect the money in their names but for his own use.\n29 Red Cross Street,\nLiverpool, 3rd Oct., 1882.\nHon. Thomas R. Jones:\nDear Sir,\u2014Having endorsed to you the order drawn by J. H. Chapman upon George McKean, Esq., for any balance of insurance moneys in his hands when collected in our favour, we are informed the instrument is not negotiable by endorsement, not being a bill of exchange, and therefore in order to perfect your title, and to enable you to obtain the amount that may be in Mr. McKean's hands, we hereby assign and transfer our interest therein both legal and equitable, and appoint you our attorney in our names but for your own use and benefit to collect the same.\nWe are, dear sir,\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) Belyea & Co.\nBut when the respondent insists that he occupies a stronger position than his immediate assignors his case is, in my opinion, fatally weak in the fundamental requisite of his being a holder for value. I have already quoted a question and answer from his cross-examination. He was re-examined by his own counsel and this is the whole of the re-examination as reported to us: \u2014\nYou say that Belyea owed you, and he gave it to you to collect and to credit him? Yes.\nSince then he failed and you got nothing, and you did not prove against the estate? No. I did not prove against the estate at all.\nThe Belyea failure and the prudence of the respondent in not going to the expense of proving against the estate are not said to have any connection with the Chapman order. The respondent gave nothing and gave up nothing for the order. The change of position by reason of reliance on the order or on any representation conveyed by it, which lies at the foundation of the doctrine of estoppel, is entirely absent.\nI do not question the proposition that taking on account of an existing debt is a taking for value as well as purchasing by a payment of money, nor do I assert that, in the case of an existing debt, the value must necessarily consist in the satisfaction of any part of the debt, or that it may not take another form, as e. g. suspension or forbearance of proceedings, but here I do not find value in any shape.\nIf the respondent were properly held to have taken for value it might not follow, as of course, that he would have a right to the whole fund. The relief to which he was entitled would be adjudged upon equitable principles, and might be found to be not more extensive than a return of the value he gave. That was held to be the proper measure of relief in re Romford Canal Co.[23], which is one of the cases noticed by the Chancellor in the Central Bank Case[24] already referred to.\nIn my opinion the respondent stands merely in the shoes of Belyea & Co. and holds subject to the state of their accounts with Chapman, who is, therefore, a necessary party to this action.\nI do not overlook the fact that the learned judge at the trial held, after hearing the evidence of both Mr. Belyea and Mr. Chapman, that the latter still owed as much money as the balance in the hands of the appellant, and that the court in banc declined to disturb that finding. Whether or not it may be considered necessary to take further evidence on those accounts I cannot assume to say, but the decision is not binding on Chapman, who is not a party, as against the appellant.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the case sent back in order that Chapman may be made a party to the record.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Gilbert & Straton.\nSolicitors for respondent: Weldon & McLean.\n[1] 5 Ex. 610.\n[2] 4 H. & N. 603.\n[3] 4 My. & C. 702.\n[4] 17 O.R. 574.\n[5] L.R. 5 P.C. 461.\n[6] L.R. 3 Q.B. 758.\n[7] 2 Ch.

In 1866 that bank transferred all its assets to trustees for the purpose of having them realized and the proceeds distributed pro rat\u00e2 among its creditors. In 1867, after confederation, the Dominion Parliament passed an act ratifying this assignment and creating the trustees a corporation with power to carry on the business of the bank, so far as was necessary to wind it up. In 1870 another Dominion act was passed transferring the bank assets to the Dominion Government as trustee to wind it up. In 1877 the land in question was sold to the defendant Anderson, who gave a mortgage for part of the purchase money and covenanted to pay the taxes.\nIn 1886 the land was sold for taxes, Anderson having allowed them to fall into arrear. The defendant Cutten became the purchaser at the tax sale and the defendant Quirt, at Anderson\u2019s instance, purchased the land from Cutten and afterwards transferred it to Anderson\u2019s wife. The crown brought a suit to have these conveyances set aside and to have it declared that the land was still vested in the crown and that the Anderson mortgage remained a charge upon it. The defendant Cutten did not appear to defend the suit; the other defendants entered an appearance and defence.\nAt the trial the conveyances were set aside on the ground that the land being property of the crown was exempt from taxation, and the tax sale was, therefore, void. The Divisional Court held that the tax sale was not void but that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage had priority over the other conveyances, and decided in favour of the crown on that ground. The case was then taken to the Court of Appeal where the judges were equally divided and the judgment of the Divisional Court was sustained. Two of their lordships in the Court of Appeal held the Dominion acts above referred to ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBain Q.C. for the appellants. The acts of 1867 and 1870, or, at all events, the latter, were ultra vires. They are not acts dealing with banking or the incorporation of banks. The bank of Upper Canada had ceased to exist as a bank when these acts were passed, and they simply dealt with the bank property which was held by the trustees under the assignment in 1866 as in the case of any other trust for creditors.\nAt all events the act of 1870 is ultra vires. The trustees were not made a banking corporation by the act of 1867 but were only to carry on the business for winding-up the bank, so the act of 1870 did not deal with a banking corporation.\nNor are the acts valid as dealing with bankruptcy and insolvency. The power given to the Dominion Parliament is only to make general laws on these subjects. L\u2019Union St. Jacques v. B\u00e9lisle[3].\nThe learned counsel also referred to the following cases on this point: Municipality of Cleveland v. Municipality of Melbourne[4]; Colonial Building & Investment Assoc. v. Attorney General of Quebec[5]; Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[6]. If the property was vested in the crown under these acts it is still liable to taxation. The property exempt is that in which the crown has the beneficial interest and not property held in trust as this was. The Ontario Assessment Act[7] exempts property of the Dominion held in trust for Indians; that shows that no other trust property is exempt. Expressio unius exclusio est alterius.\nGamble for the respondents. The Dominion acts are intra vires. The power to pass such acts must exist somewhere and if not expressly given to the provinces it must be in the Federal Parliament. Valin v. Langlois[8]; Leprohon v. City of Ottawa[9]; Lambe v. Bank of Toronto[10].\nThe courts will not presume that Parliament has exceeded its powers but will strive to uphold the validity of the act rather than to avoid it. Edgar v. Central Bank[11]; Valin v. Langlois[12].\nSee also Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons6; McArthur v. Northern Junction Railway Co.[13]; Cushing v. Dupuy[14]\nThe defendant Anderson conveyed the land in fee to the crown by his mortgage and is estopped from denying the plaintiff\u2019s title. Doe d. Hennesy v. Meyers[15].\nIf the acts were intra vires the land was vested in the crown and could not be sold for taxes. B.N.A. Act sec. 125. Leprohon v. City of Ottawa[16].\nThe exemption extends to lands held by the crown in trust. Reg. v. Williams[17]; The Queen v. Guinness[18]. The mention of lands held in trust for the Indians does not exclude other trusts. The maxim expressio unius exclusio est alterius is not of universal application; Saunders v. Evans[19].\nThe expression \u201clands held by the crown in trust for Indians\u201d does not denote a real trust. See Church v. Fenton[20].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I cannot see how it can be contended that an act for the settlement of the affairs of the Bank of Upper Canada, an insolvent institution, is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, to which body is confided the exclusive authority to deal with and legislate on banking, incorporation of banks, and bankruptcy and insolvency. If this is so, I think it equally clear that the legislature of Ontario could pass no act repealing, altering or interfering with the provisions of that act, and so could not have passed an act similar in its terms to the 33 Vic. ch. 40, \u201can act to vest in the Dominion for the purposes therein mentioned the property and powers now vested in the trustees of the Bank of Upper Canada.\u201d\nTherefore it necessarily follows that the legislative power to do so belongs to the Dominion Parliament alone.\nI think the contention that the lands, though vested in the crown, were subject to taxation is equally untenable, and that the express exemption by R.S.O. (1887) ch. 193 sec. 7 ss. 1, of all property vested or held by Her Majesty or vested in any public body, body corporate, officer or person in trust for Her Majesty, or for the public uses of the crown, is too clear to be got over, and is in no way affected or controlled by the exemption of lands vested in Her Majesty in trust for the Indians. I think, as suggested by Mr. Justice Street, that this is borne out by sec. 137, which enacts \u201cthat the taxes assessed on any land shall be a special lien on such land having preference over any claim, lien, privilege, or incumbrance of any party except the crown.\nI therefore think the enactment by the Dominion Parliament intra vires of that body, and the interest of the crown being exempt from taxation this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This appeal, which was very ably argued at the bar, raises two important questions. The first of these involves the validity of the legislation of the Dominion Parliament relating to the winding up of the affairs and the distribution of the assets of the late Bank of Upper Canada, embodied in the statutes of 1867 and 1870. The second question relates to the scope and construction of the provision in the Ontario Assessment Act, exempting lands and property of the crown from taxation. If the judgment of the court below deciding these two questions in favour of the crown is upheld the other points raised become immaterial and need not be considered.\nThe first section of the act of 1870 vests all the assets of the bank in the crown, and the second section confers upon the Governor General in Council the same powers of dealing with and realizing these assets as the assignees under the prior act of 1867 had possessed. Therefore, unless it can be demonstrated that this legislation was ultra vires of the parliament of the Dominion, the crown had full power to sell the lands in question to Anderson and to take as security for the purchase money the mortgage which it is the object of the present action to enforce.\nI am of opinion that the statutes of 1867 and 1870 were in all respects intra vires, and that for the reasons principally relied on by Mr. Justice Street in delivering the judgment of the Divisional Court, and by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal. I rest this opinion, however, exclusively upon the 21st enumeration of section 91 of the British North America Act, and in no way upon the 15th which I do not consider applicable.\nThe 21st subsection gives to parliament the exclusive power to pass laws relating to bankruptcy and insolvency. That the acts of parliament in question come within the literal meaning of these terms appears to me very plain. The bank was insolvent, and the realization and distribution of its assets was a matter consequent upon that insolvency. The only reasonable ground upon which such enactments as these under consideration could be rejected from the category of bankruptcy and insolvency statutes authorized by section 91, subsection 21, would be that they were special and not general laws, and therefore were to be considered as assigned to the provincial legislature under the 16th clause of section 91, which authorizes legislation on matters of a local and private nature within the province. The answer to this, however, is that any matter which comes within the terms of any of the subjects enumerated in section 91, although in other respects it might be classed under the head of local and private legislation, is expressly excepted from the powers of the provincial legislatures by the last clause of section 91, which enacts that \u201cany matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\u201d\nThen, it is said that this class of legislation is appro- priated to the provinces under the head of property and civil rights. This argument, however, would prove too much since general legislation in matters of bankruptcy and insolvency, which subsection 21 undoubtedly confers on the Dominion, must always be an interference with property.\nThen, it can hardly be said that such special legislation as this, respecting a bank incorporated under the statutes of the Dominion, would be within the competence of a provincial legislature; the incongruity of such a construction, when we consider that the right to incorporate banks is exclusively in the Dominion, would alone be fatal to such contention, more especially as the act of incorporation itself might well provide for the winding-up of a particular bank in case of insolvency.\nIf the special legislation regarding insolvency is intra vires of the Dominion in the case of a new bank, it is hard to see why it should not be so in the present case of a bank incorporated and reduced to insolvency before confederation. Any distinction between the two cases would be purely arbitrary.\nOn the whole it seems to me that whilst there is no power in the provinces to which these enactments could be reasonably referred the Dominion Parliament does, according to the literal interpretation of the terms used, possess a power which includes them. For these and other reasons, in which I concur, set forth in the opinions of the learned judges whose views prevailed in the courts below it seems to me that this first objection to the judgment under review entirely fails.\nAs regards authority, I am of opinion that the case in the Privy Council of Union St. Jacques v. B\u00e9lisle[21], so far from being an authority for the appellant, supports the conclusion I have reached. The act of the Quebec legislature questioned in that case was held to be intra vires upon the distinction expressly taken in the judgment that it was not an act providing for a winding up as in the case of bankruptcy or insolvency, but was rather an enactment designed for the purpose of avoiding such a result. I therefore consider the Privy Council as indicating that a special statute providing for the winding-up of an incorporated company would be bankruptcy or insolvency legislation.\nNext it is said that the interest vested in the crown under the mortgage made by Anderson is liable to taxation under the Ontario Assessment Act. I agree, however, with Mr. Justice Osler, in whose judgment on this point the learned chief justice concurred, that it is not so liable. All property vested in the crown is exempted from taxation unless made liable by some express enactment. No statute can be pointed to making the beneficial interest which the crown as mortgagees undoubtedly had in these lands liable to assessment for taxes, and that is sufficient to dispose of the case. I am also of opinion that in the absence of express enactment no difference ought to be made between property vested in the crown as a trustee, and that in which it had a beneficial interest. The crown is entitled to the prerogative of priority of payment out of assets, even though it sues as a mere trustee, as in the case of an action on a recognisance given for the benefit of subjects, and I reason why the analogy should not prevail in the present case. However, the crown is far from being a mere trustee in this case. The statute of 1870 recites that it is the largest creditor; it therefore has a beneficial interest in the assets of the bank. As I have said, in the absence of express enactment to the contrary property vested in the crown would not be taxable, and it is, therefore, rather for the appellants to show that the property of the crown is made liable to assessment than for the respondent to show the contrary.\nThe argument founded on the provision relating to Indian lands is well answered by Mr. Justice Osler, whose reasoning appears to me conclusive. The rights of the crown as regards Indian lands are of such an anomalous and peculiar nature, and so different from a right of property either as a fiduciary or beneficial owner, that it would be carrying the argument expressio unius est exclusio alterius to an altogether unwarrantable length to hold that ordinary trust property vested in the crown was made liable to taxation by a mere inference derived from this exception.\nI am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Patterson in his judgment.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I have no doubt whatever that the Dominion Parliament had jurisdiction to pass these acts.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014When the British North America Act, 1867, took effect the Bank of Upper Canada had forfeited its charter and all its privileges. That was the result of a provision contained in the act of the province of Canada[22] under which the bank had, from the first of January, 1857, held its corporate powers. By the 33rd section of that act a suspension of specie payments, if it extended to sixty days, operated as a forfeiture of the charter and of all and every the privileges granted to the bank by that or any other act. Specie payments were suspended on the 18th of September, 1866, and were not resumed. During the sixty days, and therefore while the powers of the bank continued, the bank made an assignment to five trustees of all its property upon trusts declared in the deed.\nAt the first session of the Dominion Parliament an act was passed[23] which confirmed the assignment, which is set out in a schedule, and declared it valid from the day of the date thereof; incorporated the trustees by the name of the Trustees of the Bank of Upper Canada; added certain special provisions to the provisions of the deed of assignment; and provided a shorter form for the registration of the deed of assignment in the counties where lands of the bank lay, in place of registering it in full as the registry law of Ontario required. The act contained also the declaration, the validity of which is questioned, that the trustees as a corporation should have, hold and possess all the properties, estate and effects, real and personal, of the Bank of Upper Canada.\nThen in 1870 another act[24] declared that all the assets, &c., held by the trustees of the Bank of Upper Canada under the former act or acquired by them since the passing of that act should be and were thereby transferred to and vested in Her Majesty for the Dominion of Canada and the purposes of the act.\nThe transfer of real estate in the province from one person to another obviously falls within the subject of Property and Civil Rights in the province, which by section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, is assigned to the exclusive legislative authority of the province. The acts are therefore invalid unless the subject falls also within one of the enumerated classes in section 91. It is argued that it falls within article 15, Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the issue of Paper Money; or within article 21, Bankruptcy and Insolvency; or within both of those articles.\nIn the Divisional Court[25] the decision in favour of the validity of the acts was rested on article 21. In the Court of Appeal[26], two of the learned judges considered that both articles applied, or rather, if I correctly understand the opinions expressed, that either article 15 or article 21 was sufficient; while two judges held the acts to be ultra vires.\nIt is remarked by one of the learned judges who held the acts to be valid that the defendants, when before the Court of Appeal, confined their attack to the act of 1870, but the act of 1867 was, in his opinion, material to be considered as showing the character of the legislation. I also am of opinion that the act of 1867 cannot be left out of the discussion. It is in reality upon that act that the objection is founded, because the act of 1870 purports to vest in Her Majesty whatever the act of 1867 vested in the corporate body called the Trustees of the Bank of Upper Canada, and therefore unless the earlier act was valid the later one had nothing to operate on.\nI am unconvinced by the arguments advanced to bring the legislation within article 15. The trustees were not carrying on the business of banking, they were merely administering the assets of an insolvent bank whose powers were forfeited. The incorporation of the trustees was not the incorporation of a bank. And I do not consider that the legislative authority to make laws on the subject of banking or to incorporate banks so far overrides the power conferred expressly upon the provinces to make laws in relation to pro- perty and civil rights in the province as to carry with it the power to establish a mode of dealing with real estate when a bank is concerned, or for that matter with chattel property either, differing from the provincial system. There is no incident of banking that requires that business to be put on a different footing in this particular from any other business. The judgment of the Judicial Committee in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[27], delivered by Lord Hobhouse, may be usefully referred to as an exposition of the extent of this word \u201cbanking\u201d in article 15.\nI entirely agree with Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Maclennan in what they said in the Court of Appeal on the subject of article 15.\nI cannot, however, adopt their conclusion respecting article 21. The words bankruptcy and insolvency in that article no doubt point primarily to the enactment of a general bankrupt or insolvent law, as was well explained by Lord Selborne in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in L\u2019Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. B\u00e9lisle[28]; but, as I think is conceded by the same judgment, a special act for the winding-up of some particular company which was insolvent, and the distribution of its assets, would not be beyond the competency of the Dominion Parliament,, It is at least doubtful if a provincial legislature could pass an act of the kind without transgressing the limits of its authority, but that point does not now require to be definitely decided. It is easy to imagine cases arising in connection with bankruptcy proceedings under a general law where special legislation would be required, such for instance as the necessity for curing some irregularity so as to validate or remove doubts as to titles taken under the proceedings. There must be power to do this in one legislature or the other, and I take it to be obvious that the power would be in the Dominion legislature alone. Such legislation would be, like that now under consideration, special legislation addressed to an individual case, but it would not on that account be ultra vires. That seems to have been the view of the provincial legislature when, at its first session, which was early in 1868, in passing a registry act for the province[29] it made an exceptional provision for the registration of the assignment, declaring that:\u2014\nIt shall not be necessary to register in full the deed of assignment from the Bank of Upper Canada to Thomas C. Street, &c., bearing date the 12th day of November, A.D. 1866, and confirmed by the act of the Parliament of Canada passed in the 31st year of Her Majesty\u2019s reign, chapter 17, which shall be deemed validly registered in any county or city, if registered in the manner provided in and by the said act, or by a declaration under the corporate seal of the trustees of the Bank of Upper Canada in the form following:\nThe forms given in both acts contain the express statement that the lands are held by the trustees as a corporation under the Dominion act.\nPurchasers of lands from the trustees in the interval between March, 1868, when the Provincial Registry Act became law, and May, 1870, when the unsold lands were vested in the crown, took their titles on the faith of this provincial recognition of the validity of the Dominion Act of 1867 thus recorded for their information in the registry books.\nIt is going very far to ask the courts to say at this distance of time that the legislatures were both mistaken and that the title remained in Mr. Street and the four other gentlemen associated with him as grantees under the deed of assignment.\nNow holding, as I think it is imperative upon us to hold, that it was within the authority of the Dominion Parliament to legislate in relation to the winding-up of the affairs of this insolvent bank, whose powers had been forfeited although the corporation was not extinct,\u2014Brooke v. Bank of Upper Canada[30]\u2014we virtually decide the whole controversy.\nThe right to legislate concerning bankruptcy and insolvency includes the power to make a statutory conveyance of the estate to the person charged with the administration of it. That is so in every system which the parliament may be supposed to have had in view in passing the act of 1867[31]. It was so under the Insolvent Act of 1864 which was then in force in Ontario and Quebec. It was so under the Insolvent Acts of 1869 and 1875 subsequently passed by the Dominion Parliament. It was not under any misapprehension in this particular that the provincial parliament recognised the title of the corporate trustees.\nThe act of 1870 must be judged on the same principle as the act of 1867. It altered in some respects the scheme of the earlier act for the winding-up of the affairs of the bank, but it still had that purpose in view. It is described in the title of another act to which I am about to allude, as \u201crespecting the settlement of the affairs of the Bank of Upper Canada.\u201d The administration of the estate was taken from the trustees and committed to the Governor in Council, and the estate itself was vested in Her Majesty, which measure was followed in the next year[32] by the appropriation of $250,000 to pay off claims on the bank in anticipation of the realisation of the assets. It is not for us to criticise the mode in which the legislature exercises its powers, and once we reach the conclusion that the authority to make laws in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency brought the affairs of the bank, or, more properly, the winding-up of those affairs, within the scope of that authority, there no longer remains any reason for denying the validity of the statutory conveyance.\nOn the question of the liability of the lands vested in Her Majesty to taxation I have nothing new to advance. I see no tenable ground for distinguishing them from crown lands in general.\nI agree that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Bain, Laidlaw & Co.\nSolicitors for respondent: C. & H.D.

S. C. ch. 9, sec. 10.\nHeld, that leaving a copy of an election petition and accompanying documents at the residence of the respondent with an adult member of his household during the five days after the presentation of the same is a sufficient service under sec. 10 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act even though the papers served do not come into the possession or within the knowledge of the respondent. [See now 54-55 Vic. ch. 20, sec. 8.]\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia overruling and dismissing the preliminary objections of the said appellant, Frederick W. Borden, the respondent in the court below to the petition against the election of the said Frederick W. Borden presented by the said respondent, David Berteaux, at the office of the clerk of the court at Halifax, on the twentieth day of April, A.D. 1891.\nA number of objections were taken in the said preliminary objections, but these have been confined by notice pursuant to subsection 3 of sec. 51, chapter 9 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, to certain questions. The present appeal was decided upon the fourth question submitted, which is as follows:\nFourthly\u2014Did the act of leaving a copy of the said petition and accompanying documents at the domicile of the said Frederick W. Borden at Canning in the said County of King's with the wife of the said Frederick W. Borden during the five days after the presentation of the same or within the term of the service of the said petition as extended by the order of Mr. Justice Meagher without the said copy of petition or papers coming to the possession or knowledge of the said Frederick W. Borden constitute a service of the said petition and accompanying documents so as to authorize further proceedings thereon?\nThe petitioner resides at Somerset in the County of King's. The sitting member (appellant) resides at Canning in said County of King's. The petition was filed at Halifax on the 20th April, 1891.\nOn the 25th April the petitioner obtained an order extending the time for serving the petition.\nOn the 30th April an order was made by Mr. Justice Graham to serve the petition on the appellant at Ottawa.\nThe petition and receipts, notice of its presentation, and the orders extending the time for service and directing service upon the respondent at Ottawa, were served upon the said respondent at Ottawa. The said petition and accompanying papers were served at the domicile of the said respondent, at Canning in the County of King's, within five days after the presentation of the petition, and again within the extended time for effecting service of the same.\nRoscoe for appellant:\nAs to the fourth question, there is no evidence that the appellant ever saw or heard of the papers that were left at his residence. Section 11 of the act provides for the same manner of service\u2014personal service\u2014of the petition and papers as in civil matters or in such other manner as prescribed.\nIn the province of Nova Scotia there is but one way of serving process without the intervention of the court in civil cases, namely, actual personal service. It has never been prescribed that service might be made by leaving the papers at the respondent's domicile. There is nothing in section 11 or in any rule or manner prescribed which would warrant such a method of service.\nIt has been contended, however, that by inference drawn from the latter part of section 10, service might be made by leaving the petition and papers at the respondent's domicile. If this be so then sections 10 and 11 are inconsistent, and in that case the provisions of section 11 must prevail. Wood v. Riley[1].\nBut the meaning of the latter part of section 10 as applied to the province of Nova Scotia is not that service may be made by leaving the petition and papers at the domicile of the respondent. In the province of Quebec service of ordinary civil process may be made \"upon the defendant in person or at his domicile or at the place of his ordinary residence speaking to a reasonable person belonging to the family.\" See article 57 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In Quebec, as it is quite evident that service may be made in civil process by leaving the same at the domicile of the party, the words in the latter part of section 10, \"if service cannot be effected on the respondent or respondents either personally or at his or their domicile,\" are capable of literal application, but in Nova Scotia service cannot be effected by leaving process at the domicile of a party to be served unless by order of the court or a judge, so that the words \"if service cannot be effected on the respondent or respondents either personally or at his or their domicile,\" cannot mean that service may be effected that way, inasmuch as it cannot be effected in Nova Scotia that way at all in civil cases, and saying that if service cannot be effected in one of two ways when it is impossible to have it effected in but one of those methods, is to eliminate from the statute in its application to Nova Scotia the reference to the way which cannot be employed excepting by violating the law in Nova Scotia, and as a consequence violating the terms of sec. 11. The obvious construction of sec. 10 in the light of sec. 11 is to incorporate the operative part of sec. 11, immediately after the word domicile in sec. 10, when the section would read as follows: \"If service cannot be effected on the respondent or respondents either personally or at his or their domicile, whichever may be as nearly as possible the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, then it may be effected upon such other person or in such other manner as the court or judge on the application of the petitioner directs.\" The evident intent of these two sections\u2014regard being had to the manner of service of civil process in the province of Quebec\u2014is that a petitioner shall try to serve the petition and papers in the way in the province where the petition is to be served applicable to the service of a writ of summons in civil matters, and if he cannot effect such service then the court or a judge shall direct the method of service.\nIn the construction of statutes the intention to be gotten from the statute should prevail, and the construction is to be made on all the parts of the statute together; Hardcastle's Statutory Law, page 67 and cases there cited.\nBut there is another reason for the construction claimed by the appellant. If the petition is to be served in Nova Scotia by leaving it at the domicile of the party it would be altering the law as to service of civil process in that province and compelling a construction of sec. 10 inconsistent with sec. 11. This should not be done on account of a mere inference or implication to be extracted from part of a clause of a statute. To do that needs an express and unmistakable provision. The respondent to an election petition in Nova Scotia has the right to claim personal service of that paper, and that right should not be taken away unless by a plain and unmistakable provision of the law; Hardcastle's Statutory Law, pages 48, 49, 52 and 53. The case of Walsh v. Montague (Haldimand)[2] does not consider the effect of sec. 11 of the act nor the necessity of harmonizing it with sec. 10 nor any of the principles involved in adopting the view taken.\nBoak for the respondent. Service of the petition and accompanying documents was made at the respondent's domicile within five days after the presentation of the petition and again after the time for effecting personal service had been extended. Such service is a good service within the meaning of sec. 10 of the act; Walsh v. Montague (Haldimand) (1).\nPer Curiam: A service at the residence or dwelling house of the respondent by delivering a copy of the petition and the other papers prescribed by the statute to a grown up person is a good and valid service under section 10 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W. E. Roscoe.\nSolicitor for respondent: H. W. C. Boak.\n[1] L.R. 3 C.P. 27.\n[2] 1 Ont. El. R. 485.\n"

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOYA SCOTIA.\nBank\u2014Agent of\u2014Excess of authority\u2014Dealing with funds contrary to instructions\u2014Liability to bank\u2014Discounting for his own accommodation\u2014Position of parties on accommodation paper.\nK., agent of a bank and also a member of a business firm, procured accommodation drafts from a customer of the bank which he discounted as such agent and, without indorsing the drafts, used the proceeds, in violation of his instructions from the head office, in the business of his firm. The firm, having become insolvent, executed an assignment in trust of all their property by which the trustee was to pay \"all debts by the assignors or either of them due and owing or accruing or becoming due and owing\" to the said bank as first preferred creditor and to the makers of the accommodation paper, among others, as second preferred creditors. The estate not proving sufficient to pay the bank in full a dispute arose as to the accommodation drafts, the bank claiming the right to disavow the action of the agent in discounting them and appropriating the proceeds in breach of his duty as creating a debt due to it from his firm, the makers claiming that they were really debts due to the bank from the insolvents. In a suit to enforce the carrying out of the trusts created by the assignment.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the drafts were \"debts due and owing\" from the insolvents to the bank and within the first preference created by the deed.\nPer Ritchie C. J.\u2014K. procured the accommodation paper for the sole purpose of borrowing the money of the bank for his firm and when the firm received that money they became debtors to the bank for the amount.\nPer Strong and Patterson JJ.\u2014That the agent being bound to account to the bank for the funds placed at his disposal he became a debtor to the bank, on his authority being revoked, for the amount of these drafts as money for which he had failed to account Whether or not the bank had a right to elect to treat the act of the agent as a tort was not important as in any case there was a debt due.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014The evidence does not establish that these drafts were anything else than paper discounted in the ordinary course of banking business, as to which the bank had its recourse against all persons whose names appeared on the face of the paper and were not obliged to look to any other for payment.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment for the defendant at the trial.\nThe defendant is assignee for a firm called King Bros. & Co. under a deed of trust for the benefit of creditors in which the plaintiff bank is first preferred creditor and the defendant one of the second. The suit was brought to compel the defendant to carry out the trusts created by the deed.\nThomas M. King, a member of the firm of King Bros. & Co., was agent of the plaintiff bank at Antigonish, N.S., at which agency the firm had a line of discount. The said T. M. King obtained from the defendant his indorsement to certain drafts on one Thompson, and without said drafts being indorsed by him or his firm the said King, as agent of the bank, discounted them and applied the proceeds to the use of his firm, although their line of credit at the agency of the bank had for some time prior to this been exceeded. It is in respect to these accommodation drafts that the contest in this case has arisen.\nThe assets of the estate of King Bros. & Co. were not sufficient to pay the bank as first preferred creditor even if these drafts are not included in the bank's claim. It is contended, therefore, for the plaintiff, that the drafts do not constitute debts due from King Bros. & Co. to the bank, the name of the firm not appearing thereon, and the transaction on its face being an ordinary discount for the benefit of the defendant. The contention against this is that King Bros. & Co. having received the money of the bank procured by the discount of the drafts are liable to repay it as a debt due from them. The sole question, therefore, was: Did this transaction create a debt due from King Bros. & Co., or any member of that firm, to the plaintiff bank for the amount represented by these drafts?\nThe learned judge before whom the case was heard decided this question against the contention of the bank and gave judgment for the defendant. His decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting en banc. From the decision of the full court the plaintiff brought this appeal.\nHenry Q. C. and Ross Q.C. for the appellant. There was no contract between King and the bank. Bank of Upper Canada v. Bradshaw[1].\nIf King committed a wrong against the bank defendant must prove damages. In such case, also, to compel the bank to treat the transaction as a contract would be to deprive them of the right to treat it as a tort.\nThe bank never exercised their option of treating it as a debt due from King. Brewer v. Sparrow[2]; Story on Agency[3].\nThe remedy of a cestui que trust against the trustee, or of a principal against his agent, for breach of duty must be by an equitable action for an account.\nW. Cassels Q.C. and W. B. Ritchie for the respondent. King always treated these drafts as debts due to the bank and the indorsements as collateral.\nThe deed provides for payment of all debts due the bank. As to construction of word \"debts\" see Flint v. Barnard[4]; Gwatkin v. Campbell[5].\nThe bank has dealt with the drafts as King's paper. See Oriental Financial Corporation v. Overend, Gurney & Co.[6].\nThe defendant was only a surety for King to the bank. See Bechervaise v. Lewis[7].\nThe question of election does not arise in this case Phillips v. Homfray[8].\nThe learned counsel also cited Gray v. Seckham[9]; Ex parte Twogood[10]; Ex parte Rhodes[11]; Dudley Bank v. Spittle[12]; Dresser v. Norwood[13]; Ramshire v. Bolton[14]; Holt v. Ely[15]; Bishop v. Bayly[16].\nHenry Q.C. in reply. Defendant cannot be treated as a surety. King simply borrowed the money from defendant using the bank funds for the purpose.\nAs agent of the bank King never assumed to lend money to himself.\nThe bank had a right to treat the matter as a wrong committed by King of which right they would be deprived by regarding it as a debt.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014King being agent of the plaintiff, the Merchants Bank, and also a member of the firm of King Bros. & Co., discounted for the benefit of that firm certain accommodation drafts which he obtained! from defendant. Whidden for the express purpose of having them discounted at the plaintiff's agency of which he had charge, and on the understanding that he should indorse them, which, however, he never did; the firm of King Bros. & Co. had a line of discount at the bank which the discounting those notes would exceed and by not endorsing them he wished to make the transaction appear on the books of the bank as a discount, not for King Bros. & Co., as in fact it most certainly was but for Whidden. King Bros. & Co. having failed, and being largely indebted to plaintiff and others, made an assignment to defendant on 31st December, 1883, of certain real estate and personal property to have and hold same\nin trust to convert into money all and singular the premises and everything hereby conveyed, and as soon as practicable to collect in all and singular the debts and sums of money aforesaid, and after deducting the costs, charges and disbursements of the trusts before mentioned and of these presents and all matters incidental thereto, to pay and apply the moneys arising therefrom in manner following, that is to say: All debts by the said assignors or either of them due and owing or accruing or becoming due and owing\u2014\n1st. To the Merchant's Bank of Halifax.\n2nd. To Charles B. Whidden, C. B. Whidden & Sons, and Payzant and King, the last named debt not to exceed in this connection three thousand dollars.\nThe other provisions do not bear on the question in this case which simply is: Are these drafts so discounted by King the agent for the use of King Bros., and by King Bros., of which King the agent was a partner, applied to and used in their business by that firm, covered by the words\nall debts by the said assignors or either of them due and owing or accruing or becoming due and owing to the Merchants Bank of Halifax?\nI am of opinion that when King, the agent of the bank, deposited in the bank this accommodation paper and in lieu thereof took out of the bank the amount thereof, and appropriated that amount to the purposes of the firm of King Bros., it was a loan by the bank through him to his firm secured by the deposit of the accommodation paper, and therefore became a debt due by him and his firm to the bank, the liability for which he could not escape by withholding his indorsement The withholding his indorsement did not alter the transaction which simply was that he obtained this accommodation paper for one purpose, and for that one purpose alone, viz., to enable him through its instrumentality to borrow for his firm from the bank the amount this paper professed to represent, and the moment King Bros. received that money they became debtors to the bank for the amount they so received.\nThere is not the slightest pretence for saying that the money raised by King on this accommodation paper was money raised by the makers of this paper and by them loaned to King Bros. as was contended before us, the evidence showing that the very reverse was the case. Whidden & Co. had no transaction whatever with the bank; they simply gave King this accommodation paper and he used it in the manner I have indicated. Supposing King Bros. had remained solvent and the parties on this accommodation paper had failed and become utterly and entirely unable to pay, could King be allowed, in order to escape liability, to say, \"I discounted this paper bon\u00e2 fide on the strength of the names on it whom I believed perfectly good, and, therefore, no liability ever attached to me on it?\" Surely the answer would be \"the transaction was not that of the accommodation drawer or endorser, but unquestionably your own; the accommodation parties having become utterly unable to pay as accommodation parties they could have no claim on you except for indemnity, and if they never paid or never could pay anything they never did and never could lose anything, and therefore never had or could have any claim for indemnity against you. Are you therefore to keep this money you got out of the bank (I say borrowed from the bank) and pay nobody, and so the bank lose its money and you retain it on such a flimsy pretext that you did not put your name on the paper as you ought to have done?\" In other words can King say: True, my firm got your money and used it in their business here; the accommodation parties can't pay, and so can have no claim for indemnity against me or my firm. But because I did not indorse the paper, but simply deposited it as security for the money advanced by you to me, you have no claim against me or my firm, so I am not liable to you or any body else; I will, therefore, set you at defiance, keep your money and pay nobody? Could such a contention be tolerated? I certainly think not. It seems to me too absurd to be mentioned except to be scouted as inconsistent with law, justice and common sense. It is clear the bank has some ulterior object in view. How very different would the contention of the bank be if the parties to this accommodation paper were worthless and the estate of King Bros. fully sufficient (as it is said to be) to meet all debts \"due, owing or accruing, or becoming due and owing to the bank,\" and this claim was resisted by the other creditors on the ground that it was not a debt covered by the trust deed. I have no doubt whatever that this appeal should be dismissed with costs in this and all the courts.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This appeal depends on a single question, viz.: Whether a debt from King to the appellants was constituted by the application of the funds of the bank by King for his own use, as being the proceeds of discounts of the four drafts on Thompson drawn by the respondent for King's accommodation, and of Cunningham's note endorsed by the respondent also for King's accommodation. If this is to be answered in the negative then so much of the decree made by Mr. Justice James as declares that such a debt did arise was wrong and ought to be struck out, otherwise the decree is right and the appeal must fail.\nThe solution of this question appears to depend on the application of ordinary principles of the law of agency to the undisputed facts disclosed by the evidence.\nThat King was the agent of the appellant's bank at Antigonish, and that as such agent he was intrusted with the appellant's monies to be used and applied in the business of banking, and that he did, in fact, apply part of these funds, to the extent of the amount now in question, to his own use by purporting to discount the paper before referred to, cannot be disputed. Neither can it be, nor is it, denied that the bills and note in question were all accommodation paper drawn and indorsed by the respondent for the benefit of King and procured to be so drawn and indorsed by King for the sole purpose of enabling him to get into his own hands for his own use or for that of his firm funds of the bank equivalent to the proceeds of the bills on a discount of the same; nor that the discount of such paper by King for the purposes mentioned was in direct contravention of the express orders and instructions of his principal, the present appellant.\nThen upon this state of facts it is manifest that without resorting to the device of waiving a tort in order to be able to sue on contract, a device and fiction of which it may be remarked in passing that however applicable it was in a proper case before forms of action were abolished it can be of but little practical use in the present system of pleading and procedure, the bank could at once without awaiting the maturity of the paper have sued King, had they thought fit to do so, for the recovery of the money he had so, in breach of his duty, appropriated.\nThe legal proposition upon which this depends is simply this: An agent entrusted with the funds of his principal with instructions limiting him as to the application of these funds is liable to have his authority revoked at any time, and upon such revocation of authority becomes bound to account for the moneys of which he has had the disposition, and in respect of any amount which he cannot show to have been duly applied in accordance with the instructions he has received he is a debtor in the ordinary sense of the word of his principal. No one can gainsay this as an elementary rule of the law of agency.\nThen, to apply it here, King was originally a debtor of the bank in respect of all moneys placed in his hands and so remained, save as regards so much as he had applied in the ordinary course of the business of banking carried on in compliance with the appellant's instructions. If this were not so there would be no such thing as control of the agent's conduct by the principal's instructions. No question of a third party's rights intervening arises in the present case; the question is to be regarded as one purely between principal and agent. It follows that when the business was taken out of King's hands and his agency was revoked he remained a debtor for the amount now in question which had been applied to his own use in defiance of the prohibition of his principal.\nI should have thought that the only question open in the case was one which does not seem to have attracted much attention either here or in the court below, namely, whether there had been such an adoption of these discount transactions by the bank as to amount to a confirmation of them as loans upon the paper alone and exclusive of any personal liability of King.\nThe evidence, however, wholly fails to establish any waiver or discharge of King's original liability, for there is no inconsistency in the bank retaining the liability of the parties to the bills and also holding King liable as being, what he most undoubtedly was, the real though fraudulent borrower and debtor. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reason given by Mr. Justice Weatherbe in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014(His Lordship set out the pleadings in the case, the decree of the court below and a summary of the facts, after which he proceeded as follows): The evidence shows the drafts to have been handed to Thomas M. King to be used by him in such manner as he should think fit or should have occasion to use them. As between him and the parties to the drafts he had the fullest power to deal with them as he should think fit, subject only to his promise that he would retire them as they should become due. As between him and the bank all that the evidence shows is that he would be acting in disobedience of his instructions if he should discount the paper of King Bros. & Co., or of himself. He does not appear to have been forbidden to discount good paper, although it should be accommodation paper, for persons whose names did not appear upon the paper. No evidence to that effect was offered. He himself says in his evidence that it was his practice as agent of the bank to discount paper for parties whose names did not appear on the paper, and he said that it was not for the purpose of preventing the inspector of the bank from knowing that King Bros. & Co. had received the proceeds thereof that he discounted the drafts without endorsing them; that he did not consider the application of the proceeds was a matter with which the inspector had anything to do. No one but himself knew anything of the application of the proceeds until the 29th December, 1883, when the making of the trust deed and its terms were under consideration. What he says upon this point upon his examination-in-chief as a witness called by the defendant is:\nI told Mr. Knight about two days before the execution of the deed, there was reference made to paper drawn by C. B. Whidden & Sons upon A. C. Thompson, about two days previous to the execution of the deed, when I said to the inspector of the bank, Mr. Knight, that that paper was in the interest of King Bros. & Co., and included these four drafts. Mr. Whidden said in this conversation that \"it would be some time before we could realize from the estate, it will be inconvenient for me to take up this paper.\" Mr. Knight replied \"we will allow this paper to remain as past due bills until you have an opportunity of realizing from the estate.\"\nAnd on cross-examination he says:\nI had conversation with Mr. Knight in reference to these drafts, at the office of Mr. Bligh, on the 29th December, 1883. Mr. Knight, the defendant, Mr. Bligh and myself were present. I informed Mr. Knight that there was certain paper in the bank drawn by C. B. Whidden & Sons on A. C. Thompson, the proceeds of which were used in the interest of King Bros. & Co. He expressed surprise; the defendant said that he received no part of the proceeds of the said drafts, and Mr. Knight then engaged that when these drafts should become due, they should remain as past due bills till the defendant could have opportunity of realizing from the insolvent estate.\nAnd he says further that Mr. Knight refused to recognize the drafts as being paper upon which King Bros. & Co. were liable to the plaintiff, and insisted that the plaintiff would look to the parties on the paper for the payment thereof, subject only to his promise as above stated that as the drafts should become due they should be held as past due bills till the defendant could have an opportunity of realizing from the insolvent estate, but that they were not, nor should they be deemed to be, liabilities of King Bros. & Co. to the bank, or within the provisions of the trust deed in its favor.\nNow, without impugning the right of the plaintiff to have disavowed the transaction when brought to its notice, if it was a transaction in excess of the agent's authority, or its right to look to Thos. M. King to make good any loss it might sustain by the paper proving to be bad upon the principle that he had no right to suffer his interests as a member of the firm of King Bros. & Co. to conflict with his duty to the plaintiff as its agent, it cannot be doubted that the bank had the right to treat the drafts when discounted as its property, and that no person whose name appears on the drafts could question the bank's right to hold them as its absolute property, and to recover thereon against all the parties thereto in the character in which their names appear on the paper as debtors of the bank, in respect of the amounts secured thereby. By delivery of the drafts to Thos. M. King in the manner in which, and for the purpose for which, they were made, accepted and endorsed, the parties to the drafts authorized Thos. M. King to make whatever use of them, and of the proceeds thereof when discounted, as he should think fit; whether he should or not have discounted them at his own agency was a matter with which the parties to the drafts were not concerned, that was a matter between the plaintiff and its agent whose act the plaintiff had a perfect right to adopt if it should think fit; it was for the bank to determine how they should deal with the agent's conduct; as matter of fact it has always insisted upon its right as owners of these drafts to recover against the parties thereto as its debtors. There has never been any doubt raised as to the solvency of the parties to the drafts, nor has the bank ever called in question or had occasion to call in question the right of Thomas M. King to have discounted them as he did. Whether Mr. Knight, as inspector of the bank, had any power by any undertaking of his to alter the position of the bank and to deprive it of the rights it had against the parties to the drafts, and to change the transaction into a debt primarily due to it by persons whose names were not on the paper at all, for the payment of which debt the drafts should be deemed to be collateral security only, we need not inquire, for the evidence utterly fails to establish that any undertaking of the kind had ever been given by Mr. Knight. It would have been very strange for him to have given such an undertaking, and equally strange for the bank to have recognized and affirmed it if given after King Bros. & Co. had become insolvent, and while the parties to the drafts remained solvent. But it is quite clear, I think, that the bank never did agree to regard the monies secured by the drafts as constituting debts due to it by King Bros. & Co. The promise of Mr. Knight, which was a naked promise without any consideration, that the drafts as they should fall due should remain over as past due bills until the defendant should have an opportunity of realizing the trust estate, was quite consistent with the claim of the plaintiff to look to the parties to the drafts as the only persons liable to it, and, indeed, the evidence sufficiently shows that it was made at the request of the defendant, and in case of the liability of the parties to the drafts without any prejudice to the plaintiff's claim against them, as the only persons liable in respect thereof, and to give the defendant an opportunity to protect himself under the provision in his favor contained in the second paragraph of the clause prescribing the order in which the trust funds should be applied. This is the fair construction to put upon the evidence, and that it was so understood by the defendant as a business man appears, I think, from certain questions submitted by him to the bank before he realized the trust estate and from his conduct upon receiving the answers of the bank to those questions. In the month of January, 1884, the defendant submitted to the bank the questions following:\u2014\n1. What paper in the head office and agencies do they (the bank) claim to rank under the first preferential clauses in the assignment?\n2. Will they use all legitimate means to collect the paper in said offices as it matures or in the very near future (either as promisor or endorser) other than the paper lying in the Antigonish agency known as the Antigonish paper?\n3. Will they allow all such Antigonish paper lying in the Antigonish agency, amounting to some $19,000, to lie as past due bills as per a well understood arrangement with the inspector, Mr. Knight, at the time the assignment was being made, or do they require such portion of said paper as does not bear the name of King Brothers & Co., or either of said firm, to be retired as it matures?\n4. If they require such paper to be provided for as it matures, about $8,000 of the same being the paper either of C. B. Whidden or of C. B. Whidden & Sons, are they prepared to give the same like banking facilities as in the past?\n5. Are they prepared to say that they will claim for such paper as lies in the head office at Halifax, and some of which has already matured, before I can claim in payment of my own paper as under the 2nd clause of the deed of assignment?\nTo these questions the cashier of the bank addressed and sent to the defendant, on the 25th January, 1884, the following answer:\u2014\nDear Sir,\u2014At a meeting of the board of directors of this bank held yesterday your list of questions with regard to the King paper and other business was considered. I am directed to inform you that this bank claims to rank on the King estate under the first preference clause for any paper held at this office or any of the agencies on which advances have been made.\nEvery means, however, will be used to collect from all promisors on the paper held by the bank, and instructions will be issued at once to its agents to give this matter their best attention.\nWith regard to your third question, any paper at Antigonish agency bearing the names of King Brothers & Co. will be charged to past due bills as it matures on the understanding and promise of yourself that funds will be paid in at once and from time to time as you may realize against such paper. In reference to the balance of the paper proceeds of which are said to have been used for the benefit of King Brothers & Company, the directors would have no objections after having received the concurrence of all parties concerned to allow this class of notes to remain on as past due bills provided satisfactory security was given.\nReferring to your fourth question, the directors will be prepared at all times to afford yourself and C. B. Whidden & Sons the usual banking facilities. I need hardly mention that any paper offered by you for discount would be subject to approval.\nWith regard to your fifth question, the directors cannot decide on the legal effect of the clause in the assignment, but think it covers all the notes in the bank. The bank, to preserve its claim on endorsers, must claim on all the notes it holds, and if there is any dispute it must be settled between the assignee and the endorsers. The bank will, in all cases, look to the endorsers of the notes the assignee does not pay.\nUpon receipt of these answers the defendant was made fully aware that the bank's claim was, that it covered all paper having upon it the names of King Bros. & Co., or of either of the partners, which paper they agreed to allow to lie over as past due bills, conditional upon the defendant promising to retire that paper as he should realize out of the estate. And as to all paper which, like the drafts in question, had not on them the names of King Bros. & Co., or of either of the partners, but which are said to have been used for the accommodation of King Bros. & Co., they too might lie over as past due bills, provided all the parties on such paper should consent, and that satisfactory security should be given.\nNow the defendant, as to the four drafts in question drawn by C. B. Whidden & Sons, upon and accepted by Thompson, says that instead of giving the security thus asked for he preferred himself retiring, and that he did retire, those drafts as they matured.\nThese drafts, therefore, having been so paid by the defendant in discharge of the liability of C. B. Whidden & Sons, according to the tenor of the drafts, the plaintiff had no further claim in respect of them, and what is now asked by the person who, in discharge of his liability upon the drafts, retired them, in effect, is that such payment of the drafts shall be disregarded, and that the plaintiff shall be compelled to disavow against its will the act of its agent in discounting the drafts which hither to they had not disavowed, and that it shall now be compelled to treat the transaction in a light in which it was never entertained by it, namely, as a loan by the bank to Thomas M: King, for which therefore he became the debtor of the bank, either as sole debtor, or as principal or primary debtor for whose debt the parties to the drafts were only sureties to the bank, and that in the taking of the accounts of the trust estate the defendant shall be allowed now to get credit for the monies paid by him in discharge of his liability on the drafts as if they had been paid in discharge of a debt which, at the time of the execution of the trust deed, was due and owing or accruing due by King Bros. & Co., or by Thomas M. King to the bank, and provided for in the first preferential clause in the trust deed in favor of the plaintiff. Thus compelling the bank to accept King Bros. & Co. or Thomas M. King as its debtor for the amount of the drafts in lieu of the parties whose names are on the drafts, and who are the only parties whom, up to the time of the drafts having been paid by one of the parties thereto, the plaintiff has regarded as its debtors in respect of the monies represented by these drafts. The object of the defendant plainly being thus to get for himself and C. B. Whidden & Sons the benefit of the first preferential clause in the trust deed, which is in favor of the plaintiff, to secure payment thereby of so much of its claim against the assignors of the trust deed as is represented by the drafts retired by the defendant, instead of having recourse to the trust estate under the second preferential clause of the trust deed in their favor.\nFor such a contention there is, in my opinion, no foundation in law or equity. The plaintiff never entered into any such obligation, nor can any such be forced upon it against its will by a court of justice. None of the cases referred to by the learned counsel for the defendant support any such pretension. In answer to it it is sufficient to say that the plaintiff itself is the only person competent to determine whether it should disavow or adopt an act of its agent, even though it should be an act done in disobedience of the instructions given to him, and that it has always recognized the title vested in it by the act of its agent in discounting the drafts in question, and that it never recognized the transaction in relation to these drafts and to its interest therein in any other light than as the liability and debt of the parties whose names are upon the drafts according to their tenor and effect. No court has any jurisdiction to declare that, under the circumstances attending the discounting of the drafts and the plaintiff acquiring title to them, King Bros. & Co. or Thomas M. King became and were accepted by the bank as its debtors in respect to the amounts of the drafts, or to compel the bank against its will to accept and treat them as the debtors to the bank in respect of such amounts.\nThe appeal, therefore, in my opinion must be allowed and the decree varied so as, in addition to the declaration therein as to the demand note for $1,350, to declare that at the time of the execution of the trust deed no part of the amount represented by the four drafts in question constituted or was a debt due and owing or accruing due and owing to plaintiff by the assignors of the trust estate in the trust deed mentioned, and that upon the taking of the accounts of the trust estate the moneys paid to the plaintiff in retiring those drafts cannot, therefore, be applied and charged as a payment to the plaintiff under the first preferential clause in the trust deed in its favor, and declare further that the promissory notes of King Bros. & Co. in the statement of claim mentioned are payable out of the trust estate under the said first preferential clause in favor of the plaintiff. Reserve further considerations and costs, but the costs of this appeal should be paid by the respondent. Allow appeal with costs to be paid by the respondent as the claim set up by him was in the interest of himself and his firm, and his defence was not merely that of a trustee asking directions of the court in a matter wherein he was indifferent.\nPATTERSON J. \u2014 On the 31st December, 1883, Thomas M. King and Charles R. King assigned in trust to Charles B. Whidden, the present respondent, their real and personal property. The deed recited, amongst other things, that\nthe said assignors are, or one of them is, indebted to the said trustee and the other creditors hereinafter made preferential for cash advanced and loaned, moneys held in trust, and liabilities incurred otherwise than for goods sold and delivered in the ordinary course of trade, which advances and loans so made, moneys so held, and liabilities so incurred as aforesaid were appropriated to the payment of the ordinary commercial liabilities of the said assignors.\nThe trusts were to convert the estate into money, and, after paying costs and disbursements, to pay\nAll debts by the said assignors or either of them due and owing or accruing or becoming due and owing\u2014\nFirst.\u2014To the Merchants' Bank of Halifax.\nSecond.\u2014To Charles B. Whidden, C. B. Whidden & Sons, and Payzant and King, the last named debt not to exceed in this connection three thousand dollars.\nThird.\u2014To [5 named creditors], and any balance still clue or owing the said Payzant and King over and above the sum of three thousand dollars aforesaid. Fourth.\u2014To [23 named creditors].\nFifth.\u2014All other private debts of the said Thomas M. King due on promissory notes to parties in the County of Antigonish incurred for the benefit of the said business of King Brothers and Company, and all other debts of the said Charles R. King or King Brothers and Company for cash advanced or for accommodation paper on behalf of said firm, and out of the residue to pay and discharge in equal proportions the respective debts of all the other creditors who shall, within six weeks from the date hereof, execute these presents.\nThen followed a release by the creditors of\nAll and every their and each of their respective debts due and to grow due, and all claims, actions and demands whatsoever against them or either of them which they, the said creditors or any of them, may or can have against the said assignors or either of them from the beginning of the world to the present time, provided always that no surety at law or in equity shall be released or discharged by anything contained in these presents or by the execution thereof by any creditor or creditors.\nThomas M. King was partner of his brother Charles R. King in a mercantile business at Sydney, C. B., which business was conducted by Charles, and he was himself agent at Antigonish for the Merchants' Bank of Halifax, the present appellant. T. M. King or his firm were debtors to the appellant for large sums of money, chiefly upon paper to which they were parties. The dispute upon this appeal is whether the amounts of four drafts discounted at the Antigonish agency of the bank, on which the name of T. M. King or of his partner or firm did not appear, are to be reckoned as debts entitled to rank under the first preference as due by the assignors to the bank.\nThese drafts were drawn by the respondent's firm of C. B. Whidden & Sons on and accepted by one Thompson for the accommodation of King. They were indorsed by C. B. Whidden & Sons and handed to T. M. King, with the intention that he should indorse them and negotiate them for the benefit of his firm. He did negotiate them by discounting them as agent of the bank and applying the proceeds to his own use or that of his firm, but without indorsing them.\nBy what may at first sight appear like an inversion of interests the struggle on the part of the bank, the first preferred creditor, is to maintain that these four drafts, or more properly speaking the money advanced on them, do not come within the first preference as debts due by King. This arises from the insufficiency of the estate, the bank preferring to look to the parties whose names are on the paper; and the defendant, whose firm are liable as indorsers and entitled to rank on the estate only after payment of the first preferred debts, having a very direct interest in bringing this debt within that class.\nThe action is in form for the execution of the trusts of the deed, the plaintiff claiming payment of a number of notes of King Bros. & Co., to which the defendant is not a party. The defendant shows that he has paid to the plaintiff out of the trust moneys received by him upwards of $30,000, which includes the amount of a number of notes indorsed by him or his firm, the four disputed drafts among the rest, as well as a number of debts for which he was not personally liable.\nIf he can properly charge the amounts of these four drafts against the estate there will not be enough to pay the debts now claimed by the plaintiff.\nIf he is not entitled so to charge them then he and the other parties to the paper must provide for it. Hence the struggle.\nWe are not troubled, as I understand the evidence and the pleadings, with any question of subrogation, as we might be if the indorsers had paid the drafts to the bank and were now asserting a right, as sureties for a debt of King to the bank, to take the place of the bank in the first preference distribution. The defendant who is sued as the trustee happens to be one of the indorsers, but the other parties to the paper are not before us, and the payment which the plaintiff has received was not from the indorsers, but was made by the defendant individually out of the trust funds, or perhaps in anticipation of funds afterwards received. I have no means of knowing how that was, but I find in the evidence that, when the bank authorities required security as a condition of holding the drafts as past due paper until money could be realised from the estate, the defendant says that rather than give security he paid the money. I do not know how the estate accounts stood at the time, but knowing that the paper which it was proposed to hold over included many other notes of King, and finding the amounts of these four drafts and the interest upon them included in the $30,000 statement of payments on account of the estate, I take it that the payments were by the defendant acting or assuming to act as trustee, and not on behalf of the indorsers or the acceptor of the drafts.\nIt is said that King's motive in omitting to indorse the drafts was to avoid the appearance of their being discounted on behalf of himself or his firm. There seems to have been some irregularity in his method of dealing in such matters. His right to discounts from the Merchants' Bank was limited, according to Mr. Whidden's account of what King told him, to $5,000 at the Sydney agency and $10,000 at Antigonish. Mr. King was asked: \"Had the firms of which you were a member limits of credit with the Merchants Bank? And if so, state what these limits were;\" and he answered \"I was only in connection with one firm, viz., King Brothers & Co.; the limit of the firm's credit at Sydney, Cape Breton, with the Merchants Bank was $5,000\" saying nothing of any limit or any line of credit at Antigonish. In answer to another cross-interrogatory he states that at the time the drafts were discounted his firm had advances and discounts up to their limit. Then we have this question and answer.\n6. If you state that your firm received part of the proceeds of these drafts, give your reasons for discounting them without indorsing them?\nTo the Sixth Cross-Interrogatory I say the firm of King Brothers & Co. had no account at the Antigonish Agency where these drafts were discounted, the account having been closed more than a year prior by the direction of the head office of the bank, after which, as agent, I refused their indorsement.\nThis reason would be more satisfactory if we found that the transaction went to the account of C. B. Whidden & Sons. in the books of the bank, but in place of that the proceeds of the notes were received directly by King. Nor is the answer easily reconciled with what appears in a statement prepared by King at the time of making the assignment, setting out the notes held by the bank with Antigonish names. There are seventeen notes amounting in all to over $17,000. Nine of them have the name of King Bros. & Co.; one has the name of T. M. King; four of the others are the drafts now in question; and the dates range from that of the earliest till after that of the latest of the drafts.\nBut there is no doubt left of the fact that these four drafts represent moneys of the bank applied by King to his own purposes, and that his indorsement, which under ordinary circumstances would have been there, was omitted because, in advancing or appropriating to himself the bank moneys under color of discounting the paper, he was exceeding his authority and acting in violation of his duty as agent.\nThe essence of the transaction was not altered by the form in which it was put. It was an appropriation by King to his own uses of funds entrusted to him by his employers. It was argued that it ought to be regarded as a loan from the bank to C. B. Whidden & Sons, and a loan of the same money by that firm to King Bros. & Co. There might be no legal or technical difficulty in so treating the transaction as against the respondent if the interest of justice or the rights of third parties required us to do so, particularly as the respondent put it in the power of T. M. King to negotiate the paper without becoming a party to it. That would, however, be giving more effect to the form in which the thing was done than to the proved intention of the parties, and, after all, the form of a discount on account of C. B. Whidden & Sons was not consistently carried through, because the proceeds of the drafts were not passed to their credit but were directly applied by King to his own purposes. It was well remarked by the learned Chief Justice in the court below, that if King had taken the money without security he would be liable to repay it, and that his wrongful dealing with the security placed in his hands does not do away with his liability. The technical character of his liability would be the same whether he borrowed from the bank or from C. B. Whidden & Sons. It would be for money lent or money had and received. Whose money was lent or was received by him to his own use? That the answer must be the money of the bank seems to me plain from the whole evidence, an important part of which is the explanation given by Mr. Whidden that he had no idea when he indorsed these drafts that King had exhausted the credit allowed him by the bank.\nThe case of The Bank of Upper Canada v. Bradshaw[17], which was cited for the appellants rather tells against them. It was sought to charge Bradshaw, who was a local agent of the bank, with moneys which he had advanced in alleged excess of his authority, but the moneys had not been advanced in form or effect for his own use and benefit, and he was held on that ground not to be liable in the action. One sum had been advanced to a corporation in which he was a shareholder. The corporation was the customer of the bank, and the fact that Bradshaw as a shareholder was distinct in point of law from the company itself was given as one reason, amongst others mentioned in the judgment delivered by Lord Cairns, which placed that charge on the same footing as the others.\nIt has been urged on behalf of the appellant that King's unauthorized dealing with the bank moneys was a wrong which did not create a debt unless the bank elected so to treat it, and it is said no such election has been made.\nThe former of these two propositions assumes, I think without sufficient warrant, that the bank could have proceeded against King in an action ex delicto. But even if that were so, there was at the same time a debt created by the receipt of the moneys. Of course only one action could be maintained. If an action of tort were brought it would not be competent to sue in debt for the same cause of action, and e converso. That, however, is not the point. The question is: Was there a debt created from King to the Merchants' Bank within the meaning of the first trust of the deed? Conceding for argument's sake that the taking of the money was a tortious act, it would all the same create a debt. Many cases may be cited as express authorities for this. I lately examined several of them in Molson's Bank v. Halter[18], viz., Chowne v. Baylis[19]; Emma Silver Mine Company v. Grant[20]; Cooper v. Prichard[21]; Evans v. Bear[22]; Cobham v. Dalton[23]; Ex parte Kelly[24]. Others referred to in the respondent's factum are Dudley and West Bromwich Bank v. Spittle[25]; Ramshire v. Bolton[26]; Holt v. Ely[27]; Neate v. Harding[28].\nThus the proposition which asserts the necessity for the bank to elect to treat King's liability as a debt is beside the question even if it were sound in law. But if such election were important it is, as I apprehend, sufficiently shown by the release to which the bank is a party. The release plainly covers this liability. In this respect it is consistent with the recital, and if the aid of those parts of the deed were required to give the widest possible comprehension to the word \"debts\" as used in the trust clauses they would have that effect. I believe, moreover, that the fair result of the evidence (even leaving out that of King through whom the bank acted when he received the money) concerning the negotiations connected with the making of the assignment is to show a recognition on the part of the bank of this debt as a debt of King, though when the state of his affairs began to be understood a different tone may have been adopted. So little depends, however, in my opinion upon the attitude taken on the part of the bank that it would be useless to discuss the evidence at length.\nUpon the grounds I have attempted to explain, and for the reasons given in the court below by the Chief Justice and Mr, Justice Weatherbe, I am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: Thomas Ritchie.\nSolicitor for Respondent: W.

C.\nOn the 20th December, 1883, the creditors of one L. resolved to accepted a composition payable by' his promissory notes at 4, 8 and 12 months. At the time L. was indebted to the Exchange Bank (in liquidation), who did not sign the composition deed, in a sum of $140000. B. et al., the appellants, were at that time accommodation endorsers for $7,455 of that amount, but held as security a mortgage dated the 5th September,1881, on L.'s real estate. The bank having agreed to accept $8,000 cash for its claim B. et al. on the 8th January, 1884, advanced $3,000 to L. and took his promissory notes and a new mortgage registered on the 13th January for the amount, having discharged and released on the same day the previous mortgage of the 5th September, 1881. This new transaction was not made known to D. et al., the respondents who on the 14th January, 1884, advanced a sum of $3,000 to L. to enable him to pay off the Exchange Bank and for which they accepted L.'s promissory notes. L., the debtor, having failed to pay the second instalment of his notes, D. et al., who were not originally parties to the deed of composition, brought an action to have the transaction between L and the appellants set aside and the mortgage declared void on the ground of having been granted in fraud of the rights of the debtor's creditors.\nHeld, reversing the judgments of the courts below, that the agreement by the debtor L. with the appellants was valid, the debtor having at the time the right to pledge a part of his assess to secure the payment of a loan made to assist in the payment of his composition The Chief Justice and Taschereau J dissenting\nPer Fournier J.\u2014The mortgage having been registered on the 13th January, 1884, the respondent's right of action to set aside the mortgage was prescribed by one year from that date; art. 1040 C.C. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the head-note and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Beausoleil for the appellants con-tended:\n1st. That the respondents were not Lamoureux's creditors at the time of the granting of such mortgage, and that they had no right as subsequent creditors to put. in issue the validity of said mortgage.\n2nd. That the said respondents were aware of the existenee of the said deed of the 8th January, 1884, which was duly registered at the Registry Office of Coaticooke on the 13th January 1884 and that the said respondents had knowledge of such mortgage for over a year at the time of the issue of the writ which is dated the 16th of June 1885 that by article 1040 of the Civil Code their pretended right of action was lost.\n3rd That the transaction was made in good faith that it did not create any undue preference in favour of the appellants, and that it ought to be declared valid on its own merits.\nOuimet Q.C. for respondents contended that respondents when they paid the Exchange Bank, and became the bearers of Lamoureux's notes then and there and de faclo became subrogated to the bank in the latter's action against Lamoureux and cited arts. 1039 and 1032 C.C; Larombi\u00e9re on Obligations ([1]). Upon the evidence the learned counsel contended that when the respondents consented' to advance $3,000 on the belief that they wotild stand for being repaid on the same footing as all the other creditors who had consented to take 65c. in the dollar, Brossard & Chaput the appellants were behind their back getting a new note of $2,934.86, saddliNg Lamoureux's estate with that new indebtedness and such a transaction was void at law.

Normand ([6]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. I think this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment rendered by the learned judge en premiere instance, unanimously affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, should be affirmed.\nSTRONG J. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Fournier I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER J. L'action des intim\u00e9s a pour but de faire annuler certains actes et billets promissoires comme faits en fraude de leurs droits et aussi pour faire obliger les appelants Brossard et Chaput a faire rapport de $2,000 a eux pay\u00e9es par Lamoureux qui avait failli. Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1883 Lamoureux avait obtenu la signature de ses cr\u00e9anciers a un acte de composition, a raison de 65 centionsdans la piastre, payable par ses billets promissoires a 4, 8 et 12 mois.\nCette composition (1) est sign\u00e9e par les appelants et par tons les autres cr\u00e9anciess de Lamoureux, a l'exception de la Banque d'echange qui, ayant refuse de se joindre a la composition, fit avec Lamoureux un arrangement particular. Les intimes aussi ne sont point parties a cetee composition parce que alors ils n'\u00e9taient pas cr\u00e9anciers de Lamoureux, ne l\u00e9tant devenus qu'apr\u00e9s la composition.\nLamoureux devait a la Banque d'\u00e9change $14,000, pour au del\u00e0 de $5,000 de ce montant, in \u00e9tait respon-sable comme endosseur du papier de ses pratiques. La balance, $8,389 34, se composait de ses propres billets endoss\u00e9s par les appelants.\nTine des principales difficult\u00e9s de cette cause est au sujet de l'arrangement particular avec la banque. Il est certain que Lamoureux avait fait un compromis avec ses cr\u00e9anciers a raison de 65 pour cent on en poss\u00e9de la preuve \u0152crite; mais en a til fait autant avec la Banque d'\u00e9change, et quelle est la nature de l'arrangement fait avec elle ?\nBrossard, entendu comme t\u00e9moin des intim\u00e9s, dit que la banque a transig\u00e9 avec Lamoureux en acceptant et recevant la somme de $8,000, en paiement de sa dette de $14,000.\nLamoureux s'est procur\u00e9 la somme de $8,000, n\u00c9cesssaire pour payer sa composition particuli\u00e9re avec la Banque d'Echange de la manih\u00e8re suivante, savoir: $2,000 de sa femme; $3,000 pr\u00e9t\u00e9es par Dupras et Edmand, et $3,000 aussi pr\u00ebt\u00e8ss par Brossard et Chaput. Pour ce dernier montant Lamoureux donna son billet aux appelants pour $2,934866, avec une hypoth\u00e8que de $3000, pour en assurer le paiement. Ces avances furent faites \u00e0 Lamoureux isol\u00e9ment par ces diverses parties sans aucun concert on convention entre elles, clia-cune agissant pour son propre compte avec Lamoureux, seul ou avec son \"procureur. Telle est la transaction que l'action des intim\u00e9s a pour but de faire annuler comme faite en fraude des cr\u00e9anciers, parties \u00e0 la composition. Brossard explique que le billet ne fut pas fait pour $3,000 pour la raison que Lamoureux avait pay\u00e9 certaines charges a la Banque d'Ontario dont il lui fut tenu compte, et le billet pris pour la balance, $2934 86; mais il affirme quo tout le montant de $3,000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 M. Emard qui, comme procureur de Lamoureux, conduisait les n\u00dfgociations avec la Banque d'Echange.\nD'aps\u00e9s ce t\u00e9moignage il est evident que cet arrangement avec la banque est tout a fait distinct et s\u00e9par\u00e9 de la composition de Lamoureux avec ses cr\u00e9anciers. Il n'y est question d'aucun pro rata sur la totalite de la dette. L'arrangement n'est qu'une composition pure et simple de $8000 en paiement complet et parfait de la somme de $14,000. Ces $8,000 furent pay\u00e9es avec les deniers obtenus comme susdit.\nCet arrangement est d'auaant plus probable que la banque \u00e9tant elle-m\u00eame en liquidation voulait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e comptant. Pour cette raison elle a accept\u00e9 57 pour cent au lieu de 65 a quatre huit et douze mois de d\u00e9lai. Lamoureux pr\u00e9tend au contraire que ses deux dettes de $5000 ou environ et de $8934866 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment avec la banque, que les $2,000 avan\u00e9ess par madame Lamoureux \u00e9taient en paiement de la dette de $5,000, et que les $3,000 emprunt\u00e9es des intim\u00e9s \u00e9tant accept\u00e9ess en paiement des 65 pour cent de la somme de $8,389.44, laissent aux appelanss Brossard et Chaput \u00e0 payer, comme endosseurs, les autres 35 pour cent, ce qu'ils firent en prenant le billet do Lamoureux pour le montant exact de 35 pour cent savoir $2,934866.\nL'arrangemeut partiel fait avec la banque n'avait \u00e9videmment aucun rapport a la composition do 65 pour cent offerte aux autres cr\u00e9anciers. D'apr\u00e8s cette version la banque avait accept\u00e9 environ 40 pour cent pour la reclamation de $5000 eL limit\u00e9 sa reclamation contre les endssseurs de billets au montant de $8 389.94 a 35 pour cent do ce montant, et accep\u00e9 un autre 35 pour cent des insolvabess au lieu de 65 pour cent. Il n'est donn\u00e9 aucune raison pour en avoir agi ainsi\nIl est certain d'apr\u00e9s la preuve que la banque n'a point fait un pareil arrangement, mais qu'elle a com-pose par une seule transaction, a 57 pour cent, comptant, pour sa r\u00e9clamation, se montant a pr\u00e9s de $14,000 au lieu de 65 pour cent avec d\u00e9ai c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle a accep\u00e9e $8,000 pour les $14,000 qui lui \u00e9taient dues\nIl n'est pas douteux qu'un projet semblable \u00e0 celui de Lamoureux a \u00e9t\u00e9 discute entre les parties; proba-blement aussi avec quelques-uuns des employes de la banque. Dans la preuve il est quelquefois question de l'arrangfement avec la banque comme si c'\u00e9tait le m\u0152me que celui dont il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 parl\u00e9 entre les parties mais cet arrangement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nUn des liquidateurs de la banque a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin des intim\u00e9s. il dit qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ou qu'il a pu \u00e9tre fait une proposition de r\u00e9gler s\u00e9par\u00e9ment la reclamation de $5,000 avant qu'ou ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire un r\u00e9glement, mais que la banque a insiste pour un r\u00e9srlement de toute la dette. Le r\u00e9sultat de son t\u00e9moii gnage est qu'en ce qui concerne la banque, il y a eu une composition de la somme de $8,000 accep\u00e9e en paiement de celle de $14;000\nLe t\u00e9moignage de M. Emard \u00e0 tout prendre confirme cet arrangement Il dit qu'une offre a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0la banque de payer $1,500 pour les billets se montant \u00e0 $5,115.84. Cette offre fut faite par une lettre de M. Emard du 17 d\u00c9cembre 1884. Elle ne fut pas accep\u00c9ee. M. Emard dit qu'ensuite il a fait verbalement une offre de $2,000, que la banque semblait dispos\u00e9e a accepter, mais qu'avant de l'accepter d\u00e9finitivement et de se d\u00eaclarer prete a r\u00e9gler pour ce montant, la banque exprima le d\u00e9sir que son autre r\u00e9clamation contre Lamoureux qui \u00e9tait garantie par les endossemenss de Brossard et Chaput, se montant ainsi ou'il le dit a $8,355.32, fut aussi r\u00e9glee.\nEn cela M. Emard se trouve d'accord avec M. Campbell, le liquidateur.Il parle ensuite de cc qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au sujet de la plus forte reclamation. Il dit que Lamoureux, n'etant capable de payer que $2,000, lui demauda d'offrir de racheter les billets. C'est alors qou'il s'assura pour la premiere fois qu'il pouvait se procurer $3,000 par M. Dupras et qu'il fit alors la proposition a la banque. Les termes de cette proposition furent \u00e9crits sur un blanc du tel\u00e9grapghe qui fut produit en preuve, mais a depuis dispauu du dossier. il cut \u00e9t\u00e9 d'autant plus important de so procurer ce document, quo d'autres qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 imprim\u00e9s, mais qui sont rest\u00e9s dans le dossier et nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis, ne confirment pas la version du r\u00e9gllement donn\u00e9e par M. Emard.il nese souvient pas d'avoir pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque $8,000, mais seu-lement $7,934566. Cette somme so composant de $2,000, de Mme Lamoureux, $3,000 avan\u00e9ss par Dupras et Emard, et $2,934566 de Brossard et Chaput. Mais les cheques an moyen desquelscet argent a \u00e9ta pay\u00e9 sont produits et sont pour le plein montant de $8,000. Il y en a quatre, savoir: $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 et $2,000. Ces montants n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divises d'apr\u00e9s les sources de leur provenance mais seulement pour la facilit\u00e9 de retirer les billets qui se trouvaient dans difFerentes banques.\nIl ressort \u00e9videmment de cette preuve qu'il n'y a eu do la part de la bauque qu'une composition pour $8,000, et que la banque n'a transig\u00e9 qu'avec Lamoureux, on avec Emard comme le repr\u00e9sentant do Lamoureux et non pas avec les appelants Brossard et Chaput. Ces derniers out fourni une partie du montant do la composition. Brossard dit quo c'\u00e9tait $3,000, le montant pour lequel Lamoureux a donn\u00e9 une hypoth\u00e9que; c'est aussi le montant qui, d'apr\u00e9s la preuve \u00e9cnite faite par les ch\u00e9ques d'Emard, est celui que Brossard a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque. Quel que soit le montant qu'il a fourni; que ce soit $3,000, ouseulemen $2,934.86 comme dit Emard il ne l'a sans doute ainsi avanc\u00e9 que parce qu'il \u00e9tait expose a payer comme endosseur des $8,000. Le montant pour lequel il a pris le billet de Lamoureux \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment 35 pour cent du montant entier des billets Ce calcul fut sans dout\u00e9 bas\u00e9 sur la notion que Lamoureux pourraIt fournir la diff\u00e9rence. Mais le r\u00e9glement final ayant eu lieu pour une somme comptant qui permettait d'accorder un escompte liberal, d'environ 57 pour cent, au lieu de 65 pour cent, ce qui faisait une diminution de $1,000 environ, ou 12 pour cent du montant qu'aurait donn\u00e9 la composition a 65 pour cent on ne voit pas que les motifs de Brossard pour avancer de pargent soient d'une aussi grande importance, ou que son avauce de $3,000 soit d'une nature diff\u00e9rente par rapport aux cr\u00e9ances en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, des $3,000 avan\u00e9ess par. Dupras et Emard. Cette derni\u00e9re somme paras\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e avec l'entenee entre Dupras, Emare et Lamoureux, que la difference entre $3,000 et $5,453677 (ou 65 pour cent des $8,389.34), savoir $2,453.67 serait partag\u00e9e entre eux trois, ce qui donnait $817.69 pour chacun des trois. IlI y a une l\u00e9g\u00e9re diff\u00e9rence due \u00e0. leur mani\u00e8re d'arriver \u00e0 ces chiffres parce qu'il ont d\u00e9dutt $819.48, pour la part de Lamoureux des $5,453.67, laissant $4.633.67 pour laquelle Lamoureux donna a Dupras et Emard cinq billets pro-missoires \u00e0 des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances variant de deux \u00e0 douze mois \u00e0 compter du 11 janvier 1884.\nGet arrangement assez \u00e9trang\u00e9 est bas\u00e9 sur I'id\u00e9e que les $8389344 de billets avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9s de la Banque d'Echange pour $3,000 avanc\u00e9es par Dupras et Emard, donnant aux acqu\u00e9reurs droit a 65 pour cent en vertu de la composition, mais en laissant completement de C\u00f4t\u00e9 Brossard et Chaput qui, s'ils avaient pay\u00e9 en qualit\u00e9 d'endosseurs, (accommodattion indorsers) avaient le m\u00ebme droit qu'eux aux dits billets.\nLe document suivant qui est en preuve coiitredit la th\u00e9orie que les billets out \u00e9t\u00e9 ache\u00e9ss pour $3000 de m\u00ebme qu'il constate que le paiement fait a la banque \u00e9tait le plein montant des $8,000, comme il est prouv\u00e9 par les quatre cheques auxquels il a deja \u00e9t\u00e9 fait allusion. Ce document est un ordre adress\u00e9 par les endorsers \u00e0 la banque, comme ayant l\u00e9gitimement le contr\u00f4le des billets. Il est ainsi concu:\u2014\nMONTREAL, 9th January, 1884.\nTo the Liquidators of the Exchange Bank of Canada.\nPlease remit to our attorney Mr. J. U. Emard all the notes endorsed by us and held by the Exchange Bank, upon payment of five thousand nine hundred and thirty-four dollars and eighty-six cents, $5,934.86.\nBROSSARD, CHAPUT & CO.\nDans son examen an sujet de cet ordre, monsieur Brossard persiste \u00e0 dire, comme il l'a fait d'ailleurs dans tout son t\u00c9moignage, que le r\u00e9glement avec la banque n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un seul et m\u00e9me reglement pour $8000 dont lui et sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ont avanc\u00e9 $3,000. il faut, comme il a d\u00e9ja \u00e9t\u00e9 remarqu\u00e9, faire la distinction entre les arrangements pour se procurer les fonds, et la transaction avec la banciue. I ne chose qui paralt assez claire est que les $5,000 de billets, quoique compris dans la composition avec la banque, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9spar les autres parties comme appartenant \u00e0 Mme Lamou-reux comme si elle les avaient rachet\u00e9s avec ses $2000. L'ordre que l'on vient de lire n'avait rapport qu'aux autres billets endss\u00e9ss par Brossard et Chaput et, nulle-ment aux $5000 de billets. Cet ordre n'a pas d'autre importance maintenant que comme une reconnaissance des droits des endssseurs des billets que l'aurre version de l'arrangement consid\u00e9re comme appartenant \u00e0 Du-pras et \u00e0 Emard.\nDe la part de Dupras et Emard, la transaction n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un pr\u00ebt pour laquelle ils out stipul\u00e9 pour leur profit un int\u00e9r\u00ebt exorbitant, et de la part de Brossard et Chaput un autre pr\u00ebt de $3,000 dont ils devaient \u00ebtre rembours\u00e9s par le billet de Lamoureux dont le paiement \u00e9tait garanti par une hypoth\u00e9que qui n'\u00e9tait pas donn\u00e9e seulement en consideration de ce pr\u00ebt, mais aussi en consideration de l'existence d'une hypoth\u00e9qe ant\u00e9-rieure qu'ils avaient quittan\u00e9e.\nCette analyse des faits de la cause, \u00e9tablit que de la part de Dupras et Emard, les intim\u00e9s, la transaction n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un pr\u00ebt pour lequel' ils out stipul\u00c9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat exorbitant, et de la part de Brossard et Chaput un autre pret de $3000 dont ils devaient \u00ebtre rembours\u00e9s par le billet de Lamoureux, de $2,934866, garanti par l'hy-poth\u00e9qu\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par lui, le 8 janvier 1884, et aussi en consideration de la d\u00e9charge de l'hypotheque de $7,415, du 5 septembre 1881. Le r\u00e9sultat de ces deux transactions fut de r\u00e9duire la premiere hypoth\u00e9que des appe-lants de $7415 au montant de celle donn\u00e9e comme garantie du billet de $2,934866, c'est-\u00e0-dire $3,000. Au lieu de douner une main levee partielle de la premi\u0141re hypoth\u00e9que ils pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9rent l'acquttter et en cons-tituer une nouvelle.\nLorsque le billet dc $2,931. 86 de Lamoureux fut conseni! aux appelants, afin de lui faire obtenir l;es-compte pour les $3,000 que devaient lui faire avoir Brossard et Chaput, le 5 janvier 1884, les intim\u00e9s Dupras et Emard, n'\u00e9taient pas alors cr\u00e9anciers de Lamoureux; ils ne l'etaient pas non plus, le 8 janvier 1884, lorsque Lamoureux garantit le paiement de son billet par l'y-potheaue donn\u00e9 le du m\u00ebe mois. Ils ne sont devenus les cr\u00e9nciers de Lamoureux que le onze de ianvier 1884 et n'ont partant aucuns droits comme cr\u00c9anciers subs\u00c9quents d'attaquer les transactions faites entre Lamoureux et les appelanss pour se procurer les fonds n\u00e9essaires pour acquitter sa composition. La composition qu'il venai de faire avec ses cr\u00e9anciers lui avait rendu la libre disposition de ses biens, et il n'en fait qu'un usage l\u00e9gitime en donnant cette hypo- th\u00e8que de $3,000 sur ses biens pour l'aider \u00e0 sortir de I'\u00e9tat d'onsolvabilite. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu par cette cour dans la cause de Beausoleil v. Normand ([7]).\nIl serait plus qu'\u00e9trange de consid\u00e9rer cette transac-tion comme faite en fraude des cr\u00e9auciers de Lamoureux lorsqu'elle n'a \u00e9videmment pas d'autre but que de l'aider dans ses arrangements avec ses cr\u00e9anciers,\u2014et il le serait encore davantage de la consid\u00e9rer comme une injuste preference accord\u00e9e aux appelants lorsqu'ils n'ont fait que renoncer a une hypoth\u00e9que de $7,415 pour en accepter une seulement de 2,934.86 comme garantie du billet du montant qu'ils avan^aient a Lamoureux pour payer sa composition. En outre si les intimes avaient un droit d'action pour attaquer ces transactions ils devaient en vertu de l'acticle 1040 du code civil l'exercer dans lann\u00e9e. Ils ont en connais-sance de l'acte du 8 janvier enregistr\u00e9, le 13, et leur action n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise que dans le mois de juin 1885. plus d'un an apr\u00e9s les transactions dont il s'agit, et a une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 leur droit d'action avait cess\u00e9 d'exister.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre aliou\u00e9.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This was an action by Dupras et al. under article 1032 of the Civil Code to annul certain acts and notes as fraudulent, and to oblige the defendants Brossard & Chaput, to return the amount of $2,000 to them paid by the defendant Lamoureux in virtue of the aforesaid acts and notes with conclusions against the other defendant Lamoureux for $3,612.95.\nThe plaintiffs allege:\u2014\n\" That towards the month of December 1883 the defendant Lamoureux then an insolvent offered to pay his creditors the sum of acts in the dollar, on the amount due to each creditor respectively, payable at 4 8 and 12 months.\n\" That offer was accepted by all his creditors with the exception of the Exchange Bank. It reads in the following terms: \u2014\n\"We, the undersigned, creditors of MM. Charles Lamoureux & Co., merchants and manufacturers of Coaticooke, agree by these presents to accept sixty-five cents on the dollar on the amount of our respec-tive claims, payable by note to their order at four, eight and twelve months from date.\"\nu On the remittance of the notes as heretofore mentioned, we agree to give them a full discharge, and we promise to sign an agreement before a notary, if such be required, and we have signed on condition that the creditors for $100 sign the present composition.\"\n\" Montreal, 28th November, 1883.\"\n\"That the defendants,; Brossard & Chaput, were parties to this contract and signed it the first, and in fact it was signed and accepted by all the creditors of Lamoureux with the only exception of the Exchange Bank of Canada.\"\n\" That a part of the claim which Brossard & Chaput then held against Lamoureux consisted of certain notes to the amount of $8355.22 signed by Lamoureux to the order of Brossard & Chaput, and transferred by the latter to the Exchange Bank of Canada.\"\n\" That the said bank refused to join in the agreement, but declared their willingness to accept $3,000 in lieu of acts. payable by Lamoureux, on condition that the 35cts. remaining would be paid by Brossard & Chaput, the whole to be paid in cash.\"\n\" That at the request of the defendants the plaintiffs consented to pay those $3,000 to the Exchange Bank, on remission to them by the latter of the notes for $8,385522, and then to accept from Lamoureux in exchange for these his own notes to the amount of $4,633.62.\"\n\" That the defendants would not have consented to pay the said sum of $3,000 save on the faith of the compromise made by Lamoureux with his creditors, especially Brossard & Chaput who owned the heaviest claim against Lamoureux.\"\n\" That while Brossard & Chaput openly signed and accepted the aforementioned agreement by which they consented to give Lamoureux a full discharge of his indebtedness in consideration of his notes to the amount of 65 cents on the dollar they secretly and fraudulently exacted from him a further note for $2,934.86, that is to say for the amount of the 35cts. that they had consented to pay to the Exchange Bank, in discharge of their own liability and indebtedness to the hank, beyond the 65cts. for which they had compromised with Lamoureux. These $2,934.86 represent to a cent the proportion of thirty-five per cent in the above sum of $8385.52, the amount of the Lamou-reux's notes held by the Exchange Bank, bearing the endorsation of Brossard & Chaput.\"\n\" That to secure the advantage thus fraudulently obtained over all the other creditors of Lamoureux Brossard & Chaput induced Lamoureux to give them a mortgage on his immovable property, which was done by an act passed the 8th January, 1884, before Pepin, notary, said mortgage, to the amount of $3,000, being especially to secure the payment of the above' note of $2,934.86.\"\n\" That said note and mortgage were made and given without a lawful consideration and in fraud of all the other creditors of Lamoureux and especially of the plaintiffs, and for the purpose of giving an illegal and fraudulent advantage and preference to Brossard & Chaput.\n\" That by an act bearing date the 12th January, 1884, Brossard & Chaput, transferred the above men-tioned hypothec to La Banque du Peuple, as security for the payment of the same note which they consented to discount for them the same day.\"\n\" That by another act, passed the 10th December, 1884 between Lamoureux and Brossard & Chaput, Lamoureux agreed that said hypothec would exist as long as anything was due by him to said Brossard & Chaput, whether on account of the note for $2,934866, or any other note.\"\n\" That all rights or claims salling to Brossard & Chaput in consequence of the last act were transferred to La Banque du Peuple the 19th of the same month, (December, 1884).\"\n\" That all the aforementioned deeds (or acts) were duly registered.\"\n\" That at the time of the passing of those deeds Lamoureux was to the knowledge of Brossard & Chaput, and to that of La Banque du Peuple, no-tori-ously insolvent and has been so ever since and is still insolvent.\"\n\" That Brossard & Chaput received on account of the above note of $2934866 the sum of at least $2,000, as a fraudulent privilege over the other creditors of Lamoureux.\"\n\" That at the time of the transfers of the 12th January and 19th December, 1884 the notes that such transfers were destined to guarantee were not yet matured and that these transfers were made to La Banque du People in violation of the law and of its charter.\"\n\" That the plaintiffs have had no knowledge of those deeds and the aforementioned fraudulent pay- ments until three months previous to the institution of their present action.''\n\" That Lamoureux still owes to the plaintiffs, in virtue of the notes for $4,633.22, a sum of $3,612.95.\"\n\" Wherefore the plaintiffs pray that Lamoureux be condemned to pay them the said sum of $3622.95 with interest and costs; that the deeds (acts) of the 8th and 11th January, and of the 13th and 19th December, 1884, and the note of the 5th January of the same year and all other notes given in renewal of these, be declared fraudulent, null and of no effect, and be annulled, and that Brossard & Chaput be condemned to deposit in the prothonotary's office of this court the sum of $2,000, or all other sums that can be proven to have been received by them from Lamoureux on account of the note of $2,944.86, with interest, in order that the same be divided between the creditors of the latter according to law, and that in default of so doing, within 15 days of the service of notice, they be purely and simply condemned to pay that amount to the plaintiffs, with interests and costs the said amounts to be, by the latter parties, deposited and distributed in the above mentioned manner.\"\nThe mise en cause, La Banque du Peuple, filed a declaration in the case that they were willing to abide by the judgment to be rendered by the court (s'en rap-portant \u00e0 justice).\nThe defendants Brossard & Chaput and the defendant Lamoureux filed separate pleas, but substantially offered the same moyens de defense, as follows: that the plaintiffs only became creditors of Lamoureux after the contract between him and the defendants Brossard & Chaput; that the plaintiffs were not subrogated in the rights of the Exchange Bank; that they knew of the transactions complained of and made between the defendants at the time they took place, and their action was therefore prescribed, more than one year having elapsed before it was instituted; that the defendants Brossard & Chaput had only accepted the compounding (composition) of the defendant Lamoureux for the amount of $11,384.98, besides $100 lent to the defendant Lamoureux, not including the $8,385.22, amount of the latter's notes transferred by them to the Exchange Bank; that the Exchange Bank was creditor of Lamoureux to the total amount of $14752.14, and that it did not consent to accept & composition, but offered to return the notes forming the basis of its claim against Lamoureux, in consideration of the cash payment of the sum of $8000; that Lamoureux then asked from the defendants Brossard & Chaput a loan of $3,000 to clear himself of the Exchange Bank to which the latter agreed on condition that Lamoureux would give them an hypothecary guarantee, and that it was in execution of these agreements that Lamoureux gave them the note of the 5th January, 1884, payable four months from the date thereof for $2,934.86, and gave them the hypothecary guarantee of the 8th of the same month; that Brossard & Chaput paid Lamoureux the said sum of $8000 to the know-ledge of the plaintiff Emard; that after said arrangements Lamoureux borrowed from the plaintiffs a further sum of $3,000, and at that period Lamoureux was solvent; that the note for $2,934.86 does not re-present the amount for which Lamoureux was previously discharged by his acte de composition.\nu That, moreover, in December, 1883, the defendants Brossard & Chaput held on Lamoureux's immovables hypothecary guarantees to the amount of $7,415; that without being obliged, but to help Lamoureux, they gave him acquittance (main levee) of their hypothec, by a deed passed the 8th January, 1884; that the plaintiffs, knowing Lamoureux to be insolvent, wished to make a speculation and instead of taking guarantees upon his property for what they advanced, they exacted usurious interest; that in fine the immovables belonging to Lamoureux and hypothecated to the defendants Brossard & Chaput were sold to J. S. Bousquet, who undertook to pay off all the hypothecary debts attached to them and agreed in case certain hypothecs should be annulled, to place the amount in rightful hands to be distributed amongst the creditors.\"' Then the defendants declared themselves ready to consent that after the payment of the loan of $3,000 with interest at 8 per cent per year, all existing balances on the said hypothec should be placed in the hands of those legally authorized to receive them to he distributed amongst the creditors, and they demanded the dismissal of the plaintiff's action.\nThe plaintiffs replied that Lamoureux's notes endorsed by Brossard & Chaput to the amount of $8,385.52 were withdrawn from the Exchange Bank with $3,000 furnished by the plaintiffs to pay the composition of 65 cents on the dollar payable by Lamoureux, and by means of $2,944.66 paid by Brossard & Chaput to clear Off the 35 cents on the dollar that were not covered by the composition; as to the surplus of the debt held by the Exchange Bank against Lamoureux, Brossard & Chaput had nothing to do with it and it was settled by the amount of $2,000 paid by Lamoureux himself, that is by his wife; that it appears by the agreement that Brossard & Chaput were the first to sign the agreement (concordat) without reserve.\nThe Superior Court granted the plaintiff's conclusions for $3612.55 against Lamoureux and declared null and void the notes by him given to the other two defendants of the 5th January, 1884, and the deeds of 8th and 11th January and of the 16th and 19th December, 1884. The Court of Appeal unanimously confirmed 35\u00bd that judgment. Brossard & Chaput now appeal Lamoureux does not.\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. It results clearly from the evidence that when respondents consented to advance $3,000, on the belief that they would stand for being repaid on the same footing as all the other creditors who had consented to take 65c in the dollar,' Brossard & Chaput were behind their back get-ting that new note of $2,934.86, saddling Lamoureux's estate with that new indebtedness, and what was still worse, were getting ahead of all the other creditors by means of a mortgage affecting as security for the payment of that new and secret debt, the best and clearest part of Lamoureux's estate, its immovables, and of the fraudulent character of such a transaction there can be no doubt.\nThe appellants contend, however, that even assuming this point against them, yet the respondents under art. 1039 CC. have no action to get these dealings set aside because they were not then creditors of Lamoureux, having become so only a few days subsequently.\nThis point has been disposed of by the learned judge in the Superior Court by saying that all the divers deeds, notes and agreements formed, with the concordat, but one and a continuous transaction, which was affected and vitiated by the work of deception and concealment conducted by the appellants with the apparent intent on their part to gain an undue advantage on the respondents and all the other creditors of Lamoureux.\nAs a matter of fact this is undoubtedly so, and on this ground alone the appellants' contention based on art. 1039 C.C. fails, without it being necessary to consider respondents' contention that they had become by- operation of law subrogated to the Exchange Bank. PATTERSON J.\u2014 Lamoureux, who was insolvent, effected a composition with his creditors, the terms of which are set out in an instrument which bears date the 28th of November, 1883, but which, according to the evidence, was not completed until the 20th of the following December. The instrument, which is very short, is in these words:\u2014\nNous, soussign\u00e9s, cr\u00e9anciers de MM. Charles Lamoureux & Cie, marchands et manufacturiers de Coaticook, nous engageons par les pr\u00e9sentes a accepter une composition de soixante et cinq (Go) centions dans le dollar sur le montant de nos cr\u00e9ances respectives, payable par billets a leur ordre, \u00e0 quatre, huit et douze mois de cette date.\nSur remise des billets comme ci-dessus nous lear donnerons leur d\u00e9charge et promettons signer un acte par devant Notaire si nous en sommes requis, et avons sign\u00e9 \u00e0 condition que les cr\u00e9anciers audessus de $100 signent cette composition. Montreal, 28 novembre 1883.\nThen followed the signatures of Brossard, Chaput& Cie who are the present appellants, and of all the other creditors of Lamoureux with the exception of the Exchange Bank. The respondents Dupras and Emard are not among the signers. They became creditors after the date of the instrument.\nThe Exchange Bank was a large creditor of Lamoureux, but being in liquidation preferred to compound for a payment in cash to joining in the composition for 65 per cent on time.\nLamoureux's liabilities to the bank may be called in round numbers $14,000. For upwards of $5,000 of that amount he was liable as endorser of customers' notes. The remainder, being $8,389344, was represented by his own notes on which the appellants Brossard & Chaput were accommodation endorsers.\nThere is a discrepancy in the accounts given of the arrangement with the bank.\nThe appellant Brossard, who was examined as a witness on behalf of his opponents the respondents, says that the bank received $8,000 in satisfaction of the $14,000. He says that $3,000 of that amount was a loan from him and his partner to Lamoureux. He took from Lamoureux a promissory note for $2,934.86, and to secure payment of that sum Lamoureux gave him a mortgage for $3,000. That is the transaction which this action is brought to set aside as fraudulent against the other creditors. Brossard gives an explanation of the note not being for the even sum of $3,000 by reference to some items of charges which he says Lamoureux paid to the Ontario Bank; and he says that the whole amount of $3000 was handed to Mr. Emard, who, as attorney for Lamoureux. conducted the negotiations with the Exchange Bank. According to Brossard the arrangement with the bank was a direct and simple composition of $8,000 for $14,000, the $8,000 being made up of $2000 advanced by Lamoureux's wife, $3,000 obtained from the respondents Dupras and Emard, and $3,000 from Brossard.\nThis, on the face of it, contains nothing improbable, the payment being about 57 per cent cash in place of a promise to pay 65 per cent at four, eight and twelve months.\nThe other account is given by Lamoureux, and is supported by Emard if we look only at some of his direct statements. Whether his evidence as a whole including the documentary part of it, really does sup-port it or is not rather confirmatory of the account given by Brossard is a matter to be considered.\nThe account given by Lamoureux is that the two debts of $5,000 or thereabouts and of $8,389.34, were settled separately with the bank, the $2,000 contributed by Madame Lamoureux being accepted in satisfaction of the $5,000 debt, and the $3,000 borrowed from the respondents being accepted in satisfaction of 65 per cent of the $8,389.44, leaving the appellants Brossadd & Chaput to pay, as endorsers, the other 35 per cent, which they did, taking from Lamoureux his note for the exact amount of the 35 per cent viz. $2,984.86.\nIf this piecemeal arrangement was made with the bank it is evident that it had very little reference to the 65 per cent composition that was offered to the creditors generally. According to the statement the bank accepted about 40 per cent for the $5,000 claim; confined its claim on the endorsers of the $8389 44 of notes to 35 per cent of that amount, though why it should have done so is not explained; and accepted another 35 per cent from the insolvents in place of 65 per cent.\nI am satisfied from careful consideration of the evidence that the bank did not enter into that arrangement, but compounded, as one transaction, for 57 per cent in cash of its whole claim of nearly $14,000 in lieu of 65 per cent on time.\nI do not doubt that a scheme such as that deposed to by Lamoureux was discussed among the parties with some of the bank people as well as amongst the others, and I think that in giving evidence in the action the actual arrangement with the bank has been sometimes spoken of as if it was the same as that which had been talked of among the other parties but not carried out with the bank. There seems to be some confusion in this respect. One of the liquidators of the bank was a witness for the respondents. He shows that there was or may have been a proposition to settle the $5,000 claim by itself but that before a settlement of that claim had been decided on it was insisted that one settlement should be made of. the whole debt. The effect of his testimony is that, as far as the bank was concerned, there was one composition of $8000 for the $14,000. I take Mr.Emard's evidence to really bear out that understanding. He shows that an offer was made to the bank to pay $1,500 for the notes which amounted to $5,115.84. That offer was made by letter of Mr. Emard dated 17th December 1884. It was not accepted. Then Mr. Emard says that he verbally made an offer of $2,000 which the authorities of the bank seemed disposed to accept, but before definitely accepting it and declaring themselves ready to settle for the amount they manifested the desire that their other claim against Lamoureux which was secured by the endorsement of Brossard & Chaput, amounting (as he gives the figures) to $8,385322, should also be settled.\nIn this Mr. Emard agrees with what is told us by Mr. Campbell the liquidator.\nMr. Emard then speaks of what was done towards providing for the larger claim. He says that Lamoureux, being able to pay only $2,000, asked Emard to make an offer to redeem (racheter) those notes, where-upon he first ascertained that he could procure $3,000 through Mr. Dupras, and then made a proposition to the bank. I have been desirous of seeing the terms of that proposition. It was noted, Mr. Emard tells us, on a telegraph blank which was produced in evidence but which I have not been able to find. It is said not now to be with the record. I have been more anxious to see it because other documents which were not set out in the printed case before us but which remained with the record and have been sent up do not fully sustain Mr. Emard in the view of the settlement which his oral evidence presents His recollection seems to be that what he paid to the Exchange Bank was not $8,000 but only $7,934.56, that sum being composed of Madame Lamoureux's $2000, of the $3000 advanced by Dupras and Emard, and of $2934.56 from Brossard & Chaput. But the cheques by which he paid the moneys are produced and are for the full amount of $8,000. There were four cheques, viz.,$1,000, $2,000. $3,000 and $2,000 the amounts not being thus divided by referenee to the sources from which the money came, but for convenience in retiring the notes which were held by different banks.\nFrom this evidence I cannot resist the conviction that on the part of the Exchange Bank there was simply one composition for $8,000, and that the bank dealt only with Lamoureux, or with Emard representing Lamoureux, and not with the appellants Brossard & Chaput. Those gentlemen contributed a part of the money. Brossard says it was $3,000, the same amount for which the mortgage was given by Lamoureux, and the amount which we find from the wrttten evidence of Emard's cheques was paid to the bank. I am satisfled that whatever money he raised, whether the full $3,000, or $65 44\/100 short of that sum, was raised because he was exposed to be called on as endorser of the $8,000 of notes, and I do not see any reason to doubt That the amount for which he took the note, and which was precisely 35 per cent of the full amount of the notes, was arrived at by a reckoning based on the notion that 65 per cent would be provided for in some way by Lamoureux. But the actual settlement being the acceptance from Lamoureux of a sum which seems to allow a fairly liberal discount for cash, being as I have said about 57 per cent in place of 65, making a rebate of $11100 or so which was 12 per cent of what the composition at 65 per cent would have come to, I do not see that the motive which led Brossard to raise the money is so material, or that the $3,000 advanced by him differs, in its relation to the general creditors, from the $3,000 advanced by Dupras and Emard. The last named sum was advanced, as it appears, upon an understanding between Dupras, Emard and Lamoureux that the difference between $3,000 and $5,453.07 (which was 65 per cent of the $8,389.34), viz., $2,453078, was to be shared among the three. That would seem to give $117.69 to each of the three. There is a slight difference as they computed the figures, for they deducted $819455 as the share of Lamoureux from $5,453077, leaving $4,633.62, and for that amount Lamoureux gave to Dupras and Emard his five promis-sory notes at dates from two to twelve months from the 11th of January, 1884.\nThis somewhat remarkable arrangement is based on the idea that the $8,389344 of notes were bought from the Exchange Bank for $3,000, giving the purchasers the right to rank for 65 per cent under the composition arrangement, but ignoring Brossard & Chaput, who, if they paid money in the character of endorsers, and accommodation endorsers, would certainly have had some right to the notes.\nWe have in evidence the following document which is not consistent with the theory that the notes were purchased for $3,000, nor on the other hand with the proved fact that the payment made to the hank was the full $8,000 as evidenced by the four cheques already referred to, but which, being an order addressed by the endossers to the bank properly treats the endorsers as the persons entitled to control the notes:\u2014\nMONTREAL, 9th January, 1884.\nTo the Liquidators of the Exchange Bank of Canada:\nPlease remit to our attorney Mr. J. U. Emard. all the notes endorsed by us and held by the Exchange Bank upon payment of five thousand nine hundred and thirty-four dollars and eighty-six cents, $5,934.86.\nBROSSARD, CHAPUT & Co.\nMr. Brossard when examined with reference to this order insisted, as he did throughout his evidence, that the settlement with the bank was one settlement for $8,000, $3000 of which was advanced by his firm. We must keep in mind, as before noticed, the distinction between arrangements about procuring funds and the transaction with the bank. One thing that seems clear enough is that the $5,000 of notes, although included in the one composition with the bank, were yet, as between the other parties understood as going to Madame Lamoureux as if redeemed by her $2000. The order just read deals with the other notes and not with the $5,000 worth.\n\"Whatever importance attaches at present to the order seems to me to be in its recognition of the legal right of the endorsers to the notes, which is ignored in the arrangement which treated them as belonging to Dupras and Emard.\nThe real transaction seems to have been a loan of $3000 from Dupras and Emard for which those gentlemen were to be paid an exorbitant rate of interest, and another loan of $3,000 from Brossard & Chaput which they were to be repaid according to the tenor of the promissory note given them by Lamoureux, payment being secured by a mortgage given, not only in consideration of that loan but in substitution for a previous mortgage which they released.\nI think this case turns essentially on the questions of fact in which I cannot agree with the understanding of the evidence acted on in the court below.\nThe plaintiffs found their right to attack the transaction with the defendants on their subrogation to the rights of the Exchange Bank as holders of the $8,000 of notes. in that sense only are they parties to the composition. My conclusion is that they are not holders of the notes but that the notes were satisfied by the composition paid to the bank, the plaintiffs being simply creditors of Lamoureux for the $3,000 they lent him. I am not now disputing the power of Lamoureux to promise to repay the plaintiffs their loan with abnormal interest, I am merely dealing with their locus standi as compounding creditors. I do not think they sustain that character and therefore, in my opinion, they have no right to maintain this action. Further I am not satisfied, that the position of the defendants is open to successful attack by any com-pounding creditor. I think the proper conclusion from the whole evidence is that the money paid by the defendants Brossard & Chaput was a loan from them to Lamoureux to assist in the payment of his composition. They were parties to the composition deed, but that was as creditors for another debt. This loan was a later matter and was not subject to the composition deed.\nLamoureux had the right to secure its payment by a pledge of part of his assets. To use the language of James L.J. in Ex parte Burrell ([8]):\nHe had bought the assets from his creditors He was absolute master of those assets in exactly the same way as any other purchaser.\nOr in the language of my brother Strong in Beausoleil v. Normand ([9]):'\nHe was left free to deal with his assets as he thought fit, subject only to this that, like every other debtor, he was bound not to make any fraudulent disposition of them so as to defeat the just claims of his creditors.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mercier, Beausoleil, Choquette Sf Martineau.\nSolicitors for respondents: Ouimet & Emard.\n[1] 2.

JUSTICE PATTERSON IN CHAMBERS.)\nElection petition\u2014Appeal\u2014Dissolution of Parliament\u2014Return of deposit.\nIn the interval between taking of an appeal from a decision delivered on the 8th November, 1890, in a controverted election petition and the February sittings (1891) of the Supreme Court of Canada, parliament was dissolved, and by the effect of the dissolution the petition dropped. The respondent subsequently, in order to have the costs that were awarded to him at the trial taxed and paid out of the money deposited in the court below by the petitioner as security for costs, moved before a judge of the Supreme Court in chambers (the full court having referred the motion to a judge in chambers) to have the appeal dismissed for want of prosecution, or to have the record remitted to the court below. The petitioner asserted his right to have his deposit returned to him.\nHeld, per Patterson J., that the final determination of the right to costs being kept in suspense by the appeal the motion should be refused.\nHeld, also, inasmuch as the money deposited in the court below ought to be disposed of by an order of that court the registrar of this court should certify to the court below that the appeal was not heard, and that the petition dropped by reason of the dissolution of Parliament on the 2nd February, 1891.\nMotion to dismiss an appeal in an election case for want of prosecution.\nThe full court, Taschereau J. dissenting, held that the application should be made to a judge in chambers. The facts are stated in the judgment of Patterson J. hereinafter given. Kerr Q.C. for the respondent accordingly applied to His Lordship Mr. Justice Patterson in chambers.\nAylesworth Q.C. for the petitioner opposed the motion.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This petition was presented as long ago as October, 1888, and appears to have been brought to trial with reasonable speed, the trial having been begun on the 30th January, 1889. But, though begun at that time, it was not brought to a close until the last week of October, 1890, and the judgment dismissing the petition and awarding costs to the respondent was pronounced on the 8th of November, 1890. It is not material to attempt to apportion the responsibility for this waste of two years before reaching a decision, so unlike the promptness which is aimed at by the law respecting controverted elections, but it may not be out of the way, in view of the emergency which has led to the present application, to remark that, from the affidavits made for the purpose of former applications to this court, it is clear that a large share of the delay arose from the circumstance that, from one cause or another, it was not always convenient for the respondent's solicitors to give timely attention to the proceedings. This is true of the steps necessary to prepare the appeal for being heard as well as of the trial, although there are some sweeping statements to the contrary contained in the affidavits made on the part of the respondent by a gentleman who evidently was not so well informed respecting what had taken place as he supposed himself to be.\nThe petitioner appealed against the decision of the 8th of November, 1890. In the ordinary course the appeal would have been heard at the February sittings in the present year, 1891, but before those sittings began Parliament was dissolved. By the effect of the dissolution the petition dropped. The object of the contest had ceased to exist. If authority were required for that understanding, it is furnished by the cases cited to me, The Exeter Case, Carter v. Mills[1], and The Taunton Case, Marshall v. James[2]. The dissolution took place on the 2nd February. On the part of the petitioner an order had been obtained on that day from the registrar of this court settling what materials were to printed for use in the appeal, but after the dissolution the petitioner, properly in my opinion, took no further proceedings in this court. The respondent is desirous of having the costs that were awarded to him at the trial taxed and paid out of the money deposited in the court below by the petitioner as security for costs, and with that view he has moved to have the appeal dismissed for want of prosecution, or to have the record remitted to the court below.\nOn the other hand the petitioner asserts his rights to have his deposit returned to him on the principle acted on in The Exeter Case, Carter v. Mills (1), on the ground that the petition has dropped before any final adjudication respecting either the merits or the costs.\nThe respondent would be entitled to be paid his costs out of the deposit if the proceedings under our Controverted Elections Act were the same as under the English Act of 1868, which our act follows in many of its provisions. The Taunton Case (2) would be, as I think, authority for holding that the adjudication as to costs could be sustained and enforced notwithstanding the dissolution of the House before the judge had made his report to the speaker, which dissolution put an end to the petition as far as the right to the seat was concerned. But we must notice the difference between the English law and ours. The English act gave no appeal from the judge's decision. It was final both as to the merits and the costs Our statute gives an appeal to this court which is to \"pronounce such judgment upon questions of law or of fact, or both, as in the opinion of such court ought to have been given by the court or judge appealed from[3], and may adjudge the whole or any part of the costs in the court below to be paid by either of the parties.\"[4]\nThe respondent, therefore, cannot insist that he has a final judgment in his favour for the costs. If the appeal had gone on the result might have been that he would have to pay in place of receiving costs. Hence the importance to the respondent to have the order he asks for to dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution if the case were one for giving him that relief That is, however, out of the question. He had no tenable ground on which he could, on the second of February, or at any later date, charge the petitioner with default in the prosecution of the appeal. On the 2nd of February the petition dropped. It did not abate in the technical sense of that word but the effect was quite as fatal. In the Exeter case, in which an order was made to return the deposit to the petitioner, the petition had not gone to trial when the dissolution took place. I suppose it would have been dealt within the same way if the trial had been begun and not concluded. That is essentially the present position, the final determination of the right to costs as well as of the right to the seat being kept in suspense by the appeal.\nI do not see my way to make an order in either of the forms asked for by the respondent, and I think his motion must be refused with costs.\nI should not consider it right, even with a view to the petitioner being repaid his deposit, to send the record back to the court below. That would be proper only in case the appeal had been disposed of in some shape in this court, and if done now might lead to misapprehension. But inasmuch as the money deposited in the court below ought to be disposed of by an order of that court it would, in my opinion, be proper for the registrar to certify to that court that the appeal was not heard, and that the petition dropped by reason of the dissolution of parliament on the 2nd of February.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Moss, Hoyles & Aylesworth.\nSolicitors for respondent: Kerr, MacDonatd, Davidson & Paterson.\n[1] L.

On an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada taken by H et oil\nHeld, that the appellants not having shown that the judgment was delivered subsequent to the passing of the amending act the court had no \"jurisdiction.\nQuery\u2014Whether an appeal will lie from a judgment pronounced after the passing of the amending act in an action pending before the change of the law.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada sitting in review.\nOn the 30th September, 1891, the Superior Court for Lower Canada sitting in review confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court, dismissing the contestation by appellants of the sworn statement made by J. Durocher (insolvent) upon the abandonment of his property, and on the same day the Supreme and Exchequer Courts amending Act, 1891, was sanctioned. There was no evidence at what hour the judgment was delivered. Geoffrion Q.C. for the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the statute passed during the last session of the Federal Parliament, amending the general act of the Supreme Court, could not apply in the present case inasmuch as the said statute was only sanctioned after the judgment was rendered by the Court of Review and because the said statute could not affect the present case, as the case was then pending and the act had no retroactive effect\nCharbonneau (Brosseau with him) opposed the motion.\nThe further ground was taken that the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Amending Act was ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament in so far as the provision in question was concerned, but the court having stated that this could not he argued unless the Attorney General for the Dominion was made a party counsel for respondent abandoned it.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. I have no doubt that the judgment rendered in this case by the Court of Review is not appealable to this court. It was upon the appellant to show that the statute allowing appeals from judgments of the Court of Review was in force at the time this judgment was delivered. He has not shown this but quite the reverse and therefore has not fulfilled the condition precedent to enable him to appeal. But even granting that the delivery of the judgment was simultaneous with the passing of the act I am of opinion that it would not give him the right of appeal. It is in vain to say that this is a question of procedure and not one of jurisdiction. It is purely a matter of jurisdiction of this court. We have nothing to do with the right of appeal to the Privy Council. Our jurisdiction depends upon the statute and if the statute was not in force when the judgment was delivered it is quite clear there is no appeal. The motion will be allowed and the appeal quashed with costs.\nSTRONG J. I agree and I should be of the same opinion even if the action had been pending at the time of the passing of the act and judgment had been delivered afterwards, and I rest my opinion on the decision of this court in the case of Taylor v. The Queen ([1]), and on the case of the Attorney-General v. Sillem ([2]) which was cited and relied on so much in the case of The Queen v. Taylor (1). It is true that I dissented in The Queen v. Taylor (1), but I am bound by the decision of the court.\nThe coincidence of the statute having been passed on the same day as the judgment was rendered leaves no doubt whatever in my mind. It was upon the party asserting that the case was subject to the new law, to show that the judgment was rendered after the passing of the act and was subject to its provisions, and this has not been done.\nIt is also well known that sometimes courts will look at fractions of a day in order that they shall not give statutory laws an ex post facto effect. That being so in the absence of any evidence to the contrary we are bound to hold that this judgment was rendered prior to and was an existing adjudication at the time of the passing of the statute.\nFOURNIER J. concurred with Sir W. J. Ritchie C.J. that the appeal should be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I will not, and do not consider it necessary to, decide in this case whether an appeal would or would not lie even if the judgment in this case had been delivered subsequent to the passing of the statute. I will remark, however that in the case of Hitchcock v. Way ([3]), the court there held that \" where the law is altered by statute pending an action the law as it existed when the action \"was commenced must decide the rights of the parties, unless the legislature, by the language used shows a clear intention to vary the mutual relation of such parties.\" And in the case of Tue Corpora Lion of the City of Quebec v. Dunbar (1), it was held that \"a court of appeal called upon to review a judgment respecting a matter in relation to which there has been a subsequent declaratory law, will construe the old law and the declaratory law as one and the same enactment, and that the judgment appealed from, although anterior to the declaratory law, is affected by its provisions.\"\nI do not wish to express any decided opinion upon this point, and I prefer to rest my opinion on the fact that in this case the judgment was not delivered sub sequent to the passing of the new law.\nPATTERSON J. I base my opinion in this case entirely upon this one point that it rests upon the appellant to show that at the time of the pronouncing of the judgment this court had jurisdiction. I do not think the appellant ill this case has succeeded in doing that As to the other question whether an appeal would lie from a judgment pronounced after the passing of the amending act in an action pending before the change of the law, I express no opinion. That is a matter that would require serious consideration, and I prefer to rest my opinion upon the one ground that it is for the appellant to show that this court had jurisdiction when the judgment of the court below was pronounced.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for motion: Archambault & St. Louis.\nSolicitors contra: N.

In 1878 the commissioners cancelled the location ticket for default to perform settlement duties.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the registration by the commissioners in 1874 of the transfer to respondent was a waiver of the right of the crown to cancel the location ticket for default to perform settlement duties, and the cancellation was. illegally effected. Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe action was brought at Aylmer, in the district of Ottawa, in March, 1880, by William L. Holland, the present appellant, against John Ross and Frank Ross of Quebec merchants, and two other persons who were acting under their orders and directions, for an alleged trespass upon two tots of land situate in the township of Portland, in the county and district of Ottawa, and being numbers 11 and 12 in the 4th range of lots in that township, of which lots, as by his declaration the plaintiff alleged, he was owner in virtue of a location ticket granted the 9th June, 1863, and asked that the timber cut by the defendants should be returned within a delay to be fixed, and in default that they should be condemned to pay him a sum of four thousand dollars and also asked for two thousand dollars damages, over and above the value of the timber.\nThe defendants pleaded first: \u2014 a demurrer; second, a peremptory exception that the sale from the Department of Crown Lands of the old province of Canada (which had originally been made to George C. Holland and by him transferred to the present appellant) had, on the 28th of May 1878, been cancelled by the Commissioner of Crown Lands of the Province of Quebec and that the lots in question il and 12 in the 4th range of Portland west had been restored to the timber limit held under license by the defendants; third a plea of prescription against the damages; fourth, a general denial.\nOn 20th December, 1872, George C. Holland put it on record with the department that he claimed the arrangement that the settlement duties could be and actually had been, performed on the homestead lot in the neighborhood, and not in the lots in question, by getting the Crown Lands Agent Farley to write the commissioner formulating his claim, that is that double duties or their equivalent had been performed on the homestead lot. Farley saw no objection to the issue of the patent.\nIn 1874 George C Holland transferred to William L Holland, the present appellant, all his rights in the lots in question, all payments due on the lots with interest having been paid, and a fee was accepted by the crown for registering this transfer and a further fee of $3 was actually paid and accepted, for the issuing of the patent which was then demanded.\nOn 28th May 1878 the cancellation of the sale of the lots for non-fulfilment of conditions was determined by the Commissioner of Crown Lands without any notice whatever to the Hollands; was posted on the 1st of June, and published in the Official Gazette of Quebec on the 6th of June the first notice Holland had. On the 23rd September the cancellation was confirmed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. On the 30th December a list of lots was made by the Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands to be returned to the timber license of Ross Bros. including the two lots now in question.\nOn the 9th January 1879 the Assistant Commissioner wrote that the sale had been cancelled and the lots had in consequence, been included in the license of Messrs. Ross Bros. The license is dated 7th March, 1879 but took effect from the 1st of May 1878\nBy the judgment of the Superior Court rendered by Mr. Justice McDougall on the sixth day of October, 1881 the timber in question was declared to be the property of the plaintiff and to have been wrongfully taken from the land and the defendants were condemned to return the trees, &c, or to pay the sum of $1,023 therefor and further $17 damages and costs.\nFrom this judgment defendants appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), Montreal, and the judgment of the Superior Court was reversed, and the cancellation of the lots in question was declared to have been validly made, and the plaintiff's action was in consequence dismissed.\nThe question which arose on this appeal was: Whether the cancellation by the Commissioner of Crown Lands in 1878 of the sale of the lots made to George C. Holland in 1863 was valid.\nLacoste Q.C., and Nicholls, for appellants.\nIrvine Q.C., and Robertson Q.C., for respondents.\nThe points of argument, the statutes and documentary evidence relied on by counsel are fully reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given. See also report of argument in M. L. ft. 2 Q. B. 316.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. The appellant on this appeal contends:\n1st. That having acquired under the statute of 1860, his rights are governed by that statute, and cannot be changed by subsequent legislation.\n2nd. That under the transfer of rights from the late province of Canada to the province of Quebec, in virtue of the Confederation Act, the province of Quebec acquired only the right to collect a certain sum of money, and no rights of cancellation.\n3rd. That if the province of Quebec had any rights with respect to cancellation, such rights were waived (u) by the tacit consent to the written application in 1872 by Mr. Holland that the settlement duties on the homestead should avail on the other lots (b) by the agreement of their agent in 1865, that they should so avail, and (c) by the acceptance, in 1874, of the balance of the purchase money in full with interest with the fee for transfer, accepting and enregistering the same and receiving the fee for the patent.\nUnder section 18 of 28 Vic. cap. 2 it was provided that before any assignment of the purchaser's rights could be validly made or registered \u201c all the conditions of the sale giant or location must have been complied with or dispensed with by the commissioner of crown lands before the registration is made.\" This clause was reproduced in the same words in the statute of 1869, 32 Vie. cap. Il.\nI do not think the Crown Lands Agent Collins had any authority to arrange with George C. Holland, that he (Holland) should perform the settlement duties for the lots now in question in the homestead property where he was living with his father, as the appellant claims he did but I think Holland having on the 29th September 1872, brought such an arrangement with the agent of the Crown Lands Department to the notice of the Department in 1874, George C. Holland having transferred to W. L. Holland all his rights in the lots and all payments due on the lots with interest having been paid and accepted in full, and the fees for registering this transfer paid and accepted, and the transfer having been duly enregistered and a further fee for the issuing of the patent paid and accepted, amounted to all intents and purposes to a dispensing under the statute by the Commissioner of Crown Lands with the compliance with the conditions of the sale, inasmuch as no assignment of the purchaser's rights could be validly made or registered until all the conditions of the sale had been complied with or dispensed with by the commissioner before the registration was made. It therefore, in my opinion, must be assumed that the commissioner acted legally in enregistering the transfer, receiving the fee for so doing, and a further fee of $3 for the issuing of the patent, which he could only have legally done by dispensing with the conditions of sale I do not think anything can be more conclusive than that the Commissioner of Crown Lands at the time of the enregistering of the transfer and receipt of the moneys paid and received by the crown and in view of the facts of the case, dispensed with the strict compliance with the conditions of sale, and in so doing I humbly think he acted as justice and fairness dictated, and as the honour of the crown required, and subsequently the cancellation of the sale for non-fulfilment of conditions on the 28th of May, 1878, was not justifiable, and the license dated the 7th of March, 1879, to Messrs. Ross Bros, was equally unjustifiable; therefore, on this ground, and this alone, I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Upon the argument of this case I was certainly much impressed in favour of the respondent, but a subsequent consideration of the evidence has convinced me that there was waiver of the conditions of the original sale which required the performance of the settlement duties I wish to rest my judgment solely upon the ground that there was such a waiver for the registration of the transfer The conduct of the appellant seems to have been honourable throughout, and what he did was a reasonable and substantial equivalent for the performance of the settlement duties and was done honestly and in good faith under the authority and with the sanction of the government officers prior to the registration of the transfer and must or ought to have been known by Mr. Tach\u00e9 the Deputy Commissioner, when he sanctioned the transfer. The appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J Le jugement soumis \u00e0 la revision de cette cour pal le present appel, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le 21 septembre 1886, par la cour du Banc de la Reine, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans une action port\u00e9e devant la cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district d'Aylmer. L'appelant W. L. Holland r\u00e9clamait de John Ross l'intim\u00e9 la valeur d'une certaine quantit\u00e9 de bois de commerce et des dommages r\u00e9sultant de voies de faits par lui commises sur les terres de l'appelant, dans le township de Portland.\nL'appelant all\u00e9guait dans son action qu'ii \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire en vertu de billets de location, en date du 9 juin 1863, accord\u00e9 par le commissaire des terres, \u00e0 George C. Holland, des lots no 11 et 12 du m\u00eame rang du township de Portland, qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s par le dit George C. Holland.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 d'abord par d\u00e9fenee au fonds en droit et, ensuite par une exception p\u00e9remptoire que la vente faite par le d\u00e9partement des terres de la ci-devant province du Canada, faite \u00e0 George C. Holland et par ce dernier transport\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant, a \u00e9t\u00e9 le 28 mai 1878 cancell\u00e9e par le commissaire des terres de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et que les lots en question, 11 et 12 avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans les limites de sa licence pour coupe de bois; il a aussi plaid\u00e9 prescription pour les dommages et une d\u00e9fense an fonds en fait.\nLe 6 october 1887, l'honorable juge McDougall rendit jugement d\u00e9clarant que le bois en question \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement coup\u00e9 sur les terres de l'appelant et condamna l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre le bois et \u00e0 payer des dommages.\nCe jugement porte en appel \u00e0 la cour du Banc de.la Reine fut renvers\u00e9 et la cancellation de la vente des lots en question d\u00e9clar\u00e9e valable et l'action de l'appelant renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. C'est de ce dernier jugement que le pr\u00e9sent appel est interjet\u00e9 pour le faire d\u00e9clarer erron\u00e9 et faire revivre celui de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nIl.ne s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve sur le pr\u00e9sent appel que la question qui a servi de base an jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine, savoir, si la cancellation de la vente en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement faite par le commissaire des terres. L'appelant s'en est tenu \u00e0 combattre ce motif pour d\u00e9 montrer l'erreur du jugement et faire voir que son action aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre maintenue.\nLe titre de l'appelant aux lots nos il et 12 est un billet de location en date du 9 juin 1883 dans la forme ordinaire, adopt\u00e9e et en usage par le d\u00e9partement des terres publiques, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00fb George C. Holland en a fait l'acquisition. C'est la formule de vente qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en vertu de l'acte 23 Vict., ch. 2, r\u00e9glant alors la vente des terres publiques. L'original du billet de location ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 perdu, les parties l'ont remplac\u00e9 de consentement par le suivant qui est admis comme en \u00e9tant une copie exacte. Il est ainsi con\u00e7u:\nNo. CROWN LANDS AGENCY\n$ Received from the sum of being the first installment of one-fifth of the purchase money of acres of land contained in Lot, No. in the Range of the Township of P.Q., the remainder payable in four equal annual instalments with interest from this date at 6 per cent\nThis sale if not disallowed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands is made subject to the following conditions, viz.: The purchaser to take possession of the land within six months from the date hereof and from that time continue to reside on and occupy the same either by himself or through others, for at least two years, and within four years at furthest from this date, clear and have under crop a quantity thereof in proportion of at least ten acres for every 100 acres, and erect thereon a habitable house of the dimensions of at least 16 by 20 feet-No timber to be cut before the issuing of the patent, except under license or for clearing of the land, fuel, buildings and fences; all timber cut contrary to these conditions will be dealt with as timber cut without permission on public lands. No transfer of the purchaser's right will be recognized in cases where there is default Lin complying with any of the conditions of sale In no case will the patent issue before the expiration of two years of occupation of the land or the fulfilment of the whole of the conditions even though the land be paid for in full, subject also to current licenses to cut timber on the land, and the purchaser to pay for any real improvements now existing thereon, belonging to any other party, and further subject to all mining laws and regulations Il n'est pas inutile de faire remarquer qu'entre ce billet de location et celui imprim\u00e9 dans le factum de l'intim\u00e9, il y a une diff\u00e9rence importante qui a, sans doute, en beaucoup d'influence sur la d\u00e9cision de la cour du Banc de la Reine. Elle consiste dans l'insertion faite par erreur d'un extrait de l'acte 32 Vict., ch. 11, comme faisant partie du billet de location de l'appelant qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis six ans avant la passation de cet acte, en vertu de l'acte alors en force 23 Vict. ch. 2. Cet extrait contient les mots suivants or neglects to comply with, dans les conditions de la vente, doonnant pour la premi\u00e8re fois au commissaire le pouvoir de canceller pour simple n\u00e9gligence de remplir les conditions du billet de location\nPour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause il faut se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la loi en force lors de l'\u00e9mission du billet de location en date du 9 juin 1863, en faveur de George C. Holland Par la 23 Vict. ch. 2 les \"pouvoirs du commissaire des terres quant \u00e0 l'annulation des ventes billets de location on licences d'occupation sont d\u00e9finis et limit\u00e9s ainsi qu'il suit par la section 20:\nIf the Commissioner of Crown Lands is satisfied that any purchaser grantee or locatee or lesssee of any public land, or any assignee claiming under or though him, has been guilty of any fraud or imposition, or has violated any of the conditions of sale, grant, location or lease or of the license of occupation, or if any such sale, grant. location or lease or location of occupation has been or is made or issued in error or mistake, he may cancel such sale, grant, location, lease or license and resume the land therein mentioned, and dispose of it as if no sale grant location or lease thereof bad ever been made.\nPar la section 18 il est pourvu \u00e0 ce qu'aucun transport des droits de l'acqu\u00e9reur ne puisse \u00eatre valablement fait on enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 moins que toutes les conditions de la vente n'aient \u00e9t\u00e9 rempiles on que dispense n'en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le commissaire des terres.\nAll conditions of the sale ground or location must have been complained with or disposed with by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, before the registration is made. Cet acte, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de la l\u00e9gislation subs\u00e9quente n'accorde au commissaire des terres aucun pouvoir de prononcer, en faveur de la Couronne, la confiscation des argents paves ou des am\u00e9liorations faites sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le cas ou la vente serait annul\u00e9e. C'est en vertu de cet acte que le billet de location en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis, sujet \u00e0 la condition que la vente pouvait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e seulement dans le cas o\u00f9 le concessionnaire aurait viol\u00e9 les conditions de la vente.\nGeorge C. Holland avait pris avec l'agent des terres Collins des arrangements pour \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir les conditions d'\u00e9tablissements pour les deux lots sur le homestead property o\u00f9 il vivait avec son p\u00e8re.\nDepuis l'acte de la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration les terres publiques \u00e9tant pass\u00e9es sous le contr\u00f4le de la province de Quebec, une nouvelle l\u00e9gislation a Ot\u00e9 introduite. L'acte 32 Vic, ch. 11 reproduit en entier la section 20 de l'acte 23 Vie, ch. 2, avec une seule exception de l'addition des mots suivants:\u2014or neglected to comply with the conditioss of the sale dans cette clause qui ne donnait le pouvoir d'annuler que dans le cas de violation des conditions, \u00e9tendant ainsi ce pouvoir an cas de simple n\u00e9gligence de se conformer aux conditions de la vente. Mais cette section 20, ainsi amend\u00e9e ne donne encore aucun pouvoir an commissaire des terres de prononcer la confiscation des argents pay\u00e9s on des am\u00e9liorations faites sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLa section 18 de l'acte 23 Vict ch. 2, pourvoyant \u00e0 l'enregistrement des ventes dans le d\u00e9partement des terres est aussi reproduite en entier dans la 32 Vict. ch. 11 et contient aussi la m\u00eame disposition au sujet de l'accomplissement des conditions avant que l'enregistrement puisse \u00eatre fait:\u2014\u2014\nEt toutes les conditions de la vente concession ou location devront avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies ou le commissaire des terres de la Couronne devra avoir dispense de leur accomplissement avant que tel enregistrement soit fait\nC'est en 1872, par l'acte 36 Vict. ch. 8, que pour la premi\u00e8re fois il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'annulation valablement prononc\u00e9e emporterait la peine de la confiscation de tous les argents pay\u00e9s et des am\u00e9liorations faites. Cependant le commissaire \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder telle compensation ou indemnit\u00e9 qu'il croirait juste et rai donnable. Une derni\u00e8re clause de ce statut accordait dans les soixante jours de l'avis de cancellation un appel an lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil. Pendant cc temps le commissaire ne pouvait disposer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe 20 d\u00e9cembre 1870, G. C. Holland repr\u00e9sentant qu'il avait accompli les conditions d'\u00e9tablissement suivant l'arrangement mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, sur le home-stead lot non sur ceux dont il s'agit fit faire par l'agent Farley, une demande an commissaire all\u00e9guant ces faits et r\u00e9clamant sa patente.\nLors du transport par G. C. Holland de tons ses droits \u00e0 \"W. L. Holland, l'appelant, sur les lots en question, tous les paiements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, et la Couronne avait m\u00eame accept\u00e9e un honoraire pour l'enregistrement du transport qui fut fait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le 5 juin 1874 et de plus $3.00 pour l'\u00e9mission de la patente.\nSans aucun avis aux Holland la cancellation de la vente des lots en question pour inex\u00e9cution des conditions fut prononc\u00e9e par le commissaire des terres et les lots r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans les limites de la licence de coupe de bois accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9.\nD'apr\u00e8s cet expos\u00e9 des statuts sur la mati\u00e8re et les faits en preuve en cette cause la cancellation prononc\u00e9e est-elle l\u00e9gale ? La cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la n\u00e9gative, mais son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine.\nOn a vu que la vente annul\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 George C. Holland par billet de location du 9 juin 1863 en vertu de l'acte 23 Vict. ch. 2. C'est sans doute par la loi alors en force que doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s du commissaire. A cette \u00e9poque la loi ne donnait pas an commissaire des terres des pouvoirs aussi \u00e9tends que ceux qui lui furent conf\u00e9r\u00e9s plus tard Il ne pouvait en vertu de la section 20 de cet acte annuler les ventes que pour cause de fraude on violation des conditions de la vente ce n'est que par la m\u00eame Vict, ch. 11 quo le pouvoir de les annuler pour n\u00e9gligence d'accomplir les conditions de la vente lui fut accord\u00e9 Il semble qu'il v aurait une diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 faire entre ces deux dispositions et que la violation des conditions ne peut \u00eatre mise sur le m\u00eame pied que la simple n\u00e9gligence de les accomplir. Le l\u00e9gislateur l'a reconnu en ajoutant, par un acte subs\u00e9quent, au pouvoir d'annuler pour violation des conditions celui d'annuler aussi pour simple n\u00e9gligence de les remplir Cette l\u00e9gislation subs\u00e9quente ne peut sans doute pas s'appliquer au billet de location accord\u00e9 en vertu dune autre loi celle de 1860. C'est cependant en vertu de la m\u00eame Vict, ch. 11 que la cancellation a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e for non-fulment of the conditions thereof. C'est-\u00e0-dire pour une cause qui n'\u00e9tait pas admise par le statut en vertu duquel a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis le billet de location annul\u00e9.\nAinsi le commissaire a contrairement aux autorit\u00e9s donn\u00e9 un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la 32 Vict. ch. 11 qu\u00bf affectait les droits acquis de l'appelant, voir:\u2014\nGuyot, ([2]); Pothier, contrat de vente, ([3]); Dalloz, ([4]); Toullier, ([5]); Potters worries on statutes, ([6]); Hardcastle, ([7]); Maxwellv ([8]); Domat, ([9]). \u00f6 Il est indubitable que los droits de Holland auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par la loi en force lorsqu'il a obtenu son titre.\nIl pourrait s'\u00e9lever encore plusieurs autres questions importantes soit sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une mise en demeure, avant de prononcer la cancellation, soit sur l'\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la province de Qu\u00e9bec par l'acte de I\u2019 Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, sur les terres publiques,\u2014mais il est inutile pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause d'entrer dans l'examen de ces questions, car la d\u00e9cision du litige repose sur une question plus simple et plus claire\u2014la reconnaissance par le gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec de la validit\u00e9 du titre de l'appelant.\nLe d\u00e9partement des terres tient un bureau r\u00e9gulier pour lenregistrement des transports de terres faits soit par les concessionnaires originaires, les acqu\u00e9reurs, locataires ou locateurs subs\u00e9quents de terres publiques, on leurs h\u00e9ritiers on repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, \u2014 o\u00f9 ils peuvent en suivant les formalit\u00e9s indiqu\u00e9es dans la section' 18 23 Vic, ch. 2, faire enregistrer leurs titres dans un livre tenu \u00e0. cet effet et obtenir sur le dos de leur titre un certificat d'enregistrement. Jette disposition d\u00e9clare que tels transports ainsi enregistr\u00e9s seront valides contre tout autre pr\u00e9alablement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, mais subs\u00e9quemment enregistr\u00e9s on non enregistr\u00e9s. Mais tons tels transports doivent \u00eatre faits sans condition,\u2014et toutes les conditions de la vente on location doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplies on dispense obtenue du commissaire des terres avant que l'enregistrement soit fait.\nLa 32 Vic ch. Il section 18 contient la m\u00eame dis position que la 23 Vic, ch. 2, et d\u00e9clare en termes positifs:\nEt tout tel transport, etc., etc. ou le commissaire des terres de la Couronne devra avoir dispense de leur accomplissement avant que tel enregistrement soit fait.\nD'apr\u00e8s la loi en force lors de l'\u00e9mission du billet de location, comme d'apr\u00e8s celle qui l'\u00e9tait lors de sa cancellation, l'enregistrement ne pouvait avoir lieu qu'apr\u00e8s avoir accompli toutes les conditions du titre ou en\navoir obtenu une dispense du commissaire Cette dis-\nposition est imperative et rend le titre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 inattaquable pour d\u00e9faut d'ex\u00e9cution des conditions auxquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. C'est la position dans laquelle se trouve l'appelant par l'enregistrement de son transport des billets de location en question, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le 5 juin 1874 en vertu du statut 32 Vict. ch. 11.

La Couronne ne pouvait donc plus \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 se plaindre de l'inex\u00e9cution des conditions puisqu'elle a reconnu par l'enregistrement quelles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplies ou que dispense en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\nApr\u00e8s les demandes faites par l'appelant aupr\u00e8s du d\u00e9partement des terres pour obtenir la permission de faire sur le homestead les am\u00e9liorations qu'il \u00e9tait tenu de faire sur les lots nos 11 et 12 on ne peut plus mettre en doute le fait que cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par le commissaire qui a accord\u00e9 l'enregistrement du transport, qu'il n'aurait pas eu le pouvoir de faire \u00e0 moins d'avoir dispens\u00e9 l'appelant de faire ces am\u00e9liorations. L'enregistrement constitue une preuve irr\u00e9futable de la dispense accord\u00e9e, et donne \u00e0 l'appelant tout le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice que la loi lui conf\u00e8re par l'enregistrement, en rendant son titre parfait. L'appelant pourrait aussi faire valoir en sa faveur la renonciation que la Couronne a faite au droit de canceller les billets de location, par l'acceptation du prix avec les arr\u00e9rages di'int\u00e9r\u00eat, les frais d'enregistrement du transport et l'honoraire pour l'\u00e9mission de la patente, en se fondant sur l'autorit\u00e9 de la cause de Attorney General of Victoria v.

I understand that the only point upon which the court is about to reverse is the one raised under sec 18 of the statute 28 Vic. c. 2 which enacts that:\nBefore any assignment of the purchaser's right could be validly made or registered::all conditions of the sale, grant or location must have been complied with or dispensed with by the Commissioner of Crown Lands before the registration is made.\"\nIt is contended that the assignment by George Holland to the pr\u00e9sent appellant having been registered by the Crown Lands office the respondents cannot now avail themselves of the non-compliance of any of the conditions of the location ticket I cannot give that effect to the statute. It is clearly proved that he did not comply with the contentious and that they were not dispensed with, so that the consequence may be that the registration was not validly made and that is all.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Concurred with FOURNIER J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant; Chapleaui, Hall, Nicholls and Brown.\nSolicitors for respondent: Robertson, Fleet and Falconer.\n[1] M.L.R. 2 Q.B. 316.\n[2] Rep. vo. clause comminatoire.\n[3] No. 459.\n[4] Rep. vo. condition.\n[5] 6 Vol pase 581 No. 550.\n[6] Ed. 1871 p. 162.\n[7] Ed. 1879 pp. 197-201.\n[8] Ed. 1875, pp. 190-192.\n[9] Liv. 1, tit., 1 sec. 4.\n[10] L.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong J. dissenting.\nIn sec. Ill of the Manitoba Municipal Act, 1884, which provides that municipal corporations may pass by-laws in relation to matters therein enumerated, the word \u201cmay \u201d is permissive only and does not prohibit corporations from exercising their jurisdiction otherwise than by by-law. Ritchie C.J. and Strong J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Manitoba ([1]), affirming the judgment of nonsuit at the trial.\nThe action in this case was brought to recover the amount alleged to be due plaintiff for building a bridge for the defendant municipality. The defence set up was that the contract was not under the corporate seal of the municipality and the plaintiff, consequently, could not maintain an action. The trial judge nonsuited the plaintiff and his judgment was affirmed by the full court from whose decision this appeal was brought. The facts are fully set out in the judgments of Mr. Justice Gwynne and Mr. Justice Patterson\nTupper Q.C. for the appellant. The law is not yet settled as to the necessity for a seal in contracts with municipal corporations. In Young v. Leamington ([2]) though there are dicta against the appellant\u2019s position, Lord Bramwell expressly said, in the House of Lords, that the question did not arise.\nThe law on this matter has been made by the courts and in 1856 it was settled that in the case of trading corporations the seal was not essential in all cases.\nIn executed contracts, the benefit of which has been enjoyed, the courts have always striven to make corporations liable. The latest case is Scott v. Clifton School Board ([3]) ; and see Clarke v. Cuckfield Union ([4]); followed in Nicholson v. Bradfield Union ([5]); Sanders v. St. Neat\u2019s Union ([6]), approved in Smart v. Guardians of West Ham Union ([7]).\nThere are a number of Ontario cases in the same direction beginning with Marshall v. School Trustees ([8]). See Pim v. Ontario ([9]) ; Lawrence v. Corporation of Luc know ([10]); Canada Central Railway Co. v. Murray ([11]).\nOsier Q.C. and Martin, Attorney-General of Manitoba, for the respondents cited Wallis v. Municipality of Assiniboia ([12]); Silsby v. Dunnville ([13]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Concurred in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Strong. STRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. The appellant seeks to recover as the assignee of one John F. Grant for work done in the building of a bridge under an alleged contract with the respondent. The work was performed under an agreement which was signed by Grant but which was not sealed with the corporate seal of the respondents, nor authorized by any by-law passed by the council of the municipality. Subsequently to the commencement of the work a resolution of the council authorising the payment of $200 to Grant on account of the contract was passed, but this was a mere resolution, not a by-law, and was not under the seal of the corporation. The Municipal Act of Manitoba, in force when the agreement mentioned was signed, was that of 1883. The act of 1883 was afterwards, and before the work was completed, superseded by the \u201c Manitoba Municipal Act of 1884.\u201d By both these acts, however (the sections applicable being the 113th of the former and the 111th of the latter act), the power of a municipal council to enter into contracts and to expend money for the construction of bridges was, according to the view I take, restricted to cases in which a by-law authorising the contract and the expenditure under it should be passed. Section 111 of the act of 1884 is as follows :\nThe council may pass by-laws for such municipality in relation to matters coming within the classes hereinafter enumerated, that is to say : (1) The raising of a municipal revenue. (2) The expenditure of the municipal revenue. (3) Roads and bridges and the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges wholly within the municipality.\nSection 113 of the act of 1883 was, as I have said, in the same words. These are the only provisions in the acts to which the authority of a municipal council to contract for the construction of a bridge can be referred. The 180th sections of both the acts are identical and in the following words;:\nEvery by-law shall be under the seal of the corporation and shall be signed by the head of the corporation or by the person presiding at the meeting at which the by-law has been passed and countersigned by the clerk or acting clerk of the corporation.\nWithout statutory authority the municipality could not enter into a contract for building a bridge, and we are therefore bound to enquire whether the conditions upon which alone the power invoked could be exercised have been complied with. That the words \u201c construction and maintenance of roads and bridges \u201d embrace contracts for the performance of such works, and are not to be restricted to cases in which, the municipality may take upon itself to perform the work by workmen hired from day to day, cannot admit of a doubt, for if it were otherwise there would be no power to enter into such a contract as the plaintiff insists upon in the present case, and having regard to what, from common experience, we know to be universal, such a power is always exercised by means of a contract. Then the provision of the statute is plain; it is an indispensable condition to the validity of such a contract that it should be authorised by a by-law which by-law, according to the 180th section, must be under the seal of the municipality. Then no such by-law was ever passed.\nThe consequence is, therefore, inevitable that the work in question was not performed under any contract binding upon the municipality. The contention that the work having been executed and accepted the case is taken out of the statute is, in the face of the recent decision of the House of Lords in Young v. Leamington ([14]), and that of the English Court of Appeal in Hunt v. Wimbledon (1), wholly untenable. These cases decide, absolutely and unequivocally, that where a statutory power is conferred upon a municipal corporation to make contracts in a particular form that form must be followed, and no dispensation with the requirements of the statute is admissible upon the ground of part performance, or because the corporation has taken the benefit of the contract; and this is so held apart altogether from the vexed question of the general liability of corporations upon contracts not under seal which have been executed by the other contracting party.\nHow then is it possible to come to any other conclusion than that which has been arrived at by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Manitoba? Were we to hold otherwise we should be treating the enactment of the legislature as a dead letter, and upon the mere ground of hardship setting aside the statute.\nBut even if it were admissible to treat a contract to build a bridge as one which the municipal council had incidentally power to enter into, without regard to the preliminary requirements of a by-law as provided for by sections 111 and 113 of the respective statutes, I should feel great difficulty in coming to any other conclusion than that arrived at by the court below. It is true that the cases of Young v. Leamington (2) and Hunt v. Wimbledon already referred to are decisions proceeding upon the terms of the act of parliament conferring the power, but still the judgments delivered in these cases in the Court of Appeal do contain dicta of very eminent judges adverse to the doctrine which the English Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, following Mr. Justice Wightman\u2019s decision in Clarke v. Cuckfield Union (3), acted upon in several cases, namely, that irrespective altogether of the exceptions dispensing with a seal to contracts of corporations, in the case of trading corporations and in matters of trivial importance and frequent recurrence, there was a third exception in all cases where the contract had been executed by the other contracting party and the execution had been accepted and the benefit of it taken by the corporation. The Ontario Courts of Common Pleas and Queen\u2019s Bench in the cases of Pim v. Ontario ([15]) and Fetterly v. Russell and Cambridge ([16]) did, it is true, adopt and act upon this principle, but it has been so strongly disapproved of in very late cases by the highest authority in England that I doubt much whether, if the matter were now res integra, the same result would be arrived at in the Ontario courts.\nIt is to be observed that the English Court of Exchequer always rejected the doctrine of Clarke v. Cuckfield Union ([17]) and acted upon the reverse principle.\nLord Justice Lindley, in his late work upon the Law of Joint Stock Companies ([18]) published in 1889, thus decisively treats the distinction in favour of executed contracts as exploded and states the law:\nEven a resolution of a body corporate is not equivalent to an instrument under its seal, and a corporation will not be compelled to execute a contract which it has been resolved shall be entered into by it. A distinction was at one time supposed to exist between executed and executory contracts ; but except where the equitable doctrines of part performance are applicable a corporation is no more bound by a contract not under its seal, of which it has had the benefit, than it is by a similar contract which, has not been acted upon by either party.\nAs regards part performance in equity that (as is the doctrine of part performance generally) is limited to such cases as courts of equity ordinarily exercise jurisdiction in, such as contracts for the sale of land and others in which courts of equity will grant specific performance. That the mere want of a seal in the case of a contract with a corporation not coming within the ordinary jurisdiction of the court affords no ground for equitable interference is a proposition most clearly and conclusively established by the cases of Kirk v. Bromley Union ([19]) and Crampton v. Varna Railway Company ([20]).\nUpon the whole I see no reason to doubt that the law is now as stated in the very full and able judgment of Mr. Justice Killam, though I prefer to rest the decision of the present appeal on the ground first mentioned, namely, that the respondents, a statutory body, had no authority to enter into such a contract as that which the appellant asks us to enforce otherwise than in a particular form and under conditions, prescribed by the statute, which have not been complied with.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would allow this appeal. I concur in my brother Gwynne\u2019s judgment.\nGWYNNE J\u2014In 1868 all the cases theretofore decided in the English courts relating to the rights of action arising upon parol contracts entered into with corporations aggregate were brought under review in South of Ireland Colliery Company v. Waddle ([21]), where Bovill C.J. says :\nThe contract declared on is admitted to have been made by the directors with the defendant. The objection is that it is not under the corporate seal of the company, and it is contended on the defendant\u2019s behalf that by reason of the absence of a seal there is no mutuality; that the plaintiffs are not bound by it, and therefore are not entitled to sue upon the contract. It appears further that the contract had been partly performed, and that the company were ready and willing to perform the rest. It had in fact been adopted and acted upon by both parties. The objection is a technical one, but though technical if it be in accordance with law the court is bound to give effect to it. Originally all contracts by corporations were required to be under seal. From time to time certain exceptions were introduced; but these for a long time had reference only to matters of trifling importance and frequent occurrence, such as the hiring of servants and the like. But in progress of time, as new descriptions of corporations came into existence, the courts came to consider whether these exceptions ought not to be extended in the case of corporations created for trading and other purposes. At first there was considerable conflict, and it is impossible to reconcile all the decisions on the subject. But it seems to me that the exceptions created by the recent cases are now too firmly established to be questioned by the earlier decisions which if inconsistent with them must, I think, be held not to be law. These exceptions apply to all contracts by trading corporations entered into for the purposes for which they were incorporated. A company can only carry on business by agents, managers and others, and if the contracts made by these persons are Contracts which relate to objects and purposes of the company and are not inconsistent with the rules and regulations which govern their acts they are valid and binding on the company though not under seal. It has been urged that the exceptions to the general rule are still limited to matters of frequent occurrence and small importance. The authorities, however, do not sustain that argument. It can never be that one rule is to obtain in the case of a contract for \u00a350 or \u00a3100, and another in the case of a contract for \u00a350,000 or \u00a3100.000.\nHe then proceeded to show that there was no special provision either in the act 4of parliament under which the company became incorporated or in the articles of association which required the contract sued upon to be under seal, and the court, therefore, held that the contract was valid without a seal notwithstanding the rule of the common law, and Montague Smith J. winds up his judgment by saying that the result is that East London Waterworks Co. v. Bailey ([22]) can no longer be considered to be law. Upon appeal to the Exchequer Chamber that court ([23]), consisting of three judges of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and three of the Court of Exchequer, unanimously affirmed, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas. Cockburn C.J. delivering the judgment of the court there says :\nWe are all of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas ought to be affirmed. It is unnecessary to say more than that we entirely concur in the reasoning and authority of the cases referred to in the judgment of Bovill C.J. which seems to us to exhaust the subject. In early times, no doubt, corporations could only, subject to the well known exceptions, bind themselves by contracts under seal, and for some time that rule was applied to corporations which were formed for the purpose of carrying on trade. But the contrary has since been laid clown by a long series of cases and may now be considered settled law. The machinery contracted for in this case was clearly necessary for the purpose for which the company was formed, namely, the working of coal mines.\nNow that was the case of an executory contract. It is only necessary now to consider whether the principles established by the cases decided prior to the South of Ireland Colliery Co v. Waddle, (1) and upon which that case proceeded, are limited in their application to trading corporations only, or whether they are not equally applicable in the case of a municipal corporation, such as the defendants in the present case are, who have received the benefit of a work executed for them upon a parol contract made with them in relation to a matter within the purposes for which the corporation was created, which work the governing body of the corporation has accepted as completed under the contract, and has paid part of the price agreed upon. In the Mayor of Stafford v. Till (2) it was held by the Court of Common Pleas in 1827 that a corporation aggregate might sue in assumpsit for use and occupation where the tenant held premises under a parol contract with the corporation. The principle upon which that case proceeded was that the tenant being in occupation of the land the contract between him and the corporation must be considered as executed, and that the con, tract having been executed the defendant was in justice bound to pay for his occupation, so that a promise to pay might be implied although in the case of an executory contact it might be otherwise. In the East London Waterworks Co. v. Bailey ([24]) the same court in the same year in the case of an executory contract held that although an act of parliament authorized the directors of the plaintiff company to make contracts, agreements and bargains with the workmen, agents, undertakers and other persons engaged in the undertaking, the company could not sue upon a parol contract with the defendants for the supply of pipes at certain stated periods for a breach of such contract, In The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton ([25]) to an action for rent payable under a demise by deed executed under the corporate seal of the plaintiffs the defendant pleaded a set-off, whereby he claimed to be allowed a sum of money alleged and proved to have been expended by him under a parol contract contained in a resolution passed at a corporate meeting and entered in the books of the corporation. The Court of Exchequer in that case held that notwithstanding the defendant had executed the work he could not set-off the amount so expended, the contract not having been under the corporate seal. It cannot be denied that the Court of Exchequer in that case, which W&s decided in 1840, were of opinion that the exceptions of the general common law rule that corporations can contract only under their common seal ate to be limited to cases of urgent necessity, where* in fact, to hold the common law rule applicable would occasion very great inconvenience or tend to defeat the object for which the corporation was created. The court, however, in delivering judgment ([26]) say : The seal is required as authenticating the concurrence of the whole body corporate.\nThat is the principle upon which the common law rule is founded. They go on, however, to say, and to lay down principles which might reasonably be construed as affording good foundation for future exceptions, as follows:\nIf the legislature in erecting a body corporate invest any member of it, either expressly or impliedly, with authority to bind the whole body by his mere signature, or otherwise, then undoubtedly the adding a seal would be matter purely of form and not of substance. Every one becoming a member of such a corporation knows that he is liable to be bound in his corporate character by such an act, and persons dealing with the corporation know that by such an act the body will be bound. But in other cases the seal is the only authentic evidence of what the corporation has done or agreed to do. The resolution of a meeting, however numerously attended, is after all not the act of the whole body. Every member knows he is bound by what is done under the corporate seal and by nothing else.\nIt is necessary, therefore, in every case to refer to the particular act or acts of parliament creating a corporation for the purpose of determining whether any express or implied authority is given to any particular person or persons, or part of the corporate body, to bind the whole body, for if there be, then upon a reasonable construction of the above language of the Court of Exchequer the reason assigned for the necessity of affixing the corporate seal to any contract would seem to cease to exist. Now, by the acts incorporating municipal institutions throughout the Dominion of Canada, the inhabitants of every municipality, be it a city, town, village, county or township, are the body corporate. Convenience and necessity require that the powers vested in the corporate body should be, and accordingly all such powers are by express enactment required to be, exercised by a deliberative, legislative governing body called a municipal council, consisting of members of the corporate body elected for that purpose by the inhabitants of the municipality. All of the proceedings, resolutions and minutes of these deliberative, legislative, governing bodies in respect of every matter coming under their consideration are recorded in a book required to be kept for that purpose by their clerk, so that, in the above language of the Court of Exchequer, every inhabitant of the municipality, or member of the corporate body, knows that he is liable to be bound in his corporate character by the resolutions and acts of the council or governing body. It may well, I think, be doubted whether any officers of such municipal corporations could bind the corporate body by setting the corporate seal to any contract not authorised by the council by resolution or otherwise. It is difficult, therefore, as it seems to me, to understand why in the case of those municipal institutions the affixing a seal to a contract with the corporate body should be deemed of such vital importance if, before the seal can be effectually set, there must be a precedent resolution of the council authorising the contract. It may more correctly be said that these municipal corporations speak and act by and through the acts and resolutions of their deliberative councils or governing bodies than by and through a seal, the affixing of which in such cases, as is admitted by the Court of Exchequer in The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton ([27]), would be a \u201cmatter purely of form.\u201d\nIn Arnold v. The Mayor of Poole ([28]) it was held by the Court of Common Pleas, in 1842, that a corporation could not appoint an attorney except under the corporate seal.\nIn The Fishmongers Co. v. Robertson ([29]) the contract sued upon was not one coming within any of the established exceptions to the general rule that contracts of corporations must be by deed. The subject-matter of the contract had no relation to any of the purposes for which the company were incorporated. It was a contract whereby the Fishmongers Company of London agreed with the defendants to withdraw their opposition to a bill introduced into parliament by the defendants whereby they sought to be invested with power to drain certain marsh lands in Ireland contiguous to which the Fishmongers Company owned land which they feared might be injuriously affected by the powers sought by the defendants; and the plaintiffs, alleging that they had performed all the stipulations and conditions agreed to be performed by them, averred in their declaration divers breaches by the defendants of the stipulations agreed to be performed by them, and it was held by the Court of Common Pleas in 1843, upon the objection that the contract was not executed under the seal of the plaintiffs, and was therefore invalid, that the contract having been executed by the plaintiffs and the defendants having thereby received the benefit of it they could not upon any principle of reason or justice be permitted to raise the objection. In that case the corporation, it is true, were the plaintiffs, but the same principle of reason and justice seems to me to apply to prevent a corporation, which has received the full benefit of a parol contract executed in every particular as agreed upon with the managing body, from resisting payment of the price agreed upon by contending that the contract had not been executed under their seal. Such a defence would be equally fraudulent and unjust whether urged by an individual in an action at the suit of the corporation who had executed the parol contract, or in an action by an individual who had executed it on his part against the corporation who had accepted and enjoyed the full benefit of it. In the Fishmonger Co. v. Robertson, ([30]) a case before Sir J. Leach, V.C , in 1823, f was cited, Marshall v. Corporation of Queensborough ([31]), wherein the Vice Chancellor said :\nIf a regular corporate resolution passed for granting an interest in a part of the corporate property, and upon the faith of that resolution expenditure was incurred, he was inclined to think that both principle and authority would be found for compelling the corporation to make a legal grant in pursuance of that resolution.\nAnd in The London and Birmingham Railway Company v. Winter ([32]), in 1840 an objection to a bill by an incorporated railway company for specific performance of a parol contract entered into by their agent that it did not appear that the agent was authorised under the corporate seal, and therefore that there was no mutuality, was overruled, the Lord Chancellor Cottenham holding that as the company had, before the bill was filed, not only acted on the contract by entering into possession of the land, but actually made a railroad over it, if it had been necessary for the defendants to have filed a bill for specific performance against the company he had no doubt they would be compelled specifically to perform the contract.\nIn Paine v. The Strand Union ([33]) it was held by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Hilary term, 1846, that the guardians of a poor law union could not bind themselves by an order not under seal for making a survey and map of the ratable property in a parish forming part of the union ; and the reason of that judgment was that the making of the plan so ordered was not in any way incident to the purposes for which the corporation was created. Lord Denman C.J. delivering the judgment of the court, says :\nThe plan was wanted in order to enable a fair and correct estimate to be made of the net value of the hereditaments rated in that parish; the other parishes in the union had nothing to do with it, nor were in any way benefited by it, so that the making the plan cannot have been in any way incident to the purposes for which the defendants were incorporated, which purposes related to the whole union, the defendants having no power to act as a corporation in matters confined to any particular parish.\nAnd in the following term the same court in Sanders v. The Guardians of St. Neot\u2019s Union ([34]) held that where work had been done for the corporation under a verbal order, which work had been accepted and adopted by them, the corporation could not in an action to recover the price object that the order was not given under seal. Lord Denman C.J. delivering judgment there, saying :\nWe think that they (the corporation) could not be permitted to take the objection, inasmuch as the work in question after it was done and completed was adopted by them for purposes connected with the corporation.\nThe court, it is submitted, based their judgment in that case upon a sound and rational principle, equally applicable to the case of every corporation and not limited to trading corporations only, namely, that where work has been executed for a corporation under a parol contract, which work was within the purposes for which the corporation was created, and it has been accepted and adopted and enjoyed by the corporation after its completion, it would in such case be fraudulent for the corporation, while enjoying the benefit of the work, to refuse to pay for it upon the ground that the contract in virtue of which it had been executed was invalid for want of the corporate seal, and that reason and justice required that they should not be permitted to commit such a fraud ; that they cannot be permitted, in fact, to appeal to the rule of common law so as to enable them to commit a manifest fraud. In Lamprell v. Billericay Union ([35]), in 1849, it must be admitted that the Court of Exchequer, professing to act r upon the authority of their own decision in The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton (1), held that a person who had performed work for a corporation under the directions of the architect of the corporation could not recover against the corporation upon a quantum meruit for the work done, although it had been accepted by the architect as completed in accordance with his directions and the corporation enjoyed the benefit of the completed work. In that case the Court of Exchequer assumed the decisions of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Arnold v. The Mayor of Poole (2) and Paine v. The Strand Union (3) to be in affirmance of the judgment of the Exchequer in The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton, an assumption which does not appear at all warranted by the reports of those cases or by the expressions of judges of the Queen\u2019s Bench in subsequent cases.\nIn The Copper Miners Co. v. Fox (4) A.D. 1850, the action was upon a parol contract with the defendant, who undertook to supply the company with iron rails averring mutual promises and breach by the defendant. The court held that the action would not lie the contract not being under seal, the plaintiffs\u2019 charter of incorporation having only authorized them to deal in copper as copper miners. Lord Campbell C JY delivering judgment, says :\nHad the subject of this contract been copper, or if it had been shown in any way to be incidental or ancillary to carrying on the business of copper miners, the contract would have been binding though not under seal.\nThis language of the court, applied as it was to an executory contract, is in direct conflict with the judgment of the Exchequer in the The East London Waterworks Co. v. Bailey (5). In Diggie v. The London and Blackwall Railway Company ([36]) where a railway company entered into an agreement not under seal with a contractor that he should execute certain works upon their railway for the purpose of changing the system of locomotion which they then employed, the rope and stationary engine system, to the ordinary locomotive principle, and the contractor had entered upon the work and performed a portion but was dismissed by the company before the works were completed, the Court of Exchequer decided that he could not recover upon a quantum meruit for the work done. Pollock C.B. there says :\nThe evidence shows that the parties never intended to deal as on an implied contract, such as a corporation may, under certain circumstances, enter into without their seal. They intended to contract by writing and to enter into & solemn and express contract ; and the offer of the plaintiff to do the work was accepted on the faith that there would be such a contract. It is, however, suggested that under the act incorporating the company the defendants were competent to contract by their directors without writing, merely by a resolution communicated to the plaintiff authorizing him to set about the work, and I am not quite prepared to say that might not be the case ;\u2019 for there is a material distinction between the clauses of this statute and those in Cope v. The Thames Raven Dock Company (2) cited for the defendants ; but assuming that the directors here could so contract by resolution communicated to the plaintiff without writing (about which, being a matter of some doubt, I am not prepared to give an opinion) ; assuming also, as to which there can be no doubt, that they could contract by writing under the hands of three of them ; assuming also that they could contract under the seal of the company ; the foundation of my judgment is that there is no contract under seal, none signed by three directors, and none entered into under such resolution of the directors.\nThis case was not the case of a work which had been completely executed under a parol contract which work the corporation for whom it had been so executed had accepted as completed in accordance with the terms of the parol contract, and enjoyed the benefit thereof; to such a case, Diggie v. The London and Blackwall Railway Company ([37]) cannot apply; much less can it apply to a case in which, during the progress of the work which was within the express purposes for which the corporation was created, the contract was recognized, adopted and acted upon as valid by resolutions of the governing body of the corporation, and by like resolutions was partly paid for and finally accepted as completed. The case of Cope v. The Thames Haven Dock Co, ([38]) referred to by the Chief Baron in Diggie v. The London and Blackwall Railway Co., was a decision merely to the effect that where a section of the act incorporating the company had prescribed certain forms to be observed by directors of the company in all contracts entered into by them to be binding on the company, a person purported to have been appointed an agent of the company to enter into certain negotiations with another company by the directors, but not in the manner prescribed in the act of incorporation, could not sue the company under such contract for the services rendered by him in executing the agency so purported to have been conferred upon him. In Finlay v. The Bristol and Exeter Railway Company ([39]) where the defendants had occupied certain premises of the plaintiff for two years at a fixed rent under a parol demise, and at the expiration of the two years continued in occupation without any new agreement for three months when they left the premises, paying, however, for the three months at the rate they had previously paid, it was held by the Court of Exchequer in 1852, in an action against the company for the rent for the nine months of the year after the company had ceased to occupy the premises, that the landlord could not recover on a count for use and occupation for they did not occupy ; and that no contract to occupy the premises for another year could be implied from the continuance of the company in occupation for the three months subsequent to the expiration of the two years ; that as against a corporation no contract could be implied from conduct ; and so that under the circumstances, there having been no contract under seal, the plaintiff had no action against the company. This decision appears to have no application upon the question of the liability of a corporation to pay for work executed for them under a parol contract in respect of a matter within the purposes for which the corporation was created, and which work the corporation have accepted as completed within the terms of the contract, and continue to enjoy the full benefit thereof. In Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union ([40]) it was held in 1852 that the guardians of a poor law union, who at a board properly constituted and authorized to enter into contracts give orders to a tradesman to supply and put tip water closets in the Union workhouse and he puts them up and the guardians approve and accept them, they cannot afterwards in an action against them as a corporation for the price defend themselves by showing that there was no contract under seal, for that the purposes for which the guardians were made a corporation require that they should provide such articles. Wightman J. after reviewing all the cases, says :\nThe question is whether the demand in question comes within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule. I am disposed to think it does, and that wherever the purposes for which a corporation is created render it necessary that work should be clone or goods supplied to carry such purposes into effect * * * and orders are given at a board regularly constituted, and having general authority to make contracts for work or goods necessary for the purposes for which the corporation was created, and the work is done or goods supplied and accepted by the corporation, and the whole consideration for payment executed, the corporation cannot keep the goods or the benefit and refuse to pay on the ground that though the members of the corporation who ordered the goods or work were competent to make a contract and bind the rest, the formality of a deed or of affixing the seal was wanting and then say\u2014no action lies, we are not competent to make a parol contract, and we avail ourselves of our own disability.\nThe principle thus enunciated is applicable to every corporation ; it is not limited in its application to trading corporations only; exceptions to the common law rule as recognized in the case of trading corporations rest upon principles equally applicable to every corporation aggregate. The judgment of Wightman J. in Clarke v. Cuckfield Union ([41]) recommends itself to my mind as founded upon the plainest principle of justice ; it is based upon precisely the same principles as that upon which the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench held in Paine v. The Strand Union, ([42]) that under the circumstances of that case the action did not lie, and in Sanders v. St. Neot\u2019s Union ([43]), that under the circumstances of that case the action well lay, which principle may be thus enunciated, namely, that a corporation which has received the full benefit of a parol contract made with it for the execution for it of work within the purposes for which the corporation was created, and has accepted the work so contracted for as completely executed within the terms of the parol contract, cannot be permitted to set up to an action for the price the fraudulent defence that although the corporation has received the full benefit of the contract they can claim exemption from payment of the price upon the ground that the contract under which they procured the work to be executed for them was not under the corporate seal. Smart v. West Ham Union ([44]) decided in 1885 has not much bearing upon the point under consideration. The decision of the Court of Exchequer in that case was, that assuming the appointment of a collector of rates by the guardians of a union to be valid although not under the corporate seal, a point which was not decided, still the act of parliament 4 & 5 Will. 4, ch. 76, which authorized the guardians to make the appointment, did not make them liable for payment of the collector\u2019s salary.\nIn The Australian Steam Navigation Co. v. Marzetti decided by the Court of Exchequer in 1855 (1) the case was that the company had by parol contract bought from the defendant large quantities of ale for the use of steamships which their act of incorporation authorized them to employ for the carrying of the mails and passengers and cargo. The ale for which they had paid proved to be unsound, unwholesome and unfit for use, and thereupon the company sued the defendant in assumpsit for not furnishing ale of the quality contracted for and for furnishing ale unfit for use. To an objection that the contract under which the ale had been supplied was not under the corporate seal it was held that such objection could not be entertained, Pollock C.B. there saying:\nIt is now perfectly established by a series of authorities that a corporation may, with respect to those matters for which they are expressly created, deal without seal. This principle is founded on justice and public convenience and is in accordance with common sense.\nThis language of the Chief Baron seems to me, I confess, to be in affirmance of the principle as laid down by the Queen\u2019s Bench in Paine v. The Strand Union (2) ; Sander v. St. Neots Union (3), and Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union (4). In Henderson v. The Australian Steam Navigation Co. decided in 1855 (5) it was held by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that the corporation were liable under a contract made by their directors, not \u2018under the corporate seal, to pay remuneration for services rendered in bringing home a disabled vessel Wight man J. there in plain terms reaffirms the principle upon which he proceeded in Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union ([45]), namely :\nThat the general rule that a corporation cannot contract except by deed admits of an exception in cases where the making of a certain description of contracts is necessary and incidental to the purposes for which the corporation was created.\nAnd Erie J. says :\nI am also of opinion that there should be judgment for the plaintiff on the ground that the contract was made for a purpose directly connected with the object of the incorporation, as it was a contract to bring home one of their ships the company being incorporated to trade with ships.\nHe then proceeds to show that this principle is recognized in Beverley v. Lincoln Gas Co. ([46]); in Sanders v. St: Neot\u2019s Union ([47]); in Clarke v. Cuckfield Union; and in Copper Mining Co. v. Fox ([48]); and he might have added Paine v. The Strand Union ([49]); and also by Pollock C.B. in Australian Steam Navigation Co. v. Marzetti ([50]), only that this case was not decided in the Exchequer Court until two days after the delivery of judgment in Henderson v. The Australian Steam Navigation Company (7). The learned judge then proceeded to show that, in his opinion, the principle upon which the court was proceeding did not come in question in The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton (8), or in Arnold v. The Mayor of Poole (9), for as to these cases he says :\nIt is quite clear that the mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Ludlow were not incorporated for the purpose of altering stables (which was the work for executing which the contract, sought to be enforced in that case, was entered into).\nnor the mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Poole for the purpose of litigation. There is more difficulty, he proceeds to say, in reconciling some of the other decisions of the Court of Exchequer with this principle, and Diggle v. The Blackwall Ry. Co. ([51]) may, perhaps, be in direct conflict with it. Perhaps it may be distinguished on the ground that the contract there was for the purpose of changing the railway from a line worked by stationary engines to a line for locomotives, and therefore in its nature unique and such as could occur only once in the life time of the corporation. Unless it can be distinguished on that ground the case is in conflict with the other authorities. I do not pretend to overrule the decision of a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction, but if Diggle v. The London and Blackwall Ry. Co. is in conflict with the authorities laying down this principle I adhere to them and not to it.\nI have already endeavoured to point out that it may, perhaps, be distinguished upon another ground, namely, that the moneys sought to be recovered there were not for a completed work which the company had accepted as completed and enjoyed the full benefit of, and the court held that for so much of the work that had been done when the company prevented the plaintiff from proceeding further he could not recover as upon an implied assumpsit, the evidence having shown that the parties never contemplated dealing as on an implied contract. This case appears to me to have little bearing upon a case where the whole work contracted for by parol has been completed and has been received by the company as completed and enjoyed by them and they seek to avail themselves of the defence that the contract was not under their corporate seal, and that, therefore, they are under no obligation to pay for the work of which they enjoy the benefit.\nIn Renter v. The Electric Telegraph Company ([52]), decided in 1856, it appeared that by the deed of settlement of the company the directors were to manage the company\u2019s business, but there was a special provision in the deed that all contracts above a certain value should be signed by at least three directors or sealed with the seal of the company under the authority of a special meeting. The plaintiff sued the company on an agreement involving a sum above the prescribed value. The matter of the contract was within the scope of the company\u2019s business but it was not signed by three directors nor under the seal of the company; it was made by parol with the chairman who had entered a memorandum of it in the minute book of the company. It was recognized in correspondence with the secretary, and the plaintiff did the work and received payments on account of it by cheques, which payments passed into the accounts of the company. On a case stating these facts, with power to draw inferences of fact, it was held that the contract, although not signed as required by the deed of settlement by three directors, nor under the company\u2019s seal, was ratified by the company by the conduct above and being so ratified was binding. In London Dock Company v. Sinnott ([53]), A.D. 1857, the action was upon an executory, not upon an executed, parol contract. The defendant had tendered for a contract with the plaintiffs for scavenging the London docks for a year, but when a contract for the performance: of the work in accordance with the conditions contained in his tender was presented to him he refused to sign it, and it was held that no action would lie against him for such refusal for that no power to enter into such a contract by parol is conferred upon the corporation of the London docks, and that the plaintiffs did not bring themselves within any of the exceptions to the general rule that a corporation aggregate can only be bound by contracts under the seal of the corporation. The case simply decides that a parol contract with a corporation aggregate to enter into and sign a contract binding in law with them is not recognized to be an exception to the general rule that corporations aggregate can contract only under their corporate seal.\nIn Haigh v. North Bier ley Union ([54]) it was held by the Queen\u2019s Bench, in 1858, that where a plaintiff had been employed under resolutions of the board of guardians to do certain work for them, but no contract was made under the seal of the board, the plaintiff was entitled to recover in assumpsit for the work and labour performed by him. Erie J. there in very clear language affirms Sanders v. St. Neot\u2019s Union ([55]) and Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union ([56]) as laying down the principle that an action lies against the guardians of a union to recover money for work and labour though performed under a contract not under seal. And he says that the question, therefore, before the court was one rather of fact than of law, namely, whether the work performed by the plaintiff was incidental to the purposes for which the guardians were incorporated, and he was of opinion that it was Compton J. concurred, but felt, as he said, a difficulty in distinguishing the case from The London Dock Company v. Sinnott ([57]). But with great deference the distinction is to my mind very apparent, that being an action at suit of the corporation for breach of a parol contract to enter into a binding contract, which action could not be maintained as the corporation were under no obligation to enter into a contract under seal with the defendant if he had called upon them to so do and they had refused. But Haigh v. North Bier ley Union was an action against the corporation to recover the price or value of work completely executed for them under a parol contract but in relation to matters within the N purposes of which the corporation was created, and of which they had received and enjoyed the benefit.\nIn Laird v. The Birkenhead Railway Co. (1) the plaintiff, having under the terms of a parol agreement with o the railway company constructed a tunnel under land lying between a coal yard of the plaintiff and a station on the railway of the defendants for the use of the plaintiff by way of communication between his coal yard and the defendants\u2019 station, filed his bill to enforce specific performance by the railway company of the parol contract on their part, to which bill the company set up the defence that the contract was not under their seal and so was not binding upon them. This defence was overruled by Sir W. Page Wood V.C., in 1859, who in the course of his judgment made use of the following language :\nI must say that when works of this kind are commenced in this way and carried on continually in the presence of the company\u2019s servants, for all the purposes of knowledge and acquiescence the company are bound, so far as the agency of the servants goes, just as much as individuals would be. The consequence of what took place was that with the full knowledge therefore of the company, under the eyes of their servants) the plaintiff proceeded to lay out \u00a31,200 and the tunnel was completed.\nAnd again he says :\nI very much doubt, looking at the authorities, whether haying allowed the plaintiff to lay out his money which could only be for a particular purpose they can now break up the whole matter and say, you have been very foolish ; and he overruled the objection.\nIn Wilson v West Hartlepool Ry. Co. (2) where the plaintiff filed his bill against the company for specific performance of an agreement for the purchase of a piece of land entered into with the plaintiff by the defendants through the medium of an agent, who, however, had not been appointed under the corporate seal, Sir John Romilly M. R. upon the authority of The London and Birmingham Ry. Co. v. Winter ([58]) held that the directors of the company having held out to the world a person as their agent for a particular purpose could not afterwards dispute the acts done by such person within the scope of the agency, which he held the contract sued upon to be, upon the ground that the agent had not been appointed under their corporate seal; and upon the ground of the contract being within the scope of the agency, as he conceived it to be, as well as upon the ground of acts done in accordance with the contracts by the servants and officers of the company which were referable to the contract and to nothing else, he decreed a specific performance of the contract. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal in chancery ([59]) Lord Justice Turner, so far as the case rested upon any direct authority having been given by the directors to the person who entered into the contract to enter into it, was in favour of the defendants.\nBut then it was said (he proceeds) on the part of the plaintiff that the directors ratified the contract, and I think they must be held to have done so. Upon this contract being entered into the machinery belonging to the plaintiff which had been deposited on some lands on the west of the railway, which the plaintiff alleges he had previously bought from the company, was brought over to the land in question and there deposited. Other machinery belonging to the plaintiff which had been landed at the company\u2019s harbour was also brought by the company\u2019s waggons to and deposited on this land ; the plaintiff was let into possession of the land ; the land was measured by an officer of the company ; the company laid down lines of rails for the purpose of communication between this land and their main line of railway, and they made borings in the land. These acts were in conformity with the contract and they amount, I think, to representation by the defendants to the plaintiff that the contract was a subsisting and valid contract.\nAnd so he held the acts to be a ratification of the contract and in part performance of it. He then proceeds to state the principles upon which the court proceeds in such a case, namely, that it would be a fraud to permit the defendants to defeat the contract. He says :\nThe court proceeds in such cases, on the ground of fraud, and I cannot hold that acts which, if done by an individual, would amount to fraud ought not to be so considered if done by a company. * * * * There is authority for saying that in the eye of this court it is a fraud to set up the absence of agreement when possession has been given upon the faith of it.\nHe then deals with a question which was raised by the defendants whether the contract ought to be held binding on the company, having regard to the statutory provisions affecting the company, and upon this point he says :\nIt is not disputed that the directors had power on behalf of the company to sell the land in question, and having that power it must, a3 it seems to me, have been competent for them to ratify a contract made by the manager of the company for the sale of it. They in fact ratified this contract.\nThen holding that apart from the enactment of any statutory provisions to the contrary the court could not refuse specific performance of the contract, he entered upon the enquiry whether certain statutory provisions relied upon in argument had made any alteration, and he held that they had not, saying:\nThese provisions are contained in 8 & 9 Vic. ch. 16 sec. 97. The legislature has in this section pointed out modes in which the powers of directors to contract may lawfully be exercised, and has enacted that all contracts made according to these provisions shall be binding and effectual; but it has not said that contracts made in other modes shall not be binding and effectual where there is power so to make them, and certainly it has not said that any equity which may have existed in the court before these provisions were introduced shall no longer exist. The act, it is to be observed, is in the affirmative, and affirmative acts are not generally to be construed so as to take away pre-existing rights or remedies. Had this been intended I cannot but think that it would have been expressed. He was of opinion, therefore, that the decree of the Master of the Rolls was right. Lord Justice Knight-Bruce, while not dissenting from any of the principles laid down by Lord Justice Turner, was of opinion that a decree for specific performance should not have been made for the reason solely that he thought there were some provisions in the contract which could not be enforced.\nIn Nicholson v. The Bradfield Union ([60]) to an action for the price of coal sold and delivered to the defendants in 1866, under a parol contract, the corporation set up by way of defence that the contract was invalid not being under the corporate seal. The court overruled the objection and rendered judgment for the plaintiff upon the authority of Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union ([61]), Blackburn J. who delivered the judgment of the court, saying:\nIt is not necessary to express any opinion as to what might have been the case if the plaintiff had been suing in this court for a refusal to accept the coals, or any other breach of the contract whilst still executory, or how far the principle of the London Dock Company v. Sinnott ([62]) would then have applied to such a contract. The goods in the present case have actually been supplied to, and accepted by, the corporation. They were such as must necessarily be from time to time supplied for the very purposes for which the body was incorporated, and they were supplied under a contract, in fact, made by the managing body of the corporation. If the defendants had been an unincorporated body nothing would have remained but the duty to pay for them. We think that the body corporate cannot under such circumstances escape from fulfilling that duty merely because the contract was not under seal. The case of Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union is in its facts undistinguishable from the present case.\nUpon a careful consideration of these cases, and of the manner in which the governing principle is discussed and applied in them, it is obvious, I think, that the principle which is to govern is equally applicable to all corporations aggregate, whether they be or be not trading corporations ; and it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that the great weight of authority deducible from those cases is that the principle upon which Paine v. The Strand Union (1) proceeded, which was the same as that upon which Sanders v. St Neot\u2019s Union (2) proceeded, and upon which also was based the judgment in Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union (3), and which was expressly affirmed and acted upon in Henderson v. The Australian Steam Navigation Company (4), and several others of the above cases, is the true principle ; and that The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton (5), unless it is, for some such reason as that suggested by Erie J. in Henderson v. The Australian Steam Navigation Company, or that hereinbefore suggested by me, or for some other reason, distinguishable from, and in so far as it is at variance with, Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union, and the other cases which proceeded upon the principle of that case, is not law. All of the above cases came under review in the South of Ireland Colliery Company v. Waddle (6), and the judgment in that case and the principles therein laid down, as well those applicable to executory parol contracts with corporations, as those applicable to such contracts as have been completely executed, approved as they have been in such emphatic language by the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, must be taken to be now established law unless and until a court of higher authority shall decide otherwise, an event which I venture to think will never take place and which, in my opinion, cannot take place without doing violence to every principle of justice, public convenience and sound sense. As regards executed parol contracts, with which alone we are concerned in the present case, the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in South of Ireland Colliery Company v. Waddle ([63]) has established that exceptions to the common law rule are no longer limited to matters of frequent occurrence and small importance ; that it is a matter of indifference whether the amount involved in the contract be \u00a350 or \u00a350,000 ; that in the language of the Chief Baron Pollock in Australian Steam Navigation Company v. Marzetti ([64]), it is now formally established that with respect to all matters within the purposes for which the corporation was created it may deal without seal ; and that where the managing body of a corporation aggregate contracts by parol for the execution of any work in respect of a matter within the purposes for which the corporation was created, and the work has been executed in accordance with the contract and accepted as complete, it would be a fraud in the corporation to refuse to pay for the work so executed the stipulated price, or in the absence of a stipulated price the value thereof, and so to repudiate the contract upon the ground that it was not executed under the corporate seal ; and therefore, upon every principle of justice, public convenience and sound sense, they cannot in the absence of a special statutory enactment affecting the particular case be permitted to urge such a defence to an action instituted to recover from them the price or value of the work. We have applied this principle in this court in two cases, viz. : in The London Life Assurance Company v. Wright (3) and The Canada Central Railway Company v. Murray (4) In Crampton v. Varna Railway Company (5) it was held by Lord Chancellor Hatherly that the person who had executed certain work for the company under a r parol contract entered into with him could have no relief against the company in a court of equity, because the claim was for a mere money demand over which courts of equity in England never assumed jurisdiction. It was further held, that in the particular case the contract was wholly invalid as not executed under the corporate seal, an objection upon which ground neither a court of law or equity could reject, because by an express provision in the act incorporating the company it was enacted that\nall contracts and agreements to be made by the company involving sums of more than \u00a3500 (which the contract in question did) shall have the common seal affixed thereto together with the signatures of at least two members of the council and the secretary.\nThe Lord Chancellor, however, entertained no doubt that in a proper case for a court of equity to entertain the court would have no difficulty in granting relief against the common law rule requiring corporation contracts to be under the corporate seal, for he says that he thinks the arm of the court always strong enough to deal properly with such cases.\nThere might, he says, be a contract without seal under which the whole railway was made, arid of which the company would reap the profit, and yet it might be said that they were not liable to pay for the making of the line. When any such case comes to be considered I think there will be two ways of meeting it. It may be, and perhaps is so in this case, that the contractor has his remedy against the individual with whom he entered into the contract ; or it may be that the court, acting on well recognized principles, will say that the company shall not in such case be allowed to raise any difficulty as to payment.\nI have already referred to some cases where those principles have been recognized and acted upon. Thus in all the courts of law and equity it may be asserted to have become, at least in 1868, when, in South of Ireland Colliery Company v. Waddle (1), it was by the Court of Exchequer Chamber established, too firmly to be further questioned, that where a corporation aggregate have by their managing body procured work to be done for them within the purposes for which the corporation was created under a parol contract, and where the managing body of such corporation has accepted the work as completed under the parol contract, and the corporation have received the benefit thereof, it would be a fraud in the corporation to resist payment of the price or value of the work upon the ground that the contract was not executed under their corporate seal, and therefore, unless there be some express statutory enactment to the contrary governing this particular case, they cannot upon every principle of justice and sound sense be permitted to do so, either in courts of law or equity, whose principles as to prevention of the committing of such a fraud are identical.\nHunt v. Wimbledon Local Board ([65]), and Young v. The Mayor and Corporation of Leamington ([66]), proceeded upon the same principle as did Crampton v. Varna Railway Company ([67]), namely, that there was a special statutory enactment governing the cases. The questions arose under the Public Health Act of 1875, 38 & 39 Vic. ch. 55, the 174th sec. of which enacted that :\nWith respect to contracts made by an urban authority under this act the following regulations shall be observed :\u2014\n1st. Every contract made by an urban authority whereof the value or amount exceeds \u00a350 shall be in writing and sealed with the common seal of such authority.\nThis clause was held to be obligatory and not merely directory, and as the amounts involved in those cases respectively did exceed. \u00a350, and the contracts were not entered into under the corporate seal as required by the statute, they could not, although executed, be r enforced against the corporations who contested their liability for want of the seal. They have no application in the present case, save only that parliament when passing the Board of Health Act of 1875, had been, as well may be assumed, aware of the state of the law upon the subject of parol contracts with corporations aggregate as laid down by the courts in the above cases, and more especially of the latest decision in The South of Ireland Colliery Company v. Waddle ([68]), affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber which finally established that the exception from the common law rule is no longer limited to matters of frequent occurrence and small importance, and that it is a matter of indifference whether the amount involved be \u00a350 or \u00a350,000 ; and it was no doubt for this reason that it was especially provided by the act of parliament that corporations created by the Board of Health Act should have no power to enter into any contract in respect of a matter exceeding c\u00a350, otherwise than under their corporate seal, leaving the law as finally established by the Exchequer Chamber in the South of Ireland Colliery Company v. Waddle, in respect of corporations governed only by the common law, to apply to contracts entered into by the corporations created by the act of 1875 wherein the amount involved did not exceed \u00a350.\nNow the evidence in the present case has established beyond controversy the following facts, namely, that one John F. Grant in September, 1882, under his hand, executed a contract for the construction of the bridge in question, which contract had been drawn up for his signature by the clerk of the municipality within the limits of which the bridge was required to be erected ; by this contract Grant undertook to build the bridge in question for $800.00, to be paid to him by the municipality as follows, viz.: $200.00 at the commencement of the work, $200.00 more at its completion, and the balance of $400.00 one year after the completion of the work. Before the bridge was commenced the legislature divided the municipality into two municipalities; the new municipality within which was the place where the bridge was to be erected was organised in January, 1884, and its council met immediately thereupon.\nBefore anything had been done towards the erection of the bridge under the agreement signed by Grant in 1882, the question of the erection of the bridge was discussed by the council of the new municipality at several meetings at which or at some of which Grant was present, and the council having satisfied themselves as to the terms of the contract signed by Grant at a meeting of council approved thereof and directed Grant to proceed with the work upon the terms of the contract he had signed, and the $200.00 payable at the commencement of the work was subsequently paid to Grant in pursuance of a resolution of the council to that effect passed on the 29th March, 1884.\nThereupon Grant proceeded to erect the bridge. In the month of November, 1884, in consideration of $500.00, paid to him by the plaintiff he assigned to the plaintiff his contract with the municipal corporation for the building of the bridge, and thereby undertook to assist the plaintiff in the completion thereof. Plaintiff thereupon proceeded with the erection of the bridge. In the month of January, 1885, Grant gave an order upon the municipality in the following words to one Clendinning :\nMunicipality of North Dufferin will please pay W. H.

Afterwards in the month of April, 1885, absolution was passed by the council of the municipality which was transmitted to Grant by the clerk of the council as follows:\nMoved by councillor Morrison, seconded by councillor Reekie, that the clerk be instructed to notify John F. Grant, that unless he takes immediate steps to complete the bridge between sections 28 and 33, township 6, R. 4 W., his contract will be annulled and the council will proceed to complete the same.\u2014Carried.\nYou will please govern yourself according to above motion and accept this notice.\nYours truly,\nJ. H. HAVERSON.\nClerk.\nUnder these circumstances it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the original parol contract with Grant, made with the corporation as formerly constituted, was ratified and adopted and made their own by the managing body of the municipality as subsequently constituted, who alone had power to bind the corporation. It was further proved in evidence that the bridge was an actual necessity for the public convenience of the inhabitants of the municipality, that is to say, of the corporate body. That the erection of the bridge was a matter within the purposes for which the municipal corporation was created cannot, in my opinion, admit of a doubt. By the 19th section of the Manitoba Act respecting municipalities, passed on the 14th February, 1880, roads and bridges are enumerated among a long list of other matters which are placed under the jurisdiction of the councils of every municipality. By an act passed on the 23rd December, 1880, it is expressly enacted that:\nAll roads and road allowances within the province shall be held to be under the jurisdiction of the municipality within the limits of which such roads or road allowances are situated, and such municipality shall be charged with the maintenance of the same with such assistance as they may receive from time to time from the Government of the province.\nUnder this act there can, I think, be no doubt that jurisdiction is vested in the councils of every municipality to construct a bridge over a river crossing a road within the limits of the municipality, so as to unite the termini of the road on either side of the river, and thus to make the bridge when constructed a part of the road. By the act respecting municipalities in the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, passed on the 15th May, 1881, it is enacted in its 20th section that:\nIn every municipality the council may pass by-laws for such municipalities in relation to (among other things enumerated) roads and bridges, provided that no by-law shall compel any person bound to perform statute labour on any public highway, road or bridge to perform the same, or any part thereof, at any point more than three miles distant from the land in regard to which the liability to j3erform the labour is imposed.\nBy the 111th section of 47 Vic. ch. 11, entitled \u201c an Act to revise and amend the Acts relating to Municipalities,\u201d passed on the 29th April, 1884, the same provision is made in the following language : In every city, town or local municipality the council may pass bylaws for such municipalities in relation to (among other things enumerated) roads and bridges, and the construction, and maintenance of roads and bridges wholly within the municipality, provided that, &c.,\nas in the identical language of the 20th section of the act of 1881, above quoted.\nNow, it has been argued that as these sections authorised the municipal councils to exercise their jurisdiction over roads and bridges by by-laws, they are precluded from exercising their jurisdiction otherwise than by a by-law, and so that no road or bridge could be repaired or made fit to be travelled on unless a by-law should be first passed for the purpose. The answer to this contention is to be found in the language of Lord Justice. Turner in Wilson v. West Hartlepool ([69]) quoted above. Affirmative words in a statute saying that a thing may be done in one way do not constitute a prohibition to its being done in any other way. The word \u201cmay\u201d in the section of the Manitoba act enacting that the councils may pass by-laws, &c, in relation to the several purposes mentioned in the act is by the Manitoba Interpretation Act to be construed as permissive only, not as imperative. Although, therefore, a by-law is a mode by which councils may exercise their jurisdiction over roads and bridges within the municipality, still there is nothing in the above acts affecting municipalities in Manitoba which prohibits the councils from exercising their jurisdiction in any other way. As to the defendants\u2019 pleas, that before they had notice of the assignment by Grant to the plaintiff of the former\u2019s contract with the defendants, and his causes of action thereunder, they paid certain moneys in the pleas mentioned under a judge\u2019s order made at the hearing of a certain garnishee summons sued out by one Glendinning against the said Grant, and duly served on the defendants, all that is necessary to say is that the defendants failed to produce evidence in support of these pleas and rested their case upon the contention that the contract was void for want of the corporate seal.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered for the plaintiff in the court below for $563, together with interest upon $163, part thereof, from the 7th July, 1885, and upon $400, balance thereof, from the 7th July, 1886, together with the plaintiff\u2019s costs of suit.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The local municipality of North Dufferin was organized by the statute of Manitoba 46 & 47 Vic. ch. 1, which was passed in July, 1883, and took effect on the first of January, 1884. It consists of the townships 4, 5 and 6, in ranges 3, 4 and 5 west.\nBy an act passed in 1880, 43 Vic. ch. 1, the province of Manitoba had been divided into municipalities, one of which was called Dufferin North and comprised six townships. Those six townships were by the act of 1883 formed into two municipalities, three of them becoming the municipality of Carlton, and the other three, viz., 4, 5 and 6, in ranges 3, 4 and 5 west the municipality of North Dufferin. The old name of Dufferin North was not continued.\nEvery municipality formed under the said acts and the inhabitants thereof were declared to be a body corporate. The powers of every such municipality were, by express enactment, to be exercised by the council thereof\nThe municipal council of Dufferin North had in 1882, made an agreement with one Grant for the building of a bridge over the river Boyne upon a road allowance in township No. 6. The price was to be $800 ; $200 to be paid at the commencement of the work, $200 at the completion of it and $400 one year after completion. The defendants allege that that contract was not under the seal of the corporation, but there is no direct evidence in proof of that allegation. Grant had one part or copy of the contract. It was produced at the trial but has since been o mislaid, which I regret for I should like to see it. It was signed by Grant but was not under the corporate seal, nor was it signed by any one on behalf of the municipality. But there was another\u2014the original or duplicate original, we are not told which. It was retained by the council but it had unfortunately got out of sight and could not be found by the clerk when the new council wanted to see it in January, 1884, and has not since been found. The following is the information given by the clerk of the old council to the clerk of the new council:\n28th January, 1884.\nAgreement between J. F. Grant and municipality of North Dufferin has, by some means, got mislaid. I have it some place, but can\u2019t tell where just now. I remember the conditions which were, as to payment, two hundred dollars at commencement of work, two hundred on completion, and four hundred in one year from completion.\nSaid bridge to be subject to an inspector to be appointed by the council. Council expected the bridge to be completed by 1st January, 1883.\nI am, yours truly.\nCHRIS. F. COLLINS.\nTo JNO. H. HAVERSON.\nThe case is discussed in the court below as if it had been established that the original contract was not under seal, not merely that the plaintiff had failed to prove that it was sealed. I cannot adopt that affirmative finding. It is unsupported by any direct evidence. It assumes, what no witness is reported to have said, that the paper retained by Mr. Collins was in all respects like the one given to Grant, not even signed on behalf of one of the contracting parties. I should be slow to assume that, and should think it more likely that Grant had the paper that was meant to be retained by the council, being the one with Grant\u2019s signature, and that one which was to be his voucher as against council was inadvertently kept from him. If the fact were important I should without hesitation presume that the contract was duly sealed. That presumption would be warranted, if not compelled, by the conduct of the whole matter. It would be in support of justice and would not be, as presumptions have often been, opposed to any fact that appears in evidence.\nBut it is of little or no consequence whether the municipality of Dufferin North was or was not legally bound to Mr. Grant. The defendant municipality did not inherit the burden or the benefit of the contracts of the defunct corporation. That devolution occurred only when a new municipality was coterminous with one of the old ones ([70]). The defendant corporation has to answer only for its own engagements, and its liability to the plaintiff must depend on the effect of its own doings.\nNo part of Grant\u2019s contract had been performed when the new council took office. That council probably assumed that he was bound to the defendant municipality, and Grant perhaps thought so too. The council procured from Mr. Collins the particulars contained in his letter and urged the doing of the work. Grant was sometimes present at the meetings when the matter was discussed. The reeve gave very distinct and very fair evidence about the matter in his examination and somewhat prolix cross-examination. The substance is contained in this answer :\nA. The municipality of North. Dufferin were prepared to carry out the conditions of the contract that had been entered into by the old municipality of North Dufferin, and we instructed the clerk to notify Mr. Grant that we would do so. On the 29th March, 1884, a payment of $200 to Grant was included in an order passed in the council for the payment of sundry accounts, and the money was paid to him.\nOn the 18th of April, 1885, a resolution was passed :\nThat the clerk be instructed to notify John F. Grant, that unless he took immediate steps to complete the bridge between sections 28 and 33, township 6, range 4 west, his contract will be annulled, and the council will proceed to complete the same.\nThen the bridge was built, and on the 4th of July, 1885, it was resolved :\nThat the bridge over the Boyne river, between sections 28 and 33, township 6, range 4, west, as built by John F. Grant be accepted, and that $200 as per contract be paid into county court, on solicitor\u2019s advice less $37, amount already paid on order.\nThe payment into court was made because the debt had been garnished by a creditor of Grant.\nIn November, 1884, Grant had assigned his contract to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had completed the bridge and had, on the 25th of June, 1885, given the following notice to the council :\nI wish to notify the hon. warden and councillors of the municipality of North Dufferin, that I have completed the bridge over the Boyne river between the north-east \u00bc of sec. 28 and the south-east \u00bc of sec. 33, township 6, range 4 west. I solicit the hon. council to have it inspected at your earliest convenience, by so doing you will much oblige your humble servant,\nDOSITHE BERNARDIN.\nThat notice led to the resolution of the 4th\u2019 July, and the resolution and payment were communicated to the plaintiff by the clerk of the municipality, by the following letter:\nCARMAN, MANITOBA, 7th July, 1885.\nD. BERNARD IN, Esq.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014In answer to your letter to the council relative to completion of Grant bridge : I beg to inform you that the same has been accepted, and by order of council $200 will be paid into county court (less amount of previous orders paid) on advice of municipal solicitor. You are, no doubt, aware that Grant\u2019s contract money has been garnished by W. H. Clendinning, which necessitates this step.\nYours truly,\nJ. H. HAVERSON.\nThe $37 had been paid to Clendenning in April, 1885, on an order given to him by Grant after the assignment to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff maintains that the $200 thus paid to the creditor of Grant ought to have been paid to him, and he sues for that sum together with the deferred instalment of $400 which was payable one year after the completion of the work, or in July, 1886.\nThe defence is that the municipality is not liable to pay for the bridge because there was no contract under its corporate seal.\nThat defence was sustained by Mr. Justice Bain who tried the action, and afterwards by the Chief Justice of Manitoba and Mr. Justice Killam in banc, Mr. Justice Dubuc dissenting.\nThe case presents some striking features. The statute which incorporates the municipality declares that the powers of the body politic shall be exercised by the council thereof. The council at its formal meetings, and acting in furtherance of what it deemed to be the interest of the municipality, urge Mr. Grant to build the bridge on terms that had been agreed on with another body, and which the council and Grant were willing should be the terms between them. Grant having been set in motion, a sum of $200 is paid to him on account of the work and in accordance with the terms of the original agreement. The work is then completed, partly by Grant and partly by the plaintiff as transferee of the agreement. The plaintiff formally notifies the council of the completion of the work. It is, thereupon, inspected on the part of the council and approved, and the council\u2019s approval and acceptance of the work formally embodied in a resolution which is formally communicated to the plaintiff. Something further is done. The $200 which was to be paid on the completion of the work is set apart for that purpose and is actually paid, but by an oversight is paid to the wrong person. A year later $400, half the price of the work, should also have been paid.\nThe bridge is on one of the travelled highways of the municipality, crossing a river which the reeve tells us was impassable without it. It is as much a part of the highway as the gravel or broken stone that metals the roadway. It has been kept in repair by the municipality. But the plaintiff is told that he has no claim on the municipality for payment because he has no contract under the common seal of the corporation.\nIf the decision proceeds upon a true conception of the spirit and effect of the municipal system adopted for the Province of Manitoba it proves that, in one particular at least, the system is not well fitted for the conduct of the affairs of rural communities such as the municipality of North Dufferin. The settlers in these communities, recruited from many nations, being for the most part tillers of the soil, and with no pretension to knowledge of the intricacies of the English law relating to corporations, may find it hard to understand why a man is not entitled to be paid by the municipality for work of a character not only useful to the community but one of the most essential local improvements, which he has done at the express instance of the governing body of the municipality, the body charged by statute with the management of affairs, and which that body has further by express and formal action approved and accepted.\nWe must, of course, be careful not to let the hardship of the plaintiff\u2019s position affect our views of the law further than as it illustrates the importance of interpreting a statute like the one before us so as to make the working of it by the members of these rural municipalities, or local municipalities as they are called in the statute, as simple and beset with as few intricacies and pit-falls as the language of the law will allow.\nI think, however, that the plaintiff is entitled to have the evidence treated as favourably as it will fairly warrant on one or two subsidiary matters of fact, which may or may not be important but in regard to which a somewhat strict view seems to have been taken. Thus, the learned judge at the trial remarks that no evidence was given to show the necessity of the work further than the bridge was across the river at a well travelled highway. That was by itself pretty good evidence but there was more than that. The action of the two successive councils was evidence of the necessity for the work furnished by those whose duty it was to deal with the matter, and there was in addition the following testimony from the reeve who was the only witnessed examined :\nQ. After the completion of that bridge, after its acceptance on the 4th July, what has been done with it since, between that time and now ? A. It has been used by the municipality.\nQ. What is it ? A. It is a bridge over the Boyne river, on the road allowance, between sections 28 and 33.\nQ. Is that a still travelled road ? A. Yes, a regular highway.\nQ. Do you think you would be able to get across if there was not a bridge ? A. No.\nQ. Is it a necessity ? A. Yes.\nQ. Who has taken charge of the bridge with regard to repairs, &c, since that time ? A. The municipality. Q. The present defendants ? A. Yes.\nAgain, Mr. Justice Killam, with whose judgment the learned Chief Justice concurred, remarked that it did not appear whether the $200 ordered to be paid to Grant on the 24th of March, 1884, was paid, though the plaintiff gave credit for it, apparently overlooking the resolution of the 4th of July, 1885, which provided for the second $200 that was due on the completion of the work, from which the inevitable inference as against the council is that the first $200 had been paid.\nIn my view of the statute of 1884 the 44th section has an important bearing QU the question before us.\nThe powers of every such municipality shall be exercised by the council thereof.\nI am unable to construe this section as it has been construed by the majority of the court below. The view there held will best appear from an extract from the judgment of Mr. Justice Killam.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s counsel has referred us to the 44th section of the Municipal Act of 1884, which provides that, \u201c The powers of every such municipality shall be exercised by the council thereof.\u201d What are the powers of the municipality and in what mode can the council exercise them ?\nThe 43rd section provides that the municipality \u201cshall have all the rights and be subject to all the liabilities of a corporation,\u201d and especially to acquire, &c, property, to sue and be sued, to \u201c become parties to any contracts or agreements in the management of the affairs of the said municipality,\u201d &c. The language of the section is all very general, and if interpreted generally would involve the right to make any kind of contract for any purposes whatever. Such can never be considered to be intended. We must look elsewhere to find the objects and purposes for which these corporations are created, the \u201caffairs \u201d to be managed. We find no mention of the roads and bridges or similar local improvements, to be constructed or made by the municipality itself, until we come to the 111th section, under which, \u201cthe council may pass by-laws for such municipality in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say : (1) The raising of a municipal revenue * * * (2) The expenditure of the municipal revenue. (3) Roads and bridges and the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges wholly within the municipality,\u201d &c, and giving a large number of other subjects.\nExcept under these provisions the act itself gives the municipalities no power whatever to undertake the construction or maintenance of roads and bridges. The only other authority for their doing so is found in the Act 44 Vic. (2nd sess.) c. 5, if, indeed, that be applicable.\nWith great respect for the learned judge, who has given us the assistance of a full and able presentation of his views upon the controversy in the case, I submit that his mode of looking at this portion of the statute assumes that the legislature took a rather roundabout way of conveying what could, if intended, have been easily said in plain terms. When the 43rd section declares that municipal corporations\u2014\nshall he in law capable of * * * becoming parties to any contracts or agreements in the management of the affairs of the said municipality\u2014\nthere is no suggestion that we are to look to section 111 to find what is meant by the affairs of the municipality. Nor do I see any reason to be startled by the extent of the power to contract affirmed by the words in their literal force. The limitation of the contracting power to the affairs of the municipality, which is expressed and would have been implied if it had not been expressed, must not be overlooked. Section 43 declares that the municipality shall have all the powers and shall be subject to all the liabilities of a corporation. That covers all the ground. The enumeration that follows\u2014\u201c and especially to acquire,\u201d &c, &c.\u2014does not limit the generality of the former expression. It embraces some of the ordinary corporate franchises and bestows some others, such as borrowing powers. The object of the incorporation is to provide for the convenient and efficient management of matters of common interest, \u201c the affairs of the municipality,\u201d and amongst those the making and maintenance of roads must have a prominent place. Express power to make or mend roads was not necessary, and the existence of the power is tacitly recognised by the statute in such provisions as those contained in sections 206 to 217 concerning statute labour, and in sections 221, 427, 431 and others respecting the alteration of old roads and the opening of new ones.\nSection 111 gives certain powers of a legislative character to the council, but does not meddle with its executive functions. It enacts that:\nIn every city, town, or local municipality the council may pass by-laws, for such municipality in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say :\u2014[Setting out 39 classes of subjects] and such by-laws shall be executory and remain in force until they are amended, repealed or annulled by competent authority, or until the expiration of the period for which they have been made.\nThe council is thus empowered to make general regulations for the municipality, or to adopt a systematic method of dealing with the subjects there enumerated. All of those subjects, with one or at most two exceptions, are obviously matters that cannot be properly dealt with except under such general regulations. Article No. 3 relates to\u2014\nroads and bridges and the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges wholly within the municipality.\nBut that a general law on that subject is what is meant, which may regulate the exercise of a power not derived from this section, is apparent not only from the context but from the remainder of the article itself, which is :\nProviding that no by-law shall compel any person bound to perform statute labour on any public highway, road or bridge to perform the same or any part thereof at any point, more than three miles distant from the land in regard to which the liability to perform the labour is imposed.\nThe section is strictly permissive in its form. Some of the subjects enumerated in its 39 articles, probably most of them, would not, without special authorization, be within the scope of municipal management, but others would be so\u2014roads and bridges for example, and the expenditure of the municipal revenue, which is the subject of article 2. A corporation has the same right to pay its way as a natural person has, and the authority given to the council to pass a by-law for the municipality in relation to the expenditure of the municipal revenue does not imply anything to the contrary. This topic being collateral to the main enquiry which I shall presently deal with it may be occupying time unnecessarily to refer to authorities, but I may be permitted to cite the resolution of the court in the case of Sutton s Hospital ([71]). I read the passage as it is quoted by Mr. Justice Blackburn in Riche v. Ashbury Railway Company ([72]), with an observation thereon made by that learned judge :\nBut the resolution of the court, as reported by Coke (at p. 30b), was that \u201c when a corporation is duly created all other incidents are tacite annexed * * * and, therefore, divers clauses subsequent in the charter are not of necessity, but only declaratory, and might well have been left out. As, 1, by the same to have authority, ability and capacity to purchase ; but no clause is added that they may alien, &c, and it need not, for it is incident. 2. To sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded. 3. To have a seal, &c.; that is also declaratory, for when they are incorporated they may make or use what seal they will. 4. To restrain them from aliening or demising, but in a certain form ; that is an ordinance testifying the King\u2019s desire, but it is but a precept and doth not bind in law.\u201d This seems to me an express authority that at common law it is an incident to a corporation to use its common seal for the purpose of binding itself to anything to which a natural person could bind himself, and to deal with its property as a natural person might deal with his own.\nThe case of Evan v. Corporation of Avon ([73]) places a municipal corporation on the same footing as other corporations, showing that, apart from the municipal corporations act, it has full power to dispose of all its property like a private individual.\nOne word with reference to the statute, 44 Vic. ch. 5, which is mentioned by Mr. Justice Killam. The 1st section of it enacts that:\nAll the roads and road allowances within the province shall beheld to be under the jurisdiction of the municipality within the limits of which such roads or road allowances are situated, and such municipality shall be charged with the maintenance of the same with such assistance as they may receive from time to time from the government of the province.\nI throw this into the scale along with the considerations I have advanced upon the proposition that the maintenance of roads is one of the affairs of the municipality irrespective of and anterior to any by-law which the council may pass.\nA suggestion made in argument that \u201cmaintenance\u201d did not include construction, but merely keeping the roads and road allowances in the state the council found them in, can hardly have been made seriously. If a road allowance was simply to be let alone the assistance of the government was not required.\nThe act of 1883 ([74]) which divided the province into counties cast upon the county council the duty of erecting and maintaining bridges over rivers that form or cross the boundary lines of municipalities, but made no provision in express terms for bridging rivers that cross roads within a municipality. That was obviously treated as the affair of the municipality.\nThe English Municipal Corporations Act, 1882 ([75]), provides that :\nThe municipal corporation of a borough shall be capable of acting by the council of the borough, and the council shall exercise all powers vested in the corporation by this act or otherwise.\nAnd, by another section, that the council may from time to time make such by-laws as to them seem meet for the good rule and government of the borough, and for the prevention and suppression of nuisances, &c, &c, which provision is analogous in principle and also in form, though with less of detail, to section 111.\nThe English Municipal Corporations Act, 1835 ([76]), had a provision which may have been equivalent to section 10 of the act of 1882, but was differently framed. After declaring that a long list of corporate bodies, named in schedules, should take and bear the name of The Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the several boroughs it added :\nAnd by that name shall have perpetual succession and shall be capable in law, by the council hereinafter mentioned of such borough, to do and suffer all acts which now lawfully they and their successors respectively may do and suffer by any name or title of incorporation, &c.\nI may have to allude again to these English acts.\nIt should be noticed, in connection with the topic of the power of the council to act for the corporation, that the Manitoba statute does not prescribe the method by which the council is to act. While it is enacted that every by-law is to be sealed with the corporate seal there is no general provision, such as is contained in the Ontario Municipal Acts, that the powers of the council shall be exercised by by-law. The omission is, I think, significant and it strikes me as being well advised.\nIt would be useless for me to enter into an examination of the general subject of the liability of a corporation when it has not bound itself by any instrument under its common seal. The subject will be found discussed with sufficient fulness in one or two judgments which I intend to read as part of my argument. The ancient rule, as it is called, has long lost the attribute of inflexibility. The present rule may, not inaptly, be thus expressed : A corporation can be bound only by its common seal unless when it is convenient that it should be bound without it. The; range of the so-called exceptions to the rule has reached an extent which will be shown by the judgments to which I allude. I shall merely remark at present that I do not agree with an observation made in the court below that cases such as the Mayor of Stafford v. Till ([77]) and Beverley v. Lincoln Gas Light Company ([78]) where the immediate point was the form of action, are to be regarded as a distinct class of cases on the subject When the right or liability of a corporation to sue or be sued in assumpsit is discussed the question is the capacity of the corporation to be a party to a simple contract, which is the main question.\nDicta of judges have now and then been addressed to the explanation of the principle of the exceptions, but the explanations given vary a good deal from one another. If stress is to be placed on opinions thus expressed it will be found that the reasons sometimes given for adherence to the general rule show its inapplicability to cases like the present. Take the case of The Mayor, &c, of Ludlow v. Charlton (3) which is so much relied, on against the relaxation of the rule where municipal corporations are concerned. Lord Cranworth (then Rolph B.) who delivered the judgment of the court said, amongst other general observations :\nThe seal is required as authenticating the concurrence of the whole body corporate. If the legislature, in erecting a body corporate, invest any member of it, either expressly or impliedly, with authority to bind the whole body by his mere signature, or otherwise, then, undoubtedly, the adding a seal would be purely a matter of form and not of substance. * * * ? The resolution of a meeting, however numerously attended, is after all not the act of the whole body. Every member knows that he is bound by what is done under the corporate seal and by nothing else. It is a great mistake, therefore, to speak of the necessity for a seal as a relic of ignorant times. It is no such thing : Either a seal, or some substitute for a seal, which by law shall be taken as conclusively evidencing the sense of the whole body corporate, is a necessity inherent in the very nature of a corporation, and the attempt to get rid of the old doctrine by treating as valid contracts made with particular members, and which do not come within the exceptions to which we have adverted, might be productive of great inconvenience. Now let us see how the doctrines thus formulated apply to the case before us. The corporation under the statute of Manitoba ([79]) consists of the municipality and the inhabitants thereof, a comprehensive definition even if savouring of tautology. The seal would not express the sense of every member of the corporation. It would, if so understood, be a delusion. The statute which creates the corporation invests certain members of it, viz.: the reeve and six councillors, with authority to bind the whole body. \u201c The powers of the municipality shall be exercised by the council thereof.\u201d There is no such thing as a general meeting or any other method of managing the affairs of the corporation or ascertaining the corporate will. The seal is therefore a matter of form and not of substance. It may bind the corporation as being affixed by persons authorised to act for the corporation, but is only a formal act.\nThe rule in the United States is thus stated by Mr. Dillon in section 450 of his treatise on municipal corporations :\nModern decisions have established the law to be that the contracts of municipal corporations need not be under seal unless the charter so requires. The authorised body of a municipal corporation may bind it by an ordinance, which in favour of private persons interested therein may, if so intended, operate as a contract ; or they may bind it by a resolution, or by a vote clothe its officers, agents or committees with power to act for it; and a contract made by persons thus appointed by the corporation though by parol (unless it be one which the law requires to be in writing) will bind it.\nReading this passage along with that which I have quoted from the judgment in Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton (2), and with reference to this Manitoba corporation, it seems to me that the action of the council in the matter of the contract in question can be brought under the American doctrines without transgressing the principle expounded by Lord Cranworth. I do not think that what was said by Patteson J. in Beverley v. Lincoln Gas Light Company ([80]), partly with reference to the American law a leading decision of which is that of the Supreme Court of the United States in Bank of Columbia v. Patterson ([81]), has ever been disapproved. He said:\nIt is well known that the ancient rule of the common law, that a corporation aggregate could speak and act only by its common seal, has been almost entirely superseded in practice by the courts of the United States in America. The decisions of those courts, though intrinsically entitled to the highest respect, cannot be cited as direct authority for our proceedings ; and there are obvious circumstances which justify their advancing with a somewhat freer step to the discussion of ancient rules of our common law than would be proper for ourselves. It should be stated, however, that, in coming to the decision alluded to, those courts have considered themselves, not as altering the law, but as justified by the progress of previous decisions in this country and in America. We, on our part, disclaim entirely the right or the wish to innovate on the law upon any ground of inconvenience, however strongly made out ; but when we have to deal with a rule established in a state of society very different from the present, at a time when corporations were comparatively few in number, and upon which it was very early found necessary to engraft many exceptions, we think we are justified in treating it with some degree of strictness, and are called upon not to recede from the principle of any relaxation in it which we find to have been established by previous decisions. If that principle, in fair reasoning, leads to a relaxation of the rule for which no prior decision can be found expressly in point, the mere circumstance of novelty ought not to deter us; for it is the principle of every case which is to be regarded ; and a sound decision is authority for all the legitimate consequences which it involves.\nThese remarks seem very pertinent in the present case. The state of society in the province of Manitoba differs widely from that of the ancient days in England. Whatever were the conditions that pointed towards the discussion of the ancient rules of the common law in the United States with less restraint than might be felt in England the same conditions repeat themselves in the new province. The question whether an executory contract made by the council of one of these municipalities, not under the corporate seal, can be enforced against the corporation should, I think, be considered as an open question. It is not necessary now to decide it because this contract is executed. It has not, for the same reason, been fully argued. I therefore say no more with regard to the point than that there is room for argument on both sides of the question.\nRegarding the contract as executed, and I have shown why I think that beyond dispute, I think the preponderance of authority, amounting to an overwhelming preponderance, as well as the reason of the thing and the plain demands of justice, concur in favour of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, even if by reason of the absence of the seal the council could have withdrawn before the work was done.\nIn the province of Ontario similar questions have often arisen but during the last thirty years they have been decided upon the law as settled by the Court of Error and Appeal in Pim v. The Municipal Council of the County of Ontario ([82]). The corporation in that case had made a parol contract for the building of a court house and gaol, and had accepted the buildings but refused to pay for them until compelled by the decision I refer to. Setting aside the point I make as to the effect of section 44 the case may be considered as on all fours with the one in hand. The corporation had possession of the buildings in Pim\u2019s case and occupied them, but I take it that the acceptance of the bridge in the present case is even more complete, having regard to the expressed approval of the work, and there is moreover as complete an assumption of possession as the nature of the work admits of. To revert to an illustration already used, what was done is in effect the same as if the council gave an order or made a contract in any other way, but not under seal, for the supply and laying on the road of so much broken stone at so much a toise, and then, when the work was done, approved and accepted it by formal resolution communicated to the contractor. The bridge case is somewhat stronger because it is proved that the municipality keeps the bridge in repair.\nThe points which I desire to make on this branch of the case are clearly made and ably supported by Chancellor Blake in the judgment delivered by him in Pim\u2019s case. In place of myself traversing the same ground I shall read the report of his remarks as part of my argument. I refer also to what was said on the same occasion by Mr. Justice Hagarty, who is now the Chief Justice of Ontario. The judgment of the Chancellor is as follows :\nThe Chancellor.\u2014The present state of the law upon the subject is a reproach to the administration of justice in England. It may be that the evil calls for legislative interference, but if the legislature will neither declare the law nor alter it courts of justice are bound to place their decisions upon some principle intelligible to the public and sufficient for their guidance.\nIt is said, I believe, in the case now under appeal, that the decisions in the English courts harmonise and negative the right of the present, plaintiff to relief. But the cases which have arisen since the decision in the court below show that the judgments in the English courts are in direct conflict, and are so treated by the learned judges by whom they were pronounced. In Smart v. The Guardians of the Poor of the West Ham Union (1) Parke B, says, \u201cThe case which has been cited and relied upon for the plaintiff is a case with which I cannot agree. It would in effect overrule several previous decisions of this court\u201d ; and Alderson B. adds, \u201c I quite agree with the observation of my brother Parke in reference to the judgment in Clarke v. The Guardians of the Cuckfield Union (2) as it is directly in opposition to several cases decided by the court upon similar questions. To these cases we should adhere until they are overruled by a court of error.\u201d While in the case alluded to, Mr. Justice Wightman admits his inability to reconcile his own judgment with the cases in the Exchequer ; and in Henderson v. The Australian Steam Navigation Co. ([83]), which is, I believe, the latest case upon the subject, Mr. Justice Crompton says with becoming candour, \u201cAt the same time I cannot distinguish this from Diggie v. The Blackwall Railway Co. ([84]), Homersham v. The Wolverhampton Water Works Co. ([85]). I cannot disguise from myself that we are deciding the case in opposition to these authorities, which have, however, I believe, excited some surprise.\u201d See also and contrast Clarke v. The Cuckfield Union ([86]), and Sanders v. St. Neot\u2019s Union ([87]), with Diggle v. The Blackwall Railway Co: and Lamprell v. The Guardians of the Poor of the Billericay Union (6), and other cases in the Exchequer.\nIt cannot be doubted therefore, that the authorities in the English courts conflict, and it is certainly difficult, moreover, to extract from them any satisfactory principle for our guidance. But the cases have been so often collected and so fully commented upon of late days, and are so familiar to every one conversant with the subject, that it would be mere pedantry to enter upon a detailed review of them here. I shall content myself, therefore, with a short statement of the principle upon which, in my humble opinion, the judgment of the court below ought to be reversed.\nThe action in this case is brought upon an executed contract. The court house had been built under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the defendants\u2019 architect before action brought. The justice, therefore, of compelling the defendants to pay for the work, labour and materials, of which they have had the benefit, is obvious ; and if there be a principle upon which they are to be absolved from that just liability, it must be the principle that being a corporation their will cannot be expressed except through their common seal; and as they are incapacitated from making their own will known except through their common seal, so it cannot be implied by courts of justice from their conduct, so as to subject them to any liability either in tort or assumpsit.\nNow it will be found, I apprehend, that there never was any such universal rule as that which has been su23posed. The old notion certainly was, that a corporation being a body politic, and invisible, could neither act nor speak, except by its common seal (7), or as it was expressed in argument in Rex v. Bigg (8), the common seal was the hand and seal of the corporation. But that dogma, never well founded in point of reason, was from the first subject to considerable qualification, and has undergone, from time to time, still further limitations.\nMatters of small amount and frequent recurrence were always treated as exceptions from the rule. It is difficult to understand the principle upon which that class of cases is said to have proceeded. Had the rule rested upon a different foundation it might have been \u2018 relaxed for purposes of convenience, but being a rule of necessity, and not of policy, it is difficult to understand how it can be made to consist with the cases to which I have referred. See observations of Macaulay C. J. in Marshall v. The School Trustees of Kitley ([88]) and of Patteson J. in Beverley v. The Lincoln Gas Light and Coke Co. ([89]). In Henderson v. The Australian Steam Navigation Co. ([90]), already cited, Erie J., says : \u201c It would be very dangerous to rest the exception upon the ground of frequency or, insignificance ; nor do I gather from the cases that that has been put forward as the principle. Certainly as to trading corporations the exception has not been so limited, and I think that the soundest principle on such a matter is to look to the nature, and subject-matter of the contract, and if that is found to be within the fair scope of the purposes of incorporation to hold the contract binding, even though not under seal.\u201d The doctrine propounded by Mr. Justice Erie, if it be sound, and I am very much inclined to think it so, would furnish a solution for most of the difficulties which have arisen upon the subject; but upon that point, which does not necessarily arise in the case before us, we need not express any opinion, because the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain this action may be rested, as it seems to me, on well-established principles.\nWhen it had been determined that the corporate will might be ascertained in certain cases otherwise than through the common seal, and that, as a necessary consequence, assumpsit might be maintained in such cases either by or against corporations even upon executory contracts, the difficulty of maintaining the rule as to torts and executed contracts must have been obvious. Had the old dogma been maintained in its integrity a corporation could not have been liable in tort unless the agent had been appointed or the act adopted under the corporate seal, and in no case could a promise have been implied by law from conduct ; and upon reasoning of that sort the liability of corporations under such circumstances has been from time to time resisted. But the inconvenience and injustice of such a rule was felt to be intolerable. Had this been the law corporations would have been, as Mr. Justice Coleridge has expressed it, a great nuisance. Hall v. The Mayor of Swansea ([91]).\nAnd it is now well settled that corporations aggregate are liable in tort although there has been nothing under the common seal authorizing the agent or adopting his act. Yarborough v. The Bank of England ([92]); Smith v. Birmingham Gas Go. ([93]); Eastern Counties Railway Co. v. Broom ([94]). Again when land has been used and occupied by a corporation the law implies a promise to pay a reasonable compensation. Dean and Chapter of Rochester v. Pierce ([95]); Mayor of Stafford v. Till ([96]); Lowe v. London and North Western Railway Co. ([97]). And when money has been wrongfully received, assumpsit for money had arid received may be maintained. Hall v. The Mayor of Swansea.\nNow if trover and trespass may be maintained under the circumstances to which I have alluded, and if the law implies a contract when land has been used, or moneys wrongfully received, it is difficult to understand why the same principle should not be applied wherever the contract being legal has been executed and the corporation has received all that it could have demanded if there had been a contract under the corporate seal. The argument seems to me, I must confess, conclusive. In Hall v. The Mayor of Swansea Lord Denman rests the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, which has not, I believe, been questioned, upon the ground of necessity ; and that language of Lord Denman has been since translated by Lord Campbell to mean \u201cno other than a moral necessity ; that the defendants should pay their debts\u201d; or as Mr. Justice Erie has expressed the same sentiment, \u201cthat it was absolutely necessary that the defendants should be compelled to do that winch common honesty required.\u201d Lowe v. The London and North-Western Railway Co. Now, if the necessity in Hall v. The Mayor of Swansea was the moral necessity of compelling the defendants to do what common honesty required, assuredly that necessity exists to as great an extent at least in cases circumstanced like the present when the consideration has been executed and the corporation has received all that it could have required if there had been a formal contract under the corporate seal.\nBut the distinction between executed and executory contracts does not depend upon the reason of the thing, however clear ; it has been repeatedly recognized by judges of the greatest eminence ; in The East London Waterworks Co. v. Bailey (8) Best C. J. in enumerating the cases in which a corporation is liable, although no contract has been executed under the corporate seal, says, \u201c The first is when the contract is executed ; in that case the law implies a promise, and a deed under seal is not necessary, as we have lately decided in The Mayor of Stafford v. Till ([98]), where it was hold en that a corporation might maintain assumpsit for the use and occupation of the land.\u201d And in Beverley v. The Lincoln Gas Light and Coke Go. ([99]), Mr. Justice Patteson, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, says : \u201cIn the progress, however, of these exceptions, it has been decided that a corporation may sue in assumpsit on an executed parol contract; it has, also, been decided that it may be sued in debt on a similar contract; the question now arises on the liability to be sued in assumpsit. It appears to us that what has been already decided in principle warrants us in holding that the action is maintainable.\u201d\nIt is said, however, that the distinction between executory and executed contracts was exploded by Church v. The Imperial Gas Light and Coke Co. ([100]) which has been treated by some as a governing case upon the subject. I am not certain that Lord Denman\u2019s language, properly interpreted, means that: his lordship\u2019s object was to negative the distinction between executed and executory contracts\u2014not generally\u2014but as to contracts of a particular class ; contracts which would be valid without the corporate seal, and in parts of the judgment the language is distinctly limited to that object ; it is said, for instance, ([101]) \u201c assuming it therefore to be now established in this court that a corporation may sue or be sued in assumpsit upon executed contracts of a certain kind, among which are included such as relate to the supply of articles essential to the purposes for which it is created, the first question will be whether, as affecting this point, and in respect of sub contracts, there is any sound distinction between contracts executed or executory.\u201d The question proper on that principle is strictly confined to contracts of the particular class to which I have referred, and viewed as a solution of that question the judgment is quite sound; it must be admitted, however, that the language in other parts is much less guarded and that the case has been often assumed to be an authority for the general proposition. The Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton ([102]) ; Clarke v. The Guardians of the Cuckfield Union ([103]).\nIn answer to the argument deduced from Church v. The Imperial Gas Light and Coke Co., and the subsequent authorities in which that case has been recognised, an argument which possesses, I must admit, considerable force, I have to say, first, that the point was not decided. Secondly, that Lord Denman\\s reasoning as an argument for the general proposition is, in my humble judgment, quite conclusive. And, lastly, that since the decision of the case alluded to, the distinction in this respect between executory and executed contracts has been recognized by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, including Lord Denman himself, on more occasions than one, and has received the sanction of other judges of still greater eminence. In Sanders v. The Guardians of St Neot\u2019s Union ([104]), Lord Denman, delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, says : \u201cA motion in this case was made for a new trial on the ground that no contract under seal was proved against the defendants. But we think that they could not be permitted to take the objection, inasmuch as the work in question, after it was done and completed, was adopted by them for the purposes connected with the corporation.\u201d In Doe d. Pennington v. Taniere ([105]), the same learned judge observes : \u201c To enforce an executory contract against a corporation, it might be necessary to show that it was by deed; but where the corporation have acted as upon an executed contract, it is to be presumed against them that everything has been done that was necessary to make it a binding contract upon both parties, they having had all the advantage they would have had if the contract had been regularly made.\u201d In The Fishmonger\u2019s Company v Robertson ([106]), Chief Justice Tindal says : \u201c The question therefore becomes this, whether in the case of a contract executed before action brought, where it appears that the defendants have received the whole benefit of the consideration for which they bargained, it is an answer to an action of assumpsit by the corporation that the corporation itself was not originally bound by such contract, the same not having been made under their common seal. Upon the general ground of reason and justice no such answer can be set up.\u201d Lastly in The Governor and Company of Copper Miners in England v. Fox ([107]), Lord Campbell intimates his opinion that the distinction between executory and executed contracts had not been exploded by Church v. The Imperial Gas Light and Coke Go. ([108]).\nUpon the whole, I quite concur in the principle enunciated upon the subject so often and so clearly by His Lordship, the Chief Justice, and by the late Chief Justice of the Court of. Common Pleas, Sir J. B. Macaulay; I am of opinion that the distinction in this respect, between executed and executory contracts, is sound and ought to be maintained. I do not disguise from myself that this opinion is opposed to many cases in the Exchequer, and to much that is to be found elsewhere ; but when these decisions are in such manifest and painful conflict it becomes the duty of the court to adopt that conclusion which appears upon the whole mot consistent with the principles of justice.\nI desire also to refer to opinions expressed about the same time by other judges who, like the two just named, rank high in the annals of the jurisprudence of Upper Canada.\nThe case of Marshall v. School Trustees of Kitley ([109]), and Pim v. The Municipality of Ontario ([110]), involved the same question. Both actions were in the Common Pleas, and both were decided by that court in favour of the corporation. The former was decided one term before the latter. The decision was either reversed in appeal, though there is no published report of its having been appealed, or at all events it was overruled on the appeal of Pim\u2019s case. In Marshall\u2019s case Chief Justice Macaulay dissented from the judgment of his two colleagues, delivering a judgment which I might also quote as part of my argument if time, permitted. One judge who took part in the decision was Richards J., who afterwards became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, later Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, and ultimately Chief Justice of this court. His shrewd and practical common sense, and his knowledge of the real life of the country which no man understood more thoroughly, give interest and value to his views on the state of the law which I am about to quote :\nIn this country, he said, studded as it is with municipal and trading corporations, and where the legislature has given great facilities for the establishment of these bodies, it may be of great convenience, almost amounting to necessity, that the decision arrived at in the Supreme Court of the United States, and to some extent approved of by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench here, should be law in this province, and if it should be so decided, either by the Court of Appeals or the legislature, I am far from being certain that it would not be most convenient and advantageous. These remarks apply as directly to the state of things in Manitoba as they did to Upper Canada. The thirty-five years that have passed since they were uttered have not made the reasons for adopting the suggestions less numerous or forcible. In one respect at least the contrary has been the case, because the great extension during that period of the scheme of incorporation under general laws has been, and no doubt will continue to be, prolific of corporate associations for all kinds of objects and pursuits.\nStoneburgh v. The Municipality of Brighton (1) is another Upper Canada case which was decided by the Court of Common Pleas shortly after the decision of Pim\u2019s case by the Court of Error and Appeal, but which found its way into the reports before Pim\u2019s case. The action was for building a bridge. Draper C. J. tried the action and also delivered the judgment of the court in banc, deciding on both occasions against the plaintiff, who had built the bridge under the direction of persons acting as a committee but without sufficient authority from the council. I refer to the case for the sake of what was said as to the law and as to the evidence that would have proved an adoption of the work. On both points the remarks bear upon the questions before us.\nThe latest decisions in England have established that when a corporation is a trading one, and as I understand especially where it is established for a special purpose, they are bound by a contract made in furtherance of the purposes of the corporation, though not under their corporate seal. The same doctrine and fully to the same extent has been established in this province by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Marshall v. School Trustees of Kitley (2) and Pim v. The Municipal Council of Ontario (3). We cannot, therefore, entertain any objection for the mere want of a contract under seal to charge the defendants as a corporation. But there are other difficulties in the way. I am not prepared to admit that the township council can, by resolution, delegate to third parties power to bind them by contract for purposes which the legislature have specially entrusted to the council and enabled them to execute by the passing of by-laws. The plaintiff did not contract with any known officer or servant of the municipal corporation. * * * If therefore there is a liabilty on the part of the municipality it must arise from their subsequent adoption of the contract or a receiving of the work. * * * I thought, if in fact there had been an adoption of the contract and the work clone by an appropriation of a sum on account of it after it was so nearly brought to a conclusion, it was a matter capable of easy and direct proof.\n* * * When the expense incurred by the committee became known, and it was proposed to make an appropriation for it, the appropriation was refused, because it was thought the expenditure was unauthorized and that an unfair advantage was sought to be taken of the resolution appointing the committee. * * * As to any acceptance of the work there was no proof whatever of it, except that it was conceded that the public used the bridge as part of the highway which had theretofore been in use, and this I thought formed nothing on this point for the plaintiff.\nCan it be doubted that, with evidence such as there is in this case of the contract by the council, the acceptance of the work and the other facts already dwelt upon, the liability of the corporation would have been unhesitatingly affirmed ?\nThe difficulty which the plaintiff has encountered in this case seems to have been to a great extent due to the effect attributed by the court to two comparatively recent English decisions, Hunt v. Wimbleton Local Board ([111]) and Young v. The Mayor and Corporation of Royal Leamington Spa (2); and the difficulty, if not suggested, seems at least to have taken apparent bulk, by reason of something said in the Ontario courts respecting those cases.\nI cannot help thinking that the decisions have been misunderstood. I do not think they have nearly so much bearing on the present controversy as has been supposed.\nIt will be useful when considering those cases to refer also to two cases of Frend v. Dennett ([112]) one of which was decided in 1858 at law, and the other three or four years later in equity.\nHunt v. Wimbleton ([113]) was decided under a section of the Public Health Act, 1875 ([114]), which declared that:\nEvery contract made by an urban authority, whereof the value or amount exceeds \u00a350, shall be in writing and sealed with the common seal of such authority.\nAn earlier section of the act declared that every local board, being an urban authority, should be a corporation, but nothing turned on that provision, the urban authority sued being already a municipal corporation.\nHunt\u2019s case was discussed and decided also under the act of 1875, although, as we are told in the report, the contract was made while the Public Health Act, 1848 ([115]) was in force.\nFrend v. Dennett was of course altogether under the act of. 1848.\nUnder that act I do not understand that every Ideal board of health was a corporation, though every board had a seal. The 85th section enacted that :\nThe local board of health may enter into all such contracts as may be necessary for carrying this act into execution ; and every such contract, whereof the value or amount shall exceed \u00a310, shall be in writing and (in the case of a non-corporate district) sealed with the seal of the local board by whom the same is entered into, and signed by five or more members thereof and (in the case of a corporate district) sealed with the common seal.\nUnder each act there was the requirement of a seal, whether the common seal of a corporation, such as the Mayor and Corporation of Royal Leamington Spa or the seal of an unincorporated local board such as probably was the Wimbleton Local Board when the contract with Hunt was entered into, though the board was afterwards incorporated by the act of 1875.\nFrend v. Dennett (1) was an action against the clerk of a local board of health. The question under the Public Health Acts was the same in each of the three cases. It was not a question of the capacity of a corporation to bind itself or to be bound without seal. It was, whether a contract which a statute gave power to make, and directed to be made with certain formalities, could be made without those formalities.\nThe circumstance that one of the parties to the contract was a corporation was, to my apprehension, an accident which did not alter the character of the question under the statute.\nIn the common law case of Frend v. Dennett ([116]), Cockburn C.J. said :\nIt is sought to make the rates for the district liable upon this contract by means of an action against the clerk to the local board. Now, the power given to the board to make contracts so as to bind the rates is the creature of the Act of Parliament, and that, by the very same clause which gives the board power to enter into contracts, amongst other things expressly enacts \u201c That, &c. [quoting the part of section 85, which I have read.] I think the local board had no power to contract so as to bind the rates unless they did so in the manner pointed out by the statute.\nThe equity case ([117]) was disposed of by Lord Hatherly, then Vice Chancellor Wood, on precisely the same grounds.\nSo also were the cases of Hunt and Young.\nIn Hunt\u2019s case the clause of the statute was held to be mandatory and not directory only. I understand the decision further to have been that it was imperative even as to executed contracts, although the contract in question was held not to be executed because the local board had not, in the opinion of the court, had the benefit of the plaintiffs\u2019 work.\nThere was some general discussion by the lords justices of doctrines concerning corporations, and opinions were given which in the later case of Young v. Leamington ([118]) it was thought advisable to refrain from expressing. Lord Esher (then Brett L.J.) in particular expressed a doubt whether there was any such rule in law 01 equity as that\nwhere orders are given by or on behalf of a corporation, and those orders result in an apparent contract, though not under seal, and the party with whom that apparent contract is made has fulfilled the whole of his part of the contract, and the corporation on whose behalf such apparent contract has been made accept and enjoy the whole benefit of the performance of the contract, that then the corporation is liable, although the contract is not under seal.\nBut he did not explain the grounds of his opinion, and expressly said that it was unnecessary, for reasons which he gave, to consider the point.\nBramwell L.J. had been a member of the Court of Exchequer, but not until after the decision of the cases of Mayor of Ludlow v. Charlton ([119]) and Smart v. Guardians of West Ham Union ([120]). He did not share the doubt expressed by Lord Justice Brett, nor did he appear to entertain the extreme views on which the cases in the Exchequer had been decided.\nThis doctrine exists, he said, to some extent or to some, amount, that where a man has done work for a corporation under a contract not under seal, and the corporation have had the benefit of it, the person who has done the work may recover. But whether that is limited to contracts for small amounts or not, I repeat, I will not say. It is, however, certainly limited to cases where the benefit has been actually enjoyed, and so far as I know, to cases in which it could be said that the work is such as was necessary ; that it was work which, if the corporation had not ordered, they would not have done their duty ; or if they had not given the order for its execution, they would not have been able to carry out the purposes for which they were called into existence. That seems to have been the state of things in those cases which have decided that the plaintiff may recover when the work has been done.\nThose remarks seem to me to recognise the decisions to which they refer as having very much the effect on which the plaintiff in this action relies. Cotton L J. made some observations which point to a distinction between a corporation such as one of these boards of health which acts on behalf of the public, and our municipal corporations which are themselves the public and for whom the councils act. Brett L.J. had also referred to the fact that the corporation was the board and acted for the inhabitants. What Cotton L.J. said on this point was :\nBut it is urged that there is another exception, namely, that corporations are liable when goods have been supplied or work done in pursuance of a contract entered into not under seal and the corporation have had the full benefit of such contract. I entertain very grave doubts whether such a corporation as this could be bound on any such ground, because the parties who have a beneficial enjoyment of anything supplied on the order of this body are not the corporation but those for whom the corporation act as trustees.\nThe principal judgment in the Court of Appeal in Young v. Mayor and Corporation of Royal Leamington Spa ([121]) was delivered by Lord Justice Lindley. The case was decided expressly on the same ground as Frend v. Dennett ([122]) as had also been the case of Hunt v. Wimbleton Local Board ([123]) The question of the effect of the contract there in question having been executed was not discussed by the court, Lord Justice Lindley saying that the cases on the subject were very numerous and conflicting and required review and authoritative exposition by a court of appeal. Brett L.J , expressing, as Cotton L.J. also did, his concurrence with Lindley L.J., did so\u2014\nupon the ground that the defendants were acting as an urban sanitary authority, so that the statute and the former decision of this court apply exactly to the case. I think that the mere want of seal prevents the plaintiffs from recovering, and I am further of opinion, having read all the cases on the point, that the fact that the defendants had the benefit of the contract will not prevent them from setting up the statute in answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The mere want of a seal is a complete bar.\nIt appears from the report in the House of Lords that, in delivering his judgment, the lord justice added a statement of his opinion that in the case of a municipal corporation not bound by the statute the proper decision in point of law, according to the cases and principle, would be that the want of seal prevented in such a case as the one before him the plaintiffs succeeding, but this statement he did not allow to appear in the published report of the case. Lord Blackburn suggests that in the revised report Brett L. J. (who had become M.R.), had abstained from expressing the opinion because on reflection he saw that it was not necessary for the decision of the case to decide that, and that what he had said was a mere obiter dictum. It strikes me as possible that another reason may have had some influence, and that is that when the judgment was delivered, viz. : on 18th March, 1882, the lord justice spoke with reference to corporations governed by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835. The Municipal Corporations Act of 1882 was passed on the 18th of August, 1882, and it may have occurred to him before the judgment appeared in the law reports, which was later than August, that it would be prudent to withdraw a dictum that might require modification when the new act came to be worked under. The new act happens to be more like this Manitoba Act than the former one in one particular to which I have already adverted, though I do not say that the effect is different. I have not considered that point.\nWhen Young v. Leamington ([124]) was before the House of Lords, Lord Blackburn, holding that the provision of the Public Health Act required contracts of the value of over \u00a350 to be under seal, suggested that the enactment of that provision may have been induced by the differences of opinion that existed on the matter of the liability of corporations on executed contracts not under seal. He reviewed the principal cases in which the divergent views were shown, the stricter views being held in the Exchequer and the more liberal in the Queen\u2019s Bench, down to 1866, when the Queen\u2019s Bench decided the case of Nicholson v. Bradfield Union ([125]) on the doctrine acted on in Clarke v. Cuckfield Union ([126]). There was not, he said, any decision in the question between 1866 and the passage of the Public Health Act of 1875, and he expressed his idea that the legislature, knowing of the difference of opinion that existed, and the difficult questions that might yet have to be decided, really intended to provide that those difficulties should not arise with respect to the urban authorities they were creating. Now, without presuming to criticise this theory by suggesting that the measure was not a new one, but was the re-enactment of a law made seven and twenty years before, we may take from Lord Blackburn\u2019s statement these two conclusions : There is no rule settled by English decisions opposed to that on which the case of Pim v. Ontario ([127]) was decided, but while there has been a conflict of opinion, as not overlooked in that case, the latest decision, pronounced several years after Pim\u2019s case, agrees with the judgment of the Upper Canada Court ; and secondly, the corporations, acting as urban authorities under the Public Health Act, are not left to the operation of the common law rules affecting the corporations as expounded and applied by the courts, but are under a rule concerning their contracts which, being statutory, does not permit the modifications and adaptation to changing circumstances which the ancient rule of corporations allows. Lord Bramwell gave judgment also. He said :\nAs I think the case turns on the construction of the statute, I have not thought it necessary to go into the doubtful and conflicting cases governed by the common law.\nLord Blackburn had expressly intimated that the case at bar did not give an opportunity for reviewing those cases, and he only examined them so far as he thought was required for the purposes of construing the Public Health Act, 1875.\nIt seems manifest to me that these cases of Hunt and Young leave the general question of the contracts of corporations, either at common law or under the municipal system, just where they found it, and I am at a loss to understand how they were supposed to affect the question. If there were serious doubt of that it would be worth while to notice that the action which the Public Health Acts required to be done with the formalities of signature and seal was the action of the corporation itself, not something to be done by a body delegated, like the council under the Manitoba statute, to exercise the powers of the corporation. The position is almost the converse of that noticed by Lord Justice Cotton, as existing under the Public Health Act, for here the council accepts on behalf of the corporation, and the corporation enjoys the benefit of the work. It is not necessary, however, to pursue this topic. The decisions since Young v. Leamington ([128]), do not throw much new light, upon the subject, but as far as they have come under my notice they appear to confirm the views of that case and of Hunt\u2019s case which I have taken. In The Attorney-General v. Gaskill ([129]), which was decided while Young\u2019s case was on its way to the House of Lords, Bacon Y. C. held an agreement made by a local board, without being sealed, valid, section 174 of the Public Health Act, 1875, notwithstanding, because it was not an agreement \u201c necessary for carrying the act into execution,\u201d which is the class of contracts authorized by the section and required to be under seal. The agreement related to the compromise of an action, and the Vice-Chancellor applied to it the ordinary rule applicable, according to many cases, to ordinary corporations.\nIn December, 1884, the case of Scott v. Clifton, School Board (3) was decided by Mathew J. The action was by an architect to recover payment for plans prepared for the school board which is a corporate body. There was no contract under seal. Mathew J. said :\nIf it were necessary for my decision I should hesitate to regard the cases relied on for the defendants [which were the same cases now relied on for the defendants] where contracts by corporate bodies were held to require to be under the common seal, to be a safe guide in the present case (or indeed in any other case) where the contract was for a purpose incidental to the performance of the duties of the corporate body, and its necessity was shown by proof that the corporation, with full knowledge of its terms and of all the facts, had acted upon and taken the benefit of the performance.\nThe case was decided, however, on the ground that the contract in question was one which, under the learned judge\u2019s construction of a provision of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, was well made by a minute of the board, a distinction which is not without resemblance to that which I have just hinted at between contracts made by a corporation and those made by another body which has power to bind the corporation.\nIn Melliss v. The Shirley and Freemantle Local Board of Health ([130]), Mr. Justice Cave decided, in April, 1885, that when a contract with a local board had been made without a seal and partly performed, the seal being then attached and the contract work afterwards completed, the contract was binding, under section 174, for the whole work. Under the strictest apprehension of the rules touching corporations the question could not have been raised. Mr. Justice Cave held the plaintiff entitled to recover notwithstanding that he came under section 193, which imposed a penalty on persons contracting with an urban authority with respect to a matter in which they were interested. The Court of Appeal held that section 193 made the contract void, and reversed the decision on that ground, saying nothing about the point taken under section 174 ([131]).\nIn Phelps v. Upton Snodsbury Highway Board (3), Mr. Justice Lopes in 1885, holding that a highway board which was a corporate body was not bound to pay a solicitor for opposing a bill in parliament because he was appointed by resolution only and not by deed, put his decision on the ground that the purpose for which the retainer was given was not incidental to the purpose for which the highway board was incorporated.\nThe greater strictness applied to the restrictions of section 174 than to the ordinary doctrines respecting corporations was exemplified in 1889 in the case of Tunbridge Wells Improvement Commissioners v. Southborough Local Board (4), before Mr. Justice Kay, where a petition under the seals of both the plaintiff and defendant corporations set out an agreement between them respecting which they presented the petition to the Local Government Board. The agreement was not under the seal of the defendant corporation, wherefore it was held, nothwithstanding the petition, not to bind the board under section 174.\nBurial boards, appointed under 15 & 16 Vic. ch. 85, are incorporated by the statute and authorized to make certain contracts which are directed to be made in a certain way. The plaintiff in Stevens v. Hounslow Burial Board ([132]) contracted in proper form to do repairs to chapels of the defendants for \u00a338, and did extra work under verbal orders for which he sought to recover \u00a313 more.\nFry L.J. and Mathew J., sitting as a divisional court, differed as to his right, the former holding that the statute was against it, and the latter thinking that the board was liable because the extras were each of trivial importance, and the board could not be expected to affix their seal to every order for small matters as they were required.\nThese are all the English cases of later date than Young v. Leamington ([133]) which I have happened to see. They certainly indicate no apprehension of the law being what is asserted by the defendants.\nIn my opinion the rule settled and acted on in Upper Canada thirty-five years ago in Pim\u2019s case, and adhered to in that province and the province of Ontario, as shown by numerous decisions which it would be alike tedious and unprofitable to notice in detail, is still the law of Ontario, and should be held to be also the law of Manitoba under the municipal system of that province which takes that of Ontario for its model, though differing from it in occasional matters of detail. I think the judgment of Mr. Justice Dubuc in the court below gives sound and conclusive reasons for maintaining that under the circumstances of this case the corporation is liable to the plaintiff.\nIt would, in my judgment, be a matter seriously to be deplored in the interests of the people of both provinces if the more rigid black letter rule contended for were held to be the law. I see no reason why the rule established so long ago in Upper Canada should not be maintained as the law of that province, and as also the rule of interpretation to be acted on in Manitoba, even if, upon a review of the matter, the English courts should adopt the views which Lord Esher seemed inclined to take of the result of the previous decisions. The rule which enjoins caution in disturbing principles that have been long settled and acted on ought to apply.\nIt has been declared in England by the highest authority that there is there a conflict of opinion which requires to be set at rest by a court of appeal. The Ontario rule was settled by the decision of an appellate court thirty-five years ago. Since that time the municipal law has been re-enacted a number of times in that province, and as far as the constitution and functions of municipal corporations and municipal councils are concerned, the same law has been made the law of Manitoba.\nUnder these circumstances it would be, in my judgment, our duty to affirm, or refuse to disturb, the rule so settled, even if upon an independent examination of the question we should not ourselves necessarily arrive at the same conclusion.\nIt is reasonable to assume that if the legislatures of the province of Manitoba and the province of Ontario, which cannot be accused of reluctance to introduce into the municipal law any change that was deemed desirable, had not treated the rule as being finally settled by the decision of the Court of Error and Appeal they would when re-enacting the law have acted on the suggestions thrown out by Chancellor Blake in Pim\u2019s case, and before that by Sir William Richards in Marshall v. School Trustees of Killey ([134]), and have removed all question by some express enactment. The decision in Pim\u2019s case may thus fairly be regarded as indirectly sanctioned by the legislature, and confirmed as the law of the province of Ontario with regard to its municipal corporations ; and it may properly be held that the legislature of Manitoba adopted the rule in question as part of the municipal system in which it followed the older province.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs, and judgment given for the plaintiff for $600, with interest on $200 from the fourth day of July, 1885, and on $400 from the fourth day of July, 1886, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Edward, Fisher & Wilson.\nSolicitors for respondents: J.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nGrown lands\u2014License to cut timber\u2014Free grants\u2014Patent\u2014Interference with rights of patentee.\nBy sec. 3 of R.S.O. (1887) ch. 25\u2014the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may appropriate any public lands * * * * as free grants to actual settlers, &c., and by sec. 4 such grants or appropriations shall be confined to lands * * * within the tract or territory defined in that section. By sec. 10 pine trees on land located or sold within the limits of the free grant territory after 5th March, 1880, shall be considered as reserved from the location, and shall be the property of Her Majesty, and sec. 11 enacts that patents of such lands located or sold shall contain a reservation of all pine trees on the land and that any licensee to cut timber thereon may, during the continuance of his license, enter upon the uncleared portion and cut and remove trees, &c.\nThe L. Co. held a license, issued 30th May, 1888, to cut timber on land within the free grant territory but which had not been appropriated under sec. 3 of the above act. A license was first issued to the company in 1873 and had been renewed each year since that time. The license authorized the cutting of timber on lands unlocated and sold at its date; lands sold or located while it was in force; pine trees on lots sold under orders in council of 27th May, 1869; and pine trees, when reserved, on lots sold under O. in C. of 3rd April, 1880, upon the location described on back of license.\nRegulations made by O. in C. of 27th May, 1869, provide that \u201call pine trees on any public land thereafter to be sold, which at the time of such sale or previously was included in any timber license, shall be considered as reserved from such sale and shall be subject to any timber license covering or including such land in force at the time of such sale, or granted within three years from the date of such sale, &c. All trees remaining on the land at the time the patent issues shall pass to the patentee. A patent for a lot in the free grant territory was issued to S. on 13th March, 1884.\nOn the back of the license was a schedule of lots included in the location with the date of sale or location, and the sale or location of S.\u2019s lot was mentioned. The company claimed the right to cut timber on said lot which had not been appropriated by the L.G. in C.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the provisions in secs. 10 and 11 of R.S.O. (1887) c. 25 relating to the pine trees in the territory, only apply to such lots as have been specifically appropriated under sec. 3; that the license of the company, though renewed from year to year, was only an annual license; that the license issued in 1888 did not give the holders a right under the regulations of 27th May, 1869, to the timber on land patented in 1884, and that the company had notice, by their license of 1888, that the lot in question had been patented to S. more than three years previously.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in this court.\nThe case was tried before MacMahon J. and a jury, when damages were assessed and judgment was reserved on certain points of law raised during the trial. Judgment was subsequently given in favour of the plaintiff which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Poussette Q.C. for the appellants cited Boynton v. Boyd[2]; Walker v. Rogers[3].\nEdwards for the respondent referred to Canada Permanent Loan Co. v. Taylor[4]; Doe d. Henderson v. Westove[5]; Cockburn v. Muskoka Lumber Co.[6]; Dunkin v. Cockburn[7]; McArthur v. Northern and Pacific. Junction Railway Co.[8]; and McLure v. Black[9].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014For the reasons given in the court of first instance, and in the Court of Appeal confirming the judgment of the trial judge, I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in this case.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants rested their contention upon the grounds:\n1st. That the land in question, lot 4 in the 15th concession of the township of Burleigh, is within what is spoken of as \u201cFree Grant Territory,\u201d in the Ontario statute of 1880, intituled \u201cAn Act to amend the Free Grants and Homesteads Act,\u201d and therefore subject to the provisions of that act and the regulations made in pursuance thereof, and that being such the license under which the appellants claim prevails over the letters patent under which the respondent claims; and 2nd. That even if the land be not within the operation of the \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act,\u201d the license issued in 1884 under which the appellants claim is the same license as that originally issued, which was about 1873, and renewed from year to year ever since, and as the lot in question is still specially named in the license of 1884 it must prevail over the letters patent, and sale made to the respondent under the act respecting the management and sale of public lands upon the authority of McMullen v. Macdonell[10] and Farquharson v. Knight[11].\nThe statute of the late province of Canada 23 Vic. ch. 2 intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the Sale and Management of the Public Lands\u201d in its 11th section, enacted that except as thereinafter provided no free grant of public land should be made. In its 13th section it enacted that:\nThe Governor in Council might appropriate any public lands as free grants to actual settlers upon or in the vicinity of any public roads opened through the said lands in any new settlements, under such regulations as shall from time to time be made by order in council. But no such free grant shall exceed one hundred acres.\nBy the 14th section the Governor in Council was empowered to set apart and appropriate such of the crown lands as he might deem expedient for wharves, piers, market places, and other purposes therein stated, and to make free grants thereof for such purposes subject to certain limitations therein expressed. And as to the sale of public lands it was enacted that the Governor in Council might from time to time fix the price per acre of the public lands and the terms and conditions of sale and settlement and payment. Then by the 16th section the Commissioner of Crown Lands was authorized to issue to purchasers, as well as to settlers on land, as a free grant, licenses of occupation, and that such license of occupation should operate to enable the holder to maintain suits against any wrong-doer or trespasser as effectually as he could under a patent from the crown, but that it should have no force against a license to cut timber existing at the time of the granting thereof. The 17th section gave to a certificate of sale, and to a receipt for money received on the sale of public lands, the same force and effect as by the previous section were given to the license of occupation.\nThe legislature of the province of Ontario in its first session passed an act, 31st Vic. ch. 8, intituled \u201cAn Act to secure Free Grants and homestead to actual settlers on the public lands,\u201d and thereby enacted that the statute of the Parliament of the late province of Canada, passed in the 23rd year of Her Majesty\u2019s reign, intituled \u201cAn act respecting the sale and management of the public lands,\u201d might be cited and designated in all acts and proceedings as \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860,\u201d and is the act thereinafter so designated; it then repealed the 13th section of the above act, and enacted that the Lieutenant Governor in Council might appropriate any public lands considered suitable for settlement and cultivation, and not being mineral or pine timber lands, as free grants to actual settlers under such regulations as should from time to time be made by order in council not inconsistent with the provisions of the act, but that such grants or appropriations should be confined to lands then already surveyed or thereafter to be surveyed within a very extensive tract of country particularly described in the fifth section of the act.\nIn the sixth section it was enacted that all persons to whom any land might be allotted or assigned under such regulations for a free grant should be considered as located for the land; and by sections seven and eight, that no person should be located for any land under the actor the said regulations unless certain conditions should be fulfilled; and by section nine, that no patent should issue for any land located under the act, or under said regula- tions, until the expiration of five years from the location, nor unless certain settlement duties should be performed. Then by section ten, all pine trees on the land, except such as might be actually necessary to be removed for the clearing of the land and for building, fencing or fuel, were reserved as the property of Her Majesty until the patent should issue, at which time all trees remaining on the land should pass to the patentee.\nNow by orders and regulations made under the above \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d and \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860,\u201d and passed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on the 27th May, 1869, it was provided among other things:\nPar. 1.\u2014That the quantity of land to be located to any person as a free grant, under \u201cthe Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d should be 100 acres.\nPar. 2.\u2014That any locatee under said act, being the male head of a family, should be allowed to purchase an additional 100 acres at 50 cents per acre cash at the time of such location, subject to the same reservations and conditions, and the performance of the same settlement duties, as are provided in respect of free grant locations by the 9th and 10th sections of said act, except that actual residence and building on the land purchased will not be required.\nPar. 5. All pine trees growing or being on any land hereafter located as a free grant under the said act or sold under the preceding regulation shall be subject to any timber license in force at the time of such location or sale or granted within five years subsequently thereto, and may at any time before the issue of the patent for such land be cut and removed under the authority of any such timber license while lawfully in force.\nUpon the same 27th May, 1869, another order in council was approved and passed whereby regulations of a wholly different nature were established in relation to the sale of lands under \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860.\u201d By this order it was provided that\nall pine trees growing or being upon any public land hereafter to be sold and which at the time of such sale or previously were included in any timber license, shall be considered as reserved from such sale and such sale shall be subject to any timber license covering such land in force at the time of such sale or granted within three years from the date of such sale, and such trees may be cut and removed from such land under the authority of any such timber license while lawfully in force, but the purchaser at such sale or those claiming under him or her may cut and use such trees as may be necessary for the purpose of building, fencing and fuel on the land so purchased, and may also cut and dispose of all trees required to be removed in actually clearing said land for cultivation; but no pine trees except for the necessary building, fencing and fuel as aforesaid shall be cut beyond the limit of such actual clearing before the issuing of the patent for such land; and all pine trees so cut and disposed of (except for the necessary building, fencing and fuel aforesaid) shall be subject to the payment of the same due as are at the time payable by the holders of licenses to cut timber or saw logs. All trees remaining on the land at the time the patent issues shall pass to the patentee.\nAnd it was, apparently ex majori cautel\u00e2, provided that\nthis order shall not apply to any land to be sold as mining land nor to land to be sold to any free grant locatee under the regulations or order in council bearing date this day.\nFrom the above orders and regulations it appears that while lands sold to a free grant settler under the above regulations in that behalf are made subject to any timber license in force at the time of such sale or granted within five years subsequently thereto, lands sold under the Public Lands Act of 1860 are made subject only to such licenses as may be in force covering such land at the time of such sale or granted within three years from the date of such sale, and that the provision in the 10th section of \u201cThe free grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d that all trees remaining on the land at the time the patent to a free grant locatee issues shall pass to the patentee, is by the order and regulation made in relation to land sold under \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860\u201d made part of the contract of sale entered into with the purchaser to the benefit of which he is entitled.\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council, prior to the month of February, 1871, appears to have exercised the authority vested in him by the 4th and 5th sections of \u201cThe Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d by appropriating certain of the townships comprised in the tract of country described in the 5th section of the act as townships in which free grants might be made to actual settlers, but the date or terms of the order in council making such appropriation do not appear for the order has not been produced; but on the 13th February, 1871, an act was passed intituled \u201cAn Act to encourage settlement in the Free Grant Territory,\u201d whereby after reciting that\nit is expedient to ascertain how far immigration would be encouraged, and the welfare of settlers promoted by the partial clearance of lands forming part of the public lands appropriated for free grants * * * *\nauthority was given to set apart $20,000 from the consolidated fund for the purpose.\nIt appears further that prior to the appropriation of such townships for free grants by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, under the said \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d contracts of sale for the sale of some lots in some of these townships to settlers had been made under \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860,\u201d and the above regulations made thereunder, which sales the Government seems to have desired to convert into free grants, for on the 2nd of March, 1872, the statute 35 Vic. ch. 21, intituled \u201cAn Act to provide for the remission of sums due by settlers in certain Free Grant Townships,\u201d was passed whereby it was enacted that:\nThe Lieutenant-Governor in Council may remit the sums due to the crown in respect of their lands by bon\u00e2 fide settlers still in occupation of their lands in all free grant townships save and except (four townships named) and place such settlers in the same position as those who settled in the free grant townships under the free grant regulations.\nThen again, on the 24th March, 1874, an act 37 Vic. ch. 23 was passed, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting sales of pine trees by certain settlers\u201d in the free grant townships in the districts of Muskoka and Parry Sound whereby an order in council of the 4th of October, 1871, was affirmed and declared to be good and valid in law. Then on the 2nd March, 1877, the act 40 Vic. ch. 15, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d was passed, whereby after reciting that\ndoubts have arisen as to the right of the Commissioner of Crown Lands to issue licenses to cut timber over and upon lots located or sold to free grant settlers under the \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d and that it was expedient to remove such doubts,\nit was enacted that\nnothing in the said act or in the act passed in the 37th year of Her Majesty\u2019s reign, chaptered 23, or in any other act passed by the legislature of this province or within its legislative authority contained, shall be held to have in any way restricted the authority of the Commissioner of Crown Lands to grant licenses to cut timber on lots located or sold under the said Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868, and on the contrary it is hereby declared that the said commissioner ever since the passing of the said act had and now has under chapter 23 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the sale and management of Timber on public lands,\u201d full authority to grant licenses to cut timber on lots located or sold under the said Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868.\nIf this act had stopped here, although it may be difficult to conceive what doubt could have existed as to the right of the Commissioner of Crown Lands to grant licenses to cut timber on lands in the free grant townships equally as on crown lands in other townships under the regulations to be issued from time to time by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, still, if any such doubts did exist, this first section of the act now in recital was sufficient to remove them; but the act, while in its form a mere declaratory act passed for the purpose of removing the doubts said to exist proceeds to repeal, not in terms but in substance and effect, the very plain provision of the 10th section of \u201cThe Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d which enacted that \u201call trees remaining on the land at the time the patent issues shall pass to the patentee,\u201d for the 2nd section declares that\nevery such license heretofore issued, whether the same has expired or is still current, and every such license which may be hereafter issued, to cut timber within the limits of any territory appropriated as free grant territory under the said \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d shall be deemed to have been and to be good and valid in all respects whatever for the period for which the same was or may be granted, notwithstanding the patents for lands included may in the meantime have been issued; and every such license shall be taken to have conferred and to confer upon the holder thereof the right to cut timber on the lands included therein until its expiration, whether such lands were or are located or sold under the said act, or were or are unlocated or unsold, subject, however, to such conditions, regulations and restrictions specially applicable to the free grant territory, or to the said lots so sold or located, as may have been heretofore or may be hereafter made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in respect to the payment of timber dues or otherwise, and subject also to such exceptions or restrictions as may be contained in any such license. Provided that no license shall confer the right to cut any other than pine timber upon lands which have been located or sold in the said territory prior to the date of such license unless the location or sale shall have been cancelled.\nThis mode of repealing the plain language of a prior statute as to the construction of which no doubt is alleged to have been entertained was corrected, however, by the Ontario statute, 43 Vic. ch. 4, whereby secs. 7 and 10 of the said \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d were expressly repealed and other provisions substituted therefor. The clause substituted for the repealed 10th section of the act of 1868 enacts that\nall pine trees growing upon any land located or sold within the limits of the free grant territory after the passing of this act shall be considered as reserved from said location, and shall be the property of Her Majesty [subject to certain specific exceptions stated.]\nAnd that\nthe patents for all lands hereafter located or sold as aforesaid shall contain a reservation of all pine trees standing or being on said lands, which pine trees shall continue to be the property of Her Majesty, and any person or persons now or hereafter holding a license to cut timber or saw logs may at all times during the continuance of such license enter upon the uncleared portion of any such lands and cut and remove such trees and make all necessary roads for that purpose and for the purpose of hauling in supplies, doing no unnecessary damage thereby; but the patentees or those claiming under them may cut and use such trees as may be necessary for the purpose of building and fencing on the lands so patented, and may also cut and dispose of all trees required to be removed in actually clearing the said land for cultivation, but no pine trees (except for the said necessary building and fencing as aforesaid) shall be cut beyond the limit of such actual clearing; and all pine trees so cut and disposed of shall be subject to the payment of the same dues as are at the time payable by the holders of licenses to cut timber or saw logs.\nAnd further that\nthe patentee, his heirs or assigns, of land hereafter located or sold under the Free Grants and Homesteads Act and this act shall be entitled to be paid out of the consolidated revenue of the province on all pine trees cut on such land subsequent to the 3rd day of April next after the date of the patent and upon which dues have been collected by the crown, the sum of twenty-five cents on each thousand cubic feet of square or waney pine timber; and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is to make regulations for ascertaining and determining the persons from time to time to receive such payments and the sums to be paid.\nNow, it is to be observed that all of the above acts passed since the passing of \u201cThe Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d were passed wholly in relation to the lands by that act authorized to be appropriated by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council for free grants to be made to actual settlers, and for the purpose of giving effect to that act or by way of amendment thereof; so that it might be well doubted whether any of them would have any application to the case of a lot of land sold even in a free grant township, if such a sale should be made and a patent be issued therefor under the provisions of \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860,\u201d and the regulations established by order in council under that act. With that question, however, we are not now concerned. For the purposes of the present case it is sufficient to say that the above acts leave no doubt as to the construction to be put upon the term \u201cfree grant territory\u201d as used in 43 Vic. ch. 4 now consolidated in ch. 25 of the revised statutes of Ontario, namely, that it is the same construction as must be put upon the words in 40 Vic. ch. 15: \u201cAny territory appropriated as free grant territory under the said Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868\u201d and upon the words in 37 Vic. ch. 23, \u201cfree grant lands in townships open for sale and location under the \u201cFree Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d and on the words in 35 Vic. ch. 21 \u201cfree grant townships,\u201d and upon the words in 34 Vic. ch. 5, \u201clands forming part of the public lands appropriated for free grants to settlers under the term of the Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d and that construction must be, lands in those townships which by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council have been appropriated for free grants to be made therein to actual settlers.\nThe above several acts having been consolidated in ch. 25 of the Revised Statutes which is intituled \u201cAn Act respecting Free Grants and Homesteads to actual settlers on public lands,\u201d their provisions must receive in the consolidated act the same construction as they must have received in the original acts as they stood before consolidation. By a book produced from the Crown Lands Department it appeared that 133 townships within the limits prescribed by the act of 1868 have been by order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council appropriated as free grant townships for free grants to be made therein, and that Burleigh, which has been a township of the county of Peterborough at least as far back as 1851, is not one. There can, therefore, be no doubt, in my opinion, that neither the above act 43 Vic. ch. 4 nor the revised statute ch. 25 has any application whatever to the lot of land in question in this suit, which must be regarded in point of law, as it in point of fact was, as sold and patented under the provisions of \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860\u201d now consolidated as ch. 24 of the Revised Statutes under the title \u201cAn Act respecting the sale and management of Public Lands.\u201d\nNow the lot was sold to the respondent on the 13th of March, 1884, and by the regulations, under which the sale took place as above extracted, we have seen that the land was subject only to such timber license as was then in force, or as should be granted within three years from the date of the sale; and by these regulations, which constituted the terms of the sale, it was declared that all trees remaining on the land at the time the patent issues should pass to the patentee. It is admitted that all settlement duties were performed by the purchaser, and that his last instalment of purchase money was all paid up in full on the 18th of April, 1888. We must assume then, and it is not disputed, that the respondent became then entitled to receive his patent, and this being so it is contended by the respondent that it was not competent for the Commissioner of Crown Lands to grant a license to cut any timber upon the lot after the 18th of April, 1888. But in my opinion the Commissioner of Crown Lands has not done so or affected to do so unless it be under the words in the license \u201cand pine trees on lands or lots sold under orders in council of the 27th May, 1869.\u201d It is true that he issued the license under which the appellants claim upon the 3rd of May, 1888, but the true construction of the license, in my opinion, is that it covers and professes to cover only such of the lots comprised in the location described on the back of the license as were unlocated and unsold at the date of the issue of the license on the 3rd May, 1888. Now in the location endorsed on the license the lot in question is mentioned as it had been in licenses issued ever since 1873, yet by an express notice, also endorsed on the license, the licensee was informed that this particular lot had been sold on the 13th March, 1884, and so was not included in the lots over which the license operated. The chief object of the regulations under which the public lands are sold to purchasers is to prescribe the extent to which the lands sold shall be subjected to licenses to cut timber thereon. I have no doubt, therefore, that when a lot was unsold when a license to cut timber thereon issued, but was sold while such license was in force, the licensee would be bound to ascertain and to conform himself to the terms of such regulations as among those which, by the express terms of the act respecting timber on public lands, now ch. 26 of the revised statutes of Ontario, the license is subjected to. But in the present case, as the lot had not been only sold, but the right of the purchaser to receive his patent therefor had accrued before the license issued, the license construed as above, and as I think it must be construed, in express terms excludes the lot in question from the operation of the license, which conferred upon the licensee the right to cut timber only upon such of the lands enumerated on the back as had not been sold before the issue of the license, and the notice endorsed gave express information to the licensee that the lot in question had been sold on the 13th of March, 1884.\nIt is said, however, that the license expressly authorizes the licensee to cut \u201cpine trees on lands sold under order in council of the 27th May, 1869.\u201d From the context in connection with which these words are used they certainly seem to be used as applying to the regulations of that date under \u201cThe Public Lands Act of 1860,\u201d and not those of the same date made under \u201cThe Free Grants and Homesteads Act of 1868,\u201d but in virtue of what authority these words were inserted in the license did not appear. However, assuming them to have been intended to apply to lands sold under the Public Lands Act of 1860, now ch. 26 of the revised statutes of Ontario, the licensee must be regarded as having thereby express notice of those regulations and must be bound by them, and by reference to them it appears that no timber is reserved to the crown otherwise than as is stated in those regulations, and that by the express terms thereof all trees remaining on the land at the time the patent issues shall pass to the patentee; and as all the timber in question was cut long after the issue of the patent it is unnecessary to enquire whether there was any right over the timber reserved to the crown which the Commissioner of Crown Lands could grant over the lot in the interval between the final payment of the balance of purchase money on the 18th April, 1888, and the issuing of the patent. As to the point that the license which issued on the 3rd May, 1888, was the same license as that issued in all the years subsequent to and in the year 1873 when the first appears to have been granted and before the lot in question was sold, and that, therefore, the license of 1888 covered the lot in question equally as did that issued in 1883, and in prior years, it does not seem to me to be necessary to make any observations further than that it cannot be entertained.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the court below in the judgments of Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Poussette & Johnston.\nSolicitor for respondent: E.B.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nContract\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Matters for future arrangement\u2014Sale of land or of equity of redemption.\nL. signed a document by which he agreed to sell certain property to W. for $42,500, and W. signed an agreement to purchase the same. The document signed by W. stated that the property was to be purchased \"subject to the encumbrances thereon.\" With this exception the papers were, in substance, the same, and each contained at the end this clause \"terms and deeds, &c., to be arranged by the 1st of May next.\"\nOn the day that these papers were signed L., on request of W.'s solicitor to have the terms of sale put in writing, added to the one signed by him the following: \"Terms, $500 cash this day, $500 on delivery of the deed of the Parker property, $800 with interest every three months until the six thousand five hundred dollars are paid, when the deed of the entire property will be executed.\"\nThe property mentioned in these documents was, with other property of L., mortgaged for $36,000. W. paid two sums of $500 and demanded a deed of the Parker property which was refused. In an action against L. for specific performance of the above agreement the defendant set up a verbal agreement that before a deed was given the other property of L. was to be released from the mortgage and also pleaded the statute of frauds.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Patterson J. doubting, that there was no completed agreement in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds.\nPer Ritchie C.J.\u2014The agreement only provides for payment of $6,500 leaving the greater part of the purchase money unprovided for. If W. was to assume the mortgage it was necessary to provide for the release of L.'s other property and for matters in relation to the leasehold property.\nPer Strong J.\u2014The agreement was for sale of an equity of redemption only, and as questions would arise in future as to release of L.'s other property from the mortgage and his indemnity from personal liability to the mortgagee, which should have formed part of the preliminary agreement, specific performance could not be decreed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, reversing the judgment given at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts upon which the appeal was brought and decided sufficiently appear from the above head note.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice Townshend judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, the learned judge being of opinion that the documents in evidence, coupled with the surrounding facts and circumstances, established an agreement sufficient under the Statute of Frauds to bind the defendant. The court en banc reversed this decision and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendant. From the latter decision the plaintiff appealed.\nNewcombe for the appellant. The agreement in writing was complete and any subsequent dealings not reduced to writing cannot defeat the contract contained in it; Foster v. Wheeler[1]; Bolton Partners v. Lambert[2]; Gray v. Smith[3]; Bellamy v. Debenham[4]; Rossiter v. Miller[5].\nThe expression at the end of the signed documents only contemplates a more formal agreement which will not render the contract invalid; Parker v. Taswell[6].\nThe alleged parol agreement was a mere negotiation. Harding v. Stair[7]; Fry on Specific Performance[8]. Plaintiff is certainly entitled to recover back the $1,000 which he paid.\nRussell Q.C. for the respondent. The parties were never ad idem, there being matter to be settled before a complete contract could be made. Stanley v. Dowdeswell[9]; Honeyman v. Marryatt[10].\nThe contract was abandoned and a new one made. Britain v. Rossiter[11]; Leroux v. Brown[12].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think there was no final arrangement and adjustment of the terms and deeds to be arranged and signed by the first of May then next, as provided by the memorandum of the 9th of April, 1889, and therefore the defendant was justified in refusing to give a deed of the Parker property until such terms were arranged, or at any rate until plaintiff had arranged to release and discharge defendant and his property at the north end, mentioned in the mortgage for $36,000, from such mortgage.\nMr. Justice Ritchie says, and I agree with him, that it is quite evident from the testimony of Mr. Barnhill that the terms which the defendant added to the agreement at his request were only those which had previously been agreed to, and not those which were to be arranged between the parties before the first of May. No other terms were ever afterwards agreed to between plaintiff and defendant; an attempt was made to do so which failed.\nAnd I also agree with him that taking into consideration the position of affairs a good many additional terms required to be arranged so as to make a conclusive agreement.\nThere is no reference made in either agreement to the mortgage, and according to the terms of that signed by plaintiff he was to pay $42,500 for the land subject to the encumbrances thereon; no provision is made for the payment of the larger portion of the purchase money, and if the mortgage is to be assumed by the plaintiff and taken as part of the purchase money there is no arrangement for obtaining the consent of the mortgagees, or as to the release or other disposal of the north end property. The agreements import the purchase of the fee simple, but the transfer of the leasehold portion is not provided for nor is any provision made in relation to the existing lease and the payment of the rent by the tenants of the defendant, which would have to be settled in some way before the purchase was concluded.\nSTRONG J.\u2014There would, in my opinion, be no difficulty in holding that the two documents dated the 9th of April, 1889, one signed by the plaintiff and the other by the defendant, when read and construed in the light of the surrounding facts, contained all the essential requisites of a completed contract of sale sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, were it not for the reference to the further arrangement of terms contained in each of them.\nWhen land in mortgage is sold it is, of course, competent to the parties to agree to the sale either of the land itself or of the equity of redemption subject to the encumbrance. It appears that this property was, together with other property belonging to the defendant, subject to a mortgage of $36,000. According to the strict construction of the article signed by the defendant, read without the addition prefaced by the word \"terms\" subsequently added to it, it would appear that what was intended to be sold was the land for the gross sum of $42,500. The added memorandum, however, shows sufficiently that it was the equity of redemption subject to the mortgage which was to be sold. This also sufficiently appears from the document signed by the plaintiff where the purchase by him is expressed to be for the price of $42,000 subject to encumbrances. Literally construed this would mean $42,000 over and above the encumbrances, but read in conjunction with the paper signed by the defendant I think it sufficiently appears that what was meant was that the whole price was to be $42,500, and that it was to be subject to the encumbrances the amount of which was to be deducted out of the price.\nIt is important to distinguish between a sale of the land itself, though in fact subject to encumbrances, and a sale of the equity of redemption the purchaser assuming the encumbrances, inasmuch as the rights of the parties in carrying out the sale are not the same.\nIf the land itself was sold then, a good title having been shown, or the purchaser having accepted the title, the vendor is bound to procure the concurrence of the mortgagee in the conveyance, he being paid off in the first instance by the vendor or by an appropriation of a sufficient part of the purchase money. The encumbrance in such a case does not constitute an objection to the title but is said to be a matter of conveyancing, that is to say, a matter respecting the completion of the sale by a conveyance. This is the general law and practice which regulates the carrying out of executory contracts of sale, and is always strictly adhered to in English practice and also (in Ontario) in carrying out sales under a decree of the Court of Chancery, though in the case of private contracts the distinction between matters of title and matters of conveyancing is not so strictly observed. This assumes that the vendor is entitled to compel the mortgagor to take his money, that is, the mortgage must be overdue; if this is not so the mortgage constitutes an objection to the title and is not a mere matter of conveyancing.\nIn the case of a sale of an equity of redemption, in other words a sale of land in mortgage upon the terms that the purchaser is to take a conveyance of the mere equity of redemption paying the vendor the specified price for that, a court of equity assumes (unless there is some agreement to the contrary) that the purchaser is to indemnify the vendor against the mortgage if there is any personal liability on his part in respect of it.\nAs I have said I am of opinion that this was a sale of the equity of redemption subject to the mortgage and therefore the plaintiff would be bound to indemnify the defendant against it. It turns out, however, that this mortgage comprises other lands belonging to the defendant which the plaintiff has not purchased. Now upon the plaintiff paying off the mortgage he would be entitled to an assignment of the mortgage. Supposing this to have been done, what are to be his rights regarding these other lands? Is he to be entitled to turn round and call upon the defendant to redeem the other lands by paying him the full amount of the mortgage money? This, of course, it is out of the question to suppose was ever intended by either party. Or was he to be entitled to insist upon having an apportionment of the mortgage money and a ratable proportion of it according to value charged upon the defendant's other lands which the plaintiff would have to redeem in order to get his own property acquired under this contract of purchase exonerated from the mortgage, or would the defendant be entitled to insist on a reconveyance of his other lands without in any way contributing to the payment of the mortgage money, thus making it compulsory upon the plaintiff, when redeeming the property which is the subject of the purchase, to redeem the defendant's other lands also, and precluding the plaintiff from making any terms with the mortgagee for partial redemption? I do not say what the rights of the parties would be as regards any of these questions. Perhaps there may be little foundation for any apprehension regarding them, or perhaps the law is clear one way or the other. I only refer to them to show that there were, on the proper construction of the contract as a purchase of the equity of redemption, future questions sure to arise which it was reasonable and proper should be determined by some fixed and settled arrangement in the preliminary contract. If the mortgage had embraced no other lands but those which were the subject of the sale no difficulty could have arisen. The well settled principles of law as administered by courts of equity between vendor and purchaser would have supplied the deficiencies of the written agreements of the parties, and I am far from saying that it would not do so notwithstanding the fact that the mortgage covers these other properties of the defendant. The materiality of what I have endeavoured to point out is with reference to the question of there being a completed and concluded agreement in view of the reference to the arrangement of further terms contained in both the articles, as well that signed by the plaintiff as that signed by the defendant. It appears to me, when we find these questions I have adverted to left outstanding and unprovided for, to be impossible to say that the added terms which were appended by the defendant to the memorandum he signed dispose of all that could be meant to be referred to by the proviso \"Terms, deeds, &c., &c., to be arranged by 1st May next,\" and this is still further strengthened by the word \"deeds\" in the plural having been used in the corresponding proviso in the article signed by the plaintiff. I am of opinion that there never was a concluded agreement between the parties. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I retain the opinion I had when this case was argued that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The first question in this case, which is raised under the Nova Scotia statute equivalent to the fourth, section of the Statute of Frauds, does not seem to me to create any great difficulty.\nThe defendant wrote with his own hand on the 9th of April, 1889, two memorandums, one of which he signed and gave to the plaintiff, and the other of which the plaintiff signed and the defendant kept. They differed in one respect, but they agreed in the essential matters of the parties to the contract, the land that was sold, and the price of it. The price was $42,000, and the difference between the two papers was that that which the plaintiff signed had the words \"subject to the encumbrances thereon,\" which were not in the other. Those words are capable of meaning that the price named was what the purchaser was to pay in addition to assuming the encumbrances, but they do not necessarily mean that, and they were not intended to have that meaning. The defendant himself swears to that. They may without difficulty be construed according to the real agreement, which was that $36,000 of the price was to be reckoned for with the holder of a mortgage on the land for that amount, and $6,500 paid to the defendant. That was made more clear, if it were necessary to show it upon the face of the papers, by the note added on the same day by the defendant to the memorandum which he had signed, viz.:\nTerms, $500 cash this day, $500 on delivery of the deed of the Parker property. $800 with interest every three months until the six thousand five hundred dollars are paid, when the deed of the entire property will be executed.\nIt is not \"until $6,500 are paid,\" but \"until the $6,500 are paid.\" This sum was the margin of purchase money coming to the defendant.\nThe sufficiency of the memorandum in relation to the statute is disputed principally because of the words \"terms, deeds, &c., &c., to be arranged by 1st May next,\" which it is argued indicate that the agreement was not complete. I think that is a mistaken idea, but it has been the occasion of a good deal of ingenious argument. On the part of the plaintiff it has been urged that when the defendant, on the day of the date of the agreement, added the note which he headed \"terms,\" doing so because asked by the defendant through his solicitor to set down the mode in which the money was to be paid, the arrangement of terms was made which was to have been made by the first of May. The defendant controverts this construction of his act and is right in so doing, as I apprehend the matter. I think he merely put in writing what was already agreed upon, and what the plaintiff understood and acted on when he sent his solicitor to the defendant with money to pay the $500 cash instalment. At all events these terms of payment, whether previously agreed upon or now for the first time settled, became part of the written agreement and no longer remained a matter that could be treated as still to be arranged. The \"terms,\" whatever that word as used in the contract was intended to denote, either never included, or ceased to include, the mode of payment or the time when the conveyances were to be completed. If we assume the added note to state what had been previously agreed upon it is plain that the words \"terms, deeds, &c., &c.,\" cannot have been intended to refer to the time when the deeds were to be executed. The first of May was only three weeks off, and the deed of the entire property was not to be executed till the $6,500 was paid, the payments being, as to $5,500 at least, at the rate of $800 every three months. When that sum of $6,500 was all paid the deed was to be executed. The expression seems carefully chosen. The arrangements concerning \"terms, deeds.&c., &c.\" were to be completed within the three weeks, but the actual execution of the deeds was to be deferred\u2014the deed of the Parker property to be delivered when the plaintiff was prepared to pay a second $500, and the other deed executed when the whole was paid.\nI understand the office of the words in question to be to fix the first of May as the limit for the completion of such matters of conveyancing as investigating titles, settling forms of deeds and other arrangements, including perhaps arrangements with tenants and with the mortgagee, matters essential to the carrying out of the contract but not being a part of the contract which the statute of frauds required to be in writing.\nThe word \"terms\" is no doubt a sufficiently comprehensive expression to include terms of payment, but if the terms of payment had been left at large, or if any other terms of like nature were left for future arrangement, the contract would nevertheless be, in my opinion, a complete contract which, being in writing, would satisfy the statute.\nAs said by Wilde C.J., in Valpy v. Gibson[13]:\nThe omission of the particular mode or time of payment, or even of the price itself, does not necessarily invalidate a contract of sale. Goods may be sold, and frequently are sold, when it is the intention of the parties to bind themselves by a contract which does not specify the price or mode of payment, leaving them to be settled by some future agreement or to be determined by what is reasonable under the circumstances.\nIn Ash croft v. Morrin[14] the offer was to buy goods \"on moderate terms.\" Tindal C.J. said:\nThe order here is to send certain quantities of porter and other malt liquors on \"moderate terms.\" Why is not that sufficient? This is the contract between the parties.\nIn my opinion this written contract satisfies the statute.\nIt appears that difficulties arose between the parties owing, as I gather, to the discovery that the $36,000 mortgage covered other land of the defendant besides that which the plaintiff was buying, and it was attempted to avoid trouble by making a new agreement by which the plaintiff was to pay $500 less for the land and was to provide for the mortgage debt so as to set free the defendant's land. That new agreement, which was not reduced to waiting, was pleaded and was relied on at the trial as having superseded the written contract, but it was shown to have been tentative only and not absolute, depending on contingencies one of which was the ability of the plaintiff to raise the necessary amount of money. There was conflicting evidence as to its having been expressly negotiated without prejudice to the former agreement, but it strikes me as of very little moment whether that was expressed or not. If an absolute agreement was made it would of course supersede the other. They could not both stand, and it would be idle to talk of its being without prejudice. On the other hand the negotiations could not prejudice the existing contract as long as they fell short of a binding agreement. I believe there was no difference of opinion on this point in the court below\u2014though upon the question of the original contract opinions were equally divided, Mr. Justice Townshend at the trial and the Chief Justice in banc taking one view, and two judges, forming a majority of the court in banc, differing from them.\nThe inclination of my opinion is to restore the judgment pronounced by Mr. Justice Townshend and to allow the appeal, but I do not feel strong enough in that view to formally dissent from the conclusion arrived at by the other members of the court, particularly having regard to the fact that the plaintiff seeks specific performance, his right to which is complicated by the misunderstanding respecting the property covered by the $36,000 mortgage.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nContract\u2014Engineer's certificate\u2014Finality of\u2014Bulk sum contract\u2014Deductions\u2014Engineer's powers of\u2014Interest.\nIn a bulk sum contract for various works and materials, executed, performed and furnished on the Quebec Harbour Works, the contractors were allowed by the final certificate of the engineers a balance of $52,011. The contract contained the ordinary powers given in such contracts to the engineers to determine all points in dispute by their final certificate. The work was completed and accepted by the commissioners on the 11th October, 1882, but the certificate was only granted on the 4th February, 1886. In an action brought by the contractors (appellants) for $182,241 for alleged balance of contract price and extra work.\nHeld, 1st, that the certificate of the engineers was binding on the parties and could not be set aside as regards any matter coming within the jurisdiction of the engineers, but that the engineers had no right to deduct any sum from the bulk sum contract price on account of an alleged error in the calculation of the quantities of dredging to be done stated in the specifications and the quantities actually done, and therefore the certificate in this case should be corrected in that respect.\n2 That interest could not be computed from an earlier date than from the date of the final certificate fixing the amount due to the contractors under the contract, viz., 4th February, 1886. Fournier J. dissenting.\nStrong and Gwynne J J. were of opinion that the certificate could have been reformed as regards an item for removal of sand erroneously paid for to other contractors by the commissioners and charged to the plaintiffs.\nAPPEAL AND CROSS APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada ([2]).\nIn 1876 the Quebec Harbour Commissioners, having resolved on the construction of extensive works on their property, lands and foreshore, between the Ballast Wharf at the City of Quebec and the Gras Works at the mouth of the River St. Charles, caused specifications and bills of quantities of the proposed undertaking be prepared by their engineers, Messrs. Kinipple & Morris, of Greenock, and advertised for tenders on the part of contractors for their execution.\nOn the original proposition the contract works were to he briefly these:\u2014The construction, the completion and maintenance of a wall and embankment, forming the North Quay of a proposed South Tidal Harbour inclusive of an 80 foot entrance and bridge over the same; a wall and an embankment, forming the North Quay of the proposed South West Dock; the dredging out and the formation of a channel way parallel to both walls; cribwork at the end of the embankment next the Gras Works; cribwork and retaining wall adjoining the Ballast Wharf, and other works; and the offer of the party tendering \" was to be in a lump sum, based upon the prices filled in against the various items of work in the bills of quantities. \"\nThe appellants' offer was accepted and the contract awarded to them. On the 2nd May, 1877 the formal agreement was executed and soon after the undertaking was begun. From time to time great changes were made in the nature of the works additions and modifications being largely made, and additional dredging was called for. In December, 1881, the contract was completed and the works handed over to the commissioners who, on the 22nd of that month by letter asked for a final detailed statement showing the balance due the contractors, which was duly furnished. These accounts were submitted to the engineers, who in the judgment of the contractors were disqualified from personal interest from giving a fair decision, and objection was therefore taken to their acting, the contractors asserting that they would not be bound by the decision. Ultimately it was agreed that the respective claims of the parties should be referred to the Dominion Arbitrators this course being sanctioned by an Order in Council of the Executive Government of Canada. The arbitrators heard the matter and awarded the contractors $118 333.34 a sum considerably less than their demand but in excess of the sum stated to be due by the engineers. This award was made in October, 1882. After keeping the parties in suspense for many months the commissioners repudiated the award on the ground that there was no submission, and that the reference did not fall under the statutory powers of the arbitrators. Negotiations for settlement went on for some time without success. Ultimately, after obtaining with some difficulty the consent of the commissioners, a final certificate showing a balance due of $52,011 was issued by the engineers on the 4th February, 1886, four years and two months after the contract was ended and the works handed over but the contractors did not accept this balance and the present suit was brought.\nIn 1882 a new contract was entered into between the commissioners and the firm of Larkin, Connolly & Co., involving additional dredging and the construction of a cross wall and during the years 1883 and 1884 these latter excavated and deposited on the embankment large quantities of material.\nThe alleged final certificate, together with the detailed statement upon which it is based were filed in the case. The former reads thus :\n\" FINAL CERTIFICATE.\n\"We hereby certify that Messrs. Peters, Moore & \" Wright are entitled to a final payment under their \" contract of the sum of Fifty-two thousand and \" Eleven dollars ($52,011).\n\"KINIPPLE & MORRIS.\"\nBy their action the contractors objected to this certificate on five. grounds. They objected to two deductions, which they asserted were improperly made by the engineers\u2014the first of $34,720 for \" Clerical error and dredging under Tidal cribs;\" and the second of $13326 \" for removal of sand left on Louise Embankment.\" And they claimed that in three particulars, sums that were fairly and honestly due to them were omitted by the engineers.\nThe commissioners met this demand by various pleas.\n1. On the 20th October, 1886, they filed a confession of judgment for $52,011 with interest from the 4th February, 1886 (the sum awarded by the certificate), and costs of suit and consented that judgment be entered up against them pursuant to such confession.\n2. By temporary exception they alleged that the engineers should have been made parties to the suit.\n3. By demurrer that fraud and collusion were insufficiently set out.\n4. By perpetual exception alleging:\u2014\u2014\nThat by the contract between the parties it was agreed that in the event of any difference of opinion between the engineers and the plaintiffs the decision of the engineers upon such dispute should be final.\nThe 48th clause of the contract provided that alterations deductions and modifications of the works might be made by the engineers without rendering void the contract; that the value of such additions deductions, modifications and omissions, should be determined by the engineers according to the schedule of prices specified in the contract; that if any work or material was ordered to which the schedule prices did not apply, the engineers should price out the additions or omissions and their decision as to such price should be binding;\nThe 55th 56th and 57th clauses of the contract provided that on the termination of the contract all the accounts relating thereto between the plaintiffs and the defendants must be submitted to and adjusted and settled by the engineers who thereupon should issue their certificate fixing the balance due to the contractors which certificate should be conclusive and binding on both parties without any appeal l that the contractors should not be entitled to demand and the commissioners should not be bound to pay any sum for work completed extras or any other cause until a certificate had been granted that such sum is due;\nBy the 67th clause all disputes connected with the contract in any way were; left to the final decision of the engineers;\nThat the works claimed for by the declaration, in so far as done at all, were done under the provisions of the contract; that all the accounts relating thereto including all the claims now put forth were submitted to the engineers and adjusted by them and they thereupon issued the final certificate attached which certificate is conclusive and final between the parties; and the defendants tender a confession of judgment for the amount thereof with interest from the date of the certificate and costs of suit up to the filing of the confession;\nThat with the exception of the amount of the final certificate the plaintiffs were fully paid for all work, &c., done by them.\n5. By a further plea they set up a penalty fixed by the contract for failure to deliver the works at the agreed time\u2014an alleged delay of 56 weeks, amounting to $6,500; and damages $5,834, due from a supposed fault in the wall; and they prayed compensation for so much of these two sums as might turn out to be due as as against the confession.\nTo these pleas the plaintiffs replied specially) that large extra works had been ordered and executed that great modifications had been made that there had been strikes during the pendency of the contract; that there had been remarkably high tides interfering with the progress of the work, and that for these reasons, under section 52 of the agreement, the penalty could not be claimed.\nUpon these issues the parties went to proof and hearing and in the result the Superior Court at Quebec overruled in part the certificate of the engineers the confession based upon it, and the special pleas of the defendants, and awarded the plaintiffs $91,809.22 with interest on $1195886.17, from the 11th October, 18.82, to the 22nd September, 1883; on $113,009, from the 22nd September,' 1883, to the 13th October, 1883; on $111,809, from the 13th October, 1883, to the 28th February, 1884; and on the sum of $91,899.72, from the 28th February 1884 till paid with costs and interest on the whole debt from the 11th October 1882.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and awarded the appellants the amount of $56,418.71 with interest from the 11th October 1882\nThe principal questions which arose on this appeal were:\u2014Have the engineers, properly or improperly, made the deductions of $34,472 and $13,326, as stated in the detailed schedule of their final certificate ? Was the quantity of the concrete placed behind the wall by the engineer's orders other and different from that stipulated; and if so, what loss did the change occasion to the contractors ? Have the engineers allowed for the whole quantity of concrete actually placed and if not what is the amount and value of the portion not allowed for ? And have the engineers pursued the contract in measuring by the ton of 2,240 lbs. ?\nFrom what date should interest be allowed the appellants on the amount to be awarded ? Can the certificates of the engineers be reformed by the court?\nOsler Q.C. and Cook Q.C. for appellants contended:\n(1.) That the deduction of $34,472 for dredging is unjustifiable; that in fact there was no substantial error; that by the express clauses of the contract, and notably by clause 48 no deduction was to be made from the contract sum, except on a corresponding deduction from the work made on the written orders of the engineers\u2014none such being made in the present instance; that no covenants in the contract empower the engineers to deal with errors in the specifications; that no reference in this respect was ever made to them by the parties, and that their action in dealing with the pretended error is wholly ultra vires; that under the circumstances their assuming to exercise powers not entrusted to them is a breach of duty amounting to fraud\n(2.) That the deduction of $13,326, now reduced by the Court of Queen's Bench to $8,918.50, for alleged levelling of sand is unjustifiable; that the proof shows that both in fact and to the knowledge of the engineers, no sand was left above grade, with the exception of a few yards at their request for concrete; that the time, manner and circumstances of this deduction establish clearly its fraudulent nature, originating with the Commissioners and adopted by the engineers in the interest of the succeeding contractors, Murphy, Connolly & Co.\n(3.) That the engineers having under their extensive powers, with a view to improve the permanent character of the works, compelled the contractors to substitute for the stipulated concrete behind the walls a concrete of a different nature, and unquestionably more expensive, in wholly refusing reasonable compensation for the change have violated both the letter and the spirit of the contract, and are guilty of a breach of duty, and that the contractors are entitled to additional remuneration at the rate of $1.50 per cubic yard.\n(4.) That having increased the thickness of the concrete backing in rear of the stone the engineers, in violation of the agreement and of the special undertaking contained in the correspondence between the contractors and the resident engineer, wrongfully re fused payment for 3,074 out .of 16,079 cubic yards, thus injuring the contractors to the extent of $14,000.\n(5.) That the engineers had violated the contract in computing the value of material to be furnished under the contract by the English ton of 2,240 lbs., in lieu of by the Canadian statutory ton of 2,000 lbs.\n(6.) That the appellants are entitled to interest on the balance due (less 10 per cent) from December, 1881 the date of the entry of the commission into possession of the works and upon the ten per cent with held, from December, 1882.\n(7.) That the proof of record establishes disqualification on the part of the engineers and fraud and collusion between them and the commissioners.\n(8.) That in these various respects the certificate-should be reformed.\nThe learned counsel\u2019 also relied on the points of argument and cases cited in the court below ([3]) and art. 283 C. C.; Pothier, Vente ([4]).\nIrvine Q.C. and G. Stuart Q.C. for respondents, contended:\n1st.\u2014The plaintiffs had not made a beginning of proof of fraud or collusion on the part either of the commissioners or the engineers.\n2nd.\u2014The plaintiffs had not shown even error in law or in fact though the court would not be justified in going into either in default of fraud.\n3rd.\u2014That one partner having; admitted in formal terms that this certificate is just and equitable and that he is satisfied therewith his declaration binds his partners.\n4th.\u2014That the plaintiff's pretensions with reference to the concrete both as to quality and quantity are so entirely without foundation as to cast a grave suspicion on the sincerity of the demand with reference to the other items.\n5th.\u2014The plaintiffs after adopting a standard for the calculation of stone and clayey material, using it throughout the works and finally sending in a statement of the money claimed in connection with this part of the contract, have no right to demand an additional sum exceeding $5,000 on the assumption that a new legal measure, which became law four days before the signing of the contract, was not used.\n6th.\u2014The plaintiffs could not complain of the rectification of a manifest error in the specification of the dredging, and at the same time adopt a rectification made in their favour of the quantity of concrete in the works.\n7th.\u2014The plaintiffs attempt to deny the error in the amount of dredging because of the non existence of the scale on the plan showing it when they know quite well that any engineer can establish the scale without difficulty.\n8th.\u2014If the final certificate be set aside the only amount which the plaintiff's can recover is the $12,-807.29.\n9th.\u2014The judgment awards interest from the year 1881, where interest under any circumstance was payable only from the date of the final certificate.\nAnd in addition to the cases cited in the court below ([5]) relied on Jones v. The Queen ([6]); McGreevy v. McCarron ([7]); McGreevy v. Boomer ([8]); Troplong Vente ([9]); Larombi\u00e8re ([10]); Guyot R\u00e9pertoire ([11]); Demolombe ([12]); Arts. 1070 1077 C. C.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J. I think the certificate of 4th February, 1886, is not binding on the contractors as to what has been called a clerical error which, in my opinion, was no error at all. The engineers acted he\u00b0 yond their duty or jurisdiction in respect to this, and in fact changed the contract which was for a lump sum, by deducting $34,472 by, as they allege, a clerical error in the amount of dredging set out in the specification which they had no right to do and which was not within the terms of the contract, the quantities specified therein being, in my opinion, final, between the parties.\nAs to the sand for the removal of which the defendants paid and now claim as a set-off, I have had very considerable doubt, but as this was a question of fact on which there was very considerable\" contradictory testimony I do not feel able to say that the conclusion arrived at was so clearly incorrect as to justify this court in reversing the conclusion arrived at by both the courts below on such a pure question of fact.\nAs to the difference claimed on the long and short tons the Dominion Revised Statute ch. 104 sec. 15 declares that 2000 lbs shall be a ton but it does not appear that the long ton was adopted. Boxes were used as standards by agreement between the parties and the determination of this question comes within the powers of the engineers. o\nI also think the item for cement or concrete was clearly by the contract to be determined by the engineers.\nThen should interest be computed from the date of the termination of the contract 11th October 1882, the time fixed by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, or, as the commissioners claim, from the 4th February, 1886? The plaintiffs claim that the work was completed and accepted on the 1st December 1881 and that they are entitled to interest from that date, but until the certificate the plaintiffs had no right of action and until the amount was established there was nothing on which interest could be computed.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal should be allowed with costs\nSTRONG J. For the reasons which I fully expressed during the long argument of this appeal I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should not be interfered with as regards the item relating to concrete, and that the judgment of the court below should also stand as to the long' and short ton, all objection to which I consider to be concluded by the certificate of the engineer.\nThen as regards the clerical error that is the error made by the engineer in calculating the number of yards of dredging as set out in the specifications, I am of opinion that this was a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the engineer under the contract to deal with. They had no power to make the allowances which they did and therefore the appeal to the extent of that amount should succeed.\nAs to the sand I think it was within the jurisdiction of the engineers and they did assume to deal with it. But it is clearly established that they never exercised their own judgment in regard to this matter and therefore, in my opinion, the proper conclusion is that the certificate is not binding as to this item.\nI believe the majority of the court are of opinion that the sand was left on the embankment by the appellants, and they were properly charged for its removal and as both courts have found this as a matter of fact it is conclusive. In my opinion the evidence strongly establishes that, as contended for by the appellants, the sand was placed on the embankment not by the appellants but by other contractors. I arrive at this conclusion not from the mere testimony of witnesses, but from all the surrounding circumstances which point to this as the true result. The amount charged for the removal of this sand should therefore, in my opinion, have been allowed and the judgment ought therefore to be rectified in this respect\nThe interest can only run from the date of the certicate under the terms of the contract and therefore the cross-appeal upon this head should prevail.\nThe result is that the appeal should be allowed as regards two items, the clerical error and the sand, and the cross-appeal allowed as to the interest. The costs should be apportioned as proposed by my brother Patterson\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Je concours dans le jugement qui va \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 en cette cause, except\u00e9 dans la partie concernant les int\u00e9r\u00e9ts. Il est en preuve que les parties \u00e9tant incapables de s'entendre sur le montant de la reclamation des appelants consentirent \u00e0 sen rapporter \u00e0 la decision des arbitres officiels du Canada. Le ministre des Travaux Publics ayant donn\u00e9 son consentement \u00e0 cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence il fut pass\u00e9 le dix-neuf ao\u00fbt 1882 un ordre en conseil \u00e0 cet effet, et plus tard, le onze octobre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la majorit\u00e9 des arbitres apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et leurs t\u00e9moins d\u00e9cida que l'intim\u00e9e devait payer aux appelants la somme de cent dix-huit mille trois cent trente-trois piastres et trente-quatre centins ($118,333,34.)\nBien que les appelants ne se soient pas pr\u00e9valus de cette sentence, parce qu'ils en trouvaient le montant insuffisant, le consentement de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9 dure ne pent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 autrement que comme un abandon formel de sa part du droit stipul\u00e9 dans le contrat du 2 mai 1877, de ne payer la balance du prix du contrat, qu'apr\u00e8s la production du certificat final des ing\u00e9nieurs, constatant la complete execution des travaux. La balance due \u00e9tant alors devenue exigible par l'appelant en cons\u00e9quence de cette procedure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 une v\u00e9ritable mise en demeure et demande judiciaire les appelants ont alors acquis le droit aux int\u00e9r\u00eats sur ce qui leur \u00e9tait d\u00fb. Pour cette raison je serais d'avis de condamner l'intim\u00e9e, comme l'a fait la Cour Sup\u00e9-rieur, au paiement des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 dater du onze octobre 1882.\nUne autre raison de la condamner \u00e0 payer les int\u00e9 r\u00eats, c'est que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il s'agit \u00e9tant de nature \u00e0 produire des fruits et revenus, l'intim\u00e9e en a pris possession en 1881. Par ce fait elle s'est soumise au paiement des int\u00e9r\u00eats qui, dans ce cas courent de plein droit et sans qu'il soit besoin d'aucune mise en de- meure, en vertu de l'art. 1534 du code civil. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree with what has been said in the reasons given for the dismissal of the appeal on all the items except the one known as the clerical error. It is the only amount which should be added to the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, The costs of the enqu\u00eate before the Superior Court are very heavy and we must therefore make a distinction, and I agree with the result arrived at by my Brother Patterson.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I agree with my Brother Strong on the two items he thought should be allowed.\nThe item of sand was deducted not only because it was a matter of compulsion by letter addressed to them by the commissioners but also upon the fact that the work had been accepted and taken over long before the subsequent contractor removed any sand. However, the majority of the court are of opinion that only one item should he added.\nPATTERSON J. The engineer's certificate dated the fourth of February, 1886, must in my judgment be regarded as the final certificate under the contract. It may, however, be properly read in connection with the details afterwards furnished showing how the amount of $52,011.11 (the odd cents were omitted in the certificate) was arrived at, so that without questioning the decision of the engineers upon the matters respecting which they were authorised to certify any matters outside of their jurisdiction may be eliminated. One of these is what they call a clerical error, being a part of the amount estimated by them in the specifications as the number of cubic yards to be dredged. They deduct $31,050 from the contractors' earnings on the ground that the actual dredging fell short of the estimate by the number of yards which at 25 cents a yard made up that sum. But the contract was for a lump sum the price per yard being named for the purpose of progress certificates, or for computing the price to be paid or allowed for additions to or deductions from the specified work if such additions or deductions had been made in manner provided by the contract. No such additions or deductions were made in this instance.\nThe contractors contend that there was not in fact P a smaller number of yards of dredging than the number assumed by the specifications. It is clear, however that the dredging whether more or less than the assumed amount was included in the gross contract and that the deduction varies the contract which the engineers had no power to do. The term \"clerical errors\" which is the euphemism under which they cover the supposed mistake in their preliminary calculations, which was seemingly no mistake after all, is not properly applied to the item.\nAnother deduction is of $13366 for removal of sand said to have been left by the contractors on the embankment. \"We have here again a serious dispute on the question of fact, but a glance at the contract and at one or two undisputed facts makes it clear that the deduction was beyond the powers of the engineers. The contract works were completed by the contractors and handed over to the Harbour Commissioners in the autumn of 1881. A new contract was given to other contractors who continued dredging during the summers of 1883, 1884 and 1885, depositing sand on the embankment in question. In the winter of 1885 the new contractors were required to level the sand on the embankment and they did so, but they allege that a portion which, at 25 cents a cubic yard, made the amount of $13,320 had been left there by the plaintiff. The duty of the engineers with regard to the plaintiff, and their functions under the contract, are plainly provided for: \"The contractor, on the completion of the works, shall give notice to the engineers in writing, and the engineers shall forthwith examine the whole of the works in the event of the works not being completed to the satisfaction of the engineers, they shall give notice to the contractor in writing to remedy such defects.\"\u2014(Sec. 65. See also sec. 68.)\nNo such action was taken by the engineers and it was at the instance and by the direction of the commissioners that the sum of $13320 was charged to the plaintiff by the engineers who themselves knew nothing of the matter.\nThat proceeding was not authorised by the contract and was not binding on the plaintiff. It has, however, been found as a fact that the commissioners actually paid the other contractors $8,918 50\/100 for work which the plaintiff ought to have done in removing or levelling sand, and they are entitled to set off that amount by way of compensation against the plaintiff's claim. Therefore we add to the nominal balance of $52-011 21\/100, the full $31,050 for the so-called clerical error, and in respect of the sand we add the difference between $13,326 and $8,918 50\/100; or $4,407 50\/100, making the whole claim of the plaintiff $87,468 71\/100 which is the same amount adjudged by the Court of Queen's Bench plus the clerical error.\nThere are other items attacked by the appellants as improperly found against them by the engineers. Two of these relate to concrete, one referring to the quality and one to the quantity. Another item is the weight of stone which the appellants complain was computed at 2,240 lbs. to the ton in place of 2,000. These com plaints were the subjects of much evidence and much argument, but they came within the scope of the duty of the engineers and we cannot put ourselves in their place. I do not see any tenable ground for allowing interest to the plaintiffs from any date earlier than that of the certificate, viz., the 4th of February, 1886. It is apparently a hardship on the plaintiffs that it cannot be computed four years farther back, but under the contract, clause 57, the money was payable only upon the engineer's certificate, and, in the absence of an agreement to pay interest it cannot he claimed until the debtor is in default.\n\"We cannot undertake to say who was to blame for the long delay in procuring the certificate. The enquiry would be irrelevant, because even if the delay were occasioned by any contrivance or act of the commissioners of which the plaintiffs could complain their remedy would be by way of damages for the wrong, and not as interest upon a debt which by the terms of their contract was not yet parable.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal both succeed and should be allowed with costs. The plaintiff has failed on some items the investigation of which in the court below must have involved a good deal of expense on both sides It would therefore seem just that each party should bear his costs of enqu\u00eale. In other respects the plaintiffs should have the general costs of the action, including the costs of the appeal to the Queen's Bench, but should pay the costs of the cross-appeal to that court The costs of appeal to this court allowed to the plaintiffs are not to include any costs of printing the enqu\u00eate.\nAppeal and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : W. & A.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, MANITOBA.\nAssessment and taxes\u2014Lands of the C. P. Ry. Co.\u2014Exemption from taxation until sold or occupied.\nBy the charter of the C. P. Ry. Co. the lands of the company in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, are exempt from Dominion, provincial or municipal taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the crown.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that lands which the company have agreed to sell and as to which the conditions of sale have not been fulfilled out are not lands \u201csold\u201d under this charter.\nHeld, further, that the exemption attaches to lands allotted to the company before the patent is granted by the crown.\nLands which were in the N. W. T. when allotted to the company did not lose their exemption on becoming, afterwards, a part of the Province of Manitoba.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Man.) affirming the judgment for the plaintiffs at the trial.\nThe action in this case was brought against the Municipality of Cornwallis to recover the amounts paid for taxes on certain lands of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. who had paid the same under protest claiming that said lands were exempt from taxation.\nBy the contract between the Government of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., which was ratified by Parliament, the company was to receive a subsidy of land in Manitoba and the North-West Territories, and sec. 16 of the contract provided that:\n\u201c The Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the company, shall be for ever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any province hereafter to be established or by any municipal corporation therein; and the lands of the company in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the crown.\u201d\nThe lands taxed by the municipality were a part of the lands so allotted to the plaintiffs under the contract At the time they were allotted they were situated in the North-West Territories, but shortly afterwards the boundaries of the province of Manitoba were extended and these lands then became part of that province and were so when the said taxes were imposed.\nAt the time the taxes were imposed the plaintiffs were entitled to patents of the said lands from the crown but the patents had not been issued. The lands had not been sold by the company, nor were they occupied. The company had entered into agreements for sale in respect to each lot, but the purchase money had not been paid in any case and no conveyances had been executed.\nThe lands were assessed by the defendant municipality and sold for taxes. In order to redeem them within the time prescribed by law the plaintiffs paid the taxes and served upon the appellants at the time a protest claiming that the lands were exempt.\nAt the trial before Mr. Justice Bain judgment was given for the plaintiffs, and the decision was affirmed by the full court. The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Gormully Q.C. for the appellants. The exemption from taxation does not attach to these lands until a grant issues from the crown. See Vicksburg, &\u0441., Railroad Co, v. Dennis ([1]); Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Co. v. Thomas ([2]).\nThe lands were sold within the meaning of clause 16 of the contract. London & Canadian Loan Co. v. Graham ([3]); Shaw v. Foster ([4]); The New York Indians ([5]); Ex parte Hillman ([6]).\nE. Blake Q.C. and Tupper Q.C. for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C J.\u2014There must have been a completed sale and the property must have passed out of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and vested in the purchaser before it could become liable to taxation. The lands never were sold and occupied; the conditions of the agreement for sale had not been carried out at the time the lands were taxed and the title and occupation, if any, continued in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.; it was not the agreeing to sell that made the lands liable to taxation; to make them assessable the lands must be actually sold before a right to tax enures to the municipality. The terms of the agreement to sell may never be carried out; in fact in one instance the terms were not complied with, and the agreement was cancelled and none of the payments had been fully made at the date of the trial, and there was not, as the learned judge found, any occupation of the lands.\nIf the lands are not exempt till there is a grant from the crown I do not see that the defendants are in any better position because while the title was in the crown the lands were exempt from taxation as crown lands, and I think the contract with the government, approved and ratified by parliament, conferred on the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. such an interest in these lands as justified them preventing a deed or certificate passing calculated to damage and interfere with their rights.\nI think, therefore, the lands were illegally taxed and sold, and respondents are entitled to recover the money paid to prevent the issue of a deed or certificate in pursuance of the illegal sale. The appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of the court below.\nFOURNIER and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in the appeal being dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014By clause 16 of the company's contract which has the force of an act of parliament, it is declared that the railway and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the company, shall be for ever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province established after the date of the contract; and that the lands of the company in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the crown.\nBy section 125 of the British North America Act no lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nThe grant of land agreed by the contract to be made to the company was, by clause 11, to be made in alternate sections of 640 acres each, extending back 24 miles deep on each side of the railway from Winnipeg to Jasper House, the company receiving the sections bearing uneven, numbers. The exemption clause did not apply to the sections between Winnipeg and the western boundary of Manitoba which was the eastern boundary of the North-West Territories, but applied to all the rest of the land grant, Jasper House being with-in the North-West Territories. It is scarcely necessary to refer to the contention that when any part of the land ceased to answer the description of land in the North-West Territories, by reason of another name being given to it by an act of the parliament of Canada, it was taken out of the exemption The limits of Manitoba were extended over a portion of the lands, but those lands were still the same lands that the contract described. The contract continued to apply to them just as a contract with or devise to Mary Smith will hold good although by her marriage she becomes Mary Jones.\nThe lands remained the property of Canada after they came to form part of the province of Manitoba, and as such were not liable to taxation. In this respect lands belonging to Canada and lands belonging to a province are put on the same footing by section 125 of the British North America Act, which probably means that the Dominion shall not tax provincial lands nor shall \u0430 \u0440\u0433\u043evin\u0441\u0435 tax Dominion lands, for the taxation of its own lands by either government would be an unprofitable proceeding.\nBy clause 9 (b) it was provided that\nUpon the construction of any portion of the railway hereby contracted for, not less than 20 miles in length, and the completion thereof so as to admit of the running of regular trains thereon, together with such equipment thereof as shall be required for the traffic thereon, the Government shall pay and grant to the company the money and land subsidies applicable thereto according to the division and appropriation thereof made as hereinbefore provided.\nThe grant of the lands in question was not actually made until 1890. It is conceded that some years before that date the company had become entitled to the grant of them. Why the grant was delayed does not appear. The provision is that as soon as the conditions are fulfilled as to each twenty miles the Government shall grant the land subsidy applicable to that portion of the road.\nWhether the twenty years\u2019 period of exemption from taxation under clause 16 should be reckoned from the date of the patent for each section granted, or from the time when the company became entitled to the grant and when it became the duty of the Government to make the grant, is a question which was not overlooked upon the argument but which does not now call for decision.\nThe contract is evidently framed with the idea that the lands shall be granted to the company as soon as the company becomes entitled to them, and without any contemplation of a debatable interval between the ownership of the crown, during which the land is not taxable, and the ownership of the company under the grant, and it does not countenance the rather ingenious contention of the appellants that the land might be taxable before patent issued though exempt after patent.\nI have no doubt that the proper construction of clause 16 is that, unless sold or occupied, no part of the land subsidy in the North-West Territories shall be liable to taxation until after the specified period of exemption. The immunity from liability to be taxed, which the British North America Act secures to these North-West Territories lands while they are crown lands, is to continue for the twenty years with regard to such of the lands as remain the unoccupied lands of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\nThe lands now in question were never occupied. Were they sold within the meaning of clause 16 ?\nIt need not be said that lands actually conveyed by the company to a purchaser are sold and are outside of the exemption, and would so remain even if the company should happen to repurchase them unless repurchased for a purpose to which the perpetual exemption under the first part of clause 16 applied. That is one extreme in which the meaning of \u201csold\u201d is not doubtful.\nThe other extreme is an agreement to sell such as exists with regard to the portions of land now in dispute.\nOn the part of the company it is urged that the term \u201csold\u201d refers only to a sale completed by conveyance, while the contention on behalf the municipality is that the agreement to sell at once brings the land within the description of land sold, taking it out of the exemption and rendering it subject to the provincial legislation respecting taxation and sale for non-payment of taxes.\nI do not think that either of these propositions can be maintained in its entirety. The existing provinces have their system of taxation, differing now and then in details but founded on the same principle, which also prevails generally in many of the states of the American Union. The term \u201ctaxation\u201d as used in clause 16 of the contract is a very general term, and does not, by its own force, express or include the methods or incidents attendant on the working of the system in any particular province, nor does it imply any limitation of the right of whatever province may be organised out of the North-West Territories to arrange its own system and to work it out by its own methods. At the same time the term must be understood to be used in view of the history of the taxation of lands in the provinces and of the ordinary incident of sale of the lands to realise arrears of taxes. The phrase \u201csold or occupied\u201d seems to recognise the practice of some of the provinces, if not of all of them, of assessing land in the name of both owner and occupant, but which practice is not, during the twenty years, to be followed with regard to such of the North-West Territories lands as the company continues to own.\nThe system of assessment which now prevails in the province of Ontario took its present general form under legislation of the province of Canada in 1850 ([7]) and 1853 ([8]); but land had been taxable in Upper Canada as far back as 1820 whenever \u201cheld in fee simple or promise of a fee simple by Land Board Certificate, Order in Council or certificate of any Governor of Canada or by lease\u201d ([9]). A list was furnished to the County Treasurer every year, beginning with the year 1820, from the Department of Crown Lands, showing what lands were \u201cdescribed as granted,\u201d what were un-granted, and clergy reserves, &c., leased ([10]); and all lands \u201cdescribed as granted\u201d or leased were liable to taxation.\nThe taxes were made a charge on the lands but it was some years later before the summary process of sale was authorized (5). The effect of the sale under these earlier statutes was to vest the land in the purchaser in fee simple, and that title was held to prevail against a patent subsequently issued granting the same land to the heir of the original nominee of the crown. Ryckman v. Van Voltenburg ([11]); Charles v. Dulmage ([12]).\nIt was enacted in 1853 ([13]) and it has continued to be the law of Ontario under the successive assessment acts of that province, that only the interest of the locatee or lessee of unpatented lands should be sold for taxes, and that the conveyance in pursuance of such sale should give the purchaser the same rights as the original locatee or lessee enjoyed.\nThese are examples of legislation by an old province, which are not unlikely to be followed by a new province, authorising the sale of an interest, be it the whole or less than the whole interest, in lands not yet patented. We must take cognisance of the fact that in the case of a new province embracing these North-West Territory lands such legislation is at least possible, dealing not with the interest of the crown, which would be out of the question unless the crown lands were ceded to the province, but with the interest of the settler upon crown lands, or of a purchaser who was not a settler.\nNow I see no reason, either in the language of the clause 16 or in any considerations of policy, for holding that a purchaser from the company is to be better off than a purchaser from the crown, as he would be if his land or his interest in it could not be taxed until he took a conveyance from the company, while the purchaser from the crown would, under probable legislation, be unable to protect himself by showing that he had not yet obtained his patent. It would be against good policy to throw an undue share of the burden on the even-numbered sections. No doubt the contract must be construed in view of the circumstances under which it was made and in furtherance of the public object for which the land subsidy was granted. But this is done when we recognise these lands as retaining during the twenty years the quality of crown lands in relation to the matter of taxation. For these reasons I do not assent to the proposition that the exemption from taxation is absolute until the lands are conveyed. I agree that the interest of the company is not liable to sale for taxes, and is not chargeable with taxes, but I think that a contract of the company by which an interest in land is given to a purchaser is, within the meaning of clause 16, a sale of the land.\nIt by no means follows that that is a sale which, as contended for by the municipality, does away with the exemption. The terms of the contract must be looked to. If the sale is conditional on payment of purchase money or on any thing else, and is to fail on non-performance of the condition so that the land reverts to the company as of its first estate, and not as purchaser under its own vendee, there is, after condition broken, no sale. A purchaser of the interest of the vendee at a sale for taxes would be, of course, in no better position than the defaulting tax-payer. He would have merely\u2014to adopt the language of a statute to which I have referred\u2014the same rights as the original vendee enjoyed.\nThis view is fatal to the claim of the municipality in this case, because the municipality has assumed to sell the corpus of the land itself and not merely the rights, if any rights there were, which existed under the agreements with the company.\nThese lands not being occupied I have made no allusion to considerations which would call for discussion in the case of occupied lands. It would be useless to enter upon such a discussion in the absence of an actual occupation the character of which would necessarily be an important matter.\nOn the other point respecting the right to maintain this action for money paid I merely say that I think the right is undisputable.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henderson & Matheson.\nSolicitors for respondents: Macdonald, Tupper, [Phippen & Tupper.\n[1] 116 U.

C.\nPer Strong and Fournier J.J Bank stock cannot be held as regards third parties in good faith to form part of substituted property on the ground that they have been purchased with the moneys belonging to the substitution without an act of investment in the name of the substitution and a due registration thereof. Arts. 931, 938, 939 C. C. (Patterson J. dissenting.)\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court ([1]) which dismissed the appellants' action.\nThe appellants claiming to represent the estate of the late William Petry and the substitution created by his will by their action demanded to be refunded the sums which they allege the Reverend James Henry Parker, one of them, has paid, by error, as curator to the substitution, to the respondents to redeem thirty-four shares in the capital stock of the Bank of Montreal belonging to the substitution and which Wentworth Gray Petry one of the grev\u00e9s and manager of the estate had illegally transferred to them.\nThe circumstances which gave rise to the litigation between the parties are as follows;\nFrom the 12th February to the 1st of December, 1885, Wentworth C-ray Petry borrowed from the respondents, an incorporated saving bank and loan company, divers large sums of money, upon his own Dotes secured by transfers of thirty-four shares in the capital stock of the Bank of Montreal At the respective dates at which these transfers were made these shares stood in the stock ledger of the Bank of Montreal, as being held by Wentworth Gray Petry, in trust, without any indication of the name of the beneficiary or cestui que trust for whom they were held.\nOn the 16th March, 1886, Petry, who had then become insolvent, and was indebted to the respondents in a sum of $9,400 paid them by a cheque of the Rev. George Henry Parker, curator to the substitution created by the will of the late William Petry, and drawn on the funds of the estate, a sum of $6000 and on the same day or on the next day the balance of $3400 was paid by a note of the Rev. M. Parker\u2014bearing date the 16th March 1886. Upon this settlement the notes of Petry were returned and he authorised in writing the respondents to transfer to parker, in trust the thirty-four shares of the Bank of Montreal which they held as security. The transfer being effected, Mr. Parker's note for $3,400 was subsequently paid, and the whole transaction was absolutely closed as far: as the respondents were concerned.\nNearly three years after this settlement had taken place, the Rev. George Henry Parker, in his capacity of curator to the substitution created by the last will and testament of the late William Petry Gertrude Petry, his wife, and the Rev. Henry James Petry, two of the three surviving children of the late William Petry instituted this action. It was admitted that out of the $9,400 paid by Parker $768 were due by the estate William Petry and that it is only the difference of $8632 claimed by the action which was paid by error. It was not contended that there was any error of fact in the matter, but that the payment was made through an error of law which Mr. Parker declared he had only discovered in 1887 after the decision of the Privy Council, of the case of Sweeny v. Tue Bank of Montreal ([2])\nThe appellants' action was dismissed in the Superior Court on the ground that two out of three conditions essential to the success of the action condictio indebiti were wanting viz. that there was no debt and that the payment was made by error.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) affirmed the judgment. Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 dissenting.\nIrvine Q. C. & G. Stuart Q. C, for the appellants.\nIf Mr. Parker had refused to pay but had sued the bank for the restitution of the stock fraudulently pledged, could the bank have successfully resisted the action ? In face of the decision of this court in Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal ([3]), confirmed by the Privy Council ([4]) it would be difficult to do so but it is pretended that by voluntarily paying the debt, for which he was no wise responsible, he has deprived himself of all recourse.\nWe submit 1st that the action condictio indebiti will lie when there is error in the use or consideration as rell as when there is error as to the existence of the debt. Arts. 1047, 1048, 1140.\nSee also Pothier, Pr\u00eate de Consomption ([5]), Larombi\u00e8re, Obligations ([6]), Aubry & Ran ([7]), Dalloz, Repertoire, Vo. Obligations ([8]), Haight v. The city of Monrreal ([9]), Baylis v. The City of Montreal ([10]), City of Montreal v Walker ([11]).\n2nd. That the bank being' a party to the fraud practised by W. G. Petry in pledging trust property, will not be heard to urge its own wrong-doing as a reason why the appellants should be deprived of their rights.\nThe bank at the time that it took the shares in pledge had notice that they were held i in trust.t At the time of the payments, now sought to be recovered back, it had express notice of the nature of the trust, by the cheques with which it was signed \" G. H, Parker, curator,\" and by the acknowledgment of the indebtedness which it took from Mr. Parker for the sum of $3,400, baaance remaining after payment of the $6,000: the acknowledgment of the indebtedness is expressed to be by \" Revd. George Henry Parker of Compton, Curateur Succession feu W. Petry.\"\nThe bank is evidently in bad faith; it received money which it knew it had no right to receive in consideration of the transfer of shares to their proper owner, which it had no right to withhold. Bank of Montr\u00e9al v. Sweeny ([12]).\nHamel Q.C. and Mr. Fitzpatrick with him for respondent, relied on the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Larue in the Superior Court ([13]), and also contended that as it was alleged by the plaintiffs that the moneys belonged to a substitution it was necessary for them to prove that they had complied with all the requirements of the law in regard to substitutions and this had not been done ([14]). They also contended that the appellants' claim could not be maintained because the curator to the substitution was not authorized to receive and claim the rights of those entitled under the substitution. See Dorion v Dorion ([15])\nThe institutes to make this claim should all be parties in the case and W. Gr. Petry, the respondents' debtor, is not a party to these proceedings, and the institutes cannot claim from the respondents what eventually may return by the effect of the substitution to W Gr. Petry its debtor.\nSIR \"W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the late Chief Justice Dorion.\nFOURNIER J.I am opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Larue in the Superior Court. I also adopt the view taken of the case by the late Chief Justice Sir A. A, Dorion of the Queen's Bench. The requirements of the laws with regard to the registration of the substitution have not been complied with. If the substitutes and grev\u00e9s had such confidence in their manager as not to see that the necessary precautions had been taken to save the moneys belonging to the substitution, they cannot now complain if he has acted imprudently.\nThere is another reason why this appeal should be dismissed. It is not a case of conditio indebiti for the curator to the substitution paid the debt of one of the substitutes; with full knowledge of all the facts. The cases to be cited by my brother Taschereau are in point, and I concur with him in holding that the reasons given by the Superior Court for dismissing the appellants action are good, and, therefore, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU. J.\u2014(Oral). Je suis d'avis de renvoyer le pr\u00e9sent appel. L'action n'est pas prise en vertu de l'article 1047 du Code Civil, car cet article d\u00e9clare que; \"Celui qui re\u00e7oit par erreur de droit ou de fait ce qui ne lui est pas d\u00fb, est oblige de le restituer. \"Or, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent il est \u00e9vident que la Caisse d'Economie n'a re\u00e7u que ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb. Elle ne tombe pas non plus sous l'article 1048 qui d\u00e9clare que;\n\"Celui qui pale une dette s'en croyant erron\u00e9ment le d\u00e9biteur, a droit de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition contre le cr\u00e9ancier.\"\nDans le cas present les demandeurs n'ont certainement pas pay\u00e9 le montant par\u00e9e qu\u2019il s\u2019en croyait les d\u00e9biteurs, L'article 1140 n'a pas non plus d'application;\n\" Tout paiement suppose une dette; ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 sans qu'il existe une dette est sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition.\" Il y avait ici un montant d\u00fb \u00e0 la Caisse par Wentworth Petry et c'est cette dette que les demandeurs out pay\u00e9e, non pas parce qu'ils croyaient erron\u00e9ment en \u00eatre les d\u00e9biteurs, mais purement dans le but de recouvrer les parts ou actions que Wentworth. Petry avait donn\u00e9es en gage \u00e0 la Caisse. Les demandeurs all\u00e8guent qu\u2019ils auraient eu le droit de recouvrer ces parts sans payer la dette de Wentworth Petry, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 daus la cause de Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal ([16]). Cela peut \u00eatre. N\u00e9anmoins ce qu'ils ont pav\u00e9 \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement d\u00fb \u00e0 la Caisse.\nLarombi\u00e8re ([17]) et Laurent ([18]) cites par le savant juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dans ses notes rapport\u00e9es en 16 Q.L.R. 193, ainsi qu'Aubry et Rau ([19]), sout autorit\u00e9s que, sous ces circonstances, les demandeurs ne peuvent pas recouvrer.\nPothier dit que lorsqun\u2019ne personne, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, n'a re\u00e7u que ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb, il faut qu'il y ait eu erreur de fait pour donner droit \u00e0 l'action condictio indebiti Et d'apr\u00e8s la loi romaine \" l'erreur dans la cause n'emp\u00eache pas la validit\u00e9 du paiement quand la chose est due d'ailleurs, et l'erreur dans le paiement donne lieu \u00e0 la \u00e9p\u00e9tition seulement s'il y a eu erreur de fait, et si celui qui a re\u00e7u en est devenu plus riche c'est-\u00e0-dire a re\u00e7u frauduleusement ce qui ne lui \u00e9tait pas d\u00fb. Thevenot-Dessaules dit; ([20]) l'ignorance de droit s'admet rarement.\" Le princpee \u00e9tait que nulla repetitio est ab eo qui suuni recipit, lorsque celui qui a pay\u00e9 l'a fait au nom du d\u00e9biteur ([21]). Le juge en chef Dorion pouvait bien dire, comme il l'a fait dans l'esp\u00e8ce, qu'il est douteux si le paiement par un tiers d'une somme l\u00e9gitimement due peut donner lieu \u00e0 l'action condictio indebiti, except\u00e9e pour erreur de fait bien clairement prouv\u00e9e.\nIci les demandeurs disent qu'ils se sont crus obliges de payer pour d\u00e9livrer leur gage, et que ce n'est que subs\u00e9quemment, par la d\u00e9cision in re Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal ([22]) qu'ils ont d\u00e9couvert leur erreur. Mais, dit la Cour de Cassation re Leblanc ([23]).\nL'erreur fond\u00e9e sur une jurisprudence ult\u00e9rieurement reconnue fauss\u00e9e n'est pas une cause de la nullit\u00e9 de la convention. Pour l'action condictio indehiti proprement dite, il faut que la somme pay\u00e9e ne soit pas due.\nUn endosseur d'un billet le paie apr\u00e8s prot\u00eat. Plus tard, il d\u00e9cuv\u00e9e que le prot\u00eat \u00e9tat nul. Il ne peut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, parce que, dit la Cour de Cassation dans deux arr\u00eats, \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il a pay\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00fb ([24]); Mongaley et Germain, Code de commerce ([25]); Masse Droit commercial ([26]) Nouguier ([27]); Pardessus, Droit commercial ([28]); D\u00e9mol\u00eemes, Des contrats ([29]); aussi in re d' Erlanger ([30]). Et la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est toujouss plus difficilement accord\u00e9e que l'exception pour se refuser \u00e0 payer ([31]).\nDans Caldwell v. Patterson ([32]), il fut jug\u00e9 que\u2014\nThe amount voluntarily paid on a protested bill of exchange by the drawer cannot be recovered on the ground of an error in the \"payment in point of law.\nQuelle est la cause du paiement ici ? On plut\u00f4t, qu\u2019est-ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 ? Clairement, la dette de Wentworth Petry. Et la Caisse se s'est pas enrichie aux d\u00e9pens d'autrui. Elle n'a re\u00e7u que ce qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00fb. L'erreur des demandeurs a porte sur le motif qui les a fait agir. Mais la Caisse n'avait rien \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce motif Elle n'en a pas m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e. Elle pouvait bien croire que c'\u00e9tait un pr\u00eat que les demandeurs faisaient \u00e0 Wentworth Petry. Wentworth Petry l'a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre le gage aux demandeurs, et elle a d\u00fb le faire, sans s'enqu\u00e9rir des rapports qui pouvaient exister entre eux les demandeurs et \"Wentworth Petry ou des motifs qui les faisaient agir.\nLa diff\u00e9rence entre la, cause de l'obligation et le motif du contrat ressort de cette id\u00e9e; l'une est le but imm\u00e9diat et direct one le d\u00e9biteur s'est propos\u00e9 d'atteindre en s'obligeant; l'aurre c'est la consid\u00e9ration plus \u00e9lign\u00e9e qui l'a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 a faire le contrat D\u00e9nia n\u00e9e et Colmet de Santerre ([33])\nIci, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, c'est la dette de Wentworth Petry que les demandeurs out de fait pay\u00e9e et voulu payer. C'est l\u00e0 la cause commu\u00e9e du paiement; la seule cause de la r\u00e9ception du paiement par la Caisse. Ils ne l'ont pas fait il est vrai pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier Wentworth Petry, mais, dans leur propre int\u00e9r\u00eat, et c'est l\u00e0 leur motif d\u2019action le but qu'ils voulaient atteindre!\nMais il v a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre la canuse d'un contrat et le motif qui de fait a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 l'intention des parties disent Masse et Verg\u00e9 sur Zachari\u00e6 ([34]).\nLe motif du contrat est la cause impulsive comme l'appelle Demolombe, (loc. cit.) et Teneur sur les motifs, ajoute-t-il, n'est pas une cause de nullit\u00e9\nMaynz, Obligations dit ([35]):\nAinsi l'erreur relative aux motifs qui ont pu nous engager & contracter ne constitue amais une cause do nullit\u00e9' l'erreur sur l'existence on la nature l\u00e9gale de\u2019l objet l'erreur sur le droit du promettant est sans influence sur la validit\u00e9 de la convention par la raison qu'elle tombe sur quelque chose en dehors de la prestation qui est l'objet soumis an consentement.\nLa Caisse ne pouvait refuser le paiement. Elle \u00c9tait oblig\u00e9e de l'accepter.\nEt en la payant le demandeurs sont devenus les cr\u00e9anciers de Wentworth 3?etry qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 des lors compl\u00e8tement lib\u00e9r\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis d'elle. De plus, \"Wentworth Petry a place ces argents des demandeurs dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Petry et Beaulieu Et les demandeurs, lorsqu'ilsen ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s, en 1835, non en 1886, comme ils l'all\u00e8guent, out reconnu Went-worth -Petry et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Petry et Beaulien comme leurs d\u00e9biteurs, ratifiant par l\u00e0 tout ce qu'il avait fait en filant une r\u00e9clamation contre le syndic de la faillite entry et Beaulieu. Le placement fait par Wentworth Petry pouvait-il plus clairement \u00eatre ratifi\u00e9 par eux ?\nEt en supposant que les demandeurs eussent p\u00fb recouvrer de la Caisse est-ce quills auraient pu le faire sans mettre Wentworth Petry en cause? Leur action tend \u00e0 faire annuler le contract de gage fait entre Wentworth Petry et la Caisse. Comment pourraient-ils le faire en l'absence de Wentworth Petry ? Ils all\u00e8guent bien, et provent qu'il a refuse de les joindre comme demandeurs, mais alors il fallait le joindre comme d\u00e9fendue Dans Sweeny v. La Bazque de Montr\u00e9al ([36]), Rose, le truste\u00e8 qui avait mis en gage les parts des demanderesse \u00e9ait en cause. Dans Raphael v. McFarlane ([37]) une action du m\u00eame Genre, celui qui avait transf\u00e9r\u00e9 sans droits des parts de banque appartenant au demandeur \u00e9tait aussi d\u00e9fendeur co-joint. Je renverrais l'appel.\nPAT\u00cfERSON J. This case being purely one of French law I do not pretend to discuss it with confidence, though we have had ample assistance in apprehending the views presented on each side in the well-reasoned opinions of Chief Justice Dorion and of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, and in the full and able arguments of counsel. My opinion at the argument was in favour of the views of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 the dissentient judge in the court below and after a further careful consideration of the case I retain the same opinion. I do not understand that there is any conflict on questions of fact, although in one important particular something depends on the way the facts are looked at.\nThere is no dispute as to the fact that W. G. Petry held the shares of the Bank of Montreal stock \"in trust,\u201d and that the bank, the respondents in this appeal, took the shares in pledge for the loan made to W. G. Petry personally, knowing that they were held in that manner. That being so, it would be against ordinary principles of fair dealing, and contrary to the doctrine acted on in Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal ([38]) and in Raphael v. Macfarlane ([39]) to hold that they were taken innocently, as against those beneficially entitled, or in good faith; wherefore it appears to me the de fence of want of registration of the substitution, so strongly urged and so much relied on in the. opinion delivered in the court below by the learned Chief Justice is excluded by the terms of article 940 of the Civil Code.\nThen as to the motive of the appellant in redeeming the shares, which is the fact that I say may be! looked at in more than one way. The payment certainly had the effect of discharging \"W. G. Petry's debt to the bank, but it was not made for the sake of paying that debt The motive was to save the shares for the estate. which the appellant Parker by reason of a mistake in law believed he could do only by repurchasing them, the price being measured by the amount of the detit.\nUnder that mistake the appellant Parker paid the money which belonged to the estate. Having discovered his mistake he demands a return of the money he paid and is met in the first place by the defences to which I have just alluded and by another which, under the present constitution of the record would not be fatal to the action, but which only touches his personal right to sue. The respondent says to him \" True, you paid us the money and we have no right to retain it, but you who paid it are not the right person to demand the return of it.\" It appears to me that the position of Mr. Parker differs materiality from that of the curator to the substitution in the case of Dorion v. Dorion ([40]) who was held not to be entitled to maintain an action to recover moneys belonging to the institutes which he had never had possession of.\nI think, though with distrust of my conclusion, that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Caron, Pentland & Stuart.\nSolicitors for respondents : Hanel & Tessier.\n[1] 16 Q.L.R. 193\n[2] 12 App. Cas. 617.\n[3] 12 Can.

In the administration of the estate of a feme coverte her next of kin claimed the personalty on the ground that the husband's rights were swept away by this omission.\nHeld, that the personal property passed to the husband and not to the next kin of the wife.\nPer Strong J.\u2014That the repeal by the Revised Statutes of 26 Geo. 3 c. 11, which was passed in the affirmance of the Imperial acts, operated to restore sec. 25 of the Statute of Frauds as part of the common law of New Brunswick.\nPer Gwynne J.\u2014When a colonial legislature re-enacts an Imperial act it enacts it as interpreted by the Imperial courts, and a fortiori by other Imperial acts. Hence, when the English Statute of Distributions was re-enacted by 26 Geo. 3 c. 11 (N.B), it was not necessary to enact the interpreting section of the Statute of Frauds, and its omission in the Revised Statutes did not affect the construction to be put upon the whole act. Held, per Ritchie C.J., Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ., That the Married Woman's Property Act of New Brunswick (C.S. N. B. c. 72), which exempts the separate property of a married woman from liability for her husband's debts and prohibits any dealing with it without her consent, only suspends the husband's rights in the property during coverture, and on the death of the wife he takes the personal property as he would if the act had never been passed.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick, while deciding against the next of kin on his claim to the residue of the estate of a feme coverte, directed that his costs should be paid out of the estate. On appeal the decree was varied by striking out such direction.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming a decree of the Judge of Probate for Westmoreland County in proceedings for administration of the estate of a married woman.\nThe sole question to be decided in the case is: When a married woman dies, intestate and leaving property, is her husband, or her next of kin, entitled to such property according to the law in force in New Brunswick? The courts below have decided that the property goes to the husband.\nThe English Statute of Distributions (22 & 23 Car. 2 ch 10) was formerly part of the common law of New Brunswick, as was also sec. 25 of the Statute of Frauds which declared that nothing in the Statute of Distributions should be construed to extend to the estates of femes covertes dying intestate, but that their husbands should enjoy their personal property as they might have done theretofore.\nThe New Brunswick act, 26 Geo. 3 ch. 11, re-enacted the English Statute of Distributions and the said section of the Statute of Frauds. The Revised Statutes of New Brunswick, passed in 1854, contain 26 Geo. 3 ch. 11, except section 17, corresponding to section 25 of the Satute of Frauds, which was omitted. The present Statute of Distributions is ch. 78 C.S. N.B., which is in the same form as the Revised Statutes. In this state of the statute law the appellants, who are the next of kin to the deceased, and who would be entitled to her personal estate if she had left no husband, claim that the latter's rights are swept away by the legislature; that the husband formerly took his wife's estate, not by virtue of his marital right but simply as administrator; that his exemption from the operation of the Statute of Distributions being taken away, and it being well settled that he is not of any kin to his wife, he is bound to distribute the estate as would be any other administrator.\nW. W. Wells for the appellant. The husband cannot claim the benefit of the general scheme of distribution, as he is not of kin to his wife. Bailey v. Wright[1]; Milne v. Gilbert[2].\nNor is he entitled to the property by virtue of his marital right. Prior to 31 Edw. 3, he had no right whatever in the personalty of his wife, but it was dealt with by the Ordinary in his discretion[3]. Under 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 he simply enjoyed the residue of the personal estate as administrator, the law then being that an administrator was not bound to account to any one[4]. He took the estate, not by virtue of his marital right but as \"the nearest and most lawful friend\" of his wife as the statute provides. See Fortre v. Fortre[5]; Sir George Sand's Case[6]; Fettiplace V-. Gorges[7]; re Lambert's Estate[8].\nThen under the Statute of Distributions, 22 & 23 Car. 2 ch. 10, the husband would be bound to distribute his wife's estate as he would that of a stranger. The Statute of Frauds only preserved his former right which was to take his wife's property as her administrator. At all events, in New Brunswick the legislature, by repealing the section corresponding to section 25 of the Statute of Frauds, has expressly declared that the husband shall be in the same position as other administrators. See Wood v. DeForrest[9].\nEven if the husband's rights should be considered as otherwise existing, they have been taken away by the Married Woman's Property Act, which vests her separate property entirely in the wife.\nSkinner Q.C. and Pugsley Sol. Gen. of New Brunswick for the respondent. That the husband took the personal property of his wife at her death jure mariti see Squib v. Wyn[10]; Watt v. Watt[11]; Tyler on Infancy and Coverture[12].\nThe Married Woman's Property Act was intended to protect the separate property of a wife from being taken for the husband's debts, but not to interfere with the husband's right to it at her death. The fact that she could not make a will without his consent shows that the husband's rights were not to be completely swept away by this act.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I am content to rest my judgment on the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice in the court below as I entirely concur in the conclusion at which he has arrived, except with reference to the costs; the defendant having gained the suit, and the court having held the property to be his, he should not, in my opinion, have been made to pay the costs, which was the practical result of saying the costs should come out of his estate. As a general rule when costs are awarded out of the estate it is in cases where the testator has so devised his property as to create ambiguities and mistakes as to the proper construction of his dispositions. In such a case the testator has himself really rendered an appeal to the court necessary. In this case the unfortunate defendant was in no way to blame, and having gained his suit I can see no good reason why he should be mulcted in costs. If now the costs are to come out of the estate he will have gained but a barren victory; in fact, he might as well have allowed this small estate to be divided among the next of kin as be obliged to divide it amongst the lawyers, more particularly as to the costs in this court, coming here after such a clear exposition of the law in the court below. I can only look upon this appeal as a mere experiment, and I agree with the learned judge in Elliott v. Gurr[13] that \"if parties will try experiments, and call in question rules clearly established by a uniform course of practice, they, and not the parties proceeded against, ought to be liable to the expenses. It is the duty of the court to check such novelties in practice by costs.\"\nSTRONG J.\u2014The question presented by this appeal relates to the disposition of the residue of the personal estate of Sarah Jane Cleveland, a married woman who died intestate and without issue, leaving her husband, the respondent, surviving, and also her brother and two sisters; her father and mother having both died before her. The respondent, as the intestate's husband, obtained letters of administration, and having thereunder administered the estate passed his accounts before the judge of the Probate Court of Westmoreland County, whereupon a question arose as to the proper disposition of the surplus assets of the estate remaining after the payment of the debts. The respondent contended that he was entitled to retain the residue for his own use, whilst the appellants (the children and personal representatives of the intestate's brother) insisted that the deceased's next of kin, viz., her brother and sisters or their representatives, were entitled to this surplus. The Judge of Probate having decided in favor of the husband the present appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which court having affirmed the judgment of the Probate Judge (Mr. Justice Palmer dissenting) the present appeal has been taken to this court.\nThe English Statute of Distributions (22 & 23 Car. 2nd cap. 10) was originally in force in New Brunswick as well as the subsequent explanatory enactment contained in the 25th section of the Statute of Frauds. The effect of this legislation is well known; the Statute of Distributions not having made any express provision as regards the husband's rights in the surplus assets of his wife to whom he had been appointed administrator, and doubts having arisen as to its applicability to that case, the 25th section of the Statute of Frauds enacts that the Statute of Distributions should not extend to the estates of femes covertes dying intestate, and expressly affirmed the husband's common law right to the whole residue for his own benefit. This provision of the Statute of Frauds, which as part of the law of England was applicable in New Brunswick at and from the date of its organization as a Province in 1784, was, by the Provincial Act, 26 Geo. 3, cap. 11, by which statutory provision was made for the distribution of the estates of persons dying intestate, substantially re-enacted. The 17th section of the last mentioned act was as follows:\nNothing in this Act shall be construed to extend to the estates of femes covertes who die intestate, but that their husbands might administer and enjoy them * * * * * * as they might have done before.\nIn 1854 the statutes of New Brunswick were revised, and the enactment contained in the 17th section of 26 Geo. 3 cap. 11 was not re-enacted, nor was any other provision made for the case for which it had provided. The appellants insist that the effect of this repeal is to entitle them, as next of kin of the intestate Mrs. Cleveland, to have the estate distributed amongst them in the same way as if she had left no husband. This pretension is, in my opinion, wholly unfounded. According to an elementary rule universally applicable in the interpretation of written laws the effect of the simple abrogation without more of a statutory enactment, not itself repealing but made in affirmance of the previous law, is to revive the law as it stood prior to the passing of the repealed statute, and the application of this rule in the present case must be to bring back the law to the state in which it was before the passing of the 26 Geo. 3 c. 11, that is to say, to restore what originally formed part of the common law of New Brunswick, namely, the law of England as contained in 29 Car. 2 c. 3 sec. 25.\nThe circumstance that the repealed enactment was identical in its terms with the 25th section of the Statute of Frauds, so far from constituting a reason for not applying the principle referred to is, if any argument of the kind can be required, a reason for applying it, since it affords a strong presumption; that the revising legislature repealed and dispensed with the 17th section of 26 Geo. 3 as being a superfluous and useless reiteration of the original law.\nI do not feel called upon to enter upon any investigation of the history of the law relating to a husband's right to a grant of administration of his deceased wife's goods, nor of his freedom from liability to distribution prior to the Statute of Distributions. It is sufficient to say that under the law of England as administered long prior to the passing of the Statute of Distributions, and invariably since the Statute of Frauds, it has always been considered that the husband surviving has a right to the administration of the estate of his wife dying intestate, and that as such administrator he has (as had all administrators before the Statute of Distributions) a right to retain the surplus for his own use. This right it is expressly declared by the Statute of Frauds the Statute of Distributions did not interfere with.\nHow the exclusive right of the husband came to be originally determined is a matter of no practical importance; it is sufficient to say that it has been settled law for the last two hundred years, and has during that period of time been universally recognized and acted upon and has never been called in question by any judicial authority.\nAnother question discussed at considerable length on the argument of this appeal, viz., that as to the rights of the next of kin of a husband who survives his wife and dies without having taken out letters of administration to the personal estate of the wife, as against the wife's own next of kin who have obtained administration under 21 Henry 8th cap. 5, is so absolutely irrelevant to the question presented for decision that I decline to enter upon the consideration of it.\nI am of opinion that the directions that the costs, as well those in the Probate Court as those in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, should be paid out of the estate (save so far as they related to the mere passing of the administrator's accounts in the Probate Court) were erroneous. The effect of such directions was to make the respondent bear the costs of a litigation in which he was entirely successful.\nTherefore the order under appeal must in this respect be varied by striking out the order for payment of the costs out of the estate, and by directing that the appellants do pay to the respondent his costs in both courts below with the exception of those relating to the passing of the accounts. Subject to the foregoing variations this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I see with a sense of relief that whatever conclusion I reach in this case will not affect the result, so I will not take part in the judgment. It would be useless for me to delay it.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question raised in this case is whether by the law of the Province of New Brunswick a husband, administrator of the estate and effects, etc., of his deceased wife who died intestate, is bound to make distribution of the residue of her personal estate among her next of kin or can retain it to his own use and benefit The contention of the appellants is that he is, by the law of New Brunswick, bound to make distribution among the next of kin of his deceased wife, and Mr. Wells, in his very able argument in support of that contention, opened up the whole question of the origin and nature of the husband's title to the personal property of his wife as it existed before the passing of chapters 111 and 114 of the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick of 1854, as well as the question of the effect of those statutes, and of chs. 72 and 78 of the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick of 1876.\nIn Graysbrook v. Fox[14], the reason of the passing of the statute 31 Edw. 3, ch. 11, and the mischief to remedy which it was enacted, are stated to have been:\nAlthough the ordinary might (as is there stated by common law) seize and take the goods which the intestate had at the time of his death, yet, for the debts due to the intestate, or for things in action, the ordinary had no remedy, for he could not bring an action of debt or other action for a debt due to the intestate, and by the same reason he could not release the debts due to the intestate, but his interest was only to seize the things which the intestate had in possession, and with them he might do as he pleased, but he could not sue the debtors of the intestate, and thereby the persons to whom the intestate was indebted could not have remedy for the debts due to them by the intestate, but only according to the rate of the value of the goods in possession, * * * and thus he to whom the intestate was indebted was defrauded of his debt, and he that was indebted to the intestate retained the debt in his hands which, by good reason, ought to go to satisfy the creditor of the intestate. And this was taken to be a thing against conscience, and a great mischief, and therefore, to redress it the statute 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 was made, which enacts that, \"in case where a man dieth intestate, the ordinaries shall depute the next and most lawful friends of the dead person intestate to administer his goods which deputies shall have an action to demand and recover as executors the debts due to the said person intestate in the King's court for to administer and dispend for the soul of the dead, and shall answer also in the King's court to others to whom the said dead person was hold en and bound in the same manner as executors shall answer, and they shall be accountable to the ordinaries as executors are in the case of a testament as well of the time past as the time to come. So that this act provides that where a man dies intestate the ordinary shall commit the administration to others who are the next and most faithful friends of the dead, and it gives them an action of debt and does not give it to the ordinary himself, * * * and so it has remedied the said mischief.\nAnd it is there further said that for the redress of the said mischief,\nThe act enables the administrators to have an action and to recover the debts as executors may, which point is the only purview of the act.\nIn Ognell's case[15] it was held to be undoubted law that a feme coverte could not make an executor without the assent of her husband, and that the administration of her goods of right belongs to the husband, and in Hensloe's case[16], in Trinity term 42 Eliz., which decides that the ordinaries had no title by the common law to the personal estate of persons dying intestate, but that their title thereto was derived from the King to whom as parens patri\u00e6 they belonged it was adjudged:\nThat no power was given to the ordinary before the statute to sell or give the goods, or to dispose of any of them to his own use or any other, nor had he any authority to release the debt due to the intestate, nor had the ordinaries or their deputies or committees any action to recover any debt, or to take any advantage of any covenant or of any other thing in action. That by the act the ordinary is bound to grant administration to the next and most lawful friends. That is: the next of blood who are not attained of treason, felony, or have other lawful disability, but are lawful friends; and further, that now by the act the administrators of intestates' estates, although appointed by ordinary under the authority of the act, had nevertheless vested in them by the act a more absolute interest in the goods of the intestate than the ordinary ever had, and consequently than he ever could confer; that they had under the act as absolute property in the goods and chattels of the intestate as executors had.\n31 Edw. 3 c. 11 is the first and only statute upon which the title of the husband to the debts due to, and choses in action of, his deceased wife depends; the ordinary had never had any interest in or power over such species of property and consequently could never have transferred to another any interest in or power over such property. By the common law the husband had acquired absolute title in right of his marriage in all the personal property in the possession of his wife at the time of the marriage or which came into her possession during the coverture, and also the right to reduce into possession all debts due to her and all her choses in action, or to release and discharge them during the coverture; so that the wife during the life time of her husband could die entitled to no personal property, unless in virtue of some agreement with her husband, other than debts due to her, or choses in action not reduced into possession and not released or discharged during the coverture, and so it was adjudged in the third year of Charles the First in the case of Jones v. Rowe[17], from Sir W. Jones's report of which, as more full than the other, I make the following extract:\u2014\nBefore the statute (31 Edw. 3 c. 11) the ordinary had nothing to do with the goods or debts of a feme coverte, unless she was executrix to another, for her goods in possession belonged to her husband by the inter-marriage and the wife had no property in them, but the husband if he wished could release them during the coverture; but if the wife should die before their recovery the husband could not sue for them, neither had the ordinary had anything to do with them but the debtor shall have the profit of them. The way to prevent this was to make an executor which the wife could do with her husband's assent and she could make her husband her executor and in this manner as her executor he could recover the debts. The statute of 31 Edw. 3 gives power to the ordinary to commit administration to the next and and most lawful friend of the intestate and no one can be the next and most lawful friend of the wife but her husband and upon her death it is he who takes charge of her funeral and other things belonging unto her and so administration ought to be committed to him and such power given to the ordinary must be strictly pursued and cannot be governed by his discretion and the statute 21 H. 8 does not extend to this case for that is where the husband dies intestate the widow, or his next of kin, or both shall be joined together.\nNow, the interpretation put upon the statutes has invariably been, that the husband of a woman dying intestate was exclusively and absolutely entitled to have administration of the goods and effects of his deceased wife granted to him; that in the case of a husband dying intestate it was discretionary with the ordinary to grant administration to the widow of the deceased, or to his next of kin, or to the widow and next of kin conjointly, by 21 H. 8; and that in all other cases administration should be granted to the next of kin of the intestate, or to some or one of them in the discretion of the ordinary where the intestate died leaving several his next of kin in equal degree. It becomes important, therefore, to consider why the same words in 31 Edw. 3 ch. 11 were construed by the courts to apply to the next of kin or the nearest of the blood of the intestate in all cases except in the case of a wife dying intestate, leaving her husband her survivor, in which case they apply to the husband alone, who is not next of kin, or of the blood, of his deceased wife at all. We have seen that in such a case the ordinary before the statute had no power whatever over the goods or debts of the feme coverte dying intestate; that without the assent of her husband she could die possessed of no personal estate or effects other than debts or goods over which the husband had had during the coverture full and absolute power to dispose of, relinquish, discharge and release. Prior to 31 Edw. 3 ch. 11 the ecclesiastical courts had exercised the jurisdiction of compelling the persons appointed by the ordinary to administer the personal estate of deceased persons, whether the same should die testate or intestate, to account for any surplus of personal estate remaining after payment of debts and legacies in the case of a will, and after payment of debts where the deceased had died intestate, and of distributing such surplus in the discretion of the courts. After the passing of the acts the ecclesiastical courts attempted to assert their right to exercise the jurisdiction they had before exercised of compelling administrators to account, and of distributing whatever personal estate of the intestate should remain in the hands of the administrator after the satisfaction of the debts of the intestate at the discretion of the ecclesiastical courts equally as before, but the common law courts interposed by prohibition and prevented the continuance of the exercise of such jurisdiction.\nIn Slawney's case, in 19 James 1st[18] administration having been granted to the widow of an intestate it was adjudged that she could not be compelled by the ecclesiastical courts to distribute any part of a surplus remaining in her hands after satisfaction of debts to or among the next of kin of the intestate not being his children, Hobart C.J. saying:\nIf a man observe well the statute 21 H. 8 c. 5, he shall perceive by preferring the wife and children to the administration that the statute did imitate the mind of the intestate to prefer them that it is like he would have preferred if he had made a will, which must be by giving the profit of the estate, and not only labor and dolor in suing and being sued, to bring in and defend the estate, and then to give this vast power to the ordinary to give the surplusage where he will.\nSo in Levanne's case, in 6 Car. 1st[19] where administration had been granted to the sister of an intestate, a prohibition was granted at her suit restraining the ecclesiastical court from entertaining a suit instituted there for the purpose of compelling the administration to distribute a surplus in her hands, said to be large, among the next of kin of the intestate; the court saying that prohibition was well grantable\nbecause the absolute interest in the goods is in the administrator, and administration being granted the ordinary hath nothing to do, and he cannot now, as he might at common law, repeal the administration committed at his pleasure.\nIn Tooker v. Loane, in the 15th year of James 1st[20] a prohibition was granted to restrain the ecclesiastical court interfering to make distribution of the surplus of the personal estate of an intestate in the hands of administrators, \"because the ordinary hath no power to make distribution of the surplusage,\" and the court held that by the true meaning of the statute, specially 21 Hen. 8, a benefit was intended to the administrator and not an unprofitable burthen, and the statute gives a preferment to the wife and next of kin. In an anonymous case decided in the 21st year of Charles 2, in the Kings' Bench reported in Sid. 489, it was adjudged that administration of the goods of his deceased wife must be granted to the husband and to no one else; and in Cox v. Webb[21], the same point precisely, and that this was not like the case of two in equal degree, was adjudged in the Kings' Bench, in the 6th year of William and Mary in the time of Holt Chief Justice.\nIn Palmer v. Allicock[22], in the 36th year of Charles 2nd, a man died intestate leaving no wife and only one child, a son, who obtained letters of administration to his father and then died intestate, under age, and his next of kin obtained letters of administration de bonis non of the father, whereupon the next of kin of the father instituted a suit in the ecclesiastical court to repeal these letters, and the question was whether a prohibition should go at the suit of the next of kin of the child to prevent the ecclesiastical court repealing these letters of administration. In that case Mr. Pollexfen arguendo for the prohibition, which after many arguments was granted, said:\nAt the common law there was no wife or child that had any right or interest in the intestate's estate, but the ordinary was the master thereof to distribute it in pios usus, and perhaps the wife and children might come in under that name but not otherwise. Then the 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 gave only an action to the administrator, and then the statute 21 H. 8 c. 5 left it in the wife and next of kin by virtue of the administration, but notwithstanding all these there were many inconveniences before the act 22 & 23 Car. 2, c. 10 of distribution. The statute of 21 H. 8 c. 5 settled the administration, but left the estate unsettled, only it went with the administration.\nAgain he argued:\nThen supposing there be an infant who has an interest vested, whether the estate shall go to the next of kin to the infant, or to the next of kin to the father?\nWhich was the question before the court; he continues: Wheresoever the whole estate shall go the administration shall go as if a wife die the husband shall have the administration, though this be not mentioned within the statute of 21 H. 8, c. 5, or this law, (22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10) and the reason is because the marriage gave him a kind of interest in the estate of the wife and the children shall have nothing to do therein.\nIn support of which he cited Ognell's case[23] and Rowe's case[24].\nHere we see that the right of the husband under 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 to have administration of his deceased intestate wife's estate granted to him is put upon his having \"because of his marriage a kind of interest in the estate of his wife,\" and, although this be but the argument of counsel, still coming from such an eminent counsel who succeeded in his contention it is entitled to the greatest weight, and in Fortre v. Fortre[25], in the 4th year of William and Mary, it was adjudged by the whole court, Sir John Holt C.J., that the ecclesiastical court may grant administration to the widow or to the next of kin of an intestate, which they please.\nBut where the wife dies the husband is to have the administration being the only true and lawful next of kin by the statute 31 Edw. 3, c. 11.\nBy this language the court cannot be construed as having meant that in point of fact the husband was, by 31 Edw. 3, c. 11, made or declared to be next of kin of his wife, but that he and he alone was to have administration granted to him in virtue of his right as husband to be regarded as the next and most lawful friend of his wife under the statute 31 Edw. 3, and as such beneficially entitled to her estate equally as the next of kin of other intestates were entitled under 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, and 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10.\nIn Petit v. Smith[26], the reason of the passing of 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10, is thus stated by Holt C.J.: At common law, before the statute ordered administration to be granted, the ordinary appointed committees of the personal estate and in those times it was the practice to compel such committes to distribute, but afterwards when the ordinary by virtue of the act of Parliament, 31 Edw. 3, c. 11, granted administration, this administrator had all the power of an executor, and being in nature of an executor it was adjudged that he was not compellable to make distribution, which being thought hard to those of kin to the intestate of equal degree the statute of distribution was made.\nIn Blackborough v. Davis[27] Holt C, J. refers to a case of Duncomb v. Mason (said in Raymond's reports to have been decided in the Common Pleas in the time of Bridgeman C. J. and therefore not later than the 2nd year of Car. 2nd or two years before the passing of the statute of distributions) wherein it was held that of right the husband could repeal administration granted to the next of the blood of his deceased wife,\nbecause the husband has an original right by 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 as the most lawful friend of the wife and was not within 21 H. 8 c. 5 so that the ordinary had no election in the case of the husband.\nAnd in Squib v. Wyn[28], Lord Chancellor Cowper says:\u2014\nThe husband's title at law to the personal estate of the wife is favored; even a term which is as chattel real shall go to the husband surviving his wife, and as to all the personal goods they are his by the intermarriage: though the husband administering to the wife is liable to pay her debts, yet he is entitled to the surplus which will go to his representatives.\nIn Edwards v. Freeman[29] Sir Joseph Jekyle, Master of the Rolls, says that the design of the statute of distributions was:\nTo do what a good and just parent ought for all his children.\nLord C. J. Raymond[30] says that:\nIt only makes such a will for the intestate as a father free from the partiality of affections would himself make, and this I may call a Parliamentary will. And Lord Chancellor King[31] says:\u2014\nThe occasion of making this statute was to put an end to the controversy betwixt the temporal and spiritual courts. The ordinary before took bonds from the administrator to make distribution, and those bonds were at law adjudged void, and the administrator entitled to all the personal estate. One died intestate, leaving a considerable personal estate, and a son and daughter; the son administered and the daughter contended for a share in the spiritual court where it was thought a hardship that the son should have all, yet the daughter was prohibited at law; however, this statute of distributions takes away the administrator's pretensions, (which before he had made with success) of retaining the whole.\nIn Rex v. Bettesworth[32] the husband's right to have administration granted to him of his deceased wife's estate is said to be\nin respect of the interest he has in the estate and because no one is in \u00e6quali gradu.\nIn Humphrey v. Bullen[33] where a husband survived his wife and took out letters of administration to her estate, and died before receiving a legacy to which his wife had been entitled, and the administrator of the husband received the legacy, it was held that he was entitled to retain it against an administrator de bonis non of the wife, as the absolute property of the husband. Lord Hardwicke there says:\nDuring the coverture they (that is the husband and wife) are but one person, but when that coverture is dissolved by the death of the wife the husband is certainly the next friend and nearest relation, and has a right to administer exclusive of all other persons.\nLord Hardwicke, by these words, \"next friend and nearest relation, and has a right to administer exclusive of all persons,\" must be taken as expressing the undoubted opinion of the Lord Chancellor, that the husband is the person who is indicated in 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 as \"the next and most lawful friend of the dead intestate,\" and as such exclusively entitled to the administration of his deceased wife's estate. The Lord Chancellor in that case states the object of the passing of the Statute of Distributions thus:\nAt common law no person at all had a right to administer, but it was in the breast of the ordinary to grant it to whom he pleased till the statute 21 H. 8 c. 5 which gave it to the next of kin, and if there were persons of equal kin, whichever took out administration was entitled to the surplus, and for this reason the statute was made in order to prevent this injustice and to oblige the admininistrator to distribute.\nIn Elliott v. Taylor[34] it was adjudged by Lord Hardwicke that the husband's right to administration of his wife's estate is transmissible to his representative and shall not go to hers. Lord Hardwicke there says:\nThe husband is not mentioned in the Statute of Car. 2 of Distributions; his surviving his wife is not a provision within that statute. No person but the husband can be entitled to the personal estate of the wife unless by some agreement, so he might have had administration and the whole would have been his own and nobody could have shared it with him.\nLord Thurlow, it is true, in Fettiplace v. Gorges[35], speaking of a wife dying intestate leaving her husband her surviving, says:\nIn that case the husband takes as next of kin and not from his marital rights,\nbut it is to be observed that this was not the point in judgment in the case, and in Watt v. Watt[36], it was expressly decided that a husband could not take under the designation \"next of kin\" to his wife, Lord Ch. Loughborough there saying:\nThe description of next of kin of the wife can in no respect apply to the husband. He is entitled to the personal property of his wife jure mariti; her personal property vests in him by the marriage. At the death of the wife, if it is necessary for him to have an administration to enable him to get in her personal property the administration granted to him is granted to him as husband, and when you look at the statutes, there is no law that gives the husband a right by force of the statute to administer to his wife. The husband's right is supposed in all the statutes. The statute 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, which directs who shall have administration, takes no notice of the husband. They are to grant it to the widow, or the next of kin, or both. That statute, therefore, does not take the widow to be the next of kin. It takes no notice of the widower for the law gives it to him, and where it was necessary for him to have the authority of the Ecclesiastical Court to enable him to obtain her personal property he had a right to it. That right was secured to him absolutely and exclusively, as held by the courts, by 31 Edw. 3 c. 11.\nThe proper conclusion to be deduced from these cases is that the husband, in virtue of 31 Edw. 3 c. 11, was held to be exclusively entitled to have administration of his deceased intestate wife's estate granted to him, and such title was founded upon the principles of the common law which had vested in him all her personal estate in possession and absolute power to reduce into possession for his own benefit all her debts and choses in action and to relinquish, release, acquit and discharge them, of which power being deprived by her death, and in recognition of such his right at common law to all her personal estate, and to enable him to reduce into possession and to recover such of her choses in action as had not been reduced into possession, released or discharged during the coverture, and because there was no one else having any claim in equal degree with him, the exclusive right to have administration granted was held to be vested in him by the statute 31 Edw. 3 c. 11, so that it is more correct to say that it was rather in virtue of his recognised right to beneficial interest as husband in his wife's estate that he became entitled to have administration granted to him in order to enable him to reduce such beneficial interest into possession, than to say that he became entitled to the beneficial interest in virtue of the letters of administration, although such letters constituted the mode recognised by law as necessary to enable him to reduce such interest into possession after the death of his wife. So, likewise, the widow and next of kin of an intestate under 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, which act had no application whatever to the case of a wife dying intestate leaving a husband her surviving, in virtue of their recognised beneficial interest in the intestate's estate, and as being the person whom the law deemed that the intestate would himself have preferred if he had made a will, were recognised as being and were held to be the persons to whom the administration of the intestate should be granted, upon the principle that where the estate should go there the administration should go; and further, it was because of the imperfection of 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, in not providing for distribution of the surplus of the intestate's estate after payment of his debts among his widow and next of kin, and because of the injustice and mischief which was occasioned by reason of the courts of common law prohibiting the ecclesiastical courts interfering to compel such distribution even among the next of kin of equal degree, while the common law courts were themselves unable to make any distribution, that the statute of distributions 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 was passed; and finally, in the case of a wife dying intestate leaving a husband her surviving, there being no person who was deemed in law to have any claim upon her personal estate in equal degree with him, that case did not at all come within the range of the injustice and mischief to remedy which the statute of distributions was passed.\nWe have already seen that the case of a husband surviving his intestate wife was held not to be within, or affected by, 21 Hen. 8 c. 5. Indeed the language of this latter act seems to place this beyond all doubt wherein it enacts that: In case any person dies intestate the ordinary shall grant the administration of the goods of the person deceased to the widow of the same person deceased or to the next of his kin or to both.\nThis provision seems to have been enacted merely for the purpose of enabling a widow to have an interest in the estate of her intestate husband, which otherwise she would not have had, without in any manner interfering with the right of a husband to administer to the estate of his intestate wife, which the courts held to have been absolutely vested in him by 31 Edw. 3 c. 11. Now, a perusal of 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 discloses a similarity of expression naturally to be expected in an act intended to be passed for the purpose of amending the provisions of 21 Hen. 8 c. 5., and of remedying the injustice and mischief occasioned to the next of kin of the intestate in equal degree with the administrator appointed under that act by reason of the action of the common law courts interfering to prohibit the ecclesiastical courts to compel a distribution of surplus while themselves unable to supply a remedy.\nIn 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, the provision is:\u2014\nIn case any person dies intestate, or that the executor named in any testament refuse to prove the said testament, then the ordinary, or other person or persons having authority to take probate of testaments as above is said, shall grant the administration of the goods of the testator or person deceased to the widow of the same person deceased or the next of his kin, or to both, as by the discretion of the same ordinary shall be thought good, taking surety of him or them to whom shall be made such commission for the true administration of the goods, chattels and debts which he or they shall be so authorised to administer, and in case where divers persons claim the administration as next of kin, which be in equal degree of kindred to the testator or person deceased, and where any person only desireth the administration as next of kin, where, indeed, divers persons be in equality of kindred, as is aforesaid, that in every such case the ordinary to be at his election and liberty to accept any one or more making the request where divers do require the administration.\nAnd in 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 the provision is: And be it enacted that all ordinaries, and every other person who by this Act is enabled to make distribution of the surplusage of the estate of any person dying intestate, shall distribute the whole surplusage of such estates in manner and form following, that is to say, one third of the said surplus to the wife of the intestate, and all the residue by equal portions to and amongst the children of such person dying intestate and such persons as legally represent such children in case any of the said children be then dead other than such child or children, not being heir at law, who shall have any estate by the settlement of the intestate, or shall be advanced by the intestate in his life time by portion or portions equal to the share which by such distribution shall be allotted to the other children to whom such distribution is to be made, * * * and in case there be no children nor any legal representatives of them then one moiety of the said estate to be allotted to the wife of the intestate, the residue of the said estate to be distributed equally to every of the next of kindred of the intestate who are in equal degree and those who legally represent them.\nNow, bearing in mind that the husband, by administration granted to him of the personal estate of his intestate wife, in effect obtained merely the power to recover and to reduce into possession after the death of his wife the debts and choses in action belonging to his wife over which during the coverture he had had by the common law the absolute right, to recover them for his own benefit, and power to relinquish, release and discharge them, and that the law regarded him absolutely entitled to such administration because of his relationship of husband of the deceased intestate upon, and in recognition of, the principles of the common law, and bearing in mind, also, that in his case the law held that there was not, nor could be, any person who could be said to have any claim in equal degree with him, it must, I think, be admitted that the 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 could not with propriety be held to have any application to the case of a wife dying intestate, leaving a husband her surviving, any more than 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, which, as we have seen, was always held to have had no application to such a case. However, it does appear that about five years after the passing of 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 a claim similar to that made in the present case was made in Wilson v. Drake[37], by the brother of a woman who had died intestate leaving her husband her surviving who had obtained letters of administration to her estate. What judgment was given in that case does not appear. If the judgment had been in accordance with the judgment of the courts in relation to 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, namely, that 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 did not apply to the case of femes covertes dying intestate any more than did 21 Hen. 8 c. 5, such judgment would have been, in my opinion, as I have already pointed out, justified by the judgments of the courts as to the right in which the husband was held to be exclusively entitled, under 31 Edw. 3 c. 11, to administration of his deceased intestate wife's estate. That the Parliament which passed the statute of distributions never intended that it should apply to such a case is apparent from the 25th sec. of the statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 2 c. 3, which clause would seem to have been introduced for the purpose of preventing the courts falling into, what Parliament plainly considered would be, the error of holding that the statute of distribution did operate upon a husband administrator of his deceased wife's estate, and did compel him to distribute such estate or any surplus thereof after payment of debts to and among the next of kin of the wife. The clause enacts that:\u2014\nFor the explaining an act of this present Parliament entituled \"an act for the better settling of intestates' estates\" be it declared that neither the said act nor anything therein contained shall be construed to extend to the estates of Femmes Covertes that shall die intestate but their husbands may demand and have administration of their rights and credits and other personal estates, and recover and enjoy the same as they might have done before the passing of the said act.\nThat is to say, entitled to administration under 31 Edw. 3 c. 11 as husband, and to appropriate the property to his own exclusive use independently of any statute in virtue of his common law right, as it is put by Lord Justice Turner in Milne v. Gilbert[38], and by a right paramount to the statute as put by Lord Cranworth in the same case. It is true that there are expressions in the judgment of Lord Justice Knight Bruce in that case to the effect that the 25th sec. of the Statute of Frauds operated\nto give to the husband or to restore to him by way of declaratory enactment the right which he would have had if the statute 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 had not been passed\nseemingly, thereby, implying that this latter statute did take from the husband the right to his deceased wife's estate which he previously had; but this was not necessary to the determination of the case before him which was not whether the statute had taken anything from the husband but whether it had given anything to him which he could claim under it. Lord Justice Turner in his judgment says:\nThe statute of distributions particularly excludes the idea of the husband taking under it.\nAnd referring to the 25th sec. of the Statute of Frauds he expresses his opinion that it was passed to remove any difficulty which might arise upon the question whether that statute had or had not \"taken away the common law right of the husband\" Lord Cranworth makes use of expressions to the like effect. It is observable, however, that the way in which the Parliament which had passed the act disposed of the suggested difficulty and prevented the possibility of its arising was, not by enacting that something which the statute 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10 had taken from the husband should be restored to him, but by enacting and declaring that nothing contained in the act should be construed to extend to the estates of femes covertes dying intestate.\nThe act 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10, as explained by the 25 sec. of the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 2, c. 3, was made perpetual by 1 James 2 c. 17, and that act constituted the law of England upon the subject when the country now constituting the Province of New Brunswick became a British possession, and was consequently the law in force in the Province of New Brunswick when that province was first constituted. The first General Assembly of the Province in 1786, passed the Provincial Statute 26 Geo. 3 c. 11, entituled:\nAn act relating to wills, legacies, executors and administrators, and for the settlement and distribution of the estates of intestates.\nThe 14 and 15 sections of this act, which constitute the portion of the act which relates to the distribution of the estates of intestates, are an almost verbatim transcript of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10. Now it may, I think, be laid down as an invariable course of construction of a Provincial statute, so taken verbatim from an act of the Imperial Parliament, that the Provincial courts should construe the Provincial act in accordance with the construction put upon the Imperial statute, either by the Imperial courts of justice or a fortiori by another Imperial statute passed for the purpose of construing and explaining the act under consideration; hence it will follow as a necessary consequence that if the 14 and 15 sections of the statute 26 Geo. 3 c. 11 of the General Assembly of the Province of New Brunswick had stood alone they must have received the construction which by the 25 sec. of the Statute of Frauds was by the Imperial Parliament declared to be the true intent and meaning of 22 & 23 Car. 2 c. 10. The General Assembly of the province, however, in the 17 sec. of the said act 26 Geo. 3 c. 11, enacted that: Nothing in this act contained shall be construed to extend to the estate of femes covertes who shall die intestate, but that their husbands may demand and have administration of their rights, credits and other personal estates, and recover and enjoy the same as they might have done heretofore\nthus using the language of the 25th sec. of the Statute of Frauds ex majore cauiel\u00e2, but quite unnecessarily, in my opinion, for the reason just given; when, therefore, the General Assembly of the Province, in 1854, passed the Act entituled:\u2014\"An Act to revise and consolidate the Public Statutes of New Brunswick,\" and in the 111th ch. of that act re-enacted the provisions of the 14th and 15th secs. of 26 Geo. 3 c. 11, with some trifling immaterial alterations, but omitted wholly the 17 th section of that act, no alteration was thereby made in the construction to be put upon the said chapter 111, but that chapter must have received the same construction as had been the true construction of 26 Geo. 3 c. 11, which, as I have said, even without the 17th section thereof, must have been the construction put upon the Imperial statute 22 and 23 Oar. 2 c. 10, by the 25th sec. of the Statute of Frauds. Now, the chap. 111 of the statutes of 1854 is consolidated in the Consolidated Statutes of New Brunswick as ch. 78, and the provisions of these chapters, in so far as the present question is concerned, are identical. So, likewise, ch. 114 of the statute of 1854 is now consolidated in the Consolidated Statutes of 1876 as ch. 72, which relates to the property of married women in the Province of New Brunswick, and the sole remaining question is whether the provisions of these chapters, 114 or 72, had or have the effect of divesting the husband of all beneficial interest in the personal property and choses in action whereof his wife died possessed or entitled to and intestate, such personal property in the present case consisting of bonds, mortgages, promissory notes, certificates of shares in joint stock companies, and money in bank, standing in the name of the wife. There is so little difference in the language of ch. 114 of the statute of 1854, and ch. 72 of the Consolidated Statutes of 1876, and in fact none so far as affects the question under consideration, that it will be necessary to refer only to the latter chapter, and to the 1st section thereof, for the subsequent sections relate only to the cases of \"desertion or abandonment of any married woman by her husband, or of her living separate and apart from her husband,\" in which case the married woman's interest in and the power over her real and personal property is different from her interest in and power over such property while she lives with her husband.\nNow, the 1st sec. of ch. 72 enacts that:\nThe real and personal property belonging to a woman before or accruing after marriage, except such as may be received from her husband while married, shall vest in her and be owned by her as her separate property and shall be exempt from seizure or responsibility in any way for the debts or liabilities of her husband, and shall not be conveyed, encumbered or disposed of during the time she lives with her husband, without her consent, testified, if real property, by her being a party to the instrument conveying, encumbering or disposing of the same duly acknowledged as provided by the laws for regulating the acknowledgments of married women; and after her abandonment or desertion by her husband, or upon her being compelled to support herself or upon her being separate and apart from her husband, unlawfully and of her own accord, although neither deserted nor abandoned by him, then her real and personal property may be disposed of as provided for in this chapter as if she were a femme sole, but her separate property shall be liable for her own debts contracted before marriage, and for judgments recovered against her husband for her wrongs.\nThis section, it will be observed, does not say that a married woman living with her husband shall hold her real and personal property in the same manner and with the same power of disposition over it as if she were a femme sole; while dealing solely with her right to and interest in her property while living with her husband it declares that she shall hold it as her separate property exempt from all liability for her husband's debts and not capable of being conveyed, encumbered or disposed of without her consent, such consent in the case of realty to be testified by a deed executed by her jointly with her husband, and duly acknowledged by her as provided by law for regulating the acknowledgments of married women, that is to say, apart from her husband, and to have been executed by her freely and without compulsion from her husband, but how her consent is to be testified in the case of personalty the section does not say. By this section she holds her property, while living with her husband, as settled to her sole and separate use, but the section says nothing as to its devolution in case she should die without making a will, which no doubt she might have done of property so settled. Upon her death therefore, intestate, the right of the husband to her personal property, which was suspended only during the coverture, revived; this was decided by Sir John Leach, Master of the Rolls, in 1833 in Proudley v. Fielder[39]. There monies were settled to the sole and separate use of a married woman as if she were sole and unmarried.\nThis expression \"said the Master of the Rolls,\" has no reference to the devolution of the property after her death; she is to retain the same absolute enjoyment of the monies, and is to have the same power of disposition over them as if she were sole and unmarried; but there is not one word here to vest the property after her death in the next of kin, or to defeat the right which her surviving husband is entitled to acquire as her administrator.\nIn Cooper v. Macdonald[40] Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, says in relation to the separate estate of a married woman and the interest of the husband therein upon her dying intestate: The separate use is exhausted when the wife has died without making a disposition. She enjoyed the income during her life, and she has not thought fit to exercise that which was an incident of her separate estate, the right of disposing of her property. Why should equity interfere further with the devolution of the estate, &c.\nAnd again:\nWhere she (the wife) dies without making any disposition (of her separate estate) the rights of the husband and the rights of the heir are equally unaffected and equity ought to follow the law.\nAnd in Stanton v. Lambert[41] it was held that the Married Woman's Property Act, 1882, had not altered the devolution of the undisposed of separate property of a married woman; that upon her death without disposing of the separate personalty the quality of separate property ceases and the right of the husband to such undisposed of personalty accrues as if the separate use had never existed. Now this Imperial statute of 1882, 45 & 46 Vic. ch. 75, vested her property in a married woman much more absolutely than does the New Brunswick statute. By the Imperial statute it is enacted that she shall be capable of acquiring, holding and disposing by will or otherwise of any real or personal property as her separate property as if she were a femme sole without the intervention of a justice; that she shall be capable of entering into any contract and of making herself liable in respect of, and to the extent of, her separate property, and of suing and being sued in contract or tort or otherwise, as if she were a femme sole, and her husband need not be joined with her either as plaintiff or defendant. She is enabled to carry on trade in her own behalf separate from her husband, and in respect of her separate property is made subject to the bankrupt laws in the same way as if she were a femme sole; she is declared to be entitled to have and to hold as her separate property, and to dispose of by will or otherwise, all real and personal property which shall belong to her at the time of marriage or shall be acquired by, or devolve upon her, after marriage, including any wages, earnings, money and property gained or acquired by her in any employment, trade or occupation in which she is engaged or which she carries on separately from her husband or by the exercise of any literary, artistic or scientific skill; in fact she is almost in every respect invested during the coverture with all the rights and privileges of a femme sole and subject to all the liabilities of one to the extent of her separate property, yet if she dies without having made any disposition of her separate personalty the right of her husband upon her death revives and becomes as to such undisposed of personalty as if the separate use had never existed.\nIf the New Brunswick legislature had intended to divest the husband of the right devolving upon him by his surviving his wife who died intestate we should naturally expect to find language used expressing the intention of the legislature similar to that used in the 25th section of the Imperial statute 20 & 21 Vic. ch. 85 or in the 23rd section of ch. 132 of the Revised Statute of Ontario of 1887. In the absence of the expression by the legislature of any such intention we must hold the respondent in the present case to be entitled beneficially to the personal estate of his intestate wife and the appeal in this case must, therefore, be dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I cannot say that the argument for the appellant, though learned and ingenious, created any doubt in my mind of the correctness of the decision of the court below. I so fully agree with the views of the general law and the construction of the provincial statutes expressed in the judgment of the Chief Justice of New Brunswick, as well as in those of Mr. Justice Tuck and Mr. Justice Fraser, and those judgments deal so exhaustively with the subject of the controversy, that I do not think I can usefully add anything to what those learned judges have said. I should not have considered that the right of a husband to the personal property of his wife who dies intestate, whether property in possession or in action, was open to serious question, even though declared in the terms of the New Brunswick statute C. S. N. B. ch. 72 to be the wife's separate property, were it not that a different view has been taken by the learned judge who dissented in the court below. I do not propose to enter upon a discussion of the opinions which he ably supports in his judgment. To do so would be, in effect, to repeat the arguments on which the majority of the judges founded their opinions and would serve no useful purpose. I could not further elucidate the question on which the argument has turned, and on both sides of which the language of great judges has been appealed to, viz., whether the right of the husband, which is constantly called the jus mariti, is a common law consequence of the marriage, or a right flowing from the statute 31 Edw. III under which the courts held the husband entitled to administration of the estate of his wife who died intestate. The latter position is taken and is much relied on by Mr. Justice Palmer in his dissenting judgment. He more than once speaks of the title of the husband to his wife's choses in action as acquired only as her administrator. Doubtless that was so at law. Choses in action, not being assignable at law, vested in the personal representative. But if administration were granted to one who was not the husband of the intestate he held in equity as trustee for the husband or for the personal representative of the husband. This was established by such cases as Humphrey v. Bullen[42], and Elliot v. Collier[43], and Mr. Justice Stirling in his instructive judgment in re Lambert's Estate[44] expressed the opinion that when a married woman made a will dealing with her separate estate, and probate was granted in a general and not limited form, the executor would be trustee for the husband of any separate property not effectually disposed of.\nIn Plait v. McDougall[45] a married woman entitled to a fund expectant on the death of her mother died in her mother's lifetime. Her husband survived her and died without having taken administration to her. It was held that his executors, and not the representatives of his wife, were entitled to the fund. The same point was decided in Proudley v. Fielder[46].\nIn Ripley v. Woods[47] the incipient right of the husband was held to pass to his assignees in bankruptcy. So held also in Harper v. Ravenhill[48].\nThe principle of these decisions does not seem easily reconcilable with the opinion that the husband's right arises merely or mainly from his appointment as administrator under the statute of Edward III., and reasoning based upon that opinion would therefore be apt to lead to a fallacious conclusion. Another point in which I cannot follow the learned judge is in the distinction he makes between separate property of a married woman, which is the expression used in the New Brunswick statute, and property held to her separate use. I understand both expressions to mean the same thing. We have instances of the three forms of expression, \"separate use,\" \"separate estate\" and \"separate property,\" being used interchangeably in the language of Mr. Justice Stirling in the case so often referred to in this discussion, re Lambert's Estate[49] and in language there quoted from a judgment of Sir Gr. Jessell in Cooper v. McDonald[50].\nI am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: W. W. Wells.\nSolicitor for respondent: Wm.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, MANITOBA.\nElection Petition\u2014Preliminary objections\u2014R. S. C. ch. 9, s. 63\u2014English general rules\u2014Copy of petition\u2014R.S.C. ch. 9, s. 9 (h)\u2014Description and occupation of petitioner.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the judges of the court in Manitoba not having made rules for the practice and procedure in controverted elections the English rules of Michaelmas Term, 1868, were in force, (R.S.C. ch. 9, s. 63), and that under rule one of said English rules the petitioner, when filing an election petition, is bound to leave a copy with the clerk of the court to be sent to the returning officer, and that his failure to do so is the subject of a substantial preliminary objection and fatal to the petition. Strong and Gwynne JJ. dissenting.\nHeld further, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the omission to set out in the petition the residence, address and occupation of the petitioner is a mere objection to the form which can be remedied by amendment, and is therefore not fatal.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Manitoba dismissing with costs, upon certain preliminary objections presented by the respondent, the petition presented to that court by the appellant under \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act,\" complaining, upon the grounds therein set out, of the undue election of the respondent as member of the House of Commons for the electoral district of Lisgar.\nThe court of Queen's Bench upheld the following objections, numbers two (2) and five (5):\nObjection 2.\u2014The name, residence, address and occupation of the petitioner are not set out in the said petition nor is any information or means given of identifying him, whereby the respondent is prevented from discovering whether there are any objections to the said petitioner.\nObjection 5.\u2014At the time of the presentation of the said petition at the office of the clerk of the court or prothonotary the petitioner did not leave a copy of the said petition with the said clerk or prothonotary for him to send to the returning officer of the said electoral district for publication, nor was any provision made for sending such copy to the said returning officer, nor did the petitioner furnish or pay to the said clerk of the court or prothonotary, or the returning officer, the costs, expenses and charges necessary for the publication of the said petition, pursuant to the provisions of the said act, and the rules and practice relating to the trial of election petitions, by reason whereof no copy of said petition was sent by said prothonotary to the said returning officer for publication as aforesaid, and the same was not published by said returning officer in the said electoral district as provided by the said act.\nThe petition was styled as follows:\u2014\n\"PETITION IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH.\n\"THE DOMINION CONTROVERTED ELECTIONS ACT.\n\"In the matter of the election for the Electoral District of Lisgar for a member of the House of Commons, held on the twenty-sixth day of February, A.D. 1891, and the fifth day of March, A.D. 1891.\n\"Between Thomas Collins, petitioner, and Arthur Wellington Ross, respondent.\n\"To the Honourable the Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench for the province of Manitoba:\n\"The humble petition of the above-named petitioner showeth as follows:\u2014\n\"1. An election for a member of the House of Commons for the Electoral District of Lisgar, in the Province of Manitoba, was held on the twenty-sixth day of February and the fifth day of March last past.\n\"2. Your petitioner had a right to vote at the said election, &c.\"\nMartin for appellant.\nThe second objection is that the name, residence, address and occupation of the petitioner are not set out in the petition, and the court proceeded largely upon this objection in making the order complained of.\nThe name of the petitioner, Thomas Collins, is given, and I contend that his residence, address and occupation need not be stated in the petition, either under the Controverted Elections Act, secs. 5 and 9, or under the English rules of 1868 (which, under section 63 of the act, are in force to a certain extent in Manitoba, no general rules having been promulgated by the Court of Queen's Bench under section 62). The form given in rule 5 indicates that the residence, though not the occupation, should be given, although rule 2 does not require that the residence should be given. At the most the omission to insert the residence of the petitioner is merely a clerical error, and application having been made at the hearing before the court below for leave to insert it, an amendment should have been allowed. The appellant further submits that the onus being upon the respondent to establish this preliminary objection, he should have filed material impeaching or throwing doubts upon the status or identity of the petitioner: The Megantic Case[1]; The Montmagny Case[2].\nIn any event the objection does not go to the substance of the petition, but is purely formal and should not prevail. The English rule, No. 60, says: \"No proceedings shall be defeated by any formal objection.\" The appellant refers also to sub-section 44 of section 7 of the Interpretation Act. Maxwell on Statutes[3]. See also portion of the judgment of Lord Coleridge C.J. in Woodward v. Sarsons[4], a decision under the Ballot Act; Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner[5]; and Re Lincoln Election[6].\nThe judgment of Baron Martin in The Shrewsbury Petition, Young v. Figgins[7], is a case very similar to the present.\nThe fifth objection, that at the time of the presentation of the petition the petitioner did not leave a copy of the petition with the clerk to be forwarded to the returning officer for publication in the electoral district, was a principal ground upon which the court below proceeded in dismissing the petition.\nIn answer to this objection I contend that this is not a preliminary objection which can be taken under the provisions of section 12 of the act. It is not a preliminary objection or ground of insufficiency against the petition or petitioner or against any further proceeding on the petition. The statutory provision is in the nature of a collateral proceeding intended, not for the benefit or to protect either the petitioner or the respondent, but to give the electors of the electoral division notice that a petition is pending and with the object of thereby preventing any collusive withdrawal or settlement of the petition. Such being the obvious intention of the provision the court, by giving force to this objection, has actually consummated the very result which the legislature intended to prevent.\nThe provision of the rule, being remedial in its nature and in the public interest, is not imperative but directory merely, and the omission to comply with it is not fatal to the petition. Such omission could be equitably remedied by granting the petitioner an extension of time, or by staying proceedings on the petition unless the provision of the rule had been complied with.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Haggart for respondent. With respect to objection two the learned counsel cited and relied on the Youghal case[8]; The Megantic case[9]; Lewis' Equity Drafting[10]; Story's Equity Pleading[11]; Hunter v. Mountjoy[12]; Campbell v. Andrews[13]; and as to objection five, cited Cunningham on Elections[14]; Dom. Con. Elections Act[15]; Maxwell on Stats.[16]; Noseworthy v. Buckland in the Moor[17]; Wheeler v. Gibbs[18]; Hardcastle on Stat. Law[19]; Liverpool Bank v. Turner[20]; Grace v. Clinch[21]; Tipperary case[22]; Knaresborough case[23]; Boston case[24]; Re South Renfrew[25]; Leigh & LeMarchant on Elections[26]; Hardcastle on Elections[27], and English rules L and LX made under The Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the second preliminary objection, viz., that the name, residence, address and occupation of the petitioner are not set out in the petition, is a purely formal one, and an amendment which appears to have been applied for should have been allowed. I cannot conceive that the sitting member could be in any way injured by the want of the \"residence, address and occupation\" of the petitioner, because he could have applied to a judge to stay proceedings till the same were furnished, or he could have raised an issue as to petitioner's right to vote at the election, as alleged by him in his petition, when in my opinion the burthen of establishing this status was on the petitioner, and failing to comply with which his petition would be dismissed.\nAs to the 5th objection which the court below sustained, stated shortly, it is, that no copy of the petition for transmission to the returning officer or cost of transmission, &c., was furnished by the petitioner to the prothonotary of the court when the petition was presented, by reason whereof no copy of said petition was sent by said prothonotary to said returning officer for publication, nor was same published by the said returning officer in the said electoral district as provided by the Act.\nBy section 9 (h) of the Controverted Elections Act it is provided that on the presentation of the petition the clerk of the court shall send a copy thereof by mail to the returning officer of the electoral district to which the petition relates, who shall forthwith publish the same in such electoral district. The judges of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba have made no rules under the 63rd section of the Act, which declares that in such a case:\nUntil rules of court have been made by the judges of the several courts in each province in pursuance of this act, and so far as such rules do not extend, the principles, practice and rules, on which election petitions touching the election of members of the House of Commons in England were, on the twenty-sixth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, dealt with, shall be observed so far as consistently with this act they can be observed by the said courts and the judges thereof.\nThe English rules thus in force in Manitoba require the petitioner when filing the petition to leave with the clerk a copy of the petition to be sent to the returning officer. There was no compliance with this rule and no copy was ever sent to the returning officer. It appears to me this was by no means a mere formal proceeding, but an essential part of the presentation or filing of the petition, and unless the statute and rule were duly complied with there was no proper or due presentation or filing of the petition, and therefore the objection was a substantial objection as held by the court below.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I think that in dealing with election cases it should be a golden rule that if there is any possible way of avoiding giving effect to technical preliminary objections and thus preventing the trial on the merits we should act upon it. As regards objections two and five, I cannot say they are fatal; objection two might have been cured by amendment; and a stay of proceedings until compliance with the practice would have been sufficient as regards the fifth. I am of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the petitioner should be at liberty to amend his proceedings.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014If I had been sitting in the court of first instance I should probably have said that the 5th objection should not prevail, and would have given time to prove the status, but the court below having maintained it, I do not think we should interfere.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014None of the objections in the present case are, in my opinion, good preliminary objections within the meaning of that term as used in the statute. The statute in effect incorporates the rules of court in England under the Act of 1868 in matters not provided for by the statute, and where no rules are made by the court having jurisdiction in election petitions in the province where they are filed. In this case the court of Manitoba has made no rules, and the English rules therefore apply and become incorporated with the statute as affects election petitions in the Province of Manitoba.\nOne of these rules provides that \"no proceedings under the Parliamentary Elections Act shall be defeated by any formal objection.\" Now, the omission to set out the name, residence, address and occupation of a petitioner in the body of a petition, the name of the petitioner appearing as it does here in the heading of the petition, thus:\u2014Thomas Collins, petitioner, v. Arthur Wellington Ross, respondent\u2014is, in my opinion, a mere formal objection; and any benefit to the respondent to accrue, or prejudice to be avoided by any of the omissions being supplied could be obtained by application to the court or a judge, as in an ordinary suit.\nSo, likewise, the not leaving a copy of the petition with the clerk of the court where the petition is filed, on the presentation of the petition, is a merely formal objection, and indeed the omission does not seem to work any peculiar prejudice to the respondent in any manner; and, if it did, that prejudice could be obviated by application to the court or a judge. The leaving a copy with the clerk does not so form part of the presentation of the petition that the omission to leave it would make void the filing of the petition. It is a proceeding wholly collateral to the petition and affords no reason why the respondent should not be required to answer the petition. In short, all the objections relied upon, so far as they are objections at all, are, in my opinion, merely formal and cannot therefore annul the petition. They are not, in my opinion, good preliminary objections, which term as used in the statute is, I think, applicable only to substantial objections either to the qualification of the petitioner or to the substance of the petition, or to some substantial reason why the matter of the petition should not be proceeded with.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal, and I do so with less regret than I should probably have felt if it were not apparent that the omissions that have proved fatal to the petition have arisen from want of careful attention to the 63rd section of the Controverted Elections Act, which, in the absence of rules made by the provincial court under section 62, gives the force of law in Manitoba to the English General Rules of Michaelmas Term, 1868. The first of those rules requires that when the petition is presented a copy of it shall be left to be sent to the returning officer under the provision which in our Act is subsection (h) of section 9.\nI think the failure to leave the required copy, in consequence of which no copy was sent to the returning officer, is properly made the subject of a prelimiinary objection, and has been properly held to be fatal to the further proceeding upon the petition.\nTwo things are to be done together, as directed by rule I. One is the presentation of the petition by delivering it to the officer, and the other is the leaving with the same officer the copy for him to send to the returning officer. If the former act were omitted no one would contend that the omission was not fatal notwithstanding that a copy and notices had been served on the respondent, or contend that it could be cured by delivering the petition nunc pro tunc. The second requirement of the rule may seem less fundamental than the first, but it is something prescribed to be done by the petitioner at the institution of the proceedings, and it is not easy to find safe ground for holding one requirement to be less imperative than the other.\nWe must hold the petitioner to the duty cast upon him by the law, without speculating, as we have been invited to do, on the comparative importance to him or to the respondent of his doing what the rule directs, in order that the petition may be promptly published by the returning officer.\nThe other objection given effect to in the court below, viz., the omission to state in the petition the petitioner's residence, might have been rectified by the judge without prejudice to either side. That is one test of an objection falling within the class of formal objections which by rule LX are not to defeat a proceeding under the act. See the Shrewsbury case[28], Cor. Martin B.; Aldridge v. Hurst[29], per Grove J. If the respondent was really ignorant of the matter he could have been given time to make enquiries.\nIf the omission of any description of the petitioner, by residence or otherwise, were a matter of substance and not of form, and must be held fatal to the petition, the rule would have to be applied in every case, even though it should appear, or be admitted, that the respondent was well acquainted with the petitioner and had seen him sign and present the petition. There is no indication in the statute or the rules that a practice so rigid and so unlike that which prevails in ordinary litigation is contemplated.\nIt is on the first mentioned objection that I think the decision should be sustained, and the appeal dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

The High Court of Justice in England made an order restraining the plaintiffs from proceeding with their action and a like order was made by a Divisional Court Judge in Ontario perpetually restraining plaintiffs from proceeding but reserving liberty to apply. This latter order was affirmed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal, and plaintiffs sought an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, that the judgment from which the appeal was sought was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld, per Patterson J., that if it were a final judgment the order the plaintiffs wished to get rid of was made in the exercise of judicial discretion as to which sec. 27 of the Supreme Court Act does not allow an appeal.\nMOTION to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] by which an order of Rose J. staying proceedings in the cause was upheld.\nThe facts material to the motion are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson. The judgment of Rose J. on the application for the order is reported in the Ontario Practice reports[3].\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C. for the motion, cited Phosphate Sewage Co. v. Molleson[4]; Virtue v. Hayes[5]; Ontario & Quebec Railway Co. v. Marcheterre[6]; McKinnon v. Kerouack[7].\nRobinson Q.C. and Gormully Q.C. contra referred to McHenry v. Lewis[8]; Barrett v. Day[9]; Lawrance v. Norreys[10].\nSir W.J. Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier and Gwynne JJ., were of opinion that the judgment from which the appeal was sought was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act, and that the appeal should be quashed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Two actions, one commenced on the 15th of March, 1887, and the other on the 12th of March, 1888, on a number of bills of exchange, &c.\nThe defendants are bankrupts. A receiving order was made in their bankruptcy in England on the 15th of March, 1887, the same date as the writ in the first action, and a year before the issue of the writ in the second.\nThe plaintiff bank is also being wound up under the Canadian Winding-up Act, and these actions are brought by the liquidators by order of the court.\nOn the 17th of September, 1887, the liquidators filed in the English Bankruptcy Court a claim for the same debts for which these actions are brought.\nOrders were made in the English court restraining the prosecution of these actions on the third of March, 1888, in the first action, and on the 29th of May, 1888, in the other.\nOn motion of the defendants orders have been made in these actions staying proceedings for ever, but reserving leave to apply.\nThe plaintiffs desire to appeal from those orders, and the question of our jurisdiction to hear the appeal depends on the view proper to be taken of the character of the orders.\nAre they final judgments within the meaning of that term as used in the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act[11], in sections 24 and 28?\nIf they are final judgments an appeal will lie unless forbidden by section 27 which enacts that\nNo appeal shall lie from any order made in any action, suit, cause, matter, or other judicial proceeding made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court or judge making the same; but this exception shall not include decrees and decretal orders in actions, suits, causes, matters or other judicial proceedings in equity, or in actions, suits, causes, matters or other judicial proceedings in the nature of suits or proceedings in equity instituted in any superior court.\nThe expression\n\u201cFinal judgment\u201d means any judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded[12].\nThe case of Harley v. Greenwood[13] was decided in 1821 under the act 49 Geo. III c. 121, which enacted[14]\nThat it shall not be lawful for any creditor who has brought any action against the bankrupt in respect of any demand which arose prior to the bankruptcy, or which might have been proved as a debt under the commission, to prove a debt under such commission, &c., without relinquishing such action,\u201d\nAnd\nThat the proving or claiming a debt under such commission shall be deemed an election by the creditor to take the benefit of the commission with respect to the debt so proved or claimed.\nIt was shown by Bayley J., who delivered the judgment of the court, that the commencement of an action in one court does not destroy the right of the party to commence an action for the same debt in another court; that while the pendency of another action might be pleaded in abatement, it could not be pleaded in bar; and that to restrain a creditor from commencing an action until the commission was superseded might be very injurious to him, perhaps leading to his debt being barred in the interim by the statute of limitations; and it was held that the words of the statute would be satisfied and a very beneficial remedy given to the creditor by holding that when a creditor has proved his debt and afterwards brings an action the bankrupt may, under the act, apply to the Chancellor to expunge the debt, or to the court in which the action is brought to stay the proceedings.\nNow we need not follow the process of evolution by which, three quarters of a century after the passing of the act 49 George III, the law took the slightly different form in the English Bankruptcy Act, 1883, sections 9 and 10.\nThat inquiry, and the effect upon us in this country of the English statute, and the question of election which was dealt with in terms by the act from which I have quoted, would doubtless be proper topics for discussion if we were hearing the appeal. I cite the case of Harley v. Greenwood[15]. for the assistance it gives in dealing with the two points on which our decision has at present to turn. It supports the view that this order is not a final judgment, inasmuch as it suspends only and does not put an end to or finally determine and conclude the action, and it also supports the contention that the order is made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court or the judge who made the order. Whatever may be the grounds on which the orders are to be considered as having been made; whether on the idea that the plaintiffs elected to proceed in the bankruptcy court; or on the ground that our courts are required by the effect of the English statute to act as auxiliary to the court of bankruptcy; or that on some considerations of comity it is proper to do so, the order must, as I apprehend, be regarded as an exercise of discretion. The propriety of what was done, in view of all the considerations to be taken account of, is quite a different thing. That question has been debated at least three times before the courts below, and the plaintiff may have no just cause to repine if the law which creates and limits our jurisdiction does not afford him an opportunity to debate it again.\nI agree that we must quash the appeal.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gormully & Sinclair.\nSolicitor for respondents: A.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Court of Review ([2]).\nThe following special case was agreed upon for the decision of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nOn the 13th February, 1882, Alphonse Marcotte of the city of Montreal merchant being insolvent, made an assignment of his estate, property and effects to the respondent, one of his creditors, for the benefit of the whole of his creditors\nOn the 22nd of April, 1882, appellants, creditors of said Marcotte, filed their claim duly attested upon oath for an amount of $19,139.83 in the hands of the respondent, and the latter after having realized portion of Marcottes property assigned as above prepared and advertised a dividend sheet at the rate of 12\u00bd cents in the dollar, payable on the 13th July following.\nAppellants were collocated on said dividend sheet for a sum of $2,392.99, but when they demanded payment of the same on the 13th of July, 1882, the payment thereof was refused. Hence the present action by appellants against respondent demanding payment of said sum of $2,392.49.\nTo this action respondent pleaded that appellants had no claim against Marcotte; that before his insolvency Marcotte had transferred to appellants promissory notes and merchandise for a large amount; and that, in crediting Marcotte with the sums paid out of the promissory notes and merchandise transferred as above and of the amounts realized therefrom, appellants claim was paid in full.\nBy their answer to this plea appellants admitted having realized subsequently to the filing of their claim, out of the promissory notes and merchandise to them transferred as collateral security by Marcotte, certain sums of money very much inferior to the amount of their claim, but they claimed the right to rank for the original amount of their claim until paid in full\nAppelants made advances to Marcotte up to the amount of their claim on his promissory note for a like amount taking as further security a transfer from Marcotte of the notes and goods hereinafter mentioned or referred to.\nThe collateral securities so transferred by Marcotte to appellants, consisted of promissory notes endorsed by Marcotte and of a certain quantity of merchandise, the amount of said promissory notes being $23,436.00 signed almost all of them by one Moodie, to the order of Marcotte and endorsed by him.\nMoodie had also become an insolvent and appellants realized out of his estate in virtue of said promissory notes $9,616.24; of which $8,363.76 was received in May 1882, subsequent to the filing of their claim but previous to the 13th July. 1882, when the dividend was made payable, $911.57 in May, June and July 1882; and $248.91 in April, 1883.\nAppellants also realized out of the goods and merchandise transferred to them by Marcotte a further sum of $490.00, making with that of $9,676.24 a total sum of $10,166.24.\nThe parties are agreed to submit to this honorable court for its decision as they have done in the court below, the following question, to wit:\n\"Are appellants entitled to a dividend on the full amount of their claim as filed to wit on $19,139.83, or only on the balance of said claim after deduction in whole or in part of the $10,166.24 by them realized out of said promissory notes and goods and merchandise.\"\nIn the Supreme Court of Canada the case was first argued on the 13th May, 1890, the Honourable Mr. Justice Taschereau being absent, but by order of the court the case was set down for a rehearing before the full court at the February sessions 1891.\nBe\u00efque Q.

Marcad\u00e9 ([7]) and Daniel on negotiable instruments ([8]); and on the 3rd point: Is the bearer of a joint and several obligation, or the creditor of joint and several debtors by way of suretyship or otherwise entitled to rank on the estate of each of the co-debtors for the full amount of his claim until he has been paid in full without being obliged to deduct therefrom the amount received from one or the other, by way of dividend, after the filing of the claim?

Ritchie C.J.\u2014 For the reasons given by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([14]), lam of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nStrong J.\u2014 I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. In the joint statement of facts submitted by the parties it is admitted that t the appellants made advances to Marcotte up to the amount of \" their claim on his promissory note for a like amount \" taking as further security a transfer from Marcotte the notes and goods hereinafter mentioned. The \"collateral securities so transferred by Marcotte to the \"appellants consisted of promissory notes endorsed \" by Marcotte and of a certain quantity of merchandise, the promissory notes being signed almost all of \" them by one Moodie, to the order of Marcotte and \" endorsed by him.\"\nFrom this state of facts it appears that the promissory notes, out of which the appellants obtained the greater part of the partial payment of their debt which has given rise to this controversy, were held by them by way of pledge, and not absolutely. Therefore as the pledged notes exceeded in amount the original debt due from Marcotte to the appellants, the appellants if they had collected the full amount of these notes would have been liable to account to Marcotte's estate for the balance remaining after the satisfaction of their own claim. Under these circumstances it is impossible to say that as between Marcotte and the appellants any new debt was created or liability incurred by Marcotte's endorsement of Moodie's notes. There was but one single debt due from Marcotte to the appellants represented by his promissory note in their favour and not a new joint and several debt for an amount never really die to them from Marcotte. It is always competent as between the immediate parties to securities such as bills and notes transferred by endorsement to show that the endorsement was made with the intention and for the sole purpose of effecting a pledge of the securities, which was the fact in the present case. Nouguier ([15]),Alauzet, Droit Commercial ([16]).\nThere was therefore no joint and several liability on the part of Marcotte, and the question principally argued and which does call for an adjudication in the case of the Ontario Bank v. Chaplin ([17]) does not arise at all in the present case.\nThe only question therefore, is whether the moneys realized by the appellants in respect of the pledged notes and property are to be treated as payments pro tanto of the appellants' debt. Of this there can be little doubt at least as regards the proceeds of the notes which were placed by the debtor in the hands of his creditor for this very purpose. It is true that the amount arising from the notes was not received by the appellants, until after they had filed their claim, but this can make no difference since the only question can be, what was the amount due to the appellants at the time they were entitled to judgment? The rule of English bankruptcy procedure, which does not oblige a creditor, who has proved his debt, to give credit for payments received by him from another party after the date of the proof, is a purely arbitrary rule of procedure and can have no application to a case like the present. The administration and winding-up of the insolvent's estate was not under any statute, but under a voluntary creditors' deed, and no law says that any difference shall be made between payments received before and those received after the filing of the claim. I repeat the only question can be, what was due at the time the action was taken or the judgment rendered, and the assignee is on ordinary principles entitled to credit for all payments made anterior to that date.\nFurther, I do not see any reason why any difference should be made between the credit to be given for the amount of the notes collected and the $490 produced by the sale of the goods. The sale of the goods is not in any way impeached, and must be assumed to have been authorised or acquiesced in by Marcotte; then the price ought, it would seem, to be credited just as is the money arising from the notes. The Court of Queen's Bench have, however, made a distinction founded upon the fact that the $490 was not received until after the preparation of the dividend sheet. With great deference, I am unable to see any ground for this distinction. The appellants were only entitled to judgment for the amount actually r\u00e9maining due to them deducting all payments. I should, therefore, if it had been open to us to do so have been prepared to have affirmed Mr. Justice Mathieu's judgment in its integrity. There has, however, been no cross appeal, and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench must consequently be affirmed with costs, subject to the correction of an obvious error in calculation pointed out in the respondent's factum which requires that the sum of $1,550.50 for which judgment has been rendered should be reduced to $1,214.06\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Les faits cidessus \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l'admission des parties ([18]) donnent lieu \u00e0 la question suivante les appelants untils droit \u00e0 un dividende sur le montant entier de leur reclamation telle que produite savoir sur $19,399.33 on seulement sur la balance de cette reclamation, apr\u00e8s deduction en tout ou en partie de la somme de $10,166.44 qu'ils ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s sur les billets promissoires et les marchandises oui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s par M arcotte?\nLes appelants pr\u00e9tendent que les billets de Moodie qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s par endossement comme garantie de la dette de Marcotte \u00e9taient devenus autant de cr\u00e9ances solidaires contre le failli et les signataires ou endosseurs de ces billets, et qu'en vertu des r\u00e8gles de la solidarit\u00e9 ils ont droit de r\u00e9clamer Ia totalit\u00e9 de chaque cr\u00e9ance de chacun des d\u00e9biteurs solidaires jusqu'au parfait paiement Qu'en consequence de la faillite de Marcotte, ils ont droit pour arriver au paiement integral de leur cr\u00e9ance, de r\u00e9clamer de l'intim\u00e9, son syndic, sur le chiffre nominal de leur cr\u00e9ance, au moment de la faillite, sans deduction des sommes re\u00e7ues subs\u00e9quemment des autres d\u00e9biteurs des cr\u00e9ances transport\u00e9es.\nL'intim\u00e9 pretend au contraire que l\u00e9s billets et marchandises transport\u00e9s par Marcotte aux appelants n'\u00e9tant en leur possession qu'\u00e0 litre de gage, la r\u00e9alisation de ce gage, \u00e0 quelque moment qu'elle se produise, a pour r\u00e9sultat n\u00e9cessaire l'extinction pro TANTO de leur cr\u00e9ance. En cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9 pretend que la question de solidarit\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9sente pas et qu'il n'y a pas lieu den appliquer les principes.\nLa cour de premi\u00e8re instance a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que les r\u00e8gles de gage devaient s'appliquer dans le cas actuel, et que les appelants n'avaient le droit de concourir avec les autres cr\u00e9anciers du failli que sous la deduction des sommes re\u00e7ues de la vente des marchandises et de la perception des billets transportes.\nLa cour de Revision pour le district de Montr\u00e9al a modifi\u00e9 ce jugement en d\u00e9clarant que le produit des merchandises devatt \u00eatre imput\u00e9 comme un paiement sur la reclamation des appelants mais que ceuxci avaient le droit de concourir avec les autres cr\u00e9anciers sur le montant de leur reclamation, $19,139.33, sous la deduction seulement de la somme de $490.00 provenant de la vente des marchandises.\nLa cour du Banc de la Reine appel\u00e9e plus tard \u00e0 se prononcer sur ces questions, a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour de premire instance et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les appelants n'avaient le droit de concourir avec les autres cr\u00e9anciers que sous la deduction de tout ce qu'ils avaient re\u00e7u de Marcotte, taut des billets promissoires que des marchandises transport\u00e9es.\nPar l'appel \u00e0 cette cour la m\u00eame question nous est pr\u00e9sentement soumise.\nLa position des appelants estelle v\u00e9ritablement celle de cr\u00e9anciers solidaires du failli Marcotte et des signataires et endosseurs des billets par lui transport\u00e9s aux dits appelants?\nC'est un principe incontestable que le faiseur dun billet promissoire s'oblige directement envers toutes les parties qui peuvent ensuite en devenir porteurs et que ces derniers ne se repr\u00e9sentent pas les uns les autres mais sont tous cr\u00e9anciers du faiseur en vertu de leurs propres droits. Mass\u00e9, Droit Commercial ([19]).\nLes appelanes sont devenus les cr\u00e9anciers directs de Moodie par le transport que Marcotte leur a fait des billets que Moodie avait souscrits en sa faveur. Ces billets transport\u00e9s pour assurer le paiement de la dette de Marcotte et faits payables \u00e0 son ordre ont par l'effet de l'endossement de Marcotte rendu le faiseur, Moodie, et l'endosseur Marcotte, d\u00e9biteurs conjointement et solidairement des appelants.\nPar 'admission de faits des parties on voit que les billets et les marchandises out \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s aux appelants comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale, as further security, pour assurer le paiement de leur reclamation. C'est sur ce caract\u00e8re de s\u00fbret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale donn\u00e9 au transport des billets et marchandises que l'intim\u00e9 se fonde pour soutenir qu'il ne s'agit pas ici de solidarit\u00e9, mais simplement de gage. Cette pr\u00e9tention est \u00e9videmment erron\u00e9e quant aux billets car ils out \u00e9t\u00e9 endoss\u00e9s et les appelants en sont devenus propri\u00e9taires sans conditions restrictives et out acquis la qualit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9anciers solidaires contre Marcotte et tous les signataires on endosseurs de ces billets. La solidarit\u00e9 \u00e9tant \u00e9tablie par la loi entre eux il aurait fallu une condition sp\u00e9ciale dans le transport pour y d\u00e9roger.\nLe fait que ces billets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s comme garantie collat\u00e9rale, memo s'il avait l'effet de constituer un gage ne d\u00e9truirait aucunement l'effet de la solidarit\u00e9. Les solidaires de Marcotte n'en seraient pas moins responsables envers les porteurs. La signification que l'intim\u00e9 donne aux mots 'garantie collat\u00e9rale\" n'est pas celle qu'ils out en loi i elle n'a pas l'effet de diminuer les obligations l\u00e9gales d\u00e9coulant de la s\u00f9ret\u00e9 transportee mais elle est an contraire une garantie additionnelle.\nL'article 1103 du Code Civil declare qu'il v a solidarite de la part des d\u00e9biteurs, lorsqu'ils sont obliges \u00e0 une m\u00eame chose de mani\u00e8re que chacun d'eux puisse \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9ment Contraint \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de l'obligation enti\u00e8re et que lex\u00e9cution par l'une lib\u00e8re los autres envers le cr\u00e9ancier.\nDans le cas actuel les appelants n'avaient qu'une r\u00e9clamation et deux d\u00e9biteurs dont chacun d'eux \u00e9tait oblige an paiement de toute la dette, et dont le paiement par l'un avait l'effet d'op\u00e9rer la d\u00e9charge des deux vis-\u00e0-vis des appelants.\nLaurent dit ([20]):\u2014 Il y a deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans l'obligation solidaire, on ne peut les expliquer que par un double principe. D'une part, ii y a plusieurs cod\u00e9biteurs, ce qui implique autant de liens qu'il y a de personnes oblig\u00e9es. D'autre part la dette est unique puisque tous les cod\u00e9biteurs doivent une seule et m\u00eame chose et la doivent pour le tout. Il y a donc tout ensemble un lien multiple et unit\u00e9 de la dette.\nIl y a un lien multiple parce qu'il y a plusieurs cod\u00e9biteurs, mais ce lien ne se divise pas entre eux: chaque cod\u00e9biteur est tenu de toute la dette comme s'il v \u00e9tait seul oblige.\nMarcad\u00e9 dit ([21]):\u2014\nLa solidarit\u00e9 pourrait exister entre deux personnes qui se sont oblig\u00e9es avec intervalle et par des actes s\u00e9par\u00e9s. li suffirait pour cela que Pierre e\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'avance consentir \u00e0 s'engager solidairement avec Paul, on que le premier oblig\u00e9 vint, apr\u00e8s que Paul s'est soumis \u00e0 la solidarit\u00e9, d\u00e9clarer qu'il entend s'y soumettre avec lui. En un mot, il y aura obligation solidaire proprement dite toutes les fois que les volont\u00e9s des divers oblig\u00e9s se sont r\u00e9unies pour se soumettre \u00e0 la solidarit\u00e9 d'un commun accord.\nDemolombe dit ([22]):\u2014\nL'obligation solidaire est une. \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, par rapport \u00e0 la chose qui en fait l'objet: mais elle est compos\u00e9e d'autant de liens qu'il y a de personnes diff\u00e9rentes qui l'ont contract\u00e9e, et ces personnes \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rentes entre elles, les liens qui les obligent sont autant de liens diff\u00e9rents, qui peuvent, par consequent, avoir des qualit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes.\nEt plus loin ([23]):\u2014\nRenoncer au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de division et de discussion c'est en effet de la part des d\u00e9biteurs qui s'obligent conjointement, s'obliger solidairement.\nPas de division !\nDone, chacun d'eux pourra \u00eatre contraint pour le tout.\nPas de discussion !\nDone, chacun d'eux pourra \u00eatre poursuivi principalement, comme s'il en \u00e9tait seul d\u00e9biteur envers le cr\u00e9ancier\nLa solidarit\u00e9 n'est pas autre chose.\nLes auteurs sont d'accord que l'obligaiion solidaire implique un mandat donn\u00e9 et re\u00e7u par chacun des Cod\u00e9biteurs de se repr\u00e9senter l'un l'autre ([24]).\nDans le cas actuel le mandat r\u00e9sulte de ce que la dette est cr\u00e9\u00e9e par des billets n\u00e9gociables et que dans ce cas, le mandat de toutes les parties responsables du paiement de la dette est toujours pr\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nCode Civil art. 1105:\u2014\nLa solidarit\u00e9 ne se presume pas; il faut qu'elle soit express\u00e9ment stipul\u00e9e.\nCette r\u00e9gle cesse dans les cas ou la solidarit\u00e9 a lieu de plein droit en vertu d'une disposition de la loi.\nElle ne s'applique pas non plus aux affaires de commerce dans lesquelles l'obligation est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e solidaire, except\u00e9 dans les cas r\u00e9gl\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment par des lois sp\u00e9ciales.\nCavanagh, Law of money security ([25]).\nThe literal meaning of collateral is \"additional\" or parallel; it does not mean ancillary \" or secondary\" unless shown by other circumstances. Where securities are intended to rank in successive order they should contain (express clauses to that effect; thus when two perperties are mortgaged there should be a proviso that one shall be the primary, the other the secondary security if it be so intended.\nIl y a sans doute une difference \u00e0 faire entre le transport des marchandises et le transport des billets. Quant aux premiers, je crois qu'il y a lieu de leur faire application des r\u00e8gles qui concernent le gage. Quant aux seconds, je crois que ce sont les principes de la solidarit\u00e9 qui doivent r\u00e9gler les droits des parties.\nSous l'op\u00e9ration des lois de faillite de 1869 et 1875, cette question s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les causes de Bessette v. La Banque du Peuple ([26]), et Rochette v. Louis ([27]).\nLa loi de 1875 contenait cette disposition.\nArt. 89. Le m ontant d\u00fb \u00e0 un cr\u00e9ancier sur chaque item s\u00e9par\u00e9 de sa reclamation au temps de l'ex\u00e9cution d'un acte de cession ou de l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de saisieart\u00eat, selon le cas, et qui restera d\u00fb \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 cette reclamation sera prouv\u00e9e formera partie du montant pour lequel il prendra rang sur lea biens du failli, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que cet item de sa reclamation soit pav\u00e9 en entier.\nDans la cause de Rochette v. Louis le juge en chef Meredith, d\u00e9cida que les cr\u00e9anciers MM. Louis et Cie., n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de d\u00e9duire de leur reclamation contre la faillite de Rochette le dividende qu'ils avaient re\u00e7u, depuis cetre r\u00e9clamation, de Samson leur oblige solidaire avec Rochette. Mais cette disposition a disparu avec la loi de faillite Be sorte Qu'il faut rechercher quelle \u00e9tait avant la loi de faillite la r\u00e9gle de notre droit sur la question soumise.\nL'hon. juge en chef Meredith a fait cette \u00e9tude dans la cause de Rochette v. Louis ([28]), en m\u00eame temps qu'une revue de la loi fran\u00e7aise, anglaise et \u00e9cossaise, sur cette question, que nous citons ciapr\u00e9s.\nThe rule according to the law of England appears to be that if at the time of proving the creditor has received a part of his claim he can then only prove for so much as remains due and when a dividend has been declared under another commission under which the holder has already proved his bill, though the dividend has not been received, yet the amount of it must be deducted from the bill before it can be proved ([29]).\nLa loi \u00e9cossaise, telleque nous la trouvons consign\u00e9e dans Bell's Commentaries ([30]) est tout-\u00e0-fait diff\u00e9rente.\nHe who holds several bound to him is entitled to demand the whole from each, to the effect of being paid his debt and no more, or,. if the co-obligants are bankrupts, a dividend from each corresponding to the whole but so as not to derive more than payment of the debt from the amount of the several dividends, and that a payment from a part from any one will pro tanto extinguish the claim against that estate, only leaving the security available to its full extent against the others.\nApr\u00e8s avoir ainsi expos\u00e9 la loi d'Angleterre et celle d'Ecosse, l'hon. juge dit que depuis 1775, la jurisprudence en France \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la loi \u00e9cossaise dont le principe fut adopt\u00e9 par l'art. 542 du code de commerce qui se lit comme suit:\nLe cr\u00e9ancier porteur instruments endoss\u00e9s, ou garantis solidairement par le failli et d'autres co-oblig\u00e9s qui sont en faillite, participera aux distributions dans toutes les masses et y figurera pour la valeur nominale de son litre jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement.\nL'hon. juge fait suivre cet expos\u00e9 de l'observation suivante:\u2014\nThe doctrine of the French code and of the Scotch law is favourable to commercial credit and it seems to me the most reasonable that can be adopted \u2022 but it is not in accordance with our common law, and is not sanctioned by our statute Jaw respecting insolvency. As to our common law Pothier says: 'Si tous ceux qui sont d\u00e9biteurs de la lettre de change, tant i'accepteur que le tireur et les endosseurs, avaient fait banqueroute, le propri\u00e9taire de la lettre qui est cr\u00e9ancier de chacun d'eux du total, peut se faire colloquer dans la distribution des biens de chacun d'eux comme r\u00e9ancier du total; mais aussit\u00f4t que par la distribution qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 la premiere termin\u00e9e, il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 d'une partie de sa cr\u00e9ance, puta, du quart, ii ne pourra plus rester dans les distributions des autres d\u00e9biteurs qui restent \u00e0 faire, que pour le surplus de ce qui lui est d\u00fb. (Contrat d'\u00e9change No. 160).' Renouard refers to the opinion of Pothier as being in accordanee with that of Duputy de la Serra, Bournier, Boutarie and Jousse (Renouard, vol. 2 p. 223), and speaks of the doctrine, for which they contended as an improvement upon that maintained by Savary, and as being not the same but a step towards the modern law of France. It is thought by some persons whose opinions are well deserving of respect that as to the matter under consideration there is no difference between the old law and the modern law of France. But a comparison of the above extract from Pothier with the article 542 of the French code is sufficient to show that opinion to be erroneous; and B\u00e9darride, Trait\u00e9 des Faillites, No. 853, expressly says: 'L'article 542 contient donc une derogation au droit commun.'\nL'honorable juge en chef Meredith est d'avis one le principe adopt\u00e9 par l'article 542 du code commercial fran\u00e7ais n'est pas notre droit. C'est aussi l'opinion de l'honorable juge Mondelet qui disait dans la cause de Bessette v. La Banque du Peuple ([31]):\nThe new or present jurisprudence of France is of no application to the present case The Scotch law whatever its wisdom may be cannot be our rule.\nL'honorable juge Jett\u00e9 tout en exprimant son respect pour l'opinion le ces savants magistrats declare que ces opinions ne lui paraissent pas concluantes: En effcet, until, elles ne se posent crue sur une appreciation comparative de certains textes de l\u00e9gislation formelle des divers pays mentionn\u00e9s, ce qui pouvait suffire, dans les circonstancess, puisque nous avions alors une loi positive sur la mati\u00e8re. Mais aujourd'hui que cette loi est disparue de notre droit, la quesiion doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre point de vue et c'est au d\u00e9veloppement de la science th\u00e9orique du droit Que nous devons en demander la solution\nIi resume ensuite les observations de Demolombe sur les consequences de la solidarit\u00e9 entre d\u00e9biteurs:\nTrois syst\u00e8mes se sont successivement produits en France au sujet du secours accord\u00e9 aux cr\u00e9anciers de plusieurs d\u00e9biteurs en \u00e9tat de faillite\nD'apr\u00e8s le premier syst\u00e8me le cr\u00e9ancier avait le droit de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l'une des masses en liquidation de ses divers d\u00e9biteurs, la plus avantageuse, sil le voulait, mais une fois son choix fait ii ne pouvait plus r\u00e9clamer des autres masess qui se trouvaient absolument lib\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. C'\u00e9tait le syst\u00e8me de Savary, le principal r\u00e9dacteur de l'ordonnance de 1673\nInutile d'appr\u00e9cier ce syst\u00e8me si contraire aux principes qui pr\u00e9valent aujourd'hui dans notre droit.\nLe second syst\u00e8me permettait an cr\u00e9ancier de se presenter successivement aux faillites de ses divers d\u00e9biteurs solidaires mais \u00e0 la condition de d\u00e9duire, dans les dernilres, ce qu'il avait re\u00e7u dans les premieres.\nC'\u00e9tait le syst\u00e8me de Dupuy de la Serra, Boutaric, Jousse et Pothier comme nous l'avons vu tout\u00e0l'heure par la citation des notes du juge en chef Meredith et c'est celui que virtuellement le d\u00e9fendeur veut appliquer aux demandeurs dans l'esp\u0141ce.\nLe troisi\u00e8me syst\u00e8me para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat de deux arr\u00eats rcnduseen 1776, l'un par le parlement de Paris, l'autre par le parlement d'Aix.\nLe parlement de Paris avait juge, en principe que le cr\u00e9ancier de divers d\u00e9biteurs solidaires peut se presenter successivement dans toutes les faillites, pour la valeur nominale de son titre, sans aucune dIduction des dividendes par lui d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7us.\nLe parlement d'Aix avait jug\u00e9 au contraire mais sa d\u00e9cision fut cass\u00e9e par arr\u00eat du conseil, le 24 Cvrier 1778, qui fut luim\u00eame confirm\u00e9 par un second arr\u00eat du 23 octobre 1781, portant rejet de Ia requ\u00eate en opposition, dirig\u00e9e contre le premier.\nDepuis lors, la jurisprudence fut fix\u00e9e et lorsque les r\u00e9dacteurs du code de commerce eurent \u00e0 exprimer la loi sur ce point ils le firent dans le sens de cette jurisprudence par l'article 542 du code de com- merce, dont j'ai cit\u00e9 plus haut la r\u00e9daction primitive et qui est aujour-d'hui dans les termes suivants:\nLe cr\u00e9ancier porteur d'engagements souscrits, endoss\u00e9s ou garantis solidairement par le failli et d'autres co-oblig\u00e9s qui sont en faillite, participera aux distributions dans toutes les masses et v figurera pour la valeur nominale de son titre jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement.\nTelle est incontestablement la loi fran\u00e7aise actuelle. Mais diration, cette loi n'est pas la n\u00f4tre et ii est \u00e9vident que cet article du code de commerce ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 ici. Il est vrai que la disposition formelle \u00e9dict\u00e9e par cet article 542, ne se trouve pas dans nos codes, mais la r\u00e8gle qu'il consacre estelle \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 notre legislation?\nB\u00e9darride, cite par M. le juge Meredith., dit bien que cet article 542 est une derogation au droit commun. Mais le sentiment de ces auteurs me paralt victorieuse-combattu par ceux qui soutiennent au contraire que l'article 542 du code de commerce n'est que l'expression du droit commun et ne comporte que l'application du principe de la solidarit\u00e9 dont le but est d'assurer au cr\u00e9ancier son paiement integral.\nC'est en effet la doctrine qui, apr\u00e9s de longues controverses a finalement triomph\u00e9 et a form\u00e9 la jurisprudence en France sur cette question avant l'adoption de l'article 542 du code de commerce. L'honorable juge Meredith, fait erreur en disant que le principe de la loi \u00e9cossaise a \u00e9t\u00e9 adoot\u00e9 par l'article 542 du code de commerce. Cette question faisait depuis longtemps le sujet dune division d'opinion parmi les jurisconsultes, comme on le verra par l'autorit\u00e9 cit\u00e9e ciaor\u00e8s de Dalloz dans laquelle ii fait l'historique de la question. Non seulement les jurisconsultes \u00e9taient divis\u00e9s, mais les parlements l'\u00e9taient aussi ceux d'Aix et de Paris d\u00e9cidant en sens Inverse. La question fut r\u00e9gl\u00e9e longtemps avant l'adoption du code de commerce par deux arr\u00eats du Roi en conseil qui reconnasssent au cr\u00e9ancier solidaire le droit de se porter r\u00e9clamant pour la totalit\u00e9 de sa cr\u00e9ance dans toutes les masses de ses co-d\u00e9biteurs solidaires. Ces arr\u00eats sont la base de Ia jurisprudence qui a exist\u00e9 jusqu'au code de commerce qui en a adopt\u00e9 le principe dans l'article qui fut d'abord l'article 534 et qui est maintenant l'article 542. Les auteurs qui soutiennent que cet article constitue une innovation sont \u00e9videmment dans l'erreur puisque le principe \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis longtemps reconnu par la plus haute autorit\u00e9 judiciaire de France l'arr\u00eat du Roi en son conseil ainsi qu'on peut le voir par la citation suivante d'Em\u00e9rigon, Trait\u00e9 des Assurances ([32]):\nLa m\u00eame question \u00e9tait alors agit\u00e9e au parlement de Paris, au sujet de certaines lettres de change tir\u00e9es par M et endoss\u00e9es par L. Ils avaient fait faillite et obtenu une remise de la part de leurs cr\u00e9anciers respectifs.\nPar un \u00e9v\u00e9nement singulier le parlement de Paris rendit le m\u00eame jour 18 juin 1776 in arr\u00e9t diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 celui du parlement d'.A.ix Il fat d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le porteur du billet avait droit de figurer dans chaque direction, pour la totalit\u00e9 du titre jusqu'\u00e0 extinction de cr\u00e9ance\nBellon se pourvut au conseil, et obtint du roi un arr\u00eat dont voici la teneur \"Ou\u00ef le rapport du sieur Moreau de Beaumont conseiller ordinaire, et an Conseil royal de commerce, le roi \u00e9tant en son conseil, ayant \u00e9gard \u00e0 la dite requ\u00eate, a cass\u00e9 et casse le dit arr\u00eat du parlement d'Aix, du dit jour, 18 juin 1776, et tout ce qui s'en est ensuivi; ce faisant, a \u00e9voq\u00e9 et \u00e9voque les demandes et contestations sur lesquelles le dit arr\u00eat est intervenu, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances s a ordonn\u00e9 et ordonne que les parties proc\u00e9deront en son conseil sur leurs demandes et contestations, en la forme port\u00e9e par le r\u00e8glement, pour \u00eatre statu\u00e9 ainsi qu'il appartiendra.

Les d\u00e9biteurs corr\u00e9s doivent chacun Ia m\u00eame somme. Le titre est indivisible vis-\u00e0-vis de chacun d'eux: Promittentes singuli in solidum tenentw; in utraque enim obligatione una res vertitur. Inst. de duobus reis. La faillite des d\u00e9biteurs corr\u00e9s n'alt\u00e9re en r\u00eden l'individualit\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9ance, qui ne cesse d'\u00eatre la m\u00eame dans chaque direction, et qui conserve sa force jusqu'il, ce qu'elle soit \u00e9teinte par un entier paiement.\nCONF\u00c9RENCE.\nLIV. Le code de commerce a mis fin \u00e0 ces longues controverses des auteurs, sur la question pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. \" Le cr\u00e9ancier porteur d'engagements solidaires entre le failli et d'autres co-oblig\u00e9s qui sont en faillite, participera aux distributions dans toutes les masses, jusqu'\u00e0 son parfait et entier paiement.\" (Art. 534).\nCes principes d\u00e9rivent de celui de la solidarit\u00e9, car il y a solidarit\u00e9 de la part des d\u00e9biteurs, lorsqu'ils sont oblig\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re que chacun puisse \u00eatre contraint pour la totalit\u00e9. Le titre est indivisible \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de chacun d'eux. (Voyez d'ailleurs les art. 1200, 1201, 1202 et 1204 du Code civil et l'ait. 140 du Code de commerce; voyez notre Trait\u00e9 des faillites, torn. 2 chapitre I, section 13, No. 279.)\nCes arr\u00eats, quoi qu'ils n'aient pas pour nous l'autorit\u00e9 legislative, ni l'autorit\u00e9 judiciaire de nos tribunaux n'en ont pas moins r\u00e9gl\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement une question soulev\u00e9e sur les effets du principe de la solidarit\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait exprim\u00e9 dans la loi fran\u00e7aise alors, comme ii l'\u00e9tait dans notre propre droit. Il en r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9cessairement que les arr\u00eats en conseil doivent valoir an moins pour nous comme raison \u00e9crite, et faire autorit\u00e9 dans nos cours an m\u00eame litre que les decisions de la cour de Cassation, lorsqu'elles portent sur un texte qui est semblable dans le code fran\u00e7ais et dans le n\u00f4tre.\nAinsi comme le dit d'Em\u00e9rigon, voil\u00e0 done la question pr\u00e9jug\u00e9e en faveur du porteur du papier. Les d\u00e9biteurs corr\u00e9is doivent chacun la m\u00e9me somme. Le titre est indivisible vis-\u00e0-vis de chaoun d'eux.\nLes autorit\u00e9s suivantes \u00e9tablissent toutes que les principes sur lesquels sont bases les arr\u00eats sont deriv\u00e9s de celui de la solidarit\u00e9 et ne forment pas une innovation dans le droit fran\u00e7ais.\nLarombi\u00e8re sur l'article 1204 du Code an No. 5 ([33]) parlant des articles 542 et 544 du Code de Commerce dit: Ces sag\u00e9s dispositions, expression du drolt commun, doivent \u00e9tre appliqu\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re civile. ElLes ne sont, eu effet, que lacons\u00e9quence de ce principe que chaque co-oblig\u00e9 solidaire est tenu de la totalit\u00e9. Si le cr\u00e9ancier ne figurait pas dans chaque distribution pour la valeur nominale de son titre et si sa cr\u00e9ance \u00c9tait diminu\u00e9e successivement du montant de chaque dividende allou\u00e9 il en r\u00e9sulteait que le cr\u00e9ancier perdrait dans tous les cas, une partie dc sa cr\u00e9ance, puisque dans la derni\u00e8re distribution, si avantageuse qu'elle fat, ii n'arriverait jamais \u00e0 un paiement int\u00e9gral et serait ainsi prive des garanties que lui donne la solidarit\u00e9. Car si chaque d\u00e9biteur est r\u00e9put\u00e9 seul et unique d\u00e9biteur du total ce n'est \u00e9videmment que pour mieux assurer l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de son paiement au moyen de cette responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9ciprooue et mutuelle de, insolvabilit\u00e9s de la part des co-d\u00e9biteurs entre eux.\nMass\u00e9\u2014Droit Commercial ([34]), dit:\nOn s'est demand\u00e9 si l'article 542 du Code de commerce ne fait que formuler une application des principes sur la solidarit\u00e9 et les effets du paiement par dividendes qui sont les m\u00eames en mati\u00e8re civile et en mati\u00e8re commerciale. Les cons\u00e9quences de ces principes ne tiennent pas \u00e0 l'organisation sp\u00e9ciale des faillites; elles en sont ind\u00e9pendautes et par consequent elles trouvent leur place dans la d\u00e9confiture qui n'est autre chose qu'une faillite civile, bien que sa liquidation ne soit soumise \u00e0 aucune forme et \u00e0 aucune organisation particuli\u00e8re.\nLocr\u00e9 ([35]) dit:\nToutes ces dispositions puis\u00e9es dans les principes \u00c9l\u00e9mentaires et immuables du droit civil s'appliciquent \u00e0 toutes les mati\u00e8res et \u00e0 tous les cas.\nAu sujet de l'article 542 Code de Commerce, Dalloz, Rep. ([36]), dit:\nOn n'a jamais contest\u00e9 aux er\u00e9anciers qui avaient plusieurs d\u00e9biteurs solidaires la facult\u00e9 des'adresser \u00e0 chacun deux indistinctement soit pour le montant total de la dette, soit pour parfaire le paiement qui n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 qu'en partie. Mais on a d\u00e9battu longtemps la question de savoir si, apr\u00e8s que le cr\u00e9ancier avait r\u00e9clame son paiement dans la faillite de l'un des co-d\u00e9bireurs solidaires, il pouvait encore s'adresser aux autres co-d\u00e9biteurs pour tout cc qu'il n'avait pas effectivement re\u00e7us s Comme l'ordonnance de 1673 ne contenait aucune disposition \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, les anciens auteurs n'\u00e9taient pas d'accord sur la solution de la question. Ainsi Savary, soutenait, paragraphes 13 et 48, 5me question, que lorsque le cr\u00e9ancier s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la faillite de l'un des co-d\u00e9biteurs, son opposition \u00e9tait faite et que l'acceptation d'un dividende \u00e9teignait la dette an regard de tous les oblig\u00e9s. '\nDupuy de la Serra s'appuyant sur des avis des avocats Perrin, Pomercy et Chapp\u00e9 combattait cette opinion. Dans le chapitre 16 de son livre, sur l'article des lettres de change, il \u00e9tablissait ainsi le droit de solidarit\u00e9:\nEn cas de faillite de tous les oblig\u00e9s \u00e0 la lettre de change adopt\u00e9e et protest\u00e9e faute de paiement, comme le porteur a une action solidaire contre tous, il a droit d'entrer dans chaque direction et contribution sans pouvoir \u00eatre oblige d'en choisir ou opter une et abandonner les autres Le porteur qui signe le contrat d'un des premiers obliges, sans avoir un consentement des derniers obliges, que c'est sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son action, se rend non-recevable contre eux, faute de leur pou voir c\u00e9der l'action enti\u00e8re ..... Le porteur qui est entr\u00e9 dans quelque contribution, ne peut entrer dans les suivantes que successivement pour ce qui lui est d\u00fb en reste. Un arr\u00eat du parlement de Paris, du 18 mai 1706, consacre ce syst\u00e8me que Boutarie, Jousse, en l'art. 33 de l'ordonnance, et Pothier, du Contrat de change, No. 179, apporov\u00e8rent \u00e9galement. Quoique plus favorable au cr\u00e9ancier que l'opinion de Savary, la th\u00e9orie dc Dupuys de la Serra le soumettait cependant, en fin de compte, \u00e0 une perte, puisqu'elle ne I'autorisait \u00e0 venir dans la derni\u00e8re faillite que sous la d\u00e9duction des dividendes par lui re\u00e7us dans les autres, et que la derni\u00e8re faillite ne payait qu'un dividende du reliquat. Un arr\u00eat du parlement de Paris, du 18 juin 1776, accordant tous les effets de la solidarit\u00e9, d\u00e9cida que le cr\u00e9ancier avait droit de figurer dans chaque faillite pour la totalit\u00e9 du titre, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il e\u00fbt re\u00e7u son entier paiement, et in arr\u00eat du Conseil, rendu le 24 f\u00e9vreir 1778, cassa une d\u00e9cision que le parlement d'Aix avait rendu en sens contraire \u00e0 celui du parlement de Paris, par arr\u00eat du 18 juin 1766, sur la plaidoierie d'Em\u00e9rigon (Contrats \u00e0 la grosse, ch. 10, sec. 3.)\nSur l'opposition form\u00e9e contre l'arr\u00eat du conseil, un second arr\u00eat, du 23 octobre 1781 maintint sa jurisprudence. Le code du commerce fut r\u00e9dig\u00e9 pendant que la jurisprudence \u00e9tait dans cette situation, et son art. 534 fut \u00e9crit dans le sens des arr\u00eats rendus par le conseil en 1778 et 1781. Aussi malgr\u00e9 l'ambiguit\u00e9 de cet article, qui \u00e9tait ainsi con\u00e7u: Le cr\u00e9ancier porteur d'engagements solidaires entre le failli et d'autres co-oblig\u00e9s solidaires qui sent en faillite participe aux distributions dans toutes les masses jusqu'\u00e0 parfait et entier paiement. MM. Vincens, T. 4, p. 521; Pardessus, No. 1211; Locr\u00e9, T. 7, p. 33 et suivant; Boulay Paty, Nos. 381 et 382: et nous m\u00eames, T. 8, p. 196, avions consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le cr\u00e9ancier comme ayant le droit de se pr\u00e9senter dans chaque masse pour le total de sa cr\u00e9ance, quels que fussent les dividendes partiels qu'il e\u00fbt pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment obtenus, et cela jasqu'\u00e0 parfait payement. Par application de cet article, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 ainsi que le porteur d'effets de commerce, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, en partie, par l'un des d\u00e9biteurs solidaires de ces effets, pouvait s'adresser \u00e0 la faillite de l'autre pour la totalit\u00e9 de sa cr\u00e9ance, mais de mani\u00e8re cependant qu'il ne p\u00fbt recevoir audel\u00e0 de ce qui lui \u00e9tait du: que s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 un concordat avec le failli, ii pouvait \u00e9galement dans les m\u00eames cas et sous les m\u00eames conditions, r\u00e9clamer le dividende convenu sur la totalit\u00e9 de sa cr\u00e9ance.\nLa Cour, attendu que l'art. 534 C. Com. sp\u00e9cial pour la mati\u00e8re, autorise le cr\u00e9ancier porteur de lettres de change qui a plusieurs d\u00e9biteuss solidaires en \u00e9tat de faillite, \u00e0 se remplir de l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de sa cr\u00e9ance, en se pr\u00e9sentant pour la totalit\u00e9 de ce qui lui est d\u00fb dans chaque masse de ses d\u00e9biteurs faillis, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il alt obtenu son parfait et entier paiement, et que l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 (de la Cour de Douai) n'a fait que se conformer \u00e0 cet article qui justifie suffisamment sa d\u00e9cision; rejette, (R\u00e9j. 28 janvier 1817. MM. Brisson, pr; Boyer, rap. Jourde, c. confaff. Leblond). Le nouvel article 542 a fait dispara\u00eetre tout \u00e9quivoque, en autorisant le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 venir dans chaque faillite pour la valeur nominale de son titre jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement ([37]).\nCes autorit\u00e9s me paraissent suffisantes pour \u00e9tablir que le droit du cr\u00e9ancier de se pr\u00e9senter dans toutes les faillites de ses co-d\u00e9biteurs solidaires n'est qu'une consequence logique du principe de la solidarit\u00e9. Mais la cour d'appel ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime dans la repudiation de ce principe je ne crois pas devoir m'en tenir \u00e0 ces autorit\u00e9s je pourrais en ajouter beaucoup d'autres, mais je me contenterai des suivantes qui contiennent les opinions de plusieurs de nos plus savants commentateurs:\nMass\u00e9 Droit Com. et Droit Civil ([38]) apr\u00e9s avoir d\u00e9-montr\u00e9 que sous l'ordonnance de 1673 les opinions \u00e9taient partag\u00e9es, ayant cite les opinions de Savary, Dupuys de la Serra, Boutarie, Jousse et Pothier, ajoute '.\nAussi le commerce, pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 des n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s du credit et des dangers auxquels l'exposait un syst\u00e8me qui limitait le recours du porteur contre ses d\u00e9biteurs faillis r\u00e9clamatil vivement contre l'usage qui s'\u00e9tait introduit a la suite de la doctrine et de la jurisprudence. La question fut donc de nouveau vivement agit\u00e9e entre des commer\u00e7ants et des jurisconsultes; et de cette discussion dont on retrouve les traces dans le recueil de Nicod\u00e9me, ii resulta que la faillite des divers co-oblig\u00e9s ne pouvait paralyser les effets de la solidarit\u00e9 et que le porteurd'une lettre de change, dont les divers signataires \u00e9taient en \u00e9tat de faillite, avait le droit de figurer successivement dans toutes les masses, sans deduction des dividendes qu'il avait per\u00e7us, et jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement.\nEntra\u00een\u00e9 par ce revirement dans la pratique, le parlement de Paris revint sur son ancienne jurisprudence, et par arr\u00eat du 18 juin 1776 il d\u00e9cida que le porteur d'engagements solidaires avait le droit de figurer dans toutes les faillites des co-oblig\u00e9s pour la valeur int\u00e9grale du titre jusqu'a parfait paiement.\nPar une concidence singuli\u00e8re, le parlement d'Aix rendait le m\u00eame jour, 18 juin 1776, sur la plaidoierie d'Em\u00e9rigon, qui nous en a conserv\u00e9 le souvenir, un arr\u00eat en sens contraire, jugeant que le porteur qui \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 dans le concordat de l'un des co-obliges, ne pouvait entrer dans les autres que successivement et pour ce qui lui restait d\u00fb. Mais, sur le pourvoi du porteur, cet arr\u00eat fut cass\u00e9 par un arr\u00eat du conseil du 24 f\u00e9vrier 1778, qui fut luim\u00eame confirm\u00e9 par un second arr\u00eat du 23 octobre 1731, portant rejet de la requ\u00eate en opposition dirig\u00e9e contre le premier.\nC'est cette jurisprudence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sagement maintenue par le Code de Commerce.\nPlus loin ([39]):\nC'est \u00e0 cette conclusion que je crois devoir m'arr\u00eater, parce que c'est la seule qui se trouve d'accord avec les principes sur la solidarit\u00e9, qui veulent que les co-oblig\u00e9s soient toujours tenus, quand ii reste d\u00fb quelque chose, et les effets du paiement sous forme de dividende qui si le dividende n'\u00e9tait calcul\u00e9 que sur ce qui reste d\u00fb aprls le paiement dun premier dividence, ne pourrait jamais constituer un paiement int\u00e9gral.\nEt au No. 2023, il dit:\nOn s'est demand\u00e9 si l'article 542 du Code de Commerce ne fait que formuler une application des principes sur la solidarit\u00e9 et les effets du payement par dividendes, qui sont les m\u00eames en mati\u00e8re civile et en mati\u00e8re commerciale.

Puisque l'obligation solidaire a pour but d'assurer le paiement int\u00e9gral de la cr\u00e9ance, et que le cr\u00e9ancier conserve la totalit\u00e9 de sa cr\u00e9snce contre tous les co-oblig\u00e9s ii s'en suit in\u00e9vitablement que si ceuxci tombent ensuite en faillite, il a droit de se presenter dans leur faillite pour la valeur nominale de son titre jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement. S'il en \u00e9tait autrement si le cr\u00e9ancier devait d\u00e9duire le dividende re\u00e7u dans la faillite d'un co-oblige pour venir \u00e0 contribution. il ne pourrait jamais arriver an parfait paiement. L'obligation solidaire manquerait alors son but qui est d'assurer le paiement integral de l'obligation. Ce droit de venir \u00e0 contribution dans toutes l\u00e9s masses en faillite de ses co-oblig\u00e9s a bien \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par l'art. 542 du Code du Commerce, mais il existait de droit commun avant cela, ainsi que l'a reconnu l'arr\u00eat du parlement de Paris de 1776.

Voici comment s'exprimait Lord Justice Cotton en rendant ce jugement:\u2014\nEach of these appeals (il y avait trois causes r\u00e9unies) raised the same question, namely, whether the holder of a bill of exchange taken from the drawer as security for a sum less than the amount of the bill is entitled as against the estate of the bankrupt, who had accepted it for the accommodation of the drawer to prove only for the amount due to him (the holder) or for the amount of the bill, with a restriction that he shall not receive dividends on his proof to an amount exceeding the sum due to him on his security. It was conceded that, if the bill had been accepted for value the holder would have been entitled to prove for the larger amount. But it was urged on behalf of the respondent that the fact of the acceptance being for the accommodation of the drawer makes a difference It was said and truly, that a man who has taken a bill from the drawer as security only will hold for the drawer any sum recovered from the acceptor beyond the amount due on his security and that when the bill has been accepted for the accommodation of the drawer he the drawer would be liable to repay to the acceptor any part of the sum recovered from him, which may be handed to the drawer by the holder of the bill But the acceptor has put it in the power of the drawer to make the bill in the hands of a holder for value available against the acceptor for its full amount, and although the holder may have taken it as security for a sum less than the amount of the bill we are of opinion that such a holder is entitled to make the bill available against the acceptor in the way which will best produce the sum due to him and that in the event of bankruptcy he is entitled to prove against the acceptor's estate for the full amount of the bill.\nD'apr\u00e8s tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de je conclus que les appelants cr\u00e9anciers solidaires de Marcotte et des signataires des billets qu'ils avaient re\u00e7us de lui en garantie collat\u00e9rale ont droit d'\u00eatre colloqu\u00e9s sur le chiffre nominal de leur cr\u00e9ance sans deduction des sommes re\u00e7ues sur les billets transport\u00e9s, depuis la production de leur reclamation.\nIl n'en est pas de m\u00eame de la somme de $490, produite de la vente des marchandises donn\u00e9es comme gage aux appelants. Cette somme devra \u00eatre d\u00e9duite du montant de leur reclamation car cela constitue un paiement sur leur cr\u00e9ance.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nTaschereAu J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nGWYNEE J.\u2014Some time prior to the month of February, 1882, the plaintiffs made advances to one Alphonse Marcotte, then a merchant trading in the city of Montreal, taking as security for the repayment of such advances Marcotte's own promissory note for the amount, and, by way of collateral security, divers promissory notes made by certain persons who were debtors of Marcotte, of whom one Moodie was one, for several amounts payable to Marcotte or order, and endorsed by Marcotte to the plaintiff; and, also, some goods and merchandise belonging to Marcotte and delivered by him to the plaintiffs. In the month of February, 1882, Marcotte, by a voluntary deed executed by him bearing date the 13th of that month, conveyed and transferred to the defendant Thibaudeau, one of his creditors, all his estate and effects upon trust for the benefit of the whole of his creditors. The plaintiffs as creditors of Marcotte claimed the benefit of this trust deed, and upon the 22nd April, 1882, brought in and filed with the trustee their claim for $19139.83, which was accepted and recognized by the trustee as being, and which is admitted to have been, the amount then due to them by Marcotte, and for which they were then entitled to rank as creditors entitled to the benefit of the said trust deed. The trustee having subsequeutly realized from the trust estate an amount which enabled him to pay to the plaintiffs and the other creditors of Marcotte the sum of 12\u00bd cents in the dollar upon the amounts due to them respectively at the time of their claims having been presented to the trustee, prepared and advertised a dividend sheet upon which the plaintiffs were entered and declared to be entitled to receive the sum of $2,392.49, which sum the trustee promised to pay them upon the 13th day of July then next following such advertisement, that is to say, upon the 13th of July, 1882. Between the 22nd of April, 1882, and this 18th of July the plaintiffs received from Moodie in respect of the notes made by him to Marcotte and endorsed by the latter to the plaintiffs as such collateral security as aforesaid the sums as is admitted in the case, of $8,363.66 and $911.57, making together the sum of $9,275.33; and in April 1883, the further sum of $248.91. The plaintiffs also received subsequently to the 22nd April, 1882, but when in particular is not stated, the sum of $490 as proceeds of the merchandie left in their hands. There seems to me to be some confusion in the printed case which does not appear to have been noticed; what the case says is: \" Moodie had, also, become an insolvent and appellants realized out of his estate in virtue of such promissory notes $9,676.24, viz., $8,363.66 in May, 1882, subsequently to the filing of their claim, but previous to the 13th July, 1882, when the dividend was made payable, $911.57 in May, June and July, 1882, and $248.71 in April, 1883. Appellants, also, realized out of the goods and merchandise transferred to them by Marcotte a further sum of $490 making with that of $9,076.24 a total sum of $10,166.24.\" In the argument before us it was admitted that the above statement that \"Moodie had also become insolvent\" is erroneous and that in point of fact the amount realized from him was realized under an execution issued upon a judgment recovered against him in the province of Manitoba, so that the case before us is not that of a cr\u00e9diter having a claim against two insolvent estates for the main debt, but simply of a creditor holding collateral security for his debt claiming under a voluntary deed of assignment made by his debtor in trust for his creditors\nNow as to the above sum of $490 it has been regarded by the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in appeal as having been received subsequently to the 13th July 188'2 and for that reason they have held that it cannot be deducted from the amount in respect of which the plaintiffs are entitled to receive a dividend of 12\u00bd cents in the dollar under the trust deed '. while in the Superior Court and in the Court of Review it seems to have been regarded as having been received prior to that date, although the learned judge who pronounced judgment in the Superior Court does not seem to have been of opinion that it made any difference whether at was received before or after the 13th July, 1882 for he has included the $248.91 admitted to have been received in April, 1883, in the same category as the sums received by the plaintiffs between the 22nd April and the 13th July, 1882. In an action brought by the plaintiffs against the trustee of the trust deed of February, 1882, to recover the. sum of $2,392.49, declared by him to be in his hands and payable to the plaintiffs and which he promised to pay to them upon the 13th July,, 1882, as their equal share or dividend upon the amount of the plaintiffs' claim as secured, and as recognized by him as being secured under the trust deed, the learned judge of the Superior Court held that the plaintifs had no right to recover from the trustee the said amount of $2,392.49 so declared to be in his hands and payable to them as aforesaid, and that they could recover only the sum of $1,121.99 for which sum he gave judgment in their favour. This sum of $1,121.99 was ascertained by calculating 12\u00bd cents in the dollar upon the sum of $8,963.59, being the amount which he found to be due by Marcotte to the plaintiffs after deducting from the $19,139.33 due to them in April, 1882, the above sum of $10,166.44, and which sum of $8,933.59 the learned judge held to be the only sum for which the plaintiffs were entitled to rank as creditors under the said trust deed. The Court of Review set aside the judgment of the Superior Court holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to rank as creditors upon the trust estate for the sum of $18,649.83 being the amount of plaintiffs' claim as it stood in April 1882 less the sum of $490 realized out of the merchandise, and they rendered judgment for the plaintiffs in the action for the sum of $2,331.33 with interest thereon from the 13th July 1882.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench in appeal holding the $490 to have been received subsequently to the 13th July, 1882, adjudged that this sum could not be deducted from the amount upon which the plaintiffs were entitled to a dividend under the trust deed and that they were entitled to rank on the trust deed as creditors only for the sum of $9,722.00. This plainly ought to have been $9,716500 for the judgment declares it to be arrived at by deducting from the $19,139.33 due in April, 1882, the sum of $9,423.33, which the court held to be the amount realized from the Moodie notes. How this latter sum was arrived at is not clear for the only sums admitted to have been received by the plaintiffs from the Moodie notes appear to have been the three sums of $8,363.76, $911.57 and $248 91, amounting together to $9,524.44, and as the $248.91 was not received until April, 1883, the Court of Queen's Bench must have excluded that sum for the same reason as they excluded the $490, namely, that money received after the 13th February, 1882, could not be deducted from the amount upon which the plaintiffs were entitled to a dividend; if then the $248911 be deducted from the $9,524.24 there remained only $9,275.33 to be deducted instead of the $9,423333.\nThe plaintiffs alone have appealed from this judgment and the learned counsel for the respondent admitted that not having presented a cross appeal the respondents cannot now object to the deduction of the $490, although he contended that in making that deduction the court erred and he admitted, therefore that the appeal before us is to be determined wholly upon the question as to the correctness of the judgment as to the deduction in respect of the amount received upon the Moodie notes prior to the 18th July 1882. That is the sole question before us and in determining it we can, I think with great deference, arrive at a sound conclusion without inquiring whether Moodie, by reason of the plaintiffs having been the holders of his notes payable to Marcotte and endorsed by the latter to them as collateral security for Marcotte' debt was bound solidairement with Marcotte for that debt, and without inquiring either what was the law of France prevailing in Canada at the time of its cession to the British Crown in relation to the distribution of the estate and effects of insolvent debtors.\nThe case in my judgment depends simply upon the true construction of the deed of the 13th of February 1882, construing that deed by the light of the surrounding circumstances the plaintiffs being entitled to the benefit of its provisions to the fullest extent of its terms without prejudice to rights then already held by him, which are not professed to be interfered with by the deed; and the defendant in like manner being hound to execute the trust in favour of the plaintiffs to the fullest extent of the terms of the deed without any diminution or variation whatever.\nIn 1864 the legislature of the late province of Canada passed an act respecting insolvency wherein provision was made for the distribution of the estate and effects of insolvent debtors whether under a voluntary deed of assignment executed by the debtor or under proceedings in compulsory liquidation. In that act provision was made for the case of a creditor holding collateral security, prescribing the manner in which, and the extent to which such creditor should rank on the insolvent estate; that act was amended by the 29 Vic. ch. 18, and in the same session of the legislature the statute 29 Vic. ch. 41 was passed which carried into effect the object of the statute 20. Vic. ch. 43 by codifying the laws in force in that part of the then province of Canada previously forming the province of Lower Canada in relation to civil matters into one code designated \" The civil code of Lower Canada.\" This code contains no provision upon the subject of the distribution of the estates of insolvent debtors for the reason, no doubt, that the legislature was of opinion that the Insolvent Act of 1844 as amended by 29 Vic. ch. 18 was sufficient for the purpose. This act of 1864 so amended constituted the sole law in force throughout the province of Canada, regulating the distribution of the estates of insolvent debtors at the time of the passing of the B. N. A. Act in March, 1867. In the new constitution given by that act to the Dominion of Canada and to the several provinces of which it was composed all matters relating to bankruptcy and insolvency, including, therefore, the distribution of the estate and effects of insolvent debtors among their creditors, whether having, or not having, collateral securities for their respective claims, and the manner in which and the extent to which all such creditors respectively should rank on the insolvent estate, were placed under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament for the purpose, no doubt, of insuring uniformity throughout the Dominion in the law upon these subjects. In the exercise of this jurisdiction the Dominion Parliament passed the act 32 & 33 Vie. ch. 16 making one uniform provision throughout the Dominion of Canada for the distribution of the estates of insolvent debtors whether under voluntary deeds of assignment or in compulsory liquidation, and prescribing the manner in which, and the extent to which, creditors having collateral securities should rank on the insolvent estates. This act while repealing the act of 1864 which had abrogated, annulled and repealed the old French law relating to the distribution of the estates of insolvents in that part of the late province of Canada which now constitutes the province of Quebec where alone it had ever any force enacted in substitution there for another law relating to the matter, which continued to be the sole law in force upon the subject throughout the Dominion until 1875 when it was repealed and the Dominion statute 38 Vie. ch. 16 substituted therefor; this latter act as amended by the Dominion statutes 39 Vic. ch. 30 and 40 Vic. ch. 41 continued in force as the sole law upon the subject in the Dominion until 1880 when the statute 43 Vic. ch. 1 repealing the said three last mentioned statutes was passed.\nNow on the 13th February 1882 Marcotte executed to the defendant one of his creditors accepting the trust deed upon the construction of which alone in my opinion, depends the solution of the question before us on this appeal. By that deed Marcotte after reciting that he was indebted to several persons and firms his creditors, which indebtedness he was unable to pay in full and that he had agreed with his creditors to transfer and assign to the defendant the whole of his property movable and immovable estate and effects for the profit and benefit of his said creditors assigned transferred and made over to the defendant, accepting thereof as assignee for himself and assigns and for and on be half and for the sole profit and benefit of said creditors \" all and every,\" &c., &c, enumerating specific pro-perties and concluding thus: \" and all assets generally whatsoever without exception or reserve upon trust and to and for the uses, &c., hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\n\" 1st. To pay all costs attending the execution of the trust purposes of the deed: \"\n2 2nd. All rent and privileged claims,\" and\n\"3rd. To divide from time to time and as said assignee shall deem proper the whole rest and residue of said estate pro rata among said creditors according to their several and respective claims as filed by them with the party of the second part \" (The Trustee) \"the amounts of which appear and are shown opposite the creditors' respective names set out in the annexed list approved and signed ne varielur by parties and notaries hereto \"\nNow, as it appears to me; Marcotte by this deed himself determined the precise time ne varietur when each creditor should become entitled to receive a dividend upon his claim and the respective amounts of such claims, namely upon each creditor signifying his acceptance of the benefit of the deed as expressed therein by filing his claim with the trustee, such claim being that stated in the list annexed to the deed ne varietur It is to be observed that there is no provision in the deed to the effect that the claim of any creditor having collateral security shall be diminished or altered in any respect in case, after the filing of his claim and the acceptance thereof by the trustee, he should realize anything from the collaterals held by him; no provision that from time ti time as anything should be realized from collaterals, the amount upon which such creditor would be entitled to be collocated for dividend should be reduced by the amount realized from the collaterals. Every creditor, whether holding collateral security or not, was by the terms of the deed to receive out of the estate and effects which the grantor had power to appropriate for the benefit of all creditors alike an equal ratable dividend proportionate to the amount of his claim as it existed when filed with the trustee, those holding collateal securities until, with such dividends and any sums to be realized from collaterals, they should be paid in full, when what should remain of the collaterals held by them should first come under the operation of the trust deed and for the benefit of all the other creditors not paid in full.\nThis, as it appears to me, is the true construction of the trust deed. A contrary construction cannot, in my opinion, be given to it without the insertion of a wholly new clause never apparently contemplated by the grantor, and which could not be inserted without detracting in a most essential manner from the rights which had then already been vested by the grantor in such of his creditors as were then holders of collateral securities; without, in fact, completely altering the trust purposes of the deed.\nPrior to the execution of the trust deed the above plaintiffs had the right to sue Marcotte and to recover judgment against him to the full amount of his debt, admitted to have been $19199.83 and they had the right at the same time to sue and recover judgment against Moodie to the full amount of his notes which the plaintiffs held as collateral security, and they had the right to enforce these judgments by executions levied both on the property of Marcotte and on that of Moodie from time to time, until the plaintiffs, by moneys realized either wholly from the property of one of them or partly from the property of one of them and partly from that of the other should be paid in full Marcotte s debt to them. When, then, Marcotte executed the trust deed he had no power of disposition whatever over the Moodie notes which had been transferred to the plaintiffs as collateral security, which he could exercise to the prejudice of the plaintiffs; and, indeed, he does not in the deed claim to have, or assume to exercise, any such power. So far as those notes were concerned Marcotte's interest in and his power of disposition over, them was limited to so much of the amount thereof as should remain after the plaintiffs should be paid in full Marcotte's debt to them; and that was the sole interest in those notes which passed by the trust deed to the defendant. The trust deed had no operation whatever upon those notes, unless or until the plaintiffs should be paid in full Marcottes debt, but upon the residue of the property of Marcotte the trust deed had immediate operation, and it is plain that out of the proceeds of that property the plaintiffs by the deed, which is recited as being executed in pursuance of an agreement between Marcotte and his creditors, are declared to be entitled to receive an equal dividend with all the other creditors of Marcotte upon the full amount of Marcotte's debt to the plaintiffs which is admitted to have then been $19-139.83, without in any manner detracting from the plaintiffs' rights in the collaterals held by them until they should be paid in full and the trust which the defendant accepted and undertook to execute, in so far as the plaintiffs were concerned was to pay to them upon the above amount as constituting their claim an equal share or dividend ratably with Marcotte's other creditors, out of the moneys to be realized by the trustee from the property so transferred to him in trust. It is a portion of this property which has been sold and the trustee, in accordance with the express provisions of the deed, the trusts of which he assumed and undertook to discharge, has collocated the plaintiffs as entitled to receive the sum of $2,392.49, being their equal share or dividend at the rate of 12\u2014 cents in the dollar upon the above sum for which they were, as is admitted, entitled to rank when the trust deed was executed and on the 22nd April 1882 when they filed their claim with the trustee and thereby signified their acceptance of the benefits of the trust deed For this sum of $2,392499 the plaintiffs were, in my judgment, entitled to judgment in the Superior Court with interest thereon from the 13th \"February, 1882. The only law affecting the present case is, in my opinion, that prevailing in the Province of Quebec in relation to the construction of contracts, and to the obligation imposed upon a trustee to execuse the trusts of a deed which he accepts and undertakes to execute. In the absence of an Insolvent Act passed by the Parliament of Canada qualifying the rights of creditors of an insolvent debtor as expressed in a voluntary deed executed by the debtor, and detracting from such rights in the case of a creditor holding' collateral securities, there does not, in my opinion, exist in the Dominion any law which can have the effect of depriving the plaintiffs of the benefit of the provisions of the trust deed in his favour as above construed or of relieving the defendant from the obligation of executing the trusts of the deed as accepted by him according to the precise terms and provisions of the deed.\nThe case in my judgment is simply resolved into this:\u2014 The Insolvent Act passed in 1864 by the legislature of the late province of Canada abrogated, annulled and repealed, within that part of the province which formerly constituted Lower Canada the old French law, whatever it was, in relation to insolvency and the distribution of the estates of insolvents. The act of 1864 assumed control over and provided the law relating to that subject. This act of 1864 was the sole law in force in Canada upon the subject at the time of the passing of the B.N. A. Act which act withdrew the subject from provincial jurisdiction and placed it under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of the Dominion Parliament. That Parliament by the act of 1869, when repealing the act of 1864 enacted a law upon the subject having uniform force and effect throughout the whole Dominion. The act of 1875 which repealed the act of 1869 re-enacted \u00bfmother law upon the subject, having in like manner uniform force and effect throughout the Dominion The act 43 Vic ch.1 repealed the act of 1875 and two other acts which had been passed in amendment of it. Now what was the effect of this repeal? Not, in my opinion, as has been contended to revive the old French law in relation to insolvency and the distribution of the estate of insolvents within the province of Quebec, so in effect leaving the province of Quebec with an insolvent law while all the other provinces of the Dominion were without one. The Dominion Interpretation Act enacts that the repeal of any act shall not revive any act or provision of law repealed by such act. As well might it he contended that 43 Vic. oh. 1 had the effect of reviving the repealed act of 1864 as of reviving the old provision of law which the act of 1864 abrogated, an- nulled and repealed. The effect of 43 Vic ch 1 in my opinion, was simply to leave all the provinces of the Dominion alike in the same condition that is to say without any law relating to insolvency unless and until one should be enacted by the sole power having jurisdiction over the subject. As to this case now before us, all we have to do as it appears to me is to construe the agreement between the parties as expressed in the deed of February, 1882, the trusts of which the defendant assumed the duty of dischargion, and in accordance with the provisions whereof he collocated, in my opinion correctly, the plaintiffs as entitled to receive as their dividend upon their claim as secured by the deed the sum of $2 392.44 for which sum with interest from the 13th July, 1882, they are, in my opinion, Entitled to judgment, and the appeal therefore should be allowed with costs and judgment be ordered to be entered accordingly in the Superior Court with costs.\nPATTERSON J\u2014Marcotte being insolvent assigned his effects to the respondent who is defendant in the action, for the benefit of the whole of his creditors on the 13th of February, 1882. The appellants had made him advances on his promissory note, and he had given them collateral security, to an amount larger than his debt, by pledging some goods and by endorsing to them promissory notes made by one Moodie. It is not stated in the case agreed on by the parties that Marcotte made himself, or became, personally liable to the appellants as endorser of these notes. The notes may have been endorsed merely for the purpose of transferring them, the power to do which is explained in Denton v, Peters ([46]), or it may be that Marcotte was not notified of the dishonour of the notes so as to fix him with liability for the payment of them. It was not a necessary part of the transaction that he should, in addition to his liability on his own note, become also liable on these Moodie notes. We are not even informed, nor is it necessary that we should know, whether the notes fell due before the assignment or not till afterwards. We have simply the facts that Marcotte was debtor to the appellants, and that, by way of security for the debt, they held a portion of the assets of their debtor and had the right which is recognized by article 1969 of the Civil Code to be paid from those assets by privilege or preference before other creditors. The debt due by Marcotte to the appellants and the debt due by Moodie to Marcotte were entirely distinct debts The nature of the latter was not changed by the accident of the endorsement over of the notes by Marcotte which made Moodie directly liable to the appellants not for the debt which they had proved against Marcotte's estate, but for the several promissory notes.\nTo constitute a joint and several liability as defined by article 1103 of the Civil Code three things must concur. The co-debtors must be obliged to the same thing: In such manner that each of them singly may be compelled to the performance of the whole obligation: And that the performance by one discharges the others towards the creditor. These tests are in my apprehension, fatal to the recognition of a joint and several liability in the present instance. Moodie's obligation is to pay his notes; Marcotte is to pay his debt to the appellants, which is a different thing. To hold Marcotte compellable, as endorser of the notes, to perform the same obligation as Moodie would be, as we have seen to assume facts that are not before us. Besides, that is not the obligation on which the claim before the assignee is founded. That claim is made under an obligation to which Moodie is no party. Performance by Marcotte of his obligation by the payment of his debt would not discharge Moodie. He would still have to pay his notes. And performance by Moodie discharges Marcotte only as a realization of so much of the security held by Marcotte's creditor.\nIn this particular I do not see my way to follow the learned and instructive judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in the Court of Review ([47]).\nI do not think it necessary to discuss or to form a definite opinion as to the effect of Marcotte's being liable as endorser on Moodie's notes, if he had been shown or admitted to be so liable. Two questions would arise. The first which might not be difficult to answer in the affirmative in view of articles 1103, 1104, 1105 and 2310 would be: Was there a joint and several obligation? And the second which would involve more difficulty, would be the conclusion that a joint and several obligation would carry with it the right of the creditor to rank upon the estate of each co-debtor for the whole original amount of his claim until paid in full without his being bound to reduce his claim on one estate by crediting payments received from the other estate. On this question there are strongly conflicting opinions, as is evident from contrasting the views of Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in this case, which is reported as Benning v. Thibaudeau (l),with others commented on by him, particularly those of Chief Justice Meredith expressed in Rochette v. St. Louis ([48]) and with the later opinion of Mr. Justice Andrews in Chinic v. Raltray ([49]).\nThe debt for which on the 22nd of April. 1882, the appellants filed their claim was $19,1139.83. Moodie was unable to pay in full and the amount realized from the collateral security was considerably less than this debt of $19,139.83.\nThe court of appeal sustained the respondent's contention that the sums so realized were payment pro tanto of the debt out of the property of Marcotte and that the appellants are entitled to share in the fund in the hands of the assignee in respect only of what remains unpaid.\nIn my opinion that conclusion should be affirmed on the grounds stated in the judgment of the court.\nWith regard to the amounts, I cannot make the details given in the case bring out the results there given, nor can I find in the case exactly the same figures on which the calculations in the judgment of the Queen's Bench are made.\nIn the court of first instance the computation is made on the gross amounts stated in the case and, as far as I can perceive, that computation is correct. The figures thus used are as follows:\u2014\nTotal debt proved\n$19,13983\n\"\namount realized from col- laterals\n10,16624\nBalance for which to rank\n$ 8,973 59\n12\u00bd cents per $ on $8,973.59\n$ 1,121 69\nPart of the amount realized was received after the declaration of the dividend on 13th July 1882 In the Queen's Bench it was held that that part was not to be deducted from the claim proved and the amount deducted by the judgment of the Queen's Bench was therefore $9427333 or $678911 less than the amount deducted at the trial, leaving $9,712.50 for which to rank. 12- per cent on this amount would be $1214.66 and not $1,550.50 as erroneously stated in the judgment. This correction ought, at all events, to be made, as asked by the respondent at the end of his factum; but I do not understand why the whole amount received from the collaterals should not be deducted. I think the proper correction to be made would be to restore the judgment to the amount of $1,121.69, for which it was first rendered and with this correction I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nApple dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Berque, Lafontaine & Turgeon.\nSolicitors for respondent : Geoffrion, Dorion & Allan.\n[1] M.L.R. 5 Q.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE DECISION OF MR. JUSTICE BROOKS.\nElection appeal\u2014Prelvl\u00efminary objections\u2014Status of petitioner\u2014Onus probandi\u2014Equal division of court\u2014Previous decision\u2014\u2014Effect of.\nBy preliminary objections to an election petition the respondent claimed the petition should be dismissed because the said petitioner had no right to vote at said election.\nOn the day fixed for proof and hearing of the preliminary objections the petitioner adduced no proof and the respondent declared that he had no evidence and the preliminary objections were dismissed.\nHeld per Sir W. J. Ritchie C J and Taschereau and Patterson JJ., that the onus probandi was upon the petitioner to establish his status and that the anneal should be allowed and the election petition dismissed\nPer Strong J. that the onus probandi was upon the petitioner, but in view of The established jurisprudence, the appeal should be allowed without costs.\nFournier and Gwynne JJ. contra, were of opinion that the onus probandi was on the respondent. The Megantic Election case (8 Can. S. C. R. 169) discussed.\nWhen the Supreme Court of Canada in a case in appeal is equally divided so that the decision appealed against stands unreversed the result of the case in the Supreme Court affects the actual parties to the litigation only and the court, when a similar case is brought before it, is not bound by the result of the previous case.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, District of Saint Francis, dismissing the preliminary objections which had been filed by the appellant to the respondent's petition contesting appelant's election.\nThe preliminary objections filed by the appellant against the petition were 19 in number, but the only objection relied on by the counsel for the appellant on the present appeal was viz: \" 14. Because the said petitioner had no right to vote at said election.\"\nThe 15th objection was as follows: \" Because the said petitioner was guilty of unlawful acts and corrupt practices at and during said election, and was in consequence disqualified and not entitled to present the petition in this matter.\"\nOn the day fixed the petitioner adduced no proof. Appellant having stated that he desired to make proof applied to have the case continued. Petitioner insisted that if appellant intended to adduce any proof in support of his charges of corrupt practices he must furnish particulars. The court ordered particulars to be furnished the same day and continued the case until the second day after.\nWhen the day to which the case had been continued arrived the appellant declared that he had no evidence, and the case was then heard on the preliminary objections without evidence being adduced by either party and th\u00eb judge dismissed the preliminary objections with costs\nIn the Supreme Court when the appeal was called the question arose whether the judgment pronounced by the court in The Megantic Election case ([1]) was binding upon the court, the court in that case being equally divided and the following authorities were referred to by counsel for appellant: Hadfield's case ([2]), in re ha Hall ([3]); and counsel for respondent relied on Black on Judgments ([4]) and Beamish v. Beamish ([5]).\nGeoffrion Q. C. The petitioner's status having\" been objected to he was bound in limine to prove his quality or status as an elector\nThe question thus raised as to the burden of proof is not a mere matter of practice or procedure, it involves an important principle of law. In this case there is a direct negation of an essential averment in the petition. In the absence of any legal presumption in favour of petitioner he must prove his qualification in limine before proceeding to deal with the merits of the petition.\nIn The Megantic case ([6]) there was an answer of the petitioner denying the truth of the matters set forth in the preliminary objections, and the court was equally divided and the judgment is not binding. In Duval v. Casgrain ([7]) there were two different tribunals to deal with the petition, each having a separate and distinct jurisdiction with the danger of the one encroaching upon the rights or powers of the other whereas now under the law as it stands one judge deals with the whole case.\nThe allegations of the petition are not supported by an affidavit, nor is there any prima facie evidence whatever in support of the petition.\nThere can be no legal presumption in favour of petitioner in this connection any more than there would be in favour of a person suing in his quality of executor or trustee, or a municipal elector asking for the annulment of a municipal election, when the quality or status of the party suing is put in issue.\nIt has been held in two recent cases in the province of Quebec that when a defendant alleges want of jurisdiction by exception d\u00e9clinatoire the onus of proving that the court has jurisdiction is on the plaintiff; Mc Cready v. Pr\u00e9fontaine ([8]); Fraser. v. Gilroy ([9]).\nWhite Q.C. for respondent.\nUpon reading the fourteenth and fifteenth objections together it is evident they can scarcely be treated as a distinct allegation that the petitioner was not a qualified voter of the county of Stanstead, or that his name was not upon the list of voters. They simply say that petitioner had no right to vote at said election because he was guilty of unlawful acts and corrupt practices at and during the said election, and was, in consequence, disqualified and not entitled to present the petition in this matter.\nSo interpreted the onus probandi was clearly upon the appellant.\nBut even if the fourteenth objection, taken by itself, could be taken as a denial of the petitioner's quality or status, the jurisprudence affecting the question of the onus probandi has been well settled in the province of Quebec; Duval v. Casgrain ([10]); the Megantic Electioii caee ([11]).\nIn this latter case it was held that \"the court being equally divided the judgment of the court below stands confirmed without costs.\"\nThis judgment has been treated in the province of Quebec as settling the procedure to be adopted in this province.\nLater, in 1887, the point was again brought to the attention of the Superior Court in the district of Saint Francis in the case of Hutchison et al. Petitioners v. C. C. Colby, respondent. In that case the respondent had by this preliminary objection specially denied that petitioners had the quality of voters at the time of the election, or that their names appeared upon the voter's lists. When that case was put down for trial the petitioners brought the revising barrister with his lists, in order to prove their status. The judgment of the Superior Court on the preliminary objections was rendered on 22nd December, 1887 and was in these terms: \" The court having heard the parties on the \" preliminary objections, doth dismiss the same with c costs except costs of witnesses which were unnecessary.\"\nThe state of the jurisprudence therefore in the province of Quebec, especially in the district of Saint Francis at the time when the preliminary objections in the present case were filed was as above recited. If the petitioner had brought any witnesses he would have been condemned to pay his own expenses, as the court had already declared that it was unnecessary for him to bring such witnesses.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am prepared to uphold what I said in the Megantic Election case ([12]). I think the burthen of proof was on the petitioner and therefore this appeal should be allowed and the petition dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The onus of proof was on the petitioner but the court below having been justified in following the Quebec jurisprudence and the Megantic case (1) decided by this court on an equal division, the appeal should be allowed without costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Les objections pr\u00e9liminaires en cette cause sont nombreuses, mais une seule a \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement plaid\u00e9e. Cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite pour la preuve sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires devant la cour du district de St. Fran\u00e7ois. Les principales objections sont:\u2014\n14. Farce que le p\u00e9titionnaire n'avait pas droit de voter \u00e0 la dite election.\n15. Farce que le dit p\u00e9titionnaire s'\u00e9tait rendu coupable, pendant la dite \u00e9lection, d'actes ill\u00e9gaux et de men\u00e9es corruptrices et \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence disqualifie et n'avait aucun droit de pr\u00e9senter la petition en cette cause.\nAu jour fix\u00e9 pour la preuve le p\u00e9titionnaire n'en produisit aucune. L'appelant d\u00e9sirant faire preuve demanda la remise de la cause \u00e0 plus tard. Le p\u00e9titionnaire Snow demanda des particularit\u00e9s des actes de corruption qui lui \u00e9tait reproch\u00e9s et la cour les ordonna. Lorsque le jour fix\u00e9 fut arrive, l'appelant d\u00e9clara qu'il n'avait aucune preuve \u00e0 faire,\u2014les objections pr\u00e9liminaires furent alors plaid\u00e9es sans aucune preuve depart ni d'autre.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tendit qu'ayant ni par sa 14e objection le droit de voter du p\u00e9titionnaire, c\u00e9tait \u00e0 celui-ci \u00e0 en faire la preuve et qu'il tait oblige de produire les listes \u00e8lectorales pour prouver sa qualification. 11 aurait peut-\u00eatre pu en \u00e8tre ainsi, si l'appelant s'\u00e9tait borne \u00e0 la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation de la qualit\u00e9 de voteur contenue dans la 14e objection; mais par la 15e il ne s'en tenait plus simplement \u00e0 une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation, mais ii fait au contraire une allegation sp\u00e9ciale que le petitionnaire a perdu son droit de voter paree qu'il s'est rendu coupable d'actes ill\u00e9gaux et de men\u00e9es corruptrices \u00e0 la dite election, et qu'en cons\u00e8quence ii est disqualifi\u00e9 et na aucun droit de presenter la dite petition.\nSur laquelle des deux parties retombait le fardeau de la preuve dans le cas actuel l Toute la question se r\u00e9duit donc \u00e0 savoir qui devait commencer.\nAutrefois devant les comit\u00e8s d\u00e9lection la pratiquo \u00e8tait d'obliger le P\u00e8titionnaire \u00e0 faire preuve preliminairement de sa qualification avant de proc\u00e9der sur le m\u00e9rite de la petition. Get ordre de procedure a \u00e9t\u00e9 change par l'acte des elections contest\u00e9es 49 Vie. ch. 9, see. 12 donnant au membre si\u00e9geant Ia facult\u00e8 de pr\u00e9senter par \u00e8crit des objections pr\u00e8liminaires qu'il a \u00e0 faire valoir contre la petition ou le p\u00e9titionnaire, ou contre toute procedure ult\u00e9rieure La cour doit entendre les parties sur telles objections et les decider d'une mani\u00e8re sommaire.\nLa perte de la qualification par la commission d'actes ill\u00e9gaux ou par des men\u00e9es corruptrices est sans doute un sujet d'objection pr\u00e9liminaire tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux dont le membre si\u00e9geant pouvait se pr\u00e9valoir. S'il ne l'e\u00fbt fait, le p\u00e9titionnaire eut sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 oblige, en proc\u00e9dant au m\u00e9rite, de faire preuve de sa qualification de voteur; mais il n'eut pas \u00e8t\u00e8 oblige de prouver qu'il a perdu sa qualification par des actes ill\u00e9gaux ou des men\u00e9es corruptrices. ces faits forment r\u00e9guli\u0141rement la mati\u00e8re d'une exception que l'appelant \u00e8tait libre de prendre ou de ne pas prendre. D'accus\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait, il a jug\u00e8 \u00e0 propos de se faire accusateur, il en avait le droit. En agissant de cette mani\u00e8re \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 du p\u00e9titionnaire il s'est soumis aux consequences de la maxime excipi endo reus fit actor. Ii a voulu changer l'ordre de la contestation en affirmant que pour des faits sp\u00e9ciaux le p\u00e9titionnaire avait perdu sa qualification de voteur et il doit en faire la preuve. Ii ne s'agit pas ici, comme l'a pr\u00e9tendu le savant conseil de l'appelant, de faire la preuve plus ou moins difficile d'une negation, mais bien de faire preuve de faits tout \u00e0 fait mat\u00e9riels, comme des actes de corruption \u00e8lectorale ou d'autres actes ill\u00e9gaux. Ii n'y a \u00e0 cela aucune impossibilit\u00e9 ni th\u00e9oriqee ni pratique, ce n'est pas la preuve d'une negation qu'on lui demande, c'est la preuve de faits sp\u00e9ciaux qu'il a affirm\u00e9s et all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\nCette question est d\u00e8j\u00e0 venue plusieurs fois devant les tribunaux et semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la jurisprudence. Les savantes dissertations faites par les honorables juges de Ia Cour de Revision \u00e0 Quebec dans la cause de Duval v. Casgrain ([13]) me paraissent avoir \u00e8pusse les arguments \u00e0 faire sur cette question. Le jugement de la cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 que l'onus probandi retomb\u00e2t sur la partie qui avait plaid\u00e8 par objection pr\u00e9liminaire le d\u00e9faut de qualit\u00e9 du p\u00e9titionnaire.\nDans la cause de l'\u00e9lection de M\u00e8gantic, Fr\u00e9chette v Goulet et al. ([14]), la m\u00e8me question fut soulev\u00e9e et d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par l'hon, juge Plamondon dans le m\u00e8me sens que la Cour de Revision. Les parties n'ayant point fait de preuve les objections pr\u00e9liminaires furent renvoy\u00e9es. Ce dernier jugement fut porte en appel devant cette cour; elle est rapport\u00e9e au vol. 8 des rapports de la Cour Supr\u00eame, page 169. Les juges furent \u00e8galement partag\u00e9s d'opinion et les decisions confirm\u00e9es en cons\u00e9quence.\nBien qu'il n'y ait pas une majorit\u00e9 dans cette cour, la jurisprudence \u00e8tablie par la Cour de Revision de Qu\u00e9bec, confirmee par le jugement de cette cour, a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie jusqu'ici. S'il s'agissait de revenir sur une d\u00e9cision qui aurait viol\u00e9 un principe de droit ce serait notre devoir de le faire; mais ii ne s'agit ici que d'une r\u00e8gle de jurisprudence tout \u00e0 fait indiff\u00e9rernte en elle-m\u00e8me qui pourrait tout aussi bien adopter l'affirmative que la negative sur cette question de savoir \u00e0 qui ii incombait de faire la preuve. Le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'ont les plaideurs dans ces r\u00e9gles de procedure, c'est qu'elless soient fix\u00e9es afin de ne pas \u00eatre expos\u00e9s aux inconv\u00e9nients qui pourraient r\u00e9sulter de l'incertitude \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Je ne vois aucun inconvenient \u00e0 maintenir cette jurisprudence, tandis que de son changement ii peut en r\u00e9sulter beaucoup pour les nombreuses contestations qui sont actuellement pendantes devant les tribunaux. En outre elle est suivant moi plus conforme au statut et \u00e0 la maxime excipiendo reus fot actor.\nJe suis d'avis que le jugement devrait ordonner \u00e0. l'appelant de faire preuve sur ses objections pr\u00e8liminaires.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I adhere to the views I expressed in the Megantic Electio\u00efi Case ([15]) but as it is the first time the court is called upon to decide whether or not a previous decision upon an equal division of its members is binding as an authority, with the consent of my learned colleagues I will add that we are of opinion that such a decision is not binding, ([16]), and therefore the preliminary objection taken in this case should prevail the appeal be allowed and the petition dismissed with costs. This is the judgment which, in my opinion, Mr. Justice Brooks should have given, and should be the judgment of this court.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014I retain the opinion expressed by me in the Megantic Election Cose (1), wherein Frechette was appellant and Goulet respondent that for the reasons there given, and upon the authorities there cited, the question upon whom lay the onus of proof upon a preliminary objection to an election petition affirming that the petitioner had no right to vote in whatever way the question might be decided was one affecting merely a point purely of procedure which it was within the competence of the election court conclusively to determine, and that therefore it was not a matter upon this court should entertain an appeal. The case of Frechette v. Goulet (1), proceeded upon the authority of the case of Duval v. CasgraI ([17]), in which case the Court of Review in the district of Que bec held, that in such a case the onus probandaly upon the respondent, who had raised the preliminary objection by averring that the petitioner had no right to vote at the election against the return in which he was petitioning. The court which rendered that judgment was at the time the judgment was rendered the final court for deciding all questions arising upon pre liminary objections to an election petition, and upon all questions of practice and procedure arising in the election court in which the petition was filed. The subsequently the same question was raised in this court from a like judgment rendered in the election court of the same distrIct in Frechctte v. Goulet ([18]) this court was equally divided, and the appeal against the judgment of the learned judge who had followed the practice as laid down by the Court of Review was dismissed without costs; the plain result of this dis missal was that this court declined to interfere with the judgment of the court below upon a question which was in truth only one of mere practice and procedure, and it is not surprising that thenceforth the election court, before which the present case was, should be of opinion, as it was, that this point of procedure was established in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Review in Duval v. Casgrain (1). That this court should now entertain an appeal from a judgment in a like case upon the same point which has followed the practice as so settled in Duval v. Casgrain (1), with the judgment in which case this court has in the case cited declined to interfere seems to me, must confess, scarcely seemly and not calculated to reflect credit upon the administration of justice.\nBut I am of opinion for the reason also given in Frechette v. Goulet ([19]) that the judgment of the courts below upon the point of procedure under consideration was quite correct. The affirmation in a preliminary objection to an election petition, that \" the petitioner had no right to vote,\" is not a joinder in issue upon anything alleged in the election petition\u2014the petition is not before the court upon such an objection\u2014the objection is a substantive affirmation put forward by the respondent as a sufficient reason why he should not be required to answer to, or join issue upon, anything in the petition. The sole duty of the court is to entertain the objection as one first suggested and raised by the respondent in \"justification of his not joining issue upon anything alleged in the petition. The statute provides that if a respondent has any objection to the status of the petitioner, he must present it by a preliminary objection filed within a limited time after the service of the petition. The status of the petitioner could only be affected by showing that he was not on the voters' list in use at the election. Now such an objection, standing by itself in the simple terms that the petitioner had no right to vote, is in truth an affirmation of a conclusion of law without the averment of any fact from which the conclusion is drawn. A right to vote at an election is a legal title incident upon the mere fact that the person claiming the legal right or title is on the votes' list when prepared and revised as required by law. The law expressly enacts that all persons who are on the voters' list so revised have the absolute right to vote at the election for which the list is prepared; an avermen, therefore, that a person had no right to vote at a particular election is nothing more than an argumentative averment that he is not on the voters' list for if he be on the voters' list governing at the election at which he claims to have a right to vote, his right to vote at that election is conclusive in law; the affirmation therefore in a preliminary objection merely that the petitioner had no right to vote at the election, of the return at which he complains, is nothing else than the averment of a conclusion of law without any fact being stated from which the conclusion is drawn, the only fact, however from which it could be drawn being, that he was not upon the voters' list and so was not qualified to he a petitioner, and whether he was or was not on the voters' list was as much within the power of the respondent as of the petitioner to prove: so that upon whomsoever the learned judge in the court below might determine the onus probandi in such a case to be no mischief or prejudice whatsoever could be caused to either party and that an appeal should be entertained and the election petition should be dismissed because the court, following the practice as laid down several years ago by the Court of Review with the judgment of which court this court in Frechet' v Goulet ([20]) declined to interfere decided that the onus probandi lay upon the respondent, seems to me, I must confess to be calculated to bring the administration of justice in these election cases into discredit as tending to frustrate rather than to promote the ends of justice. . But in the present case I am of opinion that the true construction of the matters pleaded by the respondent by way of preliminary objection in the 14th and 15th paragraphs of his objections is, that he avers that the petitioner had no right to vote because the said petitioner was guilty of unlawful acts and corrupt practices at and during the election, and was in consequence disqualified and not entitled to present the petition in this matter. This is the only fact alleged from which the conclusion of law that the petitioner had no right to vote is drawn. This was the view taken by the learned judge in the court below. The learned counsel for the respondent in his argument before us wished. to separate what appears to me to be but one objection into two; in my opinion they are inseparable, and this cannot be done. The paragraphs 14 and 15 are in truth, as it appears to- me, inseparable and therefore, for the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in the opinion that the onus was on the petitioner to prove his allegation that he had a right to vote at the election. He could not present the petition unless he had one of the two qualifications mentioned in the 5th section of the statute, and the form of the petition given in the rules follows an ordinary mode of pleading in requiring him to state the character in which he claims a right to call on the respondent to answer his charges. The shape in which the challenge of his claim is framed is of little consequence. If put in an affirmative form, alleging that he was not entitled to vote at the election it is none the less a traverse of the allegation in the petition, like a plea that a plaintiff who sues as executor is not executor, putting him to the proof of the quality he asserts.\nInstead of adducing such proof by production of the voters' lists, or in some other way, or asking for time to do so in case his reliance on some opinions which have been mentioned to us had led to his being unprepared at the moment, he took the risk of standing on his contention that it devolved upon the respondent to negative the alleged right. He could not therefore reasonably expect relief from this court, even if we could do more than give the judgment which the court below should have given by sustaining the objection made to the petitioner and dismissing the petition.\nThe challenge of the quality of the petitioner is properly a preliminary objection. It is one of those specified in the statute. It has however been sometimes said that it may be incumbent on the petitioner to give evidence of his status at the trial of the petition. I do not so read the statute. I think the question must be decided on the preliminary objections. Why preliminary? Preliminary to what? Clearly, as I understand section 13, preliminary to the duty of the respondent to answer the petition. It must he settled that there is a good petition properly presented by a qualified person, and when that is done\u2014in other words \" within five days after the decision on the preliminary objections, if presented and not allowed, or on the expiration of the time for presenting the same, if none are presented\"\u2014the respondent may file an answer to the petition and if he does not file an answer the petition is all the same to be at issue. Section 5 shows what is here meant by the petition which, whether answered or not, is to be at issue. By that section a petition may be presented complaining of an undue return, an undue election, no return, a double return, or unlawful acts. Those are the matters to be answered after the preliminary matters are settled; the only matters which, in default of an answer, are ipso facto put in issue; and the only matters for investigation at the trial.\nI am of opinion that we should allow the appeal and dismiss the petition.\nAppeal allowed with costs and election petition dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : J.

J., and Taschereau J., affirming the judgment of the court below, Strong and Fournier JJ. contra, that a creditor is not entitled to rank for the full amount of his claim upon the separate estates of insolvent debtors jointly and severally liable for the amount of the debt, but is obliged to deduct from his claim the amount previously received from the estates of the other parties jointly and severally liable therefor.\nPer Gwynne and Patterson JJ. That a person who has realized a portion of his debt upon the insolvent estate of one of his co-debtors, cannot be allowed to rank upon the estate (in liquidation under the Winding-up Act) of his other co-debtors jointly and severally liable without first deducting the amount he has previously received from the estate of his other co-debtor R. S. C. ch. 129 sec. 62. The Winding-up Act.\nHeld, also (affirming the judgment of the court below) that a person who makes a deposit with a bank after its suspension, the deposit consisting of cheques of third parties drawn on and accepted by the bank in question, is not entitled to be paid by privilege the amount of such deposit.\nAfter the case was argued the appellant with the consent of the respondent obtained from a judge of the court below an order to extend the time for bringing the appeal, and subsequently before the time expired he got an order from the Registrar of the Supreme Court, sitting as a Judge in Chambers, giving him leave to appeal in accordance with section 76 of the Winding-up Act, and the order declared that all proceedings had upon the appeal should he considered as taken subsequent to the order granting leave to appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, Montreal district ([2]), maintaining the contestation of the appellants' claim upon the Exchange Bank in liquidation.\nThe Ontario Bank creditors of the Exchange Bank, on the 5th June, 1886, filed an amended claim with the liquidators of the Exchange Bank of Canada, which had stopped payment on the 17th September, 1883, and had gone into liquidation under the Winding-up Act ([3]). The claim consisted of two items of $11,216.56, including a sum of $15,766.56, concerning which there was no contestation, and $6,450.000 in respect of certain promissory notes of Hyde, Turcot & Co., insolvents, which had been discounted for the Exchange Bank in 1883, and the payment of which at maturity had been guaranteed, and a further sum of $939.85, representing a deposit made by the Ontario Bank of several cheques drawn by customers of the Exchange Bank upon their accounts there, which cheques were handed in to the bank, after suspension of payment but before the Ontario Bank was aware of the suspension, and were passed to the credit of the Ontario Bank and charged against the several drawers of them, and which amount the Ontario Bank asked to he paid by preference.\nIn 1884 when the Ontario Bank first proved its claim under the Winding-up Act, it credited the Exchange Bank with the dividends it had received from the insolvent estate of Hyde, Turcot & Co., viz.: $2,454.29, but in the amended claim these dividends were not deducted.\nThe respondent Edward Chaplin, a creditor of the Exchange Bank in liquidation, contested the amended claim of the Ontario Bank on the ground that the Ex-change Bank being liable as endorsers, were entitled to the credit of the dividends received by the Ontario Bank on Hyde, Turcot & Co.'s promissory notes, and that the cheques not having been presented until after the suspension of the bank, could not be paid by preference.\nThe written guarantee of the Exchange Bank when Hyde, Turcot & Co.'s notes were discounted reads as follows:\u2014\n\"DR.

CRAIG,\n\" President, Exchange Bank of Canada,\n\" Montreal, 21st August, 1883.\" The contestation of the amended claim of the Ontario Bank was maintained by the Superior Court and the Court of Queen's Bench.\nUpon the appeal to the Supreme court of Canada, the only questions argued were:\u2014\n1. As to the right of a creditor to rank for the full amount of his claim, upon the separate estates of two insolvent debtors jointly and severally liable for the amount of the debt; or, in the present case, the right of the appellants to rank for the full amount of their claim founded upon notes discounted for the Ex-change Bank, without deducting from their claim the amount received from other parties jointly and severally liable with the bank upon the notes; and\n2. As to the right of the appellants to be paid by privilege the amount of a deposit made with the Exchange Bank of Canada after its suspension, represented by cheques of third parties accepted by the Exchange Bank, and placed to the credit of the . appellants.\nAfter the case was set down for hearing the appellant having failed to obtain leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in accordance with section 76 of the Winding-up Act, obtained from the judge of the court below an order extending the time for leave to appeal, and before the time expired the Registrar of the Supreme Court to whom a motion nunc pro tunc was referred granted leave to appeal, and his order declared that all proceedings had upon the appeal should be considered as taken subsequent to the order grating leave to appeal.\nThe case which had been argued at the May sessions 1890, was ordered to be reargued at the February sessions 1891, in order that the case should be decided by the full court Mr. Justice Taschereau being absent at the May sessions 1890. Abbott Q.C. for appellants; and Geoffrion Q.C. and J. H. Greenshields Q. C. for respondent. The points of argument and cases cited are fully reviewed in the reports of the case (1), and in the judgments herein-after given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I entirely agree with the Court of Queen's Bench that there is no foundation for the appellants' claim to preferential payment of the amount of the cheques deposited by the appellants in the Exchange Bank after its suspension.\nI am, however, of opinion that the appellants are entitled in other respects to succeed in their appeal. The promissory notes for the full amount of which the appellants claim to be ranked as creditors without deducting payments received from other parties were discounted by the appellants in the ordinary course of business, the Exchange Bank having first endorsed them. The latter bank thus became liable upon the paper jointly and severally with the prior parties to it. The appellants had therefore, prim\u00e2 facie, a legal right to get the benefit of this liability in solido by actions brought against all or any of the parties so liable. This being so it seems reasonable that the same right\u2014to obtain payment in full\u2014should be conserved to the creditor in the case of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the debtors\u2014against the bankrupt or insolvent estates unless there is some positive law or enactment to the contrary. There being no such enactment, the solution of the question must depend entirely on the old law of France as it existed at the time of the cession of the country, which law formed the common law of Lower Canada. Without entering upon a critical examination of the various authorities which have been cited it is sufficient for me to say upon this point that I have come to the conclusion that the ancient law of France was that which was finally established by the jurisprudence. The state of this jurisprudence is shown by the arr\u00eat of the Parliament of Paris of the 18th of June, 1776, and the arr\u00eat of the Council of the 24th February, 1778, reversing the decision of the Parliament of Aix of the 18th June, 1776, which last arr\u00eat is reported by Emerigon ([4]). The law as thus declared was embodied in Art. 542 of the Code of Commerce. I cannot after a full consideration of all the authorities agree with the Court of Queen's Bench in holding that this was new law introduced for the first time by the Code of Commerce, and applicable only to commercial matters; on the contrary, the best opinion I can form is that it was the reproduction of a principle which was established law not only in commercial but also in civil matters. I am led to form this opinion not only by what is said by authors of high authority, particularly Mass\u00e9 ([5]); Alauzet ([6]); Delvincourt ([7]); Rivi\u00e8re ([8]); Bravard-Veyri\u00e8res, ([9]); and Larombi\u00e8re ([10]); but also by the consideration that in no other way can the creditor who has the joint and several obligation of several debtors obtain his right to a full payment save by treating each person obliged to him as the sole debtor. One of the authors before mentioned, Bravard-Veyri\u00e8res, in the 7th edition of his work edited by Demangeat, has so clearly demonstrated this upon principle, as to convince me that the creditor has a right to prove for the full amount of his debt against each estate without deducting payments received from the other, and that no other conclusion can be consistent with the contractual rights of a creditor to whom several debtors are bound in solido.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed to the extent above indicated.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014La question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider en cette cause est absolument la m\u00eame que celle soulev\u00e9e dans la cause de Benning et al. v. Simpson et al. et l'hon.R. Thi-baudeau ([11]), au sujet du droit d'un cr\u00e9ancier de se pr\u00e9senter dans chaque masse en faillite de ses co-d\u00e9biteurs solidaires pour la totalit\u00e9 de la somme qui lui est due. Il y a aussi la question de savoir si l'appelante a un privil\u00e8ge pour se faire payer de la somme de $939.00 qu'elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la banque d'Echange apr\u00e8s la fermeture de ses portes, pour insolvabilit\u00e9.\nDans la premiere cause il est indubitable qu'il y avait solidarit\u00e9, parce que la cr\u00e9ance des appelants \u00e9tait pour la plus grande partie fond\u00e9e surdes billets promissoires, sign\u00e9s par diverses personnes et endoss\u00e9s par Marcotte en faveur des appelants Benning et al.

Il ne faut pas le confondre avec le cautionnement ordinaire parce qu'il produit des effets plus \u00e9tendus.\nL'aval, de quelque mani\u00e8re qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, produit de plein droit la solidarit\u00e9, etc., etc.\nSur la nature et les effets de l'aval ii n'y a aucune difference d'opinion dans le droit fran\u00e7ais. Celui qui a garanti un effet de commerce est toujours solidaire de celui qu'il garantit. Ce principe n'a nullement \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en question dans cette cause. Les deux cours Sup\u00e9rieure et du Banc de la Reine l'ont \u00e9galement reconnu. Le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 ce sujet:\nAttendu que la r\u00e9clamante, dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la contestation du contestant, all\u00e8gue: que, dans le mois d'ao\u00fbt mil huit cent quatre-vingt-trois, la r\u00e9clamante a pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque d'Echange du Canada, la somme de trente-cinq mille deux cent quatre-vingt-dix-huit piastres et cinq centins, et lui a escompt\u00e9, en faisant ce pr\u00eat, divers billets promissoires qu'elle avait alors, et pour le paiement desquels la dite banque d'Echange se rendit conjointement et solidairement responsable, avec les personnes oblig\u00e9es au paiement de ces billets, qu'au nombre de ces billets s'en trouvaient trois de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Hyde, Turcot et Cie, au mon- tant de deux mille cent cinquante piastres chacun.\nLa cour du Banc de la Reine a aussi admis la solidarite en confirmant purement et simplement le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Cela suffit pour r\u00e9gler la question de solidarit\u00e9 entre la banque d'Echange et les souscripteurs et endosseurs des billets garantis par la lettre ci-dessus cit\u00e9e.\nComme on le volt, la question dans cette cause se r\u00e9sume, comme dans celle de Benning et al., \u00e0 savoir si l'appelante a droit \u00e0 un dividende sur le montant de sa demande, ou bien seulement sur la balance de sa reclamation, apr\u00e8s d\u00e9duction faite du dividende re\u00e7u dans la faillite de Hyde, Turcot et Cie.\nJe ne crois pas devoir r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici l'argument que j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait sur cette question dans la cause de Benning et at ([12]), o\u00f9 j'en suis venu \u00e0la conclusion que le cr\u00e9ancier solidaire peut se pr\u00e9senter pour le plein montant de sa cr\u00e9ance dans les diff\u00e9rentes masses en faillite de ses d\u00e9biteurs solidaires jusqu'\u00e0 entier paiement de sa cr\u00e9ance.\nVoir aussi Ruben de Cauder. Dict. de droit com-mercial ([13]).\n1 L'aval est une esp\u00e8ce de cautionnement, mais il ne faut pas le confondre avec le cautionnement ordinaire parce qu'il produit des effets plus \u00e9tendus.\n7. Aucune forme particuli\u00e8re n'est prescrite pour l'aval.\n24. L'aval de quelque mani\u00e8re qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, produit de plein droit la solidarit\u00e9 et assuj\u00e9tit celui qui l'a souscrit \u00e0 toutes les obligations de la personne pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9.\nLes parties conservent la facult\u00e9 d'en restreindre l'\u00e9tendue par des stipulations particuli\u00e8res. 25. Mais ces restrictions ne se supposent pas. A moins d'une convention expresse le donneur d'aval est soumis aux m\u00eames obligations que le d\u00e9biteur principal.\nQuant \u00e0 la somme de $939.80 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de privil\u00e8ge, je concours dans les motifs donn\u00e9s par l'honorable juge Mathieu pour justifier son refus de reconna\u00eetre l'existence d'un privil\u00e8ge pour le remboursement de cette somme.\nD'apr\u00e8s mon opinion le jugement de la cour du Banc de la Reine devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le droit \u00e0 l'appelante d'\u00eatre colloqu\u00e9e sur le plein montant de sa r\u00e9clamation sans deduction du dividende de Hyde, Turcot et Cie.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nGWYNEE J.\u2014There are two sums only as to which questions are raised upon this appeal, viz., $2,454.29 and $944.81; as to this latter sum the Ontario Bank claim a right to rank as privileged creditors on the Exchange Bank in liquidation. As to the $2,454.29, the question is whether the Ontario Bank should be allowed to amend a claim brought in and proved by them on oath against the Exchange Bank in liquidation, by erasing from the credit side of the said claim so proved the above sum for which in their claim they had given credit as received out of certain promissory notes discounted by the Ontario Bank for and at the request of and guaranted by the Exchange Bank. If the Exchange Bank had continued solvent they could not have been held liable in an action brought against them upon their contract of guarantee for any greater amount than remained due and unpaid upon the notes guaranteed at the time of the commencement of the action. So in like manner, upon the Ontario Bank bringing in and proving their claim against the Ex-change Bank in liquidation under the Winding-up Act, they could not be received as claimants against the bank in liquidation for a larger amount than that bank would have been liable for in an action if sol-vent, the Ontario Bank could not be recognized as creditors for a greater amount than was actually due by their debtor. When therefore the Ontario Bank in their claim made in December, 1884, which was proved upon the oath of their agent, gave credit for the above sum of $2,594.29 theretofore received by them upon the notes which were guaranteed by the Exchange Bank, they acted quite correctly in so doing and to the claim as then made, and which in truth was the only one existing, they must be held.\nAs to the $944.81 the claim is founded upon the fact that the Exchange Bank after they had stopped payment but before the Ontario Bank were aware thereof, received from the Ontario Bank for deposit to their credit certain cheques made in their favour by certain, customers of the Exchange Bank upon them, and which had been marked as good by the latter bank (and received or marked by the Ontario Bank before the Exchange Bank stopped payment) and entered the amounts of the cheques to the credit of the Ontario Bank's account in the books of the Exchange Bank. This entry was in fact but a completion of the undertaking involved in the marking the cheques as good a couple of days previously before the bank had stopped payment. But assuming this conduct of the Exchange Bank in entering those cheques to the credit of the Ontario Bank as above stated without in-forming the Ontario Bank of the stoppage of payment by the former, to have constituted an actionable wrong to the Ontario Bank, the nature of their banks remedy was to compel a return of the cheqhes so as to enable the Ontario Bank to look to the persons who had given them the cheques and the latter to have proved against the Exchange Bank in liquidation. Not having pursued that remedy, but on the contrary made claim against the Exchange Bank as their debtors in respect of their deposit, and having proved the item in their claim presented in December, 1884, in the liquidation, they can only claim in respect of that de-posit as ordinary creditors. To allow them to rank as privileged creditors in respect of that item, would operate to the prejudice of the general creditors of the bank in liquidation, and there is in my opinion no foundation whatever in law for the appellants' contention. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The Ontario Bank discounted for the\nExchange Bank, on the 21st of August, 1883, a number of promissory notes, three of which were made by Hyde, Turcot & Co., the whole amounting to $36,044.-46, and the Exchange Bank gave a written guarantee of the prompt payment of all the notes at maturity. The notes were all paid by the parties to them, except those of Hyde Turcot & Co. who became insolvent.\nThe Exchange Bank stopped payment on the 17th of September, 1883, and went into liquidation under the Winding-up Act. If I correctly understand the documents before us none of the notes fell due until after September, 1883, but they had all fallen due before the filing of the claim of the Ontario Bank on which the present contest arises.\nThat claim was proved on the 5th of June, 1886. It consists of two items. One is a special claim for $939.85 the consideration of which we may defer. It has no reference to the notes. The other item of $11,216.56, includes $5.472.97 concerning which there is no question before us, and $5,743.59 in respect of the notes. This amount is produced by debiting, as of the 21st of August, 1883, $35,298.05 for cash advanced, being the proceeds of the $36,044.46 of notes discounted on that day, and crediting $29,554.46, the amount of all the notes except those of Hyde, Turcot & Co, Those three notes amounted to $6,450, and the Ontario Bank had received in March and June, 1884, before they proved any claim under the winding-up of the Exchange Bank, two dividends from the insolvent estate of Hyde, Turcot & Co., amounting together to $2,454.29.\nThe proof made on the 5th of June 1886, was an amended claim. A claim had been proved on the 30th of December, 1884, in which credit had been given for these dividends but that was withdrawn and the contest, on this branch of the case is whether the appellants are bound to deduct the dividends from their claim of $5,743.59, or have the right to rank for the whole amount.\nIt seems perfectly plain that the contention of the appellants cannot be maintained if the transaction is treated as they have treated it in their proof of claim. It is there represented as a loan to the Exchange Bank of $35,298 05 for which that corporation was primarily liable as borrower and the notes security for the loan. I am inclined to think that in putting the claim in this shape the appellants truly represented its real character but if so they ought to have proved as for a secured claim under section 62 of the Winding-up Act ([14]), and cannot be allowed to rank without first accounting for the value of their security. The argument for the appellants, however, ignores the form in which their claim was presented to the liquidator, and failing back upon the ostensible trans-action of a discount of notes with a letter of guaranty asserts a joint and several obligation, the co-debtors being, in the case of each note the makers or endorsers of the notes and the bank as guarantor. This question of joint and several obligation is one which I do not find free from difficulty, and the authorities, which are fully cited and examined by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Benning v. Thibaudeau ([15]), are by no means agreed upon it. My own opinion inclines to the recognition in this case of the joint and several obligation. I think that opinion is supported by articles 1103, 1104, 1105 and 2310 of the Civil Code, in connection with which I may refer to an English authority. In the case of Liquidators of Overend, Gurney & Co. v. Liqui-dators of Oriental Financial Corporation ([16]) there was a guaranty in these terms:\nI agree to indemnify you for all the loss that you may incur by discounting the bills, and in the event of the same not being paid at maturity, I engage to pay the amount of the bills on demand.\nLord Cairns speaking of that guaranty said:\nTo all intents and purposes as regarded Overend and Gurney (who had discounted the bills) Mr. Henry (the guarantor) was exactly in the same position as t) these bills as if his name had been found on the bills as a party to them. He had promised to pay them on demand when they reached maturity. Although he had given that promise not upon the face of the bills hut upon a collateral writing to all intents and purposes he was bound by the fate of the bills.\nThere appears to be an embarrassing conflict of opinion respecting the consequence of this joint and several liability. Does it entitle the creditor to rank on the estate of each of the co-debtors for the full amount of the debt, not crediting either estate with the amount realized from the other until his debt is fully paid? In Benning v. Thibaudeau ([17]), Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 answers the question in the affirmative, differing therein from the opinion of Chief Justice Meredith in Rochette v. Louis ([18]), and supporting his opinion by an able and learned argument which however failed to convince Mr. Justice Andrews, who in Chinic v. Rat-tray ([19]) adhered to the view that the law of France at the time of the cession of Canada to Great Britain which is conceded on all hands to afford the rule in the absence of legislation, was as it was declared to be by Chief Justice Meredith in Roehette's case. I do not feel that we are at present called upon to decide between these divergent opinions, because I think the question is concluded by section 62 of the Winding-up Act. The debt of the Exchange Bank to the appellants was a secured debt to the extent of the value of the notes they held. The appellants advance in their factum some arguments against this view. They urge that this being a commercial transaction, and therefore a joint and several obligation under article 1105, the bank is liable jointly and severally with the other parties on the paper. Granted; but so it is in any case of maker and endorser, and yet it cannot be doubted that in view of section 62, the maker of a promissory note is security to the endorsee. It is further submitted that the section deals only with negotiable paper upon which the company is indirectly or secondarily liable, and that in any event it merely requires a valuation of the security when the paper is not due or exigible. It is urged by the appellants in another part of their factum on the authority of Demolombe ([20]) and Sirey ([21]), that the account must he regarded as of the date of the insolvency and not as of the date of the proof. That proposition, if it were true in proceedings under the Winding-up Act, would displace the point taken touching debts not due or exigible, because the notes in question were not due when the winding-up proceedings commenced. But, apart from that, the appellants do not read section 62 correctly. The section makes provision for the case of a creditor holding a claim based upon negotiable instruments on which the company is only indirectly or secondarily liable and which is not mature or exiglible, enacting that such creditor shall be considered to hold security within the meaning of the section, and shall put a value on the liability of the person primarily liable thereon as being his security for the payment thereof, but that after the maturity of such liability and its non-payment he shall be entitled to amend and revalue his claim. This is in my judgment, a distinct affirmance, as applied to the present case, of the claim against the Exchange Bank being, in view of section 62, a secured claim, whether we regard the claim as of the commencement of the winding-up when the liability was not mature or exigible, or as of the date of the filing of the proof when the value of the security had been ascertained and realized Whatever may be the true doctrine respecting the rights of a creditor who proves the same debt against the estates of two joint and several debtors and however the general rule may be ultimately settled, it is clear to my apprehension that there are cases, of which the present is one, where an obligation which under articles 1103, 1104, 1105 and 2310 C.C. is joint and several, must be dealt with under the Winding-up Act as provable against the estate of one of two co-debtors as a debt secured by the liability of the other.\nI am of opinion that the appellants have been correctly held to be bound to deduct the dividends and to be entitled to rank only for the balance of their claim.\nI believe this opinion agrees with the jurisprudence which has obtained in the province of Quebec under our Insolvent Acts of 1869 and 1875, which contained provisions similar to those of section 62 of the Winding-up Act. I refer to In re Bessette ([22]); to Rochette v.Louis ([23]), and to remarks by Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 in Benning v. Thibaudeau ([24]).\nThe appellants in executing the deed of composition and discharge of Hyde, Turcot & Co. noted that they did not waive their recourse against the bank. Nothing now turns on that reservation. The right of re-course against the bank has been accorded to the appellants without question notwithstanding their re-lease of Hyde, Turcot & Co. The recourse stipulated for was, as I understand it for the amount released not for the amount received.\nThe contest respecting the claim of the appellants to be paid by preference an item of $939.85 relates only to a part of that amount which represents a deposit, made by the appellants, of several cheques drawn by customers of the bank upon their accounts there which cheques were handed in to the bank after the suspension of payment but before the appellants were aware of the suspension, and were passed to the credit of the appellants and charged against the several drawers of them.\nI do not think it necessary to say more as to the claim to rank as preferred creditors for this amount than that, while the appellants apparently make out of the circumstances a case of some hardship, I have not been able to perceive any valid grounds for admit-ting their claim to be collocated as preferred creditors.\nOn both branches of the case I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitors for respondents : Greenshields, Guerin & Greenshields.\n[1] M.L.R. 5 Q. 13. 407.\n[2] 15 Rev.

Disturbance of lessee's use Claim for reduction of rent\u2014Trespass\u2014Trouble de droit.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed appellant's action and incidental demand\nThe action was instituted for reduction of rent and damages under the lassoes and lessees articles of the Code of Civil Procedure and article 1612 and following of the Civil Code.\nOn the 17th of August, 1881, by deed or instrument executed under private signature an agreement was entered into between the appellants and the respondents in this cause, by which the appellants undertook for a period of ninety-seven years from the 1st of July 1881, to work, manage and operate the system of telegraph lies then owned and operated by the respondents, including the telegraph lines erected along the Southeastern Railway line and other railways under certain agreements, and to pay the respondents quarterly during the continuance of the arrangement a sum equal to the dividend at 8 per centum upon the respondents' capital stock of $2,000,000, with the further yearly sum of $5,000 to meet office expenses. In accordance with this agreement the appellants took' possession of the respondents system of telegraph lines and have since managed and operated the same.' By their action the appellants averred that since the 17th of September they had been troubled in their enjoyment of the respondents' system of telegraph lines by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, which now possesses and controls the South-eastern Railway and other railways and have constructed lines of telegraph along the same, by which in contravention to the agreements above mentioned, the company transmits for remuneration messages for the general public, thus causing a diminution of business and thereby great loss to the appellants, and concluded by their action and incidental demand by asking an annual reduction of $80,000 rent\nUpon the pleadings and evidence the Superior Court ([1]) whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([2]), dismissed the appellants' action and incidental demand on the ground that the alleged interference by the Canadian Pacific Railway with the rights and privileges acquired by the respondents under agreements with the South-eastern Railway Company and other companies referred to in the agreement of the 17th August, 1881, was a mere trespass which did not constitute a trouble de droil, and did not authorize an action for a reduction of rent under arts. 1616 and 1618 C.C.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIrvine Q.C., Girouard Q.C. and H.

The defendants denied plaintiff's title. At the trial plaintiff gave no evidence of actual damage but claimed that an action was necessary to protect his title. Evidence was given to show that the alleged trespass was committed beyond the street line, and plaintiff claimed that the street had never been dedicated to the public and his ownership extended to the centre.

R.S.C. ch. 109, it was held by two courts that the arbitrators had acted in good faith and fairness in considering the value of the property before the railway passed thought it, and its value after the railway had been constructed; and that the sum awarded was not so grossly and scandalously inadequate as to shock one's sense of justice.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld,\u2014that the judgment should not be interfered with.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), at Montreal, confirming a judgment of the Hon. Mr. Justice Wurtele, rendered the 22nd of June, 1889, dismissing the plaintiffs' action to set aside an award of arbitrators under the Railway Act ([2]).\nThe \"plaintiffs are the executors of the late \"William Moody, of C\u00f4te St. Antoine. The railway company located their line across the property of his estate at C\u00f4te St. Antoine and gave the executors notice of expropriation in ordinary form in March, 1887, offering in compensation $3,701, and appointing Mr. Norman T. Rielle, advocate, to be their arbitrator, and the plaintiffs named as their arbitrator Joseph Barsalou of Montreal auctioneer and the two arbitrators chose as third arbitrator John M. M. Duff Esq., of Montreal, \"accountant.\nThe arbitrators having proceeded to hold meetings and hear witnesses by a decision of a majority awarded $5000 to the appellants their arbitrator dissenting. The action was brought to set aside the award on the ground inter alia of the gross inadequacy and unfairness of the award, amounting to a fraud on appellants' rights, and secondly, but mainly, on the ground that the arbitrators had taken into consideration to determine the amount of their award matters which they had no right to take into account. The evidence given at the trial is reviewed at length in the judgment of Mr. Justice Wurtele, reported in M. L. R. 5 S. 0. 137.\nLaflamme Q.C. and Trenholme Q.C. for appellants, contended on the evidence that the two arbitrators had awarded appellants less than they would have done but for the unwarrantable assumption of the existence of a depot in the vicinity affording access by rail to appellants' property.\nTue Duke of Buccleuch v. The Metropolitan Board, of Works ([3]); Brown v Providence Railroad Co. ([4]); Re Credit Valley Railway Go. and Spragge ([5]) James V. Ontario & (Quebec R.W.Co ([6]); were cited and on the evidence that the award was grossly unfair and inadequate. Dalloz Rep. G\u00e9n. ([7]); Re Taylor & Ontario & Quebec Ry. Co.

The Queen ([12]) and R.S.C. ch. 109 sec. 8 sub secs. 20-21.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J._The plaintiffs, appellants, seek to have an award made on the twenty-sixth of July, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, establishing the compensation to be paid to them by the company defendant for the land to be taken from their property for its railway, declared illegal, fraudulent and void, and to get it set aside and annulled for various reasons which on this appeal were reduced to three.\n1st. Because the said award is so grossly and scandalously inadequate as to be a fraud on the plaintiffs and the result of partiality on the part of the two arbitrators who made the same\n2nd. Because the said two arbitrators in making their award assumed as a fact that the company defendants were going to erect and maintain a station at or near the plaintiff's property, and that the company defendants would permit the plaintiffs to place pipes through the land to he expropriated for water and drainage; and\n3rd. Because the said two arbitrators took into consideration the increased value alleged to be given to the remainder of the plaintiff's property by the construction of the railway, and set it off not only against the inconvenience, loss and damages to be suffered by the plaintiffs using the land to be expropriated, but also in deduction of the value of the land and buildings to be taken The action was dismissed in the two courts below and I am of opinion that these judgments cannot be impugned. No ground has been shown which would justify the maintaining of the plaintiffs' action. The \"arbitrators were the sovereign judges of the amount the plaintiffs were entitled to and there is no foundation for the allegation that they ever took into consideration matters which they were not entitled to consider. They seem to have considered the whole matter with utmost fairness taking the value of the property before the railway passed, then its value after the railway passed, and deducting the one from the other awarded the difference to the plaintiffs.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitors for appellants : Taylor & Buchan.\nSolicitors for respondents : Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\n[1] M.L.R. 6 Q.P. 385.\n[2] M.L.R. 5 S.C. 136.\n[3] L.

The plan referred to lad been made by a canvasser for insurance, who had obtained the application, and the building on said plan marked \"feed house,\" did not in any respect conform to the description in the policy, but another building thereon answered the description in every way except as to the designation \"feed house.\" The goods insured were stored in this latter building and were burnt. The company refused to pay, alleging breach of a condition in the policy that no inflammable materials should be stored on the said premises, as well as misdescription of the building containing the goods insured. In an action on the policy it appeared that a barrel of oil was in the building marked \"feed house\" at the time of the fire. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and a nonsuit, moved for pursuant to leave reserved, was refused by the full court.\nHeld, that the non-suit was rightly refused; that it was evident that the building in which the goods were stored was that intended to be described in the policy; that the building marked \"feed house\" being detached from that in which the goods were was a suitable place for storing oil, which, therefore, was not a breach of the condition; that the case was a proper one for the application of the maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet, but if not the matter was one for the jury ho had pronounced upon it. Held further, that the canvasser who secured the application could not be regarded as agent of the assured, but was the agent of the company which was bound by his acts.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to order a nonsuit moved for pursuant to leave reserved at the trial\nThe application for insurance was written by one Murray, a canvasser for several insurance companies including the defendant company, who had applied to the plaintiff and requested him to insure with the defendants. The application was written by Murray and signed by the plaintiff at Penobsquis, about fifteen miles from his residence, and was taken by Murray, who told the plaintiff that he had seen the buildings and knew their situation and would make a plan of them to accompany the application, to which the plaintiff assented, and Murray accordingly made a plan or diagram on the back of the application which he sent to the defendants, who issued the policy above referred to and sent it to the plaintiff.\nThe application asked for insurance on the plaintiffs goods contained in a building known as a storeroom and feed house. The plan represented the plaintiff's dwelling-house as facing the west, with an attached to the rear or east side of it marked as a woodshed. On the north side of the woodshed and attached to it (the space between them was about four feet) was another building marked on the plan as feed house.\nThe plan was admitted to be incorrect. The building marked \"feed house\" had been built for a pig pen, and was not as high as the building marked \"woodshed,\" which was a story and a half high with a chimney in it extending from the upper flat of the building through the roof for the reception of a stove-pipe. This building was fitted up as a store or shop with a counter and shelves for holding goods, and was used by the plaintiff as his store or shop, the goods destroyed being in it at the time of the fire. There were no goods in the other building (the \"feed house\" as marked on the plan) except a barrel of oil. That building has never been used by the plaintiff as his shop or storehouse there being no floor in it nor any fitting as a store.\nThe company resisted payment, contending that there was no contract to insure the goods that were destroyed. In an action on the policy a verdict was entered for the plaintiff with leave reserved to defendants to move for a nonsuit on the ground that the misdescription avoided the policy. A nonsuit having been refused on such motion defendants appealed to this court.\nWeldon Q.C. for the appellant, cited Wyld v. The Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co.[1]; Hastings Fire Ins. Co. v. Shannon[2]; Gore Ins. Co. v. Samo[3]; Lyle v. Richards[4]; Hews v. Atlas Ins. Co.[5].\nMcLeod Q.C. for the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I have no doubt whatever as to this case, and have had none since I first heard the statements made by the counsel. There was an application for insurance on a general stock consisting of dry good's, &c., and on the margin were these words: \"Describe particularly how the property is built, where situated, how occupied, &c.\" To this there was annexed a plan made by a Mr. Murray, a canvasser of the respondents, in which it appeared that there was a building marked \"feed house,\" and another marked \"woodshed,\" attached to the kitchen of the dwelling-house. The application was accepted, and the goods of the applicant were insured for one year in consideration of the premium of thirty dollars. Now let us see what the property was that was insured. It was $2,000 on a general stock consisting of dry goods, groceries, &c., while contained in that one-and-a half story building with shingled roof, occupied as a storehouse for storing horse feed and provisions for lumber camps, said building shown on plan on back of application for insurance as \"feed house,\" situate attached to woodshed of assured's dwelling-house, &c. Now, it is contended that this building marked \"feed house\" on the plan, which is stated to have been originally, whatever it is now, a pig sty and which was without windows, and was not attached to any other building but stood alone, is the one intended to be described in this policy; but it cannot be contended, I think, that the assured so intended; there was a barrel of oil in this building and it would be a very suitable place for storing oil which they were not allowed to keep on the premises, but it would be a most unsuitable place to keep the stock which was insured in this case. Then again the building described in the policy had a shingled roof and was occupied as a storehouse for storing feed and provisions. This building was shown never to have been occupied for doing any of these things. It was also said to be a one-and-a-half story building attached to assured's dwelling-house, and this building was not attached but was a separate building, entirely distinct and apart from the dwelling-house. But the building in which the goods actually were was a one-and-a-half story building attached to the dwelling-house and occupied and known as a storehouse and entirely answers the description in the policy.\nNow it appears, to me, so far as my judgment in this matter goes, that if ever there was a case where the maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet would apply that this is peculiarly such a case; but suppose the maxim does not apply, it is quite clear that it is a question for the jury who have already determined that the building in which the goods were which were intended to be insured was the building occupied as a storehouse for storing feed and provisions. Under these circumstances I cannot entertain a doubt that the insured is entitled to recover his loss under the policy.\nI cannot look upon a party who goes around for the purpose of obtaining insurance in any other way than as acting for the company, and I cannot see how the company is free from liability for his acts where, as in this case, he undertakes to put in with the application a plan of the building, and it was necessary that this plan should be inquired into. If all the other indicia are present, which is the case here, we have all the material necessary to determine the question put before us, and I do not think it possible to submit the case to any jury who would not find that the goods were kept in a proper building and not in a building erected for a pig-sty, and it having been left to the jury, and the court having determined that the evidence established the fact that the building really described in the policy was the one in which the goods were stored, the finding should not be interfered with. The appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. The principle upon which the Supreme Court of New Brunswick proceeded, as appears from the very full and able judgments of the learned judges who took part in the decision, was in my judgment perfectly sound. The case appears, as I said during the argument, to be one of latent ambiguity, one in which, though upon the face of the policy no difficulty or inconsistency appears, yet difficulty does arise in applying the description contained in the policy to the buildings as they actually appear on the grounds. This being so parol evidence is admissible to remove such a latent ambiguity. The first thing we have to inquire is, whether the goods described in the policy are the same as, or are different from, those on the premises which were burnt. To do that we must be able to identify the stock of goods burnt with those mentioned in the policy. In the policy the goods are described as being in a one-and-a-half story frame building, with shingled roof, shown on the plan on the back of application for insurance, as \"feed house.\" But when we come to look at the premises we find that the feed house is not a one-and-a-half story building with shingled roof; then the further description is that the goods are in a building occupied as a storehouse for storing horse feed, and the feed house was not at the time so occupied, but another building was. And then, we also find that the goods are said to be in a building attached to the woodshed of the dwelling-house. Now the feed house does not appear to have been so attached; therefore this examination of the premises and the evidence of the surrounding circumstances show that it was impossible to apply the description in the policy to the plan. That is the very case in which parol evidence is admissible.\nThen the Supreme Court of New Brunswick has dealt with the case as a question of fact, and treating the question as ore of fact, of course they have come to the only conclusion which is inevitable. If parol evidence is admissible any reasonable person, considering the evidence and all the circumstances and looking at the plan, must hold that the goods which were in the building marked \"woodshed\" on the plan, and which were destroyed, were the goods intended to be insured by the policy. As regards misrepresentation, I do not think that the plan and the application are to be looked upon as emanating from the insured, but must be regarded as emanating from the company. Murray was really an officer of the company, and what he did unless the contrary is clearly shown, was the act of the company. Therefore I do not think that there was any misrepresentation by the assured in the case.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the correct construction of the policy is not that the goods insured are only insured in the small building on the place called \"feed shed.\" The policy says distinctly that the goods insured are in a one-and-a-half story building, covered with shingles, occupied as a storehouse. What that building was was a matter of evidence, and the \"feed shed\" is not pretended to be such a building. The only error in truth is that of the person who drew up the policy and who made it say, rather ridiculously, and without any authority for so doing, that the building covered with shingles used as a storeroom for storing horse feed, &c., of the height of one-and-a-half stories, which the feed shed is not, is the feed shed. In my opinion the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I understand that in this case several wooden buildings attached to each other were destroyed by the same fire. The goods in question were deposited in one of those buildings. The premium of insurance in one would be just as much as in any of the others. The company say \"these goods which were insured in one of these buildings were not in the one which we understood to have been described in our policy.\" Now if the company can succeed in that defence it must be upon some principle of law or upon the contract between the parties. I know of no principle of law, and none has been indicated, which apart from the terms of the contract would lead to any such result as the company contend for. If there was any wilful misrepresentation the principle of fraud would come in, but that is not suggested.\nLet us see what the contract was. We have the policy with a number of conditions set out in the declaration. Of these conditions the two which may apply to this case are nos. 1 and 2.\nNo. 1 deals with two things: first, the insurance on the building; secondly, on goods. Next it deals with the application:\nEvery person desirous of effecting an insurance must state his name, place of abode, and occupation. He must describe the construction of the buildings to be insured, where situate, and in whose occupation, of what materials the same are respectively composed, and whether occupied as private dwelling houses or how otherwise.\nThen with respect to the goods:\nAlso the nature of the goods, or other property on which such insurance is proposed, and the construction of the building containing such property, &c.\nThat is what the condition says is to be stated with respect to the goods. \"The construction of the building containing such property, &c.\" The form of application which is presented to the proposed insurer says the same thing:\nDescribe particularly how the property is built, where situated, how occupied, and the nature of the goods deposited therein.\nSo we have in the first condition and on the margin of the application paper the same language, and we find both complied with in the application. The description is: On general stock consisting of dry goods, &c., all contained in one-and-a-half story frame building with shingled roof, occupied and known as store-room and feed house for storing horse feed and provision for lumber camp; situated east side of Mechanic Settlement Highway.\nThus the condition is complied with and also the directions upon the form of application.\nThen we look at the second condition, and that requires the good faith which is the essence of the contract of insurance perhaps to a greater extent than most other contracts. The terms of this condition do not avoid the policy for mere misdescription or misrepresentation, but\nIf any misrepresentation is given so that the insurance be effected upon a lower premium than would have been charged had such risk been fairly stated.\nThere is no pretense here that the company insured at too low a premium.\nThe policy adds to the description these words: \"Such building shown on plan on back of application for insurance as feed house.\" Who made the plan on the back of the application in that way? We know as a matter of evidence that it was not the applicant unless he can be said to have done it by the company's agent. There is as much reason for holding that when the policy says \"said buildings shown by plan, &c.,\" it means shown by the company in that way as for saying it was shown by the applicant in that way. Murray was an agent for the company, and there is nothing in the case to show that he was an agent of the insured.\nThere is no ground of prejudice to the company or of construction of the contract for holding that the plaintiff cannot recover. I think the judgment appealed from was perfectly right. The facts seem to have scarcely required so much consideration of the doctrine of falsa demonstratio non nocet as it received in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitors for respondent: E. & R.

With an election petition against the return of the two sitting members the petitioner deposited the sum of $2,000 with the deputy prothonotary of the court, and in the notice of presentation of petition and deposit of security he stated that he had given security to the amount of one thousand dollars for each respondent \" in all two thousand dollars\" duly deposited with the prothonotary as required by statute. The receipt was signed by W. A. Weeks, the deputy prothonotary appointed by the judges, and acknowledged the receipt of $2,000, without stating that $1,000 was deposited as security for each respondent. The petition was served personally on the respondents at Ottawa.\nHeld, 1st. That personal service of an election petition at Ottawa with- out an order of the court is a good service under section 10 of the Controverted Elections Act.\n2nd. That there being at the time of the presentation of the petition security to the amount of $1,000 for the costs for each respondent the security given was sufficient.

S.C.\nAPPEALS from orders of Chief Justice Sullivan of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, made on the twentieth day of July, A.D. 1891, dismissing certain preliminary objections filed by the appellants to the election petitions against them filed by the respondent.\n[It was agreed that the appeal in the case of Prince County should follow the result of the decision in the Queen's County case.]\nIn the Queen's County case the petition was filed by the respondent, Hennessy, and copies of petition, notice of the presentation of same and of the security were served personally upon the appellants in the city of Ottawa Ontario.\nNo order for service outside of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of P. E. Island was obtained in the matter of the petition.\nThe appellants filed preliminary objections to the petition and service which practically resolved themselves into two.\nFirst, that the service of the petition, &c., at Ottawa, and out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of P. E. Island, was illegal and void, having been made without any statutory authority or rule of the court, or special order of the judge permitting it.\nSecondly, that no security was deposited pursuant to the statute, as each defendant was entitled to have $1,000 deposited as security for the costs that may be incurred by him, whereas, as a fact, the security was given by depositing $2,000 in one lump sum for the costs of the petition generally; and further, that the money constituting the deposit was not made with the proper officer, it being paid to a deputy of the Prothonotary, who gave the receipt, this deputy not being one of the officers named in sub-section e of section 9 of the Controverted Elections Act, as defined by subsection, i of section 2 of the said act, and the amending act of 1887, ch. 7 section 1.\nPeters, Attorney General for Prince Edward Island, for appellants.\nWith respect to the illegality of the service out of the jurisdiction, I submit as a general proposition that the power to serve process out of the jurisdiction of the court is not inherent in the court, and that apart from statute the court has no power to exercise jurisdiction with respect to any person beyond its limits.\nIn support of this proposition I rely on the following authorities:\u2014Re Maugham ([1]); Exparte Bernard ([2]); In re Busfield ([3]); In re Anglo African SS. Co. ([4]) ; sec. 10 ch. 9 R. S. C.; Day's Common Law Procedure Act ([5]); Annual Practice, 1891 ([6]).\nNext, as to the objection of the illegality of deposit. The deputy prothonotary is not the officer to receive deposit or give receipt. Sub-section (e) of section 9 says the security shall be given by a deposit of money with the \"Clerk of the Court.\"\nThe interpretation clause sub-sec. i, as amended by 50-5 Vic. cap. 7, 1887, defines what officers are included in the expression \"Clerk of the Court.\"\nThe prothonotary is one of those officers the deputy prothonotary is not. The court has the right by rule to prescribe that the deputy shall be one, but it has not done so. Parliament has by statute chosen to name certain officers as the only ones authorized to do an act under the Controverted Elections Act. It gave power to the judges to name others. It did not give power to the local legislature, and the latter body cannot therefore, either directly or indirectly, by saying that the deputy shall have all the powers of the principal, confer on the deputy the specific powers the Dominion statute gives the prothonotary, and the prothonotary only.\nFurther, the deposit has not been legally made. It is, according to the receipt, a single deposit of $2,000 in the matter of the petition against both respondents.\nThere should have been separate deposits of $1,000 each as security for each respondent.\nThe 8th section of Controverted Elections Act allowing two or more candidates to be made respondents, and permitting their cases, for the sake of convenience, to be tried at the same time, explicitly enacts \"as regards the security, and for all other purposes, such petition should be deemed to be a separate petition against each respondent.\" If, therefore, as regards security, the petition is a separate one against each respondent it follows that each respondent is entitled to have the security of $1,000 deposited as required by the 9th section \" for the payment of all costs, charges and expenses that may become payable by the petitioner to member whose election is complained of.\" Pease v. Norwood ([7]).\nThis is a statutory right of the respondent and a statutory duty of the petitioner. It won't do to say that lumping the two sums together will do as well or be as good security. As a matter of fact it may not. One member may have his election voided and the other may retain his seat. Both elections may be voided, and on the other hand, after prolonged litigation, the petition may be dismissed as against both. One may appeal, the other may not. The first out of the fight might get an order for the payment of his costs, and so also might each and all of the witnesses summoned by petitioner, and eat the whole $2,000 up and nothing would be left for the other respondent. The two members elected may defend in common, and have a common interest, or they may be politically and otherwise opposed, and fight the petition on different grounds. Davies and Jenkins or Davies and Brecken\nwere instances of one case; Davies and Welsh of the other. The court cannot take judicial notice whether they are united or opposed. Each member has his rights guaranteed by statute, and one of these rights is, that if his seat is attacked the person attacking shall\ndeposit $1,000 \"as security for all costs, charges and expenses that may become payable by the petitioner \"(inter alia) to the member (not members) whose seat is complained of. It seems therefore that the deposit is illegal, and not in compliance with the act.\nA. A. Morson for respondent: As to the payment of the $2,000. The main object of the statute was to have $1,000 deposited to answer any order that might be made as to costs or otherwise, as regards proceedings against each respondent petitioned against. In this case there are two respondents to the one petition, and the sum of $2,000 was deposited when such petition was presented; the receipt states that it was deposited as security in the matter of that petition, and the notice of the presentation of the petition, served on the appellants, with the copy of the deposit receipt, specifies particularly that $2,000 was deposited as security in the matter of the petition, viz., $1,000 for each respondent to the petition, and the respondent submits that the deposit is to be appropriated to the objects designated by the depositor and not by the officer receiving it, and that in this case the notice was such an appropriation.\nOn the other objection that the money was not paid to the proper officer, the learned counsel referred to and relied on 50-51 Vic. ch. 7, sec. 1, and R.S.C. ch. 1, sec. 7 sub-sec. 40, and as to the service\u2014R.S.C. ch. 9, secs. 10-11; 36 Vic. c. 22, ss. 20-21. See also Yardley v. Jones ([8]); Ablett v. Basham ([9]); Blackwell v. England ([10]); Walcol v. Botfield ([11]); The King v. Sargent ([12]); The Shelburne Election Case ([13]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C J.\u2014The preliminary objections in this case resolve themselves into the payment of the money to the deputy prothonotary, the insufficiency of the receipt and the insufficiency of the service. I think the payment to the deputy prothonotary was sufficient; the money is now in court subject to the order and disposition of the court under the terms of the statute.\nAs to the insufficiency of the receipt, the receipt is as follows:\nPROTHONOTARY'S RECEIPT FOR DEPOSIT.\nDOMINION OF CANADA, Province of Prince Edward Island, In the Supreme Court.\nTHE DOMINION CONTROVERTED ELECTIONS ACT.\nElection of two members for the House of Commons, for the Electoral District of Queen's County, in province of Prince Edward Island, holden on the fifth day of March, A.D. 1891.\nI here by certify that I have this day received from Walter A.O. Morson, agent for William Hennessy, of Charlottetown, in said county, the sum of two thousand dollars in legal tender money of the Dominion of Canada as security in the matter of the petition of the said William Hennessy, this day filed with me against the return of Louis Henry Davies and William Welsh at said election as members for the House of Commons for said electoral district.\nDated this 27th day of April, A.D. 1891.\n(Signed) WILLIAM A. WEEKS,\nDeputy Prothonotary.\nThe notice served with the copy of this petition and with the copy of this receipt was as follows:\nNotice of presentation of petition and deposit of security.\nTake notice that on Monday, the twenty-seventh day of April, A.D. 1891, the petition of William Hennessy, of Charlottetown, in Queen's County, was duly presented and filed with the prothonotary of the Supreme Court of the province against the return at said election of Louis Henry Davies and William Welsh as members for the House of Commons, in the electoral district of Queen's County, Prince Edward Island, for the reasons therein set forth. And further take notice that at the time of presenting said petition, security to the amount of one thousand dollars for each respondent, in all, two thousand dollars in legal tender money of the Dominion of Canada, was duly deposited with the said prothonotary as required by statute, and further take notice that the name and address of the agent of the petitioner is as follows:\u2014\nWALTER A. O. MORSON,\nBARRISTER.\nOffice of MACLEOD, MORSON & MACQUARRIE,\nBrown's Block, Charlottetown, P. E. Island.\nDated this 27th day of April, A.D. 1891.\n(Signed) WILLIAM HENNESSY.\nTo Louis Henry Davies and William Welsh.\nReading the petition, the copy of the receipt and this notice together, I think there was a full and substantial compliance with the statute, and there was at the time of the presentation of the petition security to the amount of $1,000 for the payment of all costs, &c., for each respondent. And as to the service. Mr. Davies swears:\nAFFIDAVIT OF LOUIS H. DAVIES.\nI, Louis H. Davies, of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, one of the members elected for the House of Commons for the electoral district of Queen's County, in said province, make oath and say:\nI. That on Friday the first day of May last past, A.D. 1891, I was served in the City of Ottawa, Province of Ontario, in said Dominion, with the annexed copies (1) of the election petition of William Hennessy of Charlottetown, in Queen's County (2); the notice of the presentation of the said petition and of the deposit of the security; and (3) the certificate of the receipt of the money deposited as security purporting to be signed by William A. Weeks, deputy prothonotary.\nNow what does the statute say? The petition must be served on the respondent within a certain time. Here we have a personal service on the respondent at the city of Ottawa, from whence the writ issued for holding this election, and the place to which the writ was returned, and at the place where the Parliament was being held, the right to sit in which Parliament was by the petition brought in question. We cannot ignore such a service and say that there was in fact no service at all on the respondent which he is called on to answer.\nI am of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The only two objections which were much insisted upon by the Attorney General were the insufficiency of the deposit and the invalidity of the service. As to the deposit I quite agree with what has been said by the Chief Justice.\nThe officers mentioned in the statute are the clerk of the peace and the prothonotary. In Prince Edward Island, there is a deputy prothonotary not appointed by the principal prothonotary but by the judges. The money was paid to a person who was an officer of the court, who has authority to receive money ordered to be paid into court, and it is now subject to the control of the court. The objection is a purely technical one and I see no reason why we should not say that the deputy prothonotary was a proper officer to receive it just as much as if he had been appointed by the principal prothonotary this objection therefore fails.\nI also think, after consideration, although at the argu- ment I took a narrower view, that when the legislature speaks of the service of an election petition within the jurisdiction it means to authorise service anywhere within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. These petitions are not personal actions, but more properly actions in rem. Their object is to oust a party from office and therefore these proceedings although sui generis are still in the nature of proceedings in rem, and I cannot think after the view taken by this court and by the Privy Council in the case of Valin v. Langluis ([14]), that such a narrow construction should be given to these words. In the 10th section it is provided that;\nThe notice of the presentation of a petition under this act and of the security, accompanied with a copy of the petition shall, within five days after the day on which the petition was presented, or within the prescribed time, &c., &c., be served on the respondent or respondents.\nI do not think that parliament ever intended that a member while attending to his duty in parliament should be considered as exempt from service. Without some extraordinary reason to limit the service to certain parts of Canada would be to split up the act, and I therefore agree with the Chief Justice in saying that we should read the words of the section as meaning personal service within any place in Canada, and not within the limited jurisdiction of the court or judge appointed to hear the petition. It would be going back to a practice much more narrow and technical than that which prevailed when election petitions were tried by committees of the House; and the transfer of the jurisdiction to the courts was certainly intended rather to amplify than to abridge the former remedy. The appeals must be dismissed.\nFournier J.\u2014La validit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9lection des appelants a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9e par une p\u00e9tition, dans laquelle tons deux sont assign\u00e9s comme d\u00e9fendeurs. Ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 est permis par la section 8 de l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es d\u00e9clarant que plusieurs candidats pourront subir leurs proc\u00e8s en m\u00eame temps sur une seule p\u00e9tition,\u2014mais que pour le cautionnement et toutes les autres fins de l'acte, la p\u00e9tition sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une p\u00e9tition distincte contre chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs.\nLa section 9 d\u00e9clare qu'au temps de la pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition, un cautionnement sera donn\u00e9 par le p\u00e9titionnaire, pour le paiement des frais qui seront payables au membre dont l'\u00e9lection est contest\u00e9e; que ce cautionnement consistera dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de mille piastres entre les mains du greffier de la cour qui en donnera un re\u00e7u qui sera une preuve suffisante de ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Ce re\u00e7u est en la forme donn\u00e9e ci-haut ([15]), et est sign\u00e9 William A. Weeks, Deputy Prothonotary, pour la somme de deux mille piastres en argent de la Puissance, (in legal tender of the Dominion of Canada,) comme cautionnement sur la p\u00e9tition de William Hennessy, produite contre l'\u00e9lection de Louis Henry Davies et William Welsh, comme membres de la Chambre des Communes pour le district \u00e9lectoral de Queen.\nLes appelants font objection \u00e1 ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une somme de $2,000 en bloc, et pr\u00e9tendent qu'il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait en une somme de $1,000, pour chacun d'eux pour leurs frais respectifs.\nL'avis de pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition, du d\u00e9p\u00f4t, du cautionnement que I'on trouve au dossier ne peut laisser de doute sur la destination de ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t; il n'est pas fait pour l'usage commun des d\u00e9fendeurs, il est au contraire fait sp\u00e9cialement de la somme de $1,000 pour chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs en argent l\u00e9gal de la Puissance en la mani\u00e8re suivante:\u2014\nAnd, further, take notice that at the time of presenting said petition security to the amount of one thousand dollars for each respondent, in all two thousand dollars, in legal tender money of the Dominion of Canada, was duly deposited with the said prothonotary as required by statute, and further, take notice that the name and address of the agent of the petitioner is as follows.\nCet avis prouve clairement que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, suivant le statut, de mille piastres pour chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs, en tout $2,000, ce qui \u00e9tait suffisant pour le nombre des d\u00e9fendeurs. Ces derniers reconnaissent avoir re\u00e7u cet avis.\nUne autre objection c'est que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait entre les mains de l'officier indiqu\u00e9 par le statut, que le d\u00e9put\u00e9 protonotaire n'est pas le \"Clerk of the Court\" mentionn\u00e9 dans le statut, et qu'un d\u00e9p\u00f4t entre ses mains n'est pas fait suivant la loi. Cette pr\u00e9tention n'est pas fond\u00e9e. L'acte d'amendement \u00e0 l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es, ch. 7, 50-51 Vict, dit que l'expression \"the Clerk of the Court,\" signifie entre autres choses \"le protonotaire\" et l'acte d'interpr\u00e9tation, Stat. Rev. Can., ch. 1, sec. 7, s.s. 40, d\u00e9clare entre autres choses que:\u2014\nWords directing or empowering any other public officer or functionary to do any act or thing, or otherwise applying to him by his name of office, include his successors in such office and his or their lawful deputy.\nPar les 4e et 5e objections les d\u00e9fendeurs se plaignent que l'avis de pr\u00e9sentation de la p\u00e9tition et de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du cautionnement avec copie de la p\u00e9tition ne leur ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9s l\u00e9galement, que la signification leur en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Ottawa, en dehors des limites de la juridiction de la Cour. Je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire pour la d\u00e9cision de cette question d'entrer dans l'examen de la mani\u00e8re d'apr\u00e8s laquelle la signification de ces documents aurait pu \u00eatre faite d'apr\u00e8s la loi de l'Ile du Prince-Edouard ou d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles de pratique faite par la Cour Supr\u00eame de I'Ile \u00e0 ce sujet en vertu de l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es. Pour que cette signification soit l\u00e9gale il suffit qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e par l'acte d'\u00e9lection. C'est sans doute pour obvier aux difficult\u00e9s qui pourraient \u00eatre caus\u00e9es par les diff\u00e9rents modes de signification adopt\u00e9s dans chaque province, que l'acte d'\u00e9lections contest\u00e9es en indique un qui peut \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 sans difficult\u00e9 dans toute la Puissance. C'est celui dont parle la section 10 de l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es,\u2014le service personnel ou au domicile. Il est dit dans la derni\u00e8re partie de cette section que si le service ne peut \u00eatre fait soit personnellement, soit \u00e0 domicile, qu'alors la cour ou un juge peut ordonner qu'il soit fait d'une autre mani\u00e8re, \u00e0 la demande du p\u00e9titionnaire. Cette disposition consid\u00e8re comme suffisante, la signification personnelle ou \u00e0 domicile et ne d\u00e9cr\u00e8te le recours \u00e0 une autre mani\u00e8re que lorsque le service n'a pu \u00eatre fait de I'une de ces deux mani\u00e8res. C'est donc un fait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que le service personnel ou \u00e0 domicile sera l\u00e9gal, sans recours \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 du juge ni \u00e0 aucune autre formalit\u00e9. Cette disposition devant avoir son effet dans toute la Puissance, il s'en suit que la signification personnelle faite aux d\u00e9fendeurs, en la cit\u00e9 d'Ottawa, est parfaitement l\u00e9gale.\nLes autres objections concernant la juridiction et la forme de la p\u00e9tition ne sont pas fond\u00e9es non plus. Tous les faits qui, d'apr\u00e8s le statut, doivent \u00eatre all\u00e9gu\u00e9s I'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et la p\u00e9tition est dans la forme voulue. Toutes les objections sont renvoy\u00e9es.\nTaschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ., were also of opinion that the appeals should be dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Davies & Haszard.\nSolicitor for respondents: W.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF MR. JUSTICE MACLENNAN.\nElection petition\u2014Re-service of\u2014Order granting extension of time\u2014Preliminary objections\u2014R.S.C. ch. 9, sec. 10\u2014Description of petitioner.\nOn the 15th, of April, 1891, the petitioner omitted to serve on the appellant with the election petition in this case a copy of the deposit receipt., but on the 20th of April applied to a judge to extend the time for service that he might cure the omission. An order extending; the time, subsequently affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, was made and the petition was re-served accordingly with all the other papers prescribed by the statute. Before the order extending the time had been drawn up the respondent had filed preliminary objections, and by leave contained in the order he filed further preliminary objections after the re-service. The new list of objections included those made in the first instance, and also an objection to the power or jurisdiction the Court of Appeal, or a judge thereof, to extend the time for service of the petition beyond the five days prescribed by the act.\nHeld, that the order was a perfectly valid and good order, and that the re-service made thereunder was a proper and regular service. R. S. C. ch. 9, sec. 10.\nThe petition in this case simply stated that it was the petition of Angus Chisholm, of the Township of Lochiel, in the County of Glengarry, without describing his occupation, and it was shown by affidavit that there are two or three other persons of that name on the voters' list for that township.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the petition should not be dismissed for the want of a more particular description of the petitioner. Appeal from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Maclennan, dismissing the preliminary objections to the election petition in this case.\nThe petition was presented on the 14th day of April, 1891, against the return of the appellant as a member of the House of Commons for the Electoral District of Glengarry at the elections held on the 5th day of March, 1891, and prayed that it be determined and adjudged that the appellant was not duly elected or returned and that the election and return should be declared void in consequence of corrupt practices having been committed by the appellant and his agents, and that the appellant should be disqualified by reason of having personally committed corrupt practices.\nOn the 15th April, 1891, the appellant was served with a copy of the said petition, and also with the notice of the presentation of a petition and the notice of agency.\nOn the 20th day of April, 1891, there having been no copy of the deposit receipt served, the petitioner obtained an order from Mr. Justice Maclennan, bearing date the 20th day of April, 1891, extending the time for service of the petition.\nOn the 20th day of April, 1891, being the last day for that purpose as provided by section 12 of said act, the appellant filed and presented to the court certain preliminary objections and grounds of insufficiency to the said petition and against any further proceeding thereon. These objections were dismissed.\nOn the 23rd of April another copy of the petition and the notice of the presentation of the petition and of the security and the deposit receipt were served on the appellant.\nOn the 27th day of April, 1891, an application was made by the present appellant to Hon. Mr. Justice Maclennan, on notice, to set aside the order granted by him on the 20th day of April, 1891.\nOn the 27th day of April, 1891, the application came on for argument before Mr. Justice Maclennan, and on the 28th day of April, 1891, an order was made by the learned judge dismissing the motion with costs.\nThe present appellants appealed from the decision of Mr. Justice Maclennan on the said motion to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Such appeal came on for argument on the 19th of May, 1891, when the said court dismissed the said appeal with costs.\nThereupon, and after the determination of the appeal, the present appellant filed preliminary objections to the said petition which preliminary objections are the second set served, and are as follows:\n1. \"The address, occupation or calling of the petitioner are not set out in the said petition, nor is any other information or means furnished therein or thereby of identifying him, whereby the respondent is prevented from discovering whether there are or are not any objections to the status of the said petitioner, or to his being a person who had a right to vote at the election to which the said petitioner relates.\"\n2. \"There is no evidence, nor is it alleged in said petition or otherwise, that the said petitioner had a right to vote at the election to which said petitioner relates.\"\n3. \"There is no evidence, nor is it alleged in said petition or otherwise, that the petition was signed by the petitioner as required by said act.\"\n4. \"If the said petition was presented no notice of the presentation thereof, and of the security required to be given by the petitioner, was, within the time limited by the said acts and the rules of this honourable court, nor at any other time, served upon the respondent, in consequence whereof there is no jurisdiction in this honourable court, or any judge thereof, to proceed further in the said matter of the said petition.\"\n5. \"No copy of any deposit receipt for such security, if given by the registrar of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, was served upon the respondent within the time limited by the said acts and rules of this honourable court, or at any other time, in consequence whereof there is no jurisdiction in this honourable court, or any judge thereof, to proceed further in the matter of the said petition.\"\n6. \"If the petition in this matter has been filed no security for the payment of all costs, charges and expenses that may become payable by the petitioner has been given by or on behalf of the petitioner, and no deposit of the sum of $1,000 in gold coin or Dominion notes has been made by or on behalf of the petitioner with the Registrar of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, as required by said acts.\"\n7. \"There was no power or jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal or judge thereof to extend the time for service of the petition beyond the five days prescribed by the act, as there was no difficulty in effecting service of said petition within the said five days, and there were no special circumstances of difficulty in effecting service to justify the order made by the Honourable Mr. Justice Maclennan on the 20th day of April, 1891.\"\nMr. Justice Maclennan on the 26th September, 1891, disallowed the preliminary objections.\nDalton McCarthy Q.C. for appellant.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for respondent.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I think the points relied on by the appellant's counsel are even more technical and trivial than in the preceding case. The service in this case was, no doubt, a perfect and regular service. The petitioner admitted that he had not originally served a copy of the deposit receipt, and having applied for an extension of time for service that he might cure the omission his application was granted, and he subsequently re-served the copy of the petition and other necessary documents. Now, the other party contends that he is debarred from doing what this perfectly valid order allowed him to do. It is sufficient to state the objection to show that it cannot prevail.\nThe Chief Justice and the others members of the court concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Tiffony & MacDonnell.\nSolicitors for respondent: McDonald, McIntosh & McCrimmon.\n"

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH, MANITOBA.\nLibel\u2014Provisions of act relating to newspapers\u2014Compliance with\u2014Special damages\u2014Loss of custom\u201450 Vic. cc. 22 and 23 (Man.).\nBy section 13 of 50 Vic. c. 22 (Man.), \u201cThe Libel Act,\u201d no person is entitled to the benefit thereof unless he has complied with the provisions of 50 Vic. c. 23, \u201cAn Act respecting newspapers and other like publications.\u201d By section 1 of the latter act no person shall print or publish a newspaper until an affidavit or affirmation made and signed, and containing such matter as the act directs, has been deposited with the prothonotary of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench or Clerk of the Crown for the, district in which the newspaper is published; by section 2 such affidavit or affirmation shall set forth the real and true names, &c., of the printer or publisher of the newspaper and of all the proprietors; by sec. 6 if the number of publishers does not exceed four the affidavit or affirmation shall be made by all, and if they exceed four it shall be made by four of them; and sec. 5 provides that the affidavit or affirmation may be taken before a justice of the peace or commissioner for taking affidavits to be used in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nHeld, 1. That 50 Vic. c. 23 contemplates, and its provisions apply to, the case of a corporation being the sole publisher and proprietor of a newspaper.\n2. That sec. 2 is complied with if the affidavit or affirmation states that a corporation is the proprietor of the newspaper and prints and publishes the same. Gwynne J. dissenting.\n3. That the affidavit or affirmation, in case the proprietor is a corporation, may be made by the managing director.\n4. That in every proceeding under sec. 1 there is the option either to swear or affirm, and the right to affirm is not restricted to members of certain religious bodies or persons having religious scruples. 5. That if the affidavit or affirmation purports to have been taken before a commissioner his authority will be presumed until the contrary is shown.\nBy sec. 11 of the Libel Act actual malice or culpable negligence must be proved in an action for libel unless special damages are claimed.\nHeld, that such malice or negligence must be established to the satisfaction of the jury, and if there is a disagreement as to these issues the verdict cannot stand.\nHeld, further, that a general allegation of damages by loss of custom, is not a claim for special damages under this section.\nPer Strong J.\u2014Where special damages are sought to be recovered in an action of libel, or for verbal slander where the words are actionable per se, such special damage must be alleged and pleaded with particularity, and in case of special damage by reason of loss of custom the names of the customers must be given, or otherwise evidence of the special damage is inadmissible.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Man. ([1]), setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a new trial.\nThis was an action against the Manitoba Free Press Company for publishing in the Daily Free Press and and in the Weekly Free Press an article alleged by the plaintiff to be libellous and to have caused him damage by loss of reputation and by injury to his business. The facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and in the judgment of this court.\nThe plaintiff obtained a verdict for $500 which the full court set aside and ordered a new trial. From that decision he brought the present appeal.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the appellant. The defendants should have pleaded the statute 50 Vic. ch. 22 if they wished to obtain the benefit of it. Folkard on Libel ([2]) states what evidence is admissible under a plea of not guilty.\nThe declaration was not made by the proper person. Bank of Toronto v. McDougall ([3]); Freehold Loan & Savings Co. v. Bank of Commerce ([4]). The learned counsel also contended that it was incumbent on the defendants to prove the truth of the affidavit and that it conformed to the requirements of the act.\nRobinson Q.C. for the respondents cited, as to the contention that the statute should have been pleaded, Williams v. The East India Co. ([5]); Sissons v. Dixon ([6]); and as to the declaration being sufficient, Moyer v. Davidson ([7]); De Forrest v. Bunnell ([8]); Mowat v. Clement ([9]).\nMcCarthy Q.C, in reply referred to The King v. Hart ([10]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Ch. 23 s. 5 of 50 Vic. (Man.) directs that \u201csuch affidavit or affirmation shall be in writing and signed by the person or persons making the same, and may be taken before any justice of the peace or commissioner for taking affidavits to be used in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\u201d\nIf this document was sworn or affirmed before such a commissioner then the act was complied with, because the act to which alone we can look gives such a commissioner the necessary authority to administer or take the affirmation, just as the statute might have authorized the swearing of the affidavit or the affirmation to be taken before a notary public, or any other person that the legislature deemed suitable to act in such a capacity. We can only look to the act and be governed by it and by it alone.\nWhether the documents were sworn to, as Mr. Luxton thinks they were, or were solemnly declared and affirmed, as the contents state and as Mr. McKilligan\u2019s verification at the bottom indicates, does not appear to me material, inasmuch as either swearing or affirming would be a compliance with the statute, though I should, if it were necessary to determine this point, certainly be prepared to hold that the contents \u2018of the document which states that \u201c I, William F. Luxton, &c., do solemnly declare and affirm that,\u201d &c., and the attesting clause \u201c solemnly declared and affirmed before me at, &c., John B. McKilligan, a commissioner, &c.,\u201d should be taken, in the absence of any positive evidence to the contrary, as proof that the documents were affirmations and not affidavits.\nI think if a certified copy of the affidavit or affirmation is to be received in evidence as prima facie proof of such affidavit or affirmation, and that the same was duly sworn or affirmed, as provided by section 13 of the act which is as follows:\n13. In all cases a copy of any such affidavit or affirmation, certified to be a true copy under the hand of the prothonotary or deputy clerk of the Crown and Pleas having the custody of the same, shall be received in evidence as prima facie proof of such affidavit or affirmation, and that the same was duly sworn or affirmed, and of the contents thereof; and any such copy so produced and certified shall also be received as evidence that the affidavit or affirmation of which it purports to be a copy has been sworn or affirmed according to this act and shall have the same effect for the purposes of evidence as if the original affidavit or affirmation had been produced and had been proved to have been duly so certified, sworn and affirmed by the person or persons appearing by such copies to have sworn or affirmed the same.\na fortiori, the original must be held to have a similar, if not greater effect.\nI think there is nothing in the other objections raised and I therefore agree with the court below that defendants are within the protection of the statute; that special damages are neither claimed nor proved, and consequently to enable plaintiff to recover it was necessary for him to prove actual malice or culpable negligence, on neither of which questions were the jury enabled to agree; and therefore the jury having disagreed on both of these two questions, one or the other of which it was essential to plaintiff to establish to enable him to recover, I think there should be a new trial, and therefore this appeal will be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that Mr. Luxton, the managing director of the company, was the proper person to make the affidavit or affirmation required by sees. 1 and 3 of 50 Vic. ch. 53 (Manitoba). The stat. 50 Vic. ch. 22 (Manitoba) which requires the proof of actual malice or culpable negligence where special damages are not claimed is expressly made applicable to corporations by sec. 13 which enacts that \u201cno person, persons or corporation who has or have not complied with the \u2018Act respecting newspapers and other like publications\u2019 passed in the present session shall be entitled to the benefit of this act,\u201d and sec. 3 of 50 Vic ch. 53, by which last mentioned statute the affidavit or affirmation is made requisite, is to the same effect; \u201cno person or persons! or corporation who has or have not complied with the provisions of this act shall be entitled to the benefit of any of the provisions of the act respecting the law of libel passed during the present session.\u201d\nIt is therefore very plain that an affidavit was required in the case of publication by an incorporated company. Then who was the person to make such an affidavit ? The statutes give no indication of this. The corporation itself clearly could not make the affidavit and the provisions of the 6th section are not applicable to corporations but to ordinary partnerships. It seems, therefore, that the affidavit or affirmation must be made by some principal officer of the corporation, and if this be so I am opinion that the managing director was the appropriate person. The case of Kingsford v. The Great North-Western Railway Co. ([11]) is an authority for this conclusion.\nAs regards the sufficiency of the paper filed with the prothonotary as an affirmation I have had some doubts, but I have arrived at the same conclusion on this point as the court below. There was a literal compliance with the terms of the act. The statute requires an affirmation and an affirmation was made and filed. I do not think we are to read into the statute the qualification that an affirmation was only to be sufficient when the person making it was \u0105 Quaker, or one of the class who, having conscientious scruples about swearing, have the privilege given them of affirming. That would be to add to the statute in a way which upon consideration (although I at first thought differently) would be inadmissible having regard to the principles of strict construction which now prevail.\nThe objection that \u201cJohn B. McKilligan\u201d before whom the affirmation purports to have been made was not proved to have been a commissioner having authority to take affidavits is answered by the rule \u201comnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite esse acta\" and by the authorities quoted in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice in the court below, particularly what Lord Abinger C. B. says in Burdekin v. Potter ([12]); and Cheney v. Courtois ([13]), which last case appears to be exactly in point. There an affidavit was, in order to the validity of a bill of sale, required by statute to be filed with the bill of sale in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. The affidavit purported to have been sworn before a Commissioner of the Court of Exchequer, and it was objected that the party relying on a due compliance with the statute was bound to prove that the person signing as a commissioner was in fact one. Erie C.J. there says:\nI am of opinion that the statute intended to require the formality and sanction of an oath, and unless it were shown to my satisfaction that the person before whom the affidavit was sworn had no power to administer an oath I should be bound to presume omnia rite esse acta. It was the duty of the officer of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench not to file the bill of sale unless it was accompanied by an affidavit properly sworn and attested. We must presume that he has done his duty.\nApplying what was thus laid down as law by Chief Justice Erie to the present case, I say it was the duty of the prothonotary not to file this affidavit unless he was satisfied that Mr. McKilligan was a commissioner, a fact which he could easily have ascertained by a reference to the rolls or records of the court of which he was himself the custodian. In the case of an affidavit filed with a deputy clerk of the crown that officer, if he has any doubt, can easily resolve it by a reference to the prothonotary. There was, therefore, a prim\u00e2 jacie presumption that the affirmation was regularly taken before a person having authority to receive it, and it was for the plaintiff to displace that presumption if able to do so.\nAs regards the substance of the declaration there is, in my opinion, a literal and exact compliance with the requirement of the statute. The 2nd section of the act prescribes what must be the contents of the declaration or affidavit. It requires that the real and true names, addresses, descriptions and places of abode of the printers and publishers as well as of the proprietors of the newpaper shall be set forth. This in the case of a newspaper published by an incorporate company as the Free Press is, and printed by the company itself, is sufficiently complied with by stating, as the declaration does, the fact that the corporation is the proprietor of the paper and that the corporation itself prints and publishes it. This is so plain and self-evident that I do not feel called upon to take up time and space in the reports by entering upon a demonstration to show that as regards proprietorship in the case of a corporation the names of the shareholders and a statement of their shares and interests need not be given as in the case of a partnership or unincorporated company; and further that when the corporation is stated in the declaration (or affidavit) to be its own printer and publisher, as in the present case, there is no necessity for stating the names of the persons, viz.: The foreman, proof-readers, type-setters, press-men, and newsboys, employed in the mechanical work of printing and in the publication and sale of the newspaper.\nThe defendants have, therefore (subject only to the question of pleading which I will refer to hereafter), brought themselves within the protection of the statute unless we can hold that the plaintiff is within the exception excluding from its operation cases where special damages are claimed. I take it to be clear that where special damages are sought to be recovered in \u0430\u043f \u0430\u0441tion for libel, or in an action for verbal slander where the words are actionable per se, such special damage must be alleged and pleaded with particularity, and that in case of special damage by reason of loss of custom the names of the customers must be given or otherwise evidence of the special damage is not admissible, and that this rule is not confined to cases of verbal slander where the words are not actionable per se, cases in which special damage is a necessary ingredient in the cause of action. In Odgers on Libel (1) I find the following passage which appears to me applicable as showing that the allegations at the conclusion of the third and fourth counts are averments of general and not of special damages. The learned writer says: And here note the distinction between the loss of individual customers and a general diminution in annual profits. Loss of custom is special damage and must be specifically alleged and the customers\u2019 names stated in the record. If that be done the consequent reduction in plaintiff\u2019s annual income can easily be reckoned. But if no names be given, it is impossible to connect the alleged diminution in the general profits of plaintiff\u2019s business with defendant\u2019s words; it may be due to fluctuations in prices, to change of management, to a new shop being opened in opposition, or to many other causes. Hence, such an indefinite loss of business is considered general damage and can only be proved when the words are spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his trade and so are actionable per se. For there the law presumes that such words must injure the plaintiff\u2019s business and therefore attributes to those words the diminution it finds in plaintiff \u2018s profits. See Harrison v. Pearce ([14]).\nThe learned writer is no doubt here referring to cases of verbal slander, but it must be the same in cases of actions for written defamation as in those where the cause of action is for words spoken which are actionable per se. This consideration gets rid of any difficulty which might seem to arise from Evans v. Harries ([15]) and Riding v. Smith ([16]), which were both actions for verbal slander of the plaintiff in his trade and in which it was held that evidence of loss of custom generally was admissible under similar allegations to those in the present case as proof of general damages. It is therefore clear, both on authority and principle, that the declaration does not claim special damages and that the plaintiff did not bring himself within the exception of such, cases provided for by the 11th sec. of ch. 22.;\nThe question for decision is therefore (apart from the point of pleading) reduced to this: Did the plaintiff prove to the satisfaction of the jury either actual malice or culpable negligence on the part of the defendants in publishing the articles complained of? I do not see how it is possible to say, in the face of the fact that the jury were unable to agree to an answer to the second and third questions put to them by the learned judge, that they have found at all upon these vital questions. It is apparent upon the record before us that upon these the essential points they differed, and that there was no finding. The questions were clearly and explicitly framed, in these words:\nQuestion 2. Was the defendant guilty of actual malice in the publication of the article complained of ?\nQuestion 3. Was the defendant guilty of culpable negligence in its publication?\nThe jury declare that by reason of difference of opinion amongst them they are unable to answer either.\nI agree with the Chief Justice of Manitoba that after this positive declaration of an inability to agree to answers to these two direct questions it is impossible to hold that a negative answer to them is to be implied from the affirmation elicited by the 5th question, which inquired whether Mr. Luxton bona fide believed the publications to be true. It appears therefore that the real issues, viz., whether there was malice or negligence, have never been passed upon by the jury and that being so no other alternative was open to the court but to send the action down for a new trial.\nAs regards the question of pleading I think the onus must always be on the defendants, in cases under this statute, to bring themselves within the provisions in question by showing that they had filed the affidavit or affirmation, and as it is for them to prove this it is also incumbent on them to plead a compliance with the prescribed requirements. But it would be out of the question to determine this appeal on any such ground as this. The point does not seem to have been taken either at the trial or before the court in banc. The notice of appeal to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, indeed, does not even assign it as a ground of objection. It was therefore taken here for the first time, and that being so of course no effect ought to be given to it. I think, however, it would be better to make the record perfect by adding the plea, and for that purpose I should be prepared to give leave to amend.\nSubject to a variation of the rule of the court below by directing an amendment for the purpose above mentioned I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question which, in my opinion, arises in this case that it is necessary to consider is whether or not the defendants are entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Manitoba Statute, 50 Vic. ch. 22, an act respecting the law of libel. By the 18th section of that act it is enacted that:\nNo person, persons or corporation who has or have not complied with the act respecting newspapers and other lik\u0435 publications passed in the present session shall be entitled to the benefit of this act.\nNow by that act respecting newspapers, &c., 50 Vic. ch. 23, Manitoba, it is enacted in its 3rd section that:\nNo person or persons or corporation who has or have not complied with the provisions of this act shall be entitled to the benefit of any of the provisions of the act respecting the law of libel passed during this present session.\nNow the force of these two clauses of these acts is to make every provision of the act respecting newspapers, 50 Vic. ch. 23, apply to the case of corporate bodies equally as to individuals who should seek the benefit of any of the provisions of 50 Vic. ch. 22, and precisely in the same manner and to the same extent, the object of the legislature, in my opinion, being to provide for every person who should be libelled in a newspaper the same means of redress by criminal or civil process, and the same power of selection of the person or persons against whom such redress should be sought, namely, either against some individual persons filling the position of printer, or of publisher, or of owners or part owner of the newspaper in which the libel is published, and who derive profit from its publication, whether such proprietors or proprietor should or should not constitute a body corporate. This reasonable intention of the legislature is, to my mind, abundantly apparent from the language used. It never could have been their intention that a corporate body should have greater license than non-corporate proprietors of a newspaper to publish, or greater facility in escaping responsibility if they should cause to be published, libels in their paper. The first section then of the act 50 Vic. ch. 23, although it commences with the words, \u201cno person shall print or publish,\u201d &c., must, by force of the above section 3 of the same act and of section 13 of 50 Vic. ch. 22, be read thus:\nNo person, persons or corporation shall print or publish, or cause to be printed or published in Manitoba, any newspaper, pamphlet or other paper containing public news or intelligence or serving the purpose of a newspaper, or for the purpose of posting for general circulation in detached pieces as such newspaper, until an affidavit or affirmation, made and signed as hereinafter mentioned, shall have been delivered to the prothonotary of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench or the Deputy Clerk of the Crown and Pleas for the district in which such newspaper, pamphlet or other paper is printed or published.\nThen section 2 enacts that:\nSuch affidavit or affirmation shall set forth the real names, additions, descriptions and places of abode of every person who is or is intended to be the printer or publisher of the newspaper, pamphlet or other paper mentioned in such affidavit or affirmation, and of all the proprietors of the same, and also the amount of the proportional shares of such proprietors in the property of the newspaper, pamphlet or other paper, and the true description of the house or building wherein such newspaper, pamphlet or other paper is intended to be printed, and the titles of such newspaper, pamphlet or other paper.\nThen by section 6 it is enacted that:\nWhere the persons concerned as printers and publishers of any newspaper, &c., together with such number of proprietors as are hereinbefore required to be named in such affidavits or affirmations as aforesaid do not altogether exceed the number of four persons, the affidavit or affirmation required shall be sworn, affirmed and signed by all the said persons, and when the number of all such persons exceeds four the same shall be signed and sworn, or affirmed by four of such persons, but the same shall contain the real and true names, description and places of abode of every person who is or who is intended to be the printer or printers, publisher or publishers, and of so many of the proprietors as are hereinbefore for that purpose mentioned, of such newspaper, pamphlet or other such paper as aforesaid.\nThen by the 8th section it is provided that such affidavits and affirmations shall in all cases or proceedings touching or concerning any matter or thing contained in any such newspaper, &c., which may be taken against every person who has signed and sworn or affirmed such affidavit or affirmation, and against every person who has not signed or affirmed the same but who is mentioned therein to be a proprietor, printer and publisher of such newspaper, &c., shall be admitted as sufficient evidence of the truth of the matters which are by the act required to be set forth in such affidavit or affirmation, and which are therein set forth.\nThen by the 10th section it is provided that in some part of every newspaper, pamphlet or other such paper aforesaid there shall be printed the real name, addition and place of abode of every printer and publisher thereof, and also a true description of the place where the same is printed, subject in case of default to a penalty of $80.00, to be recovered from the person who knowingly and wilfully prints or publishes any such newspapers, &c., not containing the particulars aforesaid. Now as the act declares that \u201cno person, persons or corporation\u201d shall be entitled to the benefit of the act respecting the law of libel, viz., 50 Vic. ch. 22, who has not or have not complied with the provisions of 50 Vic. ch. 23, it is, in my opinion, obvious that the provisions of the latter act in every particular apply to corporate bodies equally as to individual proprietors of newspapers, and we have no right to hold that some only of those provisions apply to corporations and others to individuals, and so render the security or facilities for obtaining redress the public were intended to have in the case of libels published in newspapers less efficient in the case of a libel published in a newspaper owned by a body corporate than in the case of a libel published in a newspaper owned by persons not incorporated; and we must, in my opinion, hold that in the case of a body corporate being proprietors of a newspaper the same necessity exists for giving the real names and addresses of some, individual persons or person as printers or printer, publishers or publisher, and proprietors or proprietor, or owners of shares in such body corporate equally as in the case of a newspaper owned by persons not incorporated; and if this be not done in the case of a corporation equally as in the case of a newspaper owned by persons not incorporated the act 50 Vic. ch. 23 is not complied with, and the corporation in such case is not entitled to the benefit of 50 Vic. ch. 22.\nNow the document filed as and by way of the affidavit or affirmation required by the statute is an affirmation made by a Mr. Luxton, who styles himself managing director of the defendant company, who affirms that the Manitoba Free Press Company, a company incorporated under the laws of Manitoba, is the printer, publisher and sole proprietor of the newspaper named The Manitoba Daily Free Press and also of The Manitoba Weekly Free Press in which respective papers of the dates of the 25th and 30th May, 1889, were published the libels complained of, and in that published on the 25th of May the only notice professing any compliance with sec. 10 of 50 Vic. ch. 23 that was inserted was as follows:\nManitoba Free Press published every day except Sunday at 6 a.m. at Winnipeg by the Manitoba Free Press Company.\nW. F. LUXTON,\nManaging Director and Editor in Chief.\nwhile in that of the 30th of May, 1889, the only notice inserted was as follows:\nMANITOBA FREE PRESS,\nWEEKLY EDITION.\nPublished every Thursday at the Manitoba Free Press building, Winnipeg, Man., by the Manitoba Free Press Company.\nW. F. LUXTON,\nManaging Director and Editor in Chief.\nNow neither the affirmation so filed nor the notices published in the respective newspapers in which the libels complained of appeared constituted, in my opinion, a compliance with the provisions of the 50 Vic. ch. 23; they were rather, in my opinion, in plain contravention of the requirements of the act. The defendants, therefore, in the present case, were not entitled to the benefit of 50 Vic. ch. 22, and the plaintiff is entitled to retain his verdict and to have judgment in his favour entered thereupon. The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be allowed a11d judgment be ordered to be entered in the court below for the plaintiff on the verdict rendered in his favour. In this view of the case it is a matter of no importance that the jury have not answered the question put to them as to actual malice in the publications complained of.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014This is an action of libel. The declaration contains four counts. The first and second counts are alike but refer to different publications of the article charged as libellous, the first count being for the publication of the article in the Manitoba Weekly Free Press, and the second for publication of the same article in the Manitoba Daily Free Press, and both of those counts charging generally that the defendants falsely and maliciously printed and published of the plaintiff the words contained in the article, not alleging special damage, and indeed not containing any allegation of damage.\nThe third and fourth counts, again, are alike, charging the same publications of the article but each beginning with the averment that the article was published in relation to the plaintiff and to the carrying on by him of his business of a hardware merchant, and concluding:\nWhereby the plaintiff has been and is greatly injured in his credit and reputation, and also has been greatly injured in his credit and reputation as a hardware merchant and in his said business, and has experienced and sustained sensible and material diminution and loss in the custom and profits of his said trade and business by divers persons, whose names are to the plaintiff unknown, having in consequence of the committing of the said grievances by the defendants avoided the plaintiff\u2019s said shops, stores and warehouses, and abstained from being customers of the plaintiff as such merchant as aforesaid, as they otherwise would have been but for the committing of the said grievances by the defendants.\nAnd the declaration concludes with a general claim for $10,000 damages. The pleas are: 1st. Not guilty; 2nd. As to the third and fourth counts, that the plaintiff did not carry on the business of hardware merchant as alleged; 3rd and 4th, held bad on demurrer; 5th, that the defamatory allegations are true.\nThe questions upon this appeal turn upon two statutes of Manitoba. One statute ([17]) enacts that 11. Except in cases where special damages are claimed the plaintiff in all actions for libel in newspapers shall be required to prove either actual malice or culpable negligence in the publication of the libel complained of.\n13. No person, persons or corporation, who has or have not complied with the \u201cAct respecting Newspapers and other like publications,\u201d passed in the present session, shall be entitled to the benefit of this act.\nThe other is the act thus referred to in section 13 (1). The provisions in question are contained in sections 1, 3 and 5:\n1. No person shall print or publish, or cause to be printed or published in Manitoba any newspaper, pamphlet or other paper containing public news or intelligence, or serving the purpose of a newspaper, or, for the purpose of posting for general circulation, in detached pieces as such newspaper, until an affidavit or affirmation, made and signed as hereinafter mentioned, containing the matters hereinafter mentioned, shall have been delivered to the prothonotary of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, or the Deputy Clerk of the Crown and Pleas for the district in which such newspaper, pamphlet or other paper is printed or published.\n3. No person or persons or corporation, who bas or have not complied with the provisions of this act, shall be entitled to the benefit of any of the provisions of the act respecting the law of libel passed during this present session.\n5. Every such affidavit or affirmation shall be in writing, and signed by the person or persons making the same, and may be taken before any justice of the peace or commissioner for taking affidavits to be used in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nSection 4 prescribes the contents of the affidavit and I think nothing turns upon it. In my opinion the section is satisfied by this document.\nSection 6 requires that when the persons concerned as printers and publishers of any newspaper, together with the proprietors, do not exceed four in number the affidavit or affirmation must be made and signed by them all, but if they are more than four then it is to be made and signed by four of them. That does not appear to be applicable to a case like this one where the sole proprietor and publisher is a corporation. Therefore there is no reason for denying that an affidavit or affirmation by the managing director of this corporation satisfies section one, which does not say who is to make it.\nThere was no finding of actual malice or culpable negligence. The jury gave a general verdict for the plaintiff for $500 but did not answer three out of the five questions left to them by the judge. Two of those three questions on which the jury could not agree asked if the defendants were guilty of actual malice or culpable negligence in the publication of the article, the third related to the affidavit and will be noticed presently. The two on which they agreed were the following:\n4. Was the article complained of merely a fair and reasonable defence against attacks previously made upon the defendant company or its publications by the publishers of the Sun newspaper ?\nTo which they answered \u201cNo\u201d; and\n5. Did Mr. Luxton when the publications ill question were made bon\u00e2fide believe them to be true in fact ? If it is not proved to your satisfaction that he did not so believe, answer the question in the affirmative.\nThey answered this question in the affirmative. Mr. Luxton was the writer of the article and the managing director of the company.\nA new trial was ordered on the ground that the jury had really disagreed. The appellant contends that that is an erroneous view of the matter and that he is entitled to retain his verdict for $500.\nThe first question is whether the statute was complied with in respect of the affidavit or affirmation so as to dispense with proof of actual malice or culpable negligence.\nThere was, no doubt, evidence of actual malice sufficient to go to the jury, and perhaps, also, of culpable negligence; but I apprehend that when the statute makes proof of those things, or of one of them, essential to the maintenance of the action the issue thus thrown upon the plaintiff is, like any other issue, to be proved to the satisfaction of the jury. If that is not done, as it was not done in this case, the issue is not proved and the plaintiff fails. Hence the importance of the inquiry whether the defendants have brought themselves within the protection of the statute.\nNow let us look at the affidavit or affirmation.\nIt is made by Mr. Luxton. It commences thus:\nI, William Fisher Luxton, of the city of Winnipeg, in the county of Selkirk, journalist, do solemnly declare and affirm:\nAnd after stating all that the statute requires it to state, it concludes:\nAnd I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by virtue of the \u201cAct respecting Extra-Judicial Oaths.\u201d\nSolemnly declared and signed before me at the city of Winnipeg, in the county of Selkirk, this 19th day of December, A.D. 1887.\n(Sgd.) W.F. LUXTON.\n(Sdg.) JOHN \u0412. MCKILLIGAN,\nA commr.. &c.\nOne objection made is that John B. McKilligan was not proved to be a justice of the peace or a commissioner for taking affidavits to be used in the Queen\u2019s Bench. That is an objection to which we should not pay any attention. It was urged before us stoutly enough, but at the trial where everybody evidently knew Mr. McKilligan there is no trace of it. It was debated whether or not Mr. Luxton had sworn to the statement before Mr. McKilligan or had merely affirmed, and after the judge had charged the jury he was recalled to be further examined about the document. Mr. McKilligan was then mentioned, as he had been during the regular examination of Mr. Luxton and of the secretary of the company, the prothonotary who produced the document which had been filed in his office not being asked anything about him any more than the other witnesses, but he was mentioned only in this manner:\nHis Lordship\u2014Tell the jury what you did on the occasion when you said you swore to these affidavits?\nA. My recollection is that I swore to it, that is, the form being recited to me by Mr. McKilligan and I kissed the book, the ordinary form \u201cSo help me God.\u201d There are circumstances that go to corroborate that the affidavit or affirmation, whatever it is called, was made in my own office and in my room; Mr. Campbell, who was acting for me, brought Mr. McKilligan there and I have a bible there and it is used for that purpose. That goes to confirm that circumstance.\nIt is palpable that witness, counsel, judge and jury knew that Mr. McKilligan was a proper person to administer the oath or take the affirmation.\nThe main question, and in fact the only question, made at the trial respecting the document is whether it is an affidavit or an affirmation within the, meaning of this particular statute.\nThe jury were asked to find whether it was sworn to or only affirmed, and they could not agree upon the fact.\nI speak of the document in the singular though there were two. They were fac similes. one of them relating to the daily paper and the other to the weekly.\nThe argument in support of the objection is that the statute requires an affidavit or sworn statement when the deponent has no conscientious scruples about taking an oath and that the affirmation is permitted only in case of persons who have such scruples, or when the deponent belongs to some religious body the members of which are excused from being sworn.\nIt may be that some idea of that sort was in the mind of the draftsman who framed the clause of the statute, but he certainly has not conveyed it by the language he has used. Literally read the clause gives an option to swear or affirm. There are statutes which permit a witness at the trial of a civil or criminal case to make a solemn affirmation instead of giving his \u0435vidence on oath, provided he belongs to one of certain religious denominations, or provided he has conscientious objections to being sworn, and the same privilege is extended to some proceedings out of court. The English statutes on the subject down to 17 & 18 Vic. ch. 125 are cited by the appellant in his factum, and may, together with later statutes, be found noticed in Taylor on Evidence ([18]). We may refer also to such provisions as those contained in the Criminal Procedure Act ([19]), and in the act respecting oaths of allegiance ([20]), as examples of greater care in the particular in discussion, the right to affirm in place of swearing being given only to those persons who have that right in civil cases.\nThe class of persons is thus defined by reference to the legislation concerning the mode of giving testim\u043e\u043f\u0443 in civil actions. There is no assumption of the existence of the right to substitute affirmation for oath as belonging to any class apart from legislation.\nBut the argument for the appellant requires us to read into this statute something which the legislature has not expressed, in place of understanding the language in its literal meaning which gives the option to swear or to affirm. In this case the deponent has affirmed, he \u201csolemnly declares and affirms,\u201d the word \u201c affirm\u201d not being, as it would seem, indispensable, and probably not being intended to be used in a statutory declaration under the Dominion act. I think a declaration under the third section of that act\u2014the act respecting\u2019 extra-judicial oaths (1)\u2014would satisfy the Manitoba statute, but in this case the deponent does not merely solemnly declare, he uses the expression given by the Manitoba statute and solemnly affirms.\nThus it appears to me that the statute was complied with by the filing of the document in evidence, even though it may not have been sworn to and although Mr. Luxton may not be a person who could assert a statutory privilege to give his evidence in a civil action on solemn affirmation in place of on oath.\nI am unable to see anything in the contention that the statute ought to have been pleaded. There is nothing in question but a rule of evidence. Malice has always to be established. It is of the essence of the charge. But whereas it is in other cases prim\u00e2 facie proved by the publication of the defamatory words a different rule is applied to newspapers. That is the law of the land and the plaintiff knows the law. He has access to the documents filed with the prothonotary and can satisfy himself before he brings his action as to what proof he requires.\nI do not see my way to hold that we can properly order a judgment for the defendant, and am of opinion that our proper course is simply to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Aikins, Culver, Patterson & McCleneghan.\nSolicitors for respondents: Archibald, Howell & Cumberland.\n[1] 6 Man.

The statute authorising the assessment required the municipal council, after the final revision of the assessment roll in each year, to pass a by-law for levying a rate on all real and personal property mentioned in said roll, but no such by-law was passed in either of the years 1880 or 1881. The lands so assessed and sold were formerly Dominion lands which were sold and paid for in 1879, but the patent did not issue until April, 1881. The patentee sold the lands, and after the tax sale a mortgage thereon was given to R. who sought to have the tax sale set aside as invalid.\n45 V. \u0441. 16, s. 7 (Man.) provides that every deed made pursuant to a sale for taxes shall be valid, notwithstanding any informality in or preceding the sale, unless questioned within one year from its execution, and 51 V. c. 101s. 58 (Man.) provides that \u201call assessments heretofore made and rates struck by the municipalities are hereby confirmed and declared valid and binding upon all persons and corporations affected thereby.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Patterson J. dissenting, that the assessments for the years 1880\u20131 were illegal for want of a by-law and the sale for taxes thereunder was void. If the lands could be taxed the defect in the assessments was not cured by 45 V. c. 16 s. 7, or by 51 V. c. 101 s. 58, which would cure irregularities but could not make good a deed that was a nullity as was the deed here.\nHeld, per Gwynne J., Patterson J. contra, that the patents for the lands not having issued until April, 1881, the said taxes accrued due while the lands vested in the Crown, and so were exempt from taxation.\nHeld per Strong J., following McKay v. Crysler (3 Can. s. C. K. 436), and O\u2019Brien v. Cogswell (17 Can. S.C.R. 420), that the operation of 45 V. c. 16 s. 7 is restricted to curing the defects in the proceedings for the sale itself as distinguished from the proceedings in assessing and levying the taxes which led to the sale.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Man. (1) reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the caveatee.\nThis was an issue under the Real Property Act of Manitoba under the following circumstances. The land originally belonged to the Dominion Government and was sold in 1879 to one Graham, who paid the purchase money in full but did not obtain a patent until April, 1881. Graham, in 1882, conveyed the land to one Casey, who, in May, 1882, gave a mortgage to Mary Ryan, the respondent.\nThe lands were assessed by the municipality of Lorne, where they were situate, for the years 1880 and 1881, and in March, 1882, they were sold for the two years\u2019 taxes. The appellant, Whelan, claims title from the purchaser at this tax sale. He applied to the district registrar for a certificate of title, whereupon the said Mary Ryan filed a, caveat against the granting of such certificate claiming that the said lands were exempt from taxation in 1880\u20131 as being Crown lands, or, if they were liable to be taxed, that the proceedings therefor were so irregular that there was no real assessment for those years.\nThe statutes of the province under which the assessments were made in the said years require each municipal council, after the final revision of the assessment roll in each year, to pass a by-law for levying a rate on all the real and personal property mentioned in said roll. No such by-law was passed by the municipality of Lorne in either of the years 1880 or 1881. It was claimed, however, that this defect was cured by the provisions of the following later statutes, namely, 45 Vic. ch. 16 sec. 7 which makes valid any deed given in pursuance of a tax sale, notwithstanding any informality in or preceding such sale, unless questioned within one year from its execution, and 51 Vic. ch. 101 sec. 58 which provides that \u201call assessments heretofore made and rates struck by the municipality are hereby confirmed and declared valid and binding upon all persons and corporations affected thereby.\u201d The Chief Justice of Manitoba, who tried the case, gave effect to this contention, but his decision was overruled by the full court..\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for the appellant cited Rorke v. Errington ([1]); Claxton v. Shibley ([2]); Fitzgerald v. Wilson ([3]); Church v. Fenton ([4]).\nGormully Q.C. for the respondent referred to McKay v. Crysler ([5]) and O\u2019 Brien v. Cogswell ([6]).\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. There never was a legal assessment of the lands in question in this case in the years 1880 and 1881, the lands never having been assessed in the manner prescribed by law, and no bylaw having been passed for levying a rate after the final revision of the roll in either of the years 1880 or 1881 for the alleged taxes for which the land was sold, the law requiring such a by-law to be passed, and consequently there can be no assessment of taxes for those years when there have been no taxes legally imposed; and if no taxes legally levied and no assessment there was, in my opinion no authority to sell and any such sale was void.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the tax sale under which the appellant claims was void and that the deed made in pursuance of it was a nullity.\nThe title and the facts are concisely stated at the beginning of the judgment given by the learned Chief Justice by whom the issue was tried.\nThe taxes for which the land was ostensibly sold were those claimed for the years 1880 and 1881.\nThe original contract for purchase from the Dominion Government was entered into by Adam Wilson Graham, under whom the respondent claims title, on the 4th of September, 1879. The patent was issued to Graham on the 27th September, 1881, at which date the purchase money was paid in full. On the 6th of March, 1882, the lands were sold for taxes by the municipality of Lorne, and on the 12th March, 1883, a deed was executed by the municipality purporting to convey them to John D. Macintosh, the purchaser at the tax sale, under whom the appellant claims title. Therefore the taxes for which the municipal authorities assumed to sell were taxes claimed to have accrued due whilst the legal title to the lands was vested in the Dominion Government.\nThe lands of the Dominion are by the British North America Act expressly exempted from provincial taxation.\nA question has been raised as to the liability to taxation of lands which the Dominion Government have contracted to sell to a purchaser whose contract is a subsisting one. It was argued before this court, and also in the courts below, that so long as the Dominion retains, in addition to the legal title, a beneficial interest, as it undoubtedly does in the case of lands agreed to be sold but which have not been fully paid for, the interest of the purchaser of such lands cannot be made the subject of taxation by provincial legislation. In the present case, as I have before stated, the purchase money was not paid until after the alleged assessment of the taxes for 1881. The legislature of Manitoba has made provision for the assessment and sale of the interests of purchasers of Dominion lands, expressly reserving the rights and interest of the Crown as represented by the Dominion. The 11th subsection of the 39th section of 43 Vic. ch. 1, which was passed on the 4th February, 1880, clearly implies that the interest of a purchaser of Crown lands, or his pre-emption right, should be liable to taxation and sale saving the rights of the Crown. The learned Chief Justice was of opinion that the legislature of Manitoba had the power thus to impose taxation on the interests of purchasers in unpatented Dominion lands, saving the interest of the Crown, and that by the section referred to they exercised this power, or rather indicated that the general provision for taxing lands included such interests. I am not at present prepared to say that this was not a correct conclusion, but as this appeal can be decided upon other grounds I refrain from expressing any opinion on the point.\nThe next inquiry, however, which is as to the legality and sufficiency of the assessment of the taxes for which the lands were sold, must be answered adversely to the appellant. As regards the taxes claimed for both the years 1880 and 1881 it appears to me to be very clear that there was no imposition of rates such as the law required, and consequently the land was sold for taxes not legally due. The legality of the taxes claimed for those two years depends on different statutes, that for 1880 being regulated by 43 Vic. ch. 1 and that for 1881 by 44 Vic. ch. 3, but they each contain a clause, identical in terms, providing that the council shall in each year after the revision of the roll pass a by-law \u201cfor levying a rate on all the real and personal property in the said roll to provide for all the necessary expenses of the said municipality.\u201d Then not only did the appellant fail to prove that there was any such by-law for either of these two years, but the respondent, so far as it was possible to do so, established that there was none. Mr. Crawford, the clerk and treasurer of the municipality and the custodian of its records, being called upon to produce the by-law under which the rate was levied in 1880, answers: \u201cI cannot. I don\u2019t think there ever was one. I cannot find one.\u201d And being asked as to a by-law in 1881, he says he cannot produce that for the same reason. He adds: \u201cThe minutes do not show that there was one passed and I cannot find that there was any such by-law.\u201d And to the question: \u201cYou would know if there was one passed ?\u201d He answers: \u201cYes, certainly.\u201d The same witness also produced the minute book and no trace of any by-law for either year was found in it.\nAfter this evidence it is useless to talk of presum\u0440tions; the fact is established that there never was a by-law in either year. It is true that it does appear that on the 2nd August, 1880, a resolution was passed that a rate of five mills on the dollar be struck on the total of the assessment roll and a similar resolution was passed on the 11th July, 1881. But these resolutions are not the equivalents of by-laws, not being passed with the same solemnities and being wanting moreover in the seal of the municipality and the signature of its head officer which are required to be affixed to every by-law. Therefore there was no valid or legal rate for these two years. 1880 and 1881 and the imposition of the taxes for which the land was sold was wholly illegal and void.\nThen sec. 58 of 51 Vic. cap. 101 is invoked. This statute was not passed until 18th May, 1888, more than five years after th\u0435 deed was executed. It is as follows: \u201cAll assessments made and rates heretofore struck by the municipality are hereby confirmed and declared valid and binding upon all persons and corporations affected thereby.\u201d Against giving this the ex post facto effect contended for the most rigid construction must be adopted, and I think the plain answer to it is that given by Mr. Justice Bain that it is to be restricted to defective proceedings in the nature of irregularities and not to absolute nullities such as we have here. And further that, as Mr. Justice Killam points out, it is to be read as applying only to validate existing rates and assessments for the purpose of subsequent proceedings to be afterwards taken for their enforcement, and not as making good sales made on the basis of absolutely void proceedings. The legislation appears to have been passed in the interest of municipalities and not in aid of purchasers. The rates being satisfied by the sale the municipality has no longer any interest inasmuch as no rates or assessments any longer exist to which the clause can apply. Lastly the 45 Vic. ch. 16 sec. 7 is insisted upon as an enactment curing all defects as well in the assessment as in the sale and giving to the deed by itself the effect of conferring an indefeasible title without regard to the validity of the assessment.\nIn O\u2019Brien v. Cogswell (1) I rested my judgment upon a construction which restricted a section, similar in its terms to this, to irregularities and defects in the proceedings for sale as distinguished from the proceedings for the assessment and levying of the tax. The latter procedure I considered to be analogous to an adjudication whilst the sale is in the nature of an execution.\nIn the Ontario statute in question in McKay v. Crysler the language did not admit of this so easily. I say this, however, not by way of questioning the decision of the court in that case by which I am of course bound; I merely wish to point out that McKay v. Crysler was a stronger case for the absolute construction contended for by the appellant than either O\u2019Brien v. Cogswell or the present case. Here the words are \u201cnotwithstanding any informality or defect in or preceding such sale.\u201d These words I construe, as I did similar, words in O\u2019Brien v. Cogswell, as applying only to informalities and defects in the sale or in the proceedings relating to the sale. I think I am entitled so to confine the words \u201cpreceding such sale,\u201d and to read them as referring to the preliminaries of the sale as distinguished from the levying of the assessment and the imposition of the tax, for the reason that in so doing I am carrying out the principle laid down by the court in McKay v. Crysler (in which at the time I certainly did not concur) that the courts are bound to place on such enactments as these the most restricted construction possible in order to prevent the gross violation of common right and justice which would follow if a comprehensive construction were adopted. At all events McKay v. Crysler ([7]) and O\u2019Brien v. Cogswell ([8]) have settled, so far as this court is concerned, a principle of construction applicable to this section which makes it impossible to construe it as the appellant contends. If it is asked what scope or application can then be given to this clause I answer that there is abundant room for its application since it shuts out all objections on the ground of irregularity in the preliminaries of the sale such as irregular advertisements and other defects of a similar kind.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon a true construction of the British North America Act in connection with the Manitoba Act, Dominion statute 33 Vic. ch. 3, lands in the province of Manitoba do not, in my opinion, become subject to municipal taxation until the issue of letters patent therefor, and consequently the land in question was not liable to taxation prior to the 8th day of April, 1881. I am of opinion further that, assuming the land in question to have been liable to taxation in 1880 and 1881, the matter relied upon as evidencing the assessment of the land and the imposition of a tax thereon in those years did not operate as an assessment of the land and the imposition of any tax thereon in those years. What was done appears to have been done in open and wilful disregard of the law relating to the assessment of and levying a tax upon land in the province; and I am of opinion further that the statutes of the province of Manitoba relied upon as making valid deeds executed to give effect to sales of land for taxes have no application to deeds executed by the heads of municipalities purporting to convey lands as sold for arrears of taxes in cases where in point of law the land so purported to be sold was not liable to be assessed and taxed by the municipality; nor to cases where, although liable to be assessed, no assessment was in point of fact made as required by law, but on the contrary, as in the present case, the essential steps required by law to be taken to effect a valid assessment and a valid imposition of a rate never were taken, and the law in that respect was utterly disregarded and as it were set at defiance. It would, in my opinion, be a monstrous perversion of justice to construe those statutes either as enabling the head of the municipal institutions in the province to confiscate at their pleasure the lands of individuals by executing deeds as upon a sale for arrears of taxes during a period when the lands were not liable to be assessed, or when the land so purported to be sold had not been assessed as required by the law in order to subject lands to taxation by municipalities, or to make valid deeds which had been executed under such circumstances. The appeal therefore, in my opinion, must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The lands in question were sold for taxes on the 6th of March, 1882, under a warrant under the hand of the warden and seal of the municipality bearing date the 21st of January, 1882, and the deed was made to the purchaser by the warden and treasurer on the 12th of March, 1883. The sale had been duly advertised according to statute, except that the notice omitted to state that the sale was to begin at noon.\nUnder the law of Manitoba lands are liable to be sold for taxes when the taxes are two years in arrear. The two years\u2019 alleged arrears in this case were for 1880 and 1881.\nIt is objected that the land was not taxable in 1880 because the patent from, the Crown did not issue until April, 1881. But the patentee, Wilson, had bought and paid for the land in December, 1879, and the patent, though not issued until 1881, merely carried out the sale of 1879. It has been argued that no interest in the land was created by the purchase and payment, and in effect that the title remained so absolutely in the Crown that it was still a matter of mere bounty to grant the land. The patent does not so treat the matter, but on the contrary states that the land was granted because the grantee was found to be \u201cduly entitled thereto\u2014the said lands being part and parcel of those known as \u2018Dominion Lands \u05d9 and mentioned in the Dominion Land Act of 1879\u201d The rights of purchasers are recognised in that act in various ways. Section 31, which declares that payments for lands purchased in the ordinary manner shall be made in cash, except in the case of payments in scrip or in military bounty warrants, refers to lands of the class of those now in question. These lands were purchased in the ordinary manner and paid for in scrip. By section 82 the entry, receipt or certificate of the agent who sold the lands entitled Wilson to maintain suits at law or in equity against any wrongdoer or trespasser on the lands as effectually as he could do under a patent of the land from the Crown. A person who obtained a homestead entry had a right given in nearly the same terms to maintain actions, but there are several provisions relating to free grant lands which, under the principle expressio unius est exclusio alterius, rather go to emphasise the right of a purchaser in the ordinary way. Such e.g. is subsection 13 of section 34 which declares that the title shall remain in the Crown until the issue of the patent, and that such lands shall not be liable to be taken in execution before the issue of the patent; and such also is subsection 17 which forbids assignments of homestead rights before the issue of the patent except as elsewhere mentioned in the act. There is no restriction upon assignments by a purchaser in the ordinary way. If it should happen that, either innocently or fraudulently, another person purchased the same land and obtained a patent for it the first purchaser could, under section 78, have the patent annulled\u2014as was done in several cases to be found in the Upper Canada and Ontario reports under a similar jurisdiction, in one of which cases, Stevens v. Cook ([9]), land bought and paid for by one man had, through an oversight, been sold again and patented to another man.\nNor must we hastily concede the law to be, as urged in argument, that the purchaser would be without legal remedy in the event, if such a thing were supposable, of being refused his patent. It is not necessary, however, to discuss that hypothetical position, and it is therefore unadvisable to do so.\nIt is, in my opinion, manifest from the provisions of the Manitoba Municipal Corporations Act 1880, under which the assessment was made, that every interest in land, except the interest of the Crown and some others specially exempted, was made taxable. There was no difference of opinion on that point in the court below, and I shall adopt what was said upon it by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba in place of making an independent examination of the statute:\nIt was only by sec. 271 of 46 & 47 Vic. c. 1 that provision was made in express terms for unpatented lands being under certain circumstances liable to taxation. By sec. 20 of 43 Vic. c. 1 the council was to assess and levy on the whole real and personal property within its jurisdiction except as hereafter provided, &c., the first exception from taxation mentioned, sec. 23, being real estate vested in or held in trust for Her Majesty, but the legislature plainly intended that lands \u043e\u0441cupied, though unpatented, should be included among the property liable to taxation, because sec. 39 subsec. 11 makes express provisions for the effect of a sale in the case of land sold for taxes before the issuing of letters patent from the Crown, so that such cases should in no way affect the rights of Her Majesty in the land but only transfer to the purchaser such rights of\u2019 pre-emption, or other claim, as the holder of the land or any other person had acquired; the previous municipal acts 36. Vic. \u0441. 24, 38 Vic. \u0441. 41 and 40 Vic. \u0441. 6, all contain similar provisions. There car., I think, be no doubt that even before the passing of 46 & 47 Vic. c.1. s. 271, lands purchased from the Crown were liable to taxation before the issuing of the patent, and on default in payment could be sold so as at all events to transfer the interest of the holder though leaving the rights of Her Majesty intact, and imposing on the Crown no obligation to recognise the purchaser or tax sale.\nThe policy of the law and the obligations of ownership in a new country, where the improvements resulting from municipal expenditure enure to the common benefit of all the owners of land, concur with the provisions of the Statute which aim at making all who enjoy the benefits bear their share of the burdens.\nThere is an Upper Canada case of Ryckman v. Van Voltenburg ([10]), in which the contest was between a tax title and the patent which was issued, many years after the tax sale, to the representative of the original nominee of the Crown. The case would appear, if time were taken to examine it which I do not propose to do, to be !more like the present case in principle than at first sight it would seem to be, and the concluding passage of the judgment of Draper C.J. would be seen to be, mutatis Mutandis, appropriate to the Manitoba law. He said:\nI do not see how proper effect can be given to the provision of the assessment laws, without holding that the sheriff has power to convey away the present right and future acquired title of the party in whose favour the description for grant issued.\nThe \u201cdescription for grant\u201d indicated that the person named was entitled to the patent, and all lands \u201cdescribed as granted,\u201d were ,taxable.\nThe circumstances that the lands in this case were Dominion lands, while in Upper Canada they belonged to the province under whose legislation they were taxed and sold, is not a distinction that affects the question. No right of the Dominion is touched by the tax sale. What is assessed and sold, either before or after the patent, is the interest of the purchaser.\nBut it is further objected that these lands, if liable in 1880 to taxation, have not been legally sold. It is said that the rates were not imposed as the statute directed by by-law passed after the final revision of the roll, but only by resolution passed before the roll was finally revised. It is also said that the assessment itself was irregular because the council passed a resolution in each of the years 1880 and 1881 that the lands in the municipality should be assessed or taxed at the uniform rate of $3 an acre. The municipal law in force in each of those years ([11]),\u2014not the same statute in 1881 as in 1880, for among the annual crops in that fertile country, one that never fails is a statute re-enacting or changing the municipal law\u2014required the assessors to prepare an asessment roll in conformity with a schedule, in which after diligent inquiry they were to set down all the information therein contained, and were to notify each person assessed, if known, of the amount of his assessment. One item, for which the schedule provides three columns, is headed \u201cassessment,\u201d the three sub-heads being \u201cReal,\u201d \u201cPersonal\u201d and \u201cTotal\u201d\u2014but what \u201cAssessment\u201d means in relation to the supposed or the actual value of land is not explained. Provision is made for the person assessed furnishing information to the assessors, and the notice given him, if he is known, enables him to appeal to the Court of Revision if dissatisfied with what the assessors do. It happens in this case that the rolls when looked at show that the land in question was assessed at $3 an acre, the same amount mentioned in the resolution of the coun\u0441\u0456l but there is not a word in evidence to discredit the work of the assessors as being strictly what the statutes required. I see nothing whatever in the objection.\nAnother complaint is that the notice of sale failed to state, as according to the statute it ought to have stated, that the sale of the lands on the list would begin at 12 o\u2019clock noon. There is no pretense that the omission did any harm. The sale took place before an audience which no one says would have been larger if the hour had been named. I should gathe from what a witness wh was at the sale says that it began some time after noon, and this particular land was not the first sold. The treasurer, who conducted the sale, was a witness at the trial but he does not appear to have been asked at what time of day he began the sale. The defect in the notice was certainly an irregularity, but it cannot be used, as was attempted, as evidence that the sale was not fairly and openly and properly conducted. It does not touch the conduct of the sale, and some other evidence which seems to have been expected to show improper conduct among the bidders, or a combination not to bid against each other, failed to show any such thing. The conduct of the sale is unimpeached.\nThe policy of the legislation in Manitoba seems to be, as it has been for many years in Ontario, to make tax titles unimpeachable after a reasonable time has been allowed for questioning the regularity of the proceedings under which the land has been assessed and sold. With this object various enactments have from year to year been included in the municipal statutes. These enactments are not all identical in their wording. It would be unwise to attempt an exposition of any of them beyond what the present case calls for. The sale, it will be remembered, was in 1882, and the deed was made by the treasurer on the 12th of March, 1883. On the 29th of April, 1881, was passed the act. 47 Vic. ch. 11, which declared in section 340, that:\nAll lands heretofore sold for school, municipal or other taxes, for which deeds have been given to purchasers, shall become absolutely vested in such purchasers, their heirs or assigns, unless the validity thereof has been questioned in the manner above mentioned before the first day of January, 1885.\nThe manner above mentioned was \u201cbefore some court of competent jurisdiction, by some person interested in the land sold,\u201d by section 338 which referred to prospective sales.\nThis section 340 appears to me to conclude the contest. The argument to the contrary is that the land cannot be held to have been sold for taxes unless there were taxes due and in arrear for two years, and the two learned judges who, in the court below, held against this tax title adopted that reading of the section, and moreover held that, by reason principally of the want of a by-law striking the rate in 1880 and 1881, and the striking of it in the former year before the roll was finally revised, no taxes were due. That is an extreme view of the law which would render these curative provisions of little use, and by perpetuating the uncertainty of the validity of any tax title discourage all persons except speculators from buying at a tax sale, and ensure the sacrifice of the land. I think, with deference to those learned judges, that they have misunderstood the Ontario decisions\u2019 on which they found their opinions. There has been some difference of opinion as to whether a cognate provision of the Ontario statutes was satisfied if any taxes remained in arrears at the time of the sale or whether it was not essential that some taxes had been due for the specified time which was once five and afterwards three years. I myself held the latter opinion. It had been held that sales were void if made for more \u2014sometimes a very little more\u2014than the amount of taxes strictly demandable. The curative provision was apparently intended to correct that construction of the law, and prevent a man who let his taxes go unpaid for the five or three years from escaping the consequence of his default by pointing to some error in the figures.\nBut whatever may have been the views taken on that point the question has usually been whether the taxes were not paid, as in Hamilton v. Eggleton ([12]) and in Donovan v. Hogan ([13]), or had not been shown to have been de facto assessed, as was held in this court in McKay v. Crysler ([14]). Where, as expressed by Wilson J. in Jones v. Cowden ([15]),\nthere is no reason to doubt that the land was actually though perhaps not formally taxed\nthe deed was held valid, as it was in Jones v. Cowden, though that case was ultimately decided on the registry laws. I may refer, also, to the language of my brother Gwynne in Hamilton v. Eggleton and in McKay v. Crysler as to the cure of all defects and irregularities when the taxes had been allowed to go unpaid for the full period of five or three years.\nBut all this discussion seems futile in the face of the sweeping clause contained in an act passed in 1888 ([16]).\nAll assessments made and rates struck by the municipalities are hereby confirmed and declared valid and binding upon all persons and corporations affected thereby; but this section shall not in any way affect any appeal or cases pending at the time of the coming into force of this act, when the validity of any such assessment is brought in question.\nThe present case does not come within the saving proviso, and I am unable to see how we can give effect to the language of the clause, which is to my apprehension very plain and unambiguous, unless we hold the assessments and rates now in question to be valid and binding.\nIn my opinion we should allow the appeal and restore the judgment pronounced by the Chief Justice at the trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Mulock & Robarts.\nSolicitors for respondent: Martin, Curtis, Anderson & Bearisto.\n1 6 Man.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Patterson JJ,\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE)\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Action in disavowal\u2014Prescription\u2014Appearance by attorney Service of summons C S.L G ch 83 s 44. Parties to suit\nIn an action brought in 1866 for the sum of $800 and interest at 12\u00bd per cent against two brothers S. J. D. and W. McD. D. being the amount of a promissory note signed by them, one copy of the summons was served at the domicile of S. J D at Three Rivers the other defendant W. McD. D. then residing in the state of New York. On the return of the writ the respondent filed an appearance as attorney for both defendants, and proceedings were suspended untll 1874 when judgment was taken and in December, 1880. upon the issue of an alias writ of execution, the appellant having failed in an opposition to judgment, filed a petition in disavowed of the 'respondent. The disavowed attorney pleaded inter alia that he had been authorized to appear by a letter signed by S. J. D., saying: \"Be so good as to file an appearanse in the case to which the enclosed has reference, &c.\" and also prescription, ratification and insufficiency of the allegations of the petition of disavowal. The petition in disavowed was dismissed. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the matter in controversy did not amount to the sum of $2,000.\nHeld, 1st. That as the judgment obtained against the appellant in March, 1874, on the appearance filed by the respondent, exceeded the amount of $2,000, the judgment on the petition for disavowed was appealable.\n2nd. That there was i.e evidence of authority given to the respondent or of ratification by appellant of respondent's act and therefore the petition in disavowal should be maintained\n3rd. Following McDonald v. Dawson (11 Q. L. E. 181) that the only prescription available against a petition in disavowed is that of thirty years. 4. That where a petitioning in disavowal lists been served on all parties to the suit and is only contested by the attorney, whose authority to act is denied, the latter cannot on an appeal complain that all parties interested in the result are not parties to the appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court at Three Rivers, dismissing the petition in disavowal taken by W. McD. Dawson against J. B. C. Dumont, the respondent.\nIn 1866 an action was instituted by the tutor of Miss McDonald against the two brothers Simon J. Dawson and William McD. Dawson the present appellant. The action was for the recovery of the amount of a promissory note for $800, with interest at 12 \u00bd per cent dated on the 27th February, 1862, and payable on the 25th June of same year.\nSimon J. Dawson was served with the summons at his domicile at Three Rivers on the 11th October, 1866, but W. McD. Dawson the other defendant, alleged that the summons was never served upon him and that at that time from 1864 to 1868 he had no residence in Three Rivers, but was residing in New York.\nThe summons was entered in court in 1866, and no other proceedings were taken until 1874, when the pupil, having become of age, was substituted to her tutor by reprise distance, and a judgment by default was entered against both Simon J. Dawson and W. McD. Dawson. It was only after this judgment that \"W. McD Dawson was made aware of it by an execution issued against his goods and chattels.\nThereupon the W. McD. Dawson made oppositions to the judgment obtained against him; these oppositions were rejected except the last, which was maintained by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada ([1]) render- on the 12th January, 1885, and all proceedings in the cause and on the writ of execution were stayed until the decision of the Superior Court on the petition in disavowal was obtained. At the trial of the petition in disavowal, the following letter was produced as evidence of the authority of the respondent to appear for\nW. McD. Dawson:\n\"THREE RIVERS\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\u2014Be so good as to file an appearance in the case to which the enclosed has reference The matter is arranged for the present, but as I may not get to Three Rivers before the 25th so as to see Mr McDougall, it is necessary in the meantime to file an appearance, so as to prevent judgment going by default.\n\"I have been busy for some days past with Chaudi\u00e9re matters hut I hope to get to Three Rivers to-morrow or Thursday evening.\n\"Truly yours\n\"S.J. Dawson.\"\nBy the return of the bailiff on the writ of summons it appeared that only one copy of the summons was served upon Simon J Dawson at his domicile at Three Rivers The petition in disavowal having been dismissed by the Superior Court, the judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nAfter the hearing of the case in the Court of Queen's Bench and before judgment \"W. McD Dawson died and S. J. Dawson, the present appellant, having obtained leave to accept the estate under benefit of inventory, was allowed to take the present appeal, reserving to the respondent any rights they might have acquired under certain proceedings theretofore taken.\nThe principal questions which arose on the present appeal were:\u2014\n1st. Was the ease appealable? . 2nd. Has W. McD. Dawson ever been duly served with the original summons ?\n3rd. Has Mr. Dumont ever been authorized to appear for W. McD. Dawson ?\n4th. Can the appellant succeed in the present appeal inasmuch as all the interested parties are not represented, the writ of appeal having been served only on the respondent ?\nIrvine Q.C. and Robertson for appellant.\nMcLean for respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. This is an appeal from a judgment dismissing the petition in disavowal of Mr. Wm. McD. Dawson against Mr. Dumont, the respondent, who appeared for him in a suit brought against his brother and himself in the Superior Court at Three Rivers and in which a judgment was obtained in 1874.\nNow it is not pretended that the respondent had any other authority than the letter which was addressed to Mr. Dumont by Mr. S. J. Dawson on the 22nd October, 1866, which is as follows:\u2014\nTHREE RIVERS\nMr DEAR SIR,\u2014\nBe so good as to file an appearance in the case to which the enclosed has reference. The matter is arranged for the present, but as I may not get to Three Rivers before the 25th so as to see Mr. McDougall, it is necessary in the meantime to file an appearance, so as to prevent judgment going by default.\nI have been busy for some days past with Chaudi\u00e9re matters, but hope to get to Three Rivers tomorrow or Thursday morning.\nTruly yours,\nS. J. Dawson.\nNow it is possible, inasmuch as he does not express it in so many words, that Mr. Damont might have considered and no doubt did consider that the letter gave him authority to appear for the two defendants, but even supposing it did give him authority, and that Mr. S. J. Dawson had given it in so many words, that would not get us a step further in the case, for we would then have to ask; Where does it appear that Mr. Dawson got the authority to name an attorney for his brother ? There is no evidence whatever of record; on the contrary the evidence is to the effect that he had not such authority. I cannot conceive how the courts below came to the conclusion that there was evidence that Mr. Dumont was authorized to appear in this matter.\nNow the moment we have come to that conclusion the next question is whether there is any evidence of ratification by Mr. W. McD. Dawson. The only fact relied on is the evidence showing that when Mr. McD. Dawsen came to discover years after, and to his great surprise, that an execution had been taken out against him, he naturally went to inquire about this at the office of the prothonotary with Mr. Dumont. Now there is not a title of evidence that Mr. Dawson said to Mr. Dumont on that occasion either impliedly or expressly '. \"You were right to appear but you should have pleaded,'' or that he ever gave his assent to what had been done. In my opinion it was natural for him to go and look after the judgment which so seriously affected his interests, yet we are asked to infer that he ratified the act which at that very time he was repudiating in every way he could.\nAs to the question of jurisdiction I cannot see how the objection can be urged if we had jurisdiction in the cases between the same parties that have already' been decided by this court.\nUnder these circumstances I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J._I think it quite clear that there was no original authority given to Mr. Dumont, though Mr Dumont supposed that he was properly authorized by the letter of the 23rd October written by Mr. Simon J. Dawson at Quebec. This letter on its face is general in its terms, authorizing Mr. Dumont\nTo file an appearance in the case to which the inclosed has reference. The matter is arranged for the present, but as I may not get to Three Rivers before the 25th, so as to see Mr. McDougall, it is necessary in the meantime to file an appearance, so as to prevent judgment going by default.\nNow construing the words in their ordinary meaning, and setting aside the relation of brother existing between the two defendants it would only refer to an appearance for the party who sent the writ, and wrote and signed the letter and there is no evidence that he either pretended to be or was authorized by his brother the defendant William McD. Dawson to write the letter. But granting that in so many words Mr. Simon J. Dawson had written, authorizing Mr. Dumont to appear for both defendants, where did Mr. Simon J. Dawson get authority to do that? Where is there the evidence of record that Mr. William McD. Dawson had authorized his brother to retain the ser-vices of an attorney for him ? Are we to say that the mere relationship existing between the two parties is enough? Surely not. There was therefore originally no authority to enter appearance for \"William McD. Dawson.\nThen as regards ratification we must expect Mr. Dumont would put the case as strongly in his favour as he possibly could and what does he say as to any subsequent recognition and confirmation of his authority by Mr. William McD. Dawson ? At p. 84 of the case we find the following evidence:\u2014\nI cannot say positively if William McDonnell Dawson, one of the defendants, had any knowledge of the appearance I filed in the case, but I know that in 1874 he was aware of it, having had occasion to speak of it to him, and having gone with him to the prothonotary's office of the Superior Court at Three Rivers to examine the record. in the case. Before that date I do not remember that I spoke of it.\nThere could be no ratification in this for how can Mr. William McD. Dawson be held to have then ratified the act of Mr. Dumont when we know from the record that at that very time he was opposing the judgment? The conversation might have been and probably was a series of objections on the part of Mr. William McD. Dawson. Therefore, so far as that goes there is no ratification. So that there is nothing of record by which it is proved or from which we can infer as a fact that the respondent was ever authorized to represent Mr. William McD. Dawson, or that the latter in any manner ratified his unauthorized proceedings. That being so, upon the merits the judgment appealed from was wrong exactly upon the ground taken by Mr. Justice Tessier in the Court of Queen's Bench that Mr \"William McD. Dawson was never served with a copy of the summons nor authorized Mr. Dumont to appear for him.\nAs to the question of jurisdiction\u2014-that question is concluded by the decisions of this court upon contestations of oppositions. I can draw no distinction between an opposition and a petition for disavowal. This is really a judgment in a judicial proceeding in which the question has been finally decided by the highest court of final resort in the province of Quebec, and the matter in controversy involves a sum of over $2,000, the amount fixed by the statute, so that the appeal is competent within the exact words of the statute.\nThen as to the question of law which has been raised, viz., that of prescription, it was determined by the judgment of the majority of this court in the former case of Dawson v. McDonald ([2]) that under the Code of Civil Procedure and the ordinance of 1667 there is no other prescription or limitation to a petition for a disavowal than that of 30 years and I am bound to follow that decision.\nThere remains but the objection taken by the respondent's counsel that all the parties are not before this court on the present appeal. This is removed by what has been suggested by my brother Taschereau during the argument.\nFOURNIER J. concurred in the observations of Strong J.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014No direct relief is asked against the original plaintiffs. All that is now asked is that a judgment may be pronounced which may be - an element in attacking the judgment which they still have in their favour. Then it appears also that this petition was served on all the parties, and if they chose not to contest it, but elected to allow the point to be decided upon a contestation between the appellant and the respondent, they are not now in a position to complain because they were not served with a notice of appeal. For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be reversed, and a judgment entered in the Superior Court declaring the disavowal valid with costs in all courts.\nPATTERSON J. The other members of the court being clear that we have jurisdiction I shall only say that I have not considered the point sufficiently to assent, but will not enter a dissent.\nI think the real question is: Was Mr. Dumont authorized to appear for both defendants? I am scarcely prepared to say upon the evidence we have that he was. I am not prepared to hold that an appearance authorized by one brother a co-defendant is authority to appear for both. Whether the judgment obtained on the subsequent opposition does not put an end to the objection I have some doubt.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : A. Roberston.\nSolicitor for respondent : L. D. Paquin.\n[1] Cassels\u2019s Dig. 322.\n[2] 11 Q. L. R. 181.\n"

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Construction of\u2014Telephone service\u2014Transmission of message\u2014Use of wire.\nThe Bell Telephone Co. carried on the business of executing orders by telephone for messenger boys, cabs, etc., which it sold to the Elec. Desp. Co., agreeing, among other things, not to transmit or give, in any manner, directly or indirectly, any orders for messengers, cabs, etc., to any person or persons, company or corporation, except to the Elec. Desp. Co. The G.N.W. Tel. Co. afterwards established a messenger service for the purposes of which the wires of the Telephone Co. were used. In an action for breach of the agreement with the Elec. Desp. Co. and for an injunction to restrain the Telephone Co. from allowing their wires to be used for giving orders for messengers, etc.:\nHeld, Ritchie C.J. doubting, that the Telephone Co., being ignorant of the nature of communications sent over their wires by subscribers, did not \u201ctransmit\u201d such orders within the meaning of the agreement; that the use of the wires by subscribers could not be restricted; and that the Telephone Co. was under no obligation, even if it were possible to do so, to take measures to ascertain the nature of all communications with a view to preventing such orders being given.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favour of the defendants.\nThe action is brought by the plaintiffs for breach of an agreement entered into with them by the defendants and asks for damages and for an injunction.\nBefore the date of the said agreement the defendants in connection with their regular telephone business had been and on that date were carrying on a messenger business at their said central office, where they kept messengers for the delivery of messages, letters and parcels throughout the city of Toronto and its suburbs and had been in the habit of receiving at said central office, by means of their telephones and wires, orders from the lessees of said telephones and others for the services of messengers.\nAt this time the plaintiffs were carrying on in the city of Toronto the business of the district telegraph and telephone exchange system including telegraph signalling and despatching and delivering messages, goods and parcels by messengers or vehicles, and they possessed and used in such business several lines of telephonic communication in the said city of Toronto, and they had in their employ a number of messengers for the delivery of messages, letters and parcels throughout the said city of Toronto and its suburbs, and an action had been brought by the Canadian Telephone Company (whose interests were subsequently acquired by the Bell Company) against the plaintiffs, and for the purpose and with the view of settling the disputes, as well between the parties to that action as between the defendants and the plaintiffs, an agreement was entered into between the said parties.\nBy the first clause of the agreement, the defendants covenant and agree:\u2014\u201cThat they will and hereby do bargain, sell, assign, and set over to the said Electric Despatch Company, their successors and assigns, for the period of ten years from the 1st day of October, in the year of Our Lord 1882, all the messenger, cab, city express, cartage and livery call business, now carried on in the city of Toronto by the said Bell Telephone Company, and such other and further business rights and privileges as are hereinafter mentioned, together with the good-will of the said business.\nBy the 8th clause the defendants covenant and agree:\u2014\u201cThat they will place in direct communication with the Electric Company\u2019s office all subscribers to their telephone exchange system who desire to order messenger, cab, city express or livery service, and give the Electric Company free communication with the subscribers to the Bell Company telephone system in the same manner as telephone exchange subscribers are now furnished communication with one another.\nIn the sixteenth clause the defendants expressly agree \u201cthat they will in no manner and at no time during the term of this agreement, transmit or give directly or indirectly free or for remuneration any messenger orders to any person or persons, company or corporation, except the Electric Despatch Company as herein set forth, and that from and after the first day of October next, being the month of October, 1882, they will cease to do any such business as herein agreed to be done by the Electric Despatch Company.\u201d\nThe substance of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that in or about the early part of the month of July, 1887, the defendants entered into an agreement with the Great North-West Telegraph Company, in which they agreed to render to the latter company the same services, and to grant to them the same privileges, that they had already agreed to grant to the plaintiffs.\nAt the trial judgment was given in favour of the defendants, the trial judge holding that the messages sent by persons using the wires were not transmitted by the company. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judges were equally divided and the appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C. and Moss Q.C. for the appellants. As to messages being \u201ctransmitted\u201d by telephone see The Attorney General v. The Edison Telephone Co.[3]\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 claim is not against public policy. Printing and Numerical Registering Co. v. Sampson[4]; Ontario Salt Co. v. Merchants Salt Co.[5]\nThe learned counsel also cited Pugh v. The City and Suburban Telephone Co.[6]; Tipping v.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I have entertained some doubts as to the questions involved in this case which are not entirely removed, but as the other members of the court are unanimous I will not delay the decision.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I have had some doubt in this case on the question of public policy but my general impressions, as I stated some years ago in The Ontario Salt Co. v. The Merchants Salt Co.[11], are strongly against avoiding contracts on that ground in cases which have not been the subjects of previous decision. I think, therefore, that I ought not to give effect to these doubts. I concur in the judgment of my brother Gwynne. FOURNIER J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is simply one as to the construction of an agreement entered into between the appellants and the respondents under the seals of the respective companies and bearing date the 12th day of September, 1882. By that agreement, after reciting among other things that the respondents were then carrying on in the city of Toronto a general district messenger, cab, city express, cartage and livery call business, which they had agreed to sell and the appellants had agreed to purchase upon the terms thereinafter contained, it was witnessed that the respondents did thereby bargain, sell, assign and set over unto the appellants for the period of ten years from the 1st day of October then next, all the messenger, cab, city express, cartage and livery call business then carried on by the respondents in the city of Toronto, and such other and further business, rights and privileges thereinafter mentioned together with the good-will of the business. Now the messenger business so then carried on by the respondents, and so sold to the appellants, was carried on in this manner. The respondents kept a large staff of messenger boys, and when requested by any of the lessees of their telephone instruments to send a messenger boy to such lessee, or to deliver a message for such lessee, they did so by one of their messenger boys, making a charge to the person so served; so likewise when requested by any such lessee to send to such lessee or to any place for such lessee at his request a cab, city express, cart or livery vehicle, or horse, or the like, they did so, in like manner making a charge for such service to the person for whom it was rendered. This being the nature of the business which the respond- ents were carrying on under the name of a \u201cGeneral District messenger, cab, city express, cartage and livery call business,\u201d which they had agreed to sell and had sold to the appellants, the agreement proceeds to provide the means for giving effect to the sale so that it should commence to take effect upon the 1st day of October then next, from and after which day the respondents covenanted to cease to do any such business. The means so provided are as follows: Paragraph 2 of the agreement provides that the respondents will, on or before the 1st day of October then next, transfer the telephone line wires of all cabmen, carters, city expressmen and liverymen who are subscribers to the telephone exchange system from the central office of the said respondents to and through a twenty-five wire magnets telephone switch placed in the central office of the appellants by and at the expense of the respondents for the free use of, and to be operated by, the appellants during the term of the agreement, in such manner and so that all telephone communications over the said telephone line wires of such cabmen, carters, city express and livery men, must pass through said switch in the central office of the appellants. By paragraph 2a the respondents agree to transfer to the appellants all existing contracts for cab, livery, express or cartage service, but that if any parties to such contracts should insist on the respondents carrying out the said contracts the appellants should place such parties in direct communication with the respondents as requested during the existence of such contracts, and that the respondents should collect the rates collectable for any services rendered and account to the appellants therefor.\nBy paragraph 3 the respondents covenanted that the telephone lines of all cabmen, carters, city express and livery men who should thereafter become subscribers to the respondents\u2019 exchange system should be connected only through the appellants\u2019 central office as above stated.\nBy paragraph 4 that the respondents will erect and connect such wires as are necessary for the transmission of communications between the twenty-five wire switch placed in the central office of the appellants as before mentioned and the respondents\u2019 central office free of expense to the appellants, and that the appellants should have the free and continuous use of said switch and lines during the continuance of the agreement.\nBy paragraph 5 that they will maintain and keep in repair the said lines and switch free of expense to the appellants.\nBy paragraph 6 that they will immediately upon the said lines being transferred as above agreed notify the said cabmen, carters, city express and livery men of the transfer of said lines, constituting the office of the appellants a branch or switch station of the respondents, and that in future the fares payable for each cab, express waggon or livery vehicle ordered through the respondents\u2019 telephones will be due and payable to the appellants.\nNow it is admitted that every thing so undertaken to be done by the respondents has been done, and that the appellants by the switch placed in their central office have been put into direct communication with all cabmen, carters, city express and liverymen who are subscribers to the respondents\u2019 telephone exchange system, and lessees of their telephone instruments who can communicate with each other without the intervention of the respondents or of their servants in their central office. It is contended, however, on the part of the appellants, that if any lessee of a telephone instrument of the respondents should make use of such instru- ment for the purpose of requesting any other lessee of such an instrument to send to the former a messenger boy, cab, express cart, or livery carriage, &c., that inasmuch as such request would pass through the central office of the respondents such use by any lessee of the respondents of the telephone instrument leased to him would constitute a breach by the respondents of their covenant contained in the agreement, which is as follows, namely:\nThat they will in no manner and at no time during the continuance of this agreement transmit or give, directly or indirectly, free or for remuneration, any messenger, cab, city express or livery orders to any person or persons, company or corporation, except the Electric Company as herein set forth, and that from and after the first day of October next they will cease to do any such business as herein agreed to be done by the Electric Company.\nThe argument in support of this construction of the above covenant is that when one lessee of a telephone instrument of the respondents holds communication with another lessee of such an instrument the communication, whatever it may be, is transmitted over the wires which are the property of the respondents from the one lessee to the other, and that therefore the respondents are the persons who \u201ctransmit\u201d that communication, although their sole act and part in the matter is causing the wire extending from the telephone instrument of the one lessee, at the request of such lessee, to be connected with the telephone instrument of the other lessee in utter ignorance of the nature of the communication intended to be passed from one to the other, and that in case such communication should prove to be a request made upon the person receiving the communication to send a messenger to the person sending it that becomes a breach by the respondents of their covenant. The whole question is, therefore, reduced to this: Is this the true sense in which the word \u201ctransmit\u201d is used in the covenant? Doubtless the word \u201ctransmit\u201d is an accurate expression to make use of in relation to every message which is sent from one subscriber to the respondents\u2019 telephone exchange system to another. Every message is transmitted from one person to another along the respondents\u2019 wires, but in such case the person who transmits the message is no other than the sender of it. The wires constitute the mode of transmission by which the one lessee transmits the message along the wires to the other. It is the person who breathes into the instrument the message which is transmitted along the wires who alone can be said to be the person who \u201ctransmits\u201d the message. The owners of the telephone wires, who are utterly ignorant of the nature of the message intended to be sent, cannot be said within the meaning of the covenant to transmit a message of the purport of which they are ignorant. The contention of the appellants in effect operates to construe the respondents\u2019 covenant as if it was thus expressed:\nThat they will not transmit or give directly or indirectly, or suffer or permit any lessee of any of their telephone instruments to make use of any of such instruments for the purpose of transmitting or giving any messenger, cab, city express or livery order to any person or corporation except the appellants.\nThe respondents\u2019 covenant is, in my judgment, open to no such construction. The business which the respondents made over to the appellants was simply that which the respondents had been carrying on. As to all cabmen, carters, city express, or liverymen, which were or should become subscribers to the respondents\u2019 telephone exchange system, they have been placed in direct communication with the appellants by the switch placed in the appellants\u2019 central office as had been agreed upon, and no complaint is made of any breach by the respondents of their covenant as regards any of such persons; any lessee, however, of a telephone instrument might through his instrument ask any other lessee to send him a cab or an express cart, equally as a messenger boy, and if the non-interference by the respondents to prevent one of the subscribers to their telephone exchange system from asking another subscriber to send him a messenger would constitute a breach by the respondents of their covenant, so also would the respondents\u2019 non-interference to prevent any subscriber from asking another to send a cab or express cart. Now the messenger boy business which the respondents formerly carried on, and which they made over to the appellants, was conducted in this manner. When a lessee of one of their telephone instruments called upon the respondents and requested them through the telephone to send a messenger to him, or to any place for him, they executed the order making a charge for so doing to the person from whom they received the order. The object of the respondents\u2019 covenant seems to be to provide that if, after the first of October then next, when the respondents covenanted to cease carrying on the messenger boy, cab, city express and livery order business which they had previously carried on, they should receive any order to send to or for any person a messenger boy, cab, city express, cart, &c., &c., they would transmit the order to the appellants to be executed instead of executing it themselves as they had previously done. This seems to me to be the natural construction of the language used in the covenant. To be in a position enabling the respondents to \u201ctransmit\u201d an order to the appellants it must have been given to them and received by them. It is a strained and unnatural construction of the language used to say that an order given through the telephone and sent by one lessee of the respondents\u2019 telephone instruments to another is an order given to and received by the respondents. It is assumed by the appellants that while the respondents themselves carried on the business no lessee of any of their telephone instruments could have transmitted through his telephone a request to another lessee to send to the former a messenger, or a cab, city express, or the like, but there is no foundation for any such assumption. The respondents could not have deprived any lessee of the right to use his instrument for the purpose of transmitting to another lessee a request to execute any such order, nor could the respondents have deprived the party receiving such an order of his right to execute it. The appellants contention, however, is that it is now incumbent upon the respondents, by reason of their covenant, to intercept in their central office, as it is contended they can, an order not addressed to them\u2014but to intercept all orders passing along the wires from one lessee to another which asks for a messenger or a cab, city express or the like, and that unless the respondents so intercept such orders and send them to the appellants the covenant of the respondents is broken. Now in point of fact the respondents have no means whatever of knowing the nature of any communication passed along the telephone wires from one lessee of a telephone instrument to another until the communication has passed through and has already been received by the party to whom it is addressed, and then only by the adoption of a practice by no means commendable, and which, though it may be within their power, certainly constitutes no part of any duty the respondents are called upon to discharge, namely, of employing persons for the special purpose of spying and prying into every communication which passes along the wires from one lessee to another in order to discover whether any of such communications contains a request for a messenger, cab, city express or the like to be sent anywhere. Such an interpretation of the respondents\u2019 covenant would, moreover, involve a violation of every lease of an instrument which was in existence in September, 1882, when the agreement was entered into, and the substitution of new leases restraining the lessees from ever transmitting through their instruments an order for a messenger boy, cab, or city express or any livery order to any other lessee than to the appellants, and restraining any lessees other than the appellants receiving any such order from another lessee from executing it under penalties sufficient to protect the respondents from the breach of their covenant which, as is contended, would be involved in such transmission of such a message.\nIt is impossible, in my opinion, to conceive that the parties to the agreement ever contemplated that a request sent by one lessee of the respondents\u2019 telephone instrument to another for a messenger boy or a cab or city express to be sent anywhere could constitute a breach by the respondents of their covenant. What the parties did contemplate I have no doubt was, that the respondents should cease to carry on the messenger boy, cab and express order business which they had previously carried on, and that if they should be asked as they formerly had been by any of their lessees for a messenger boy they would transmit the order to the appellants to execute and would not execute it themselves, and as it is admitted that the respondents never have committed any breach of the covenant by neglecting to send to the appellants any such order addressed to and received by them, nor any breach unless it can be held that an order spoken into his telephone instrument by one lessee and so addressed and sent to another and not intercepted by the respondents, and diverted from its original destination and given instead to the appellants, should constitute a breach of their covenant; and as I am of opinion that the respondents\u2019 covenant is not open to any such construction the appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I cannot say that I have any doubt about this case. I entirely concur in the construction of the contract presented in the divisional court by the Chancellor and Mr. Justice Ferguson, and in the Court of Appeal by Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nThe messenger business, though it may require telephone communication to enable it, in these days of telephones, to be successfully carried on, is no more a branch of the business of a telephone company than any other enterprise in which the company may choose to engage, such for example as a grocery, as was suggested during the argument by one of my learned brothers. The contention of the appellants involves the assertion of the right of the company to refuse the use of its lines,\u2014those lines in respect of which a servitude is imposed on the public highways, street, bridges, watercourses and other such places[12]; for sending an order for a messenger, or for groceries, to any other shop but its own. It may be, though I doubt it, that if brought to the test of strict law the abstract right to establish such a monopoly could be maintained, but it would be a rash thing to make the experiment, and I have no idea that clause 16 of the contract with the appellants was framed with any such purpose or understanding. The language of the clause creates no difficulty in my mind. The agreement on the part of the Bell Company is contained in paragraphs numbered from 1 to 16, and one numbered 2a. Number one is the general assignment of the business and good-will, and the others are mainly oc- cupied with details of what is in a general way covered by number one. No details specially referable to the good-will of the business are given till we come to the last paragraph. It was to be expected that orders would, for a while at all events, continue to come to the Bell Company for cabs or messengers. What was to be done with them? Those are the orders which I understand paragraph 16 to refer to. It is more general than paragraph 8 which refers to orders of the same kind, number 16 not being confined to orders coming over the wires. As well expressed by the learned chancellor \u201cboth stipulations are in pari materi\u00e2, and are such as are usual in the case of a sale of a business and good-will to prevent the seller from taking an active part, whether directly or indirectly, in derogating from the value of the property and good-will sold and transferred.\u201d\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: McMichael, Mills & McMichael.\nSolicitors for respondents: Kingstone, Wood & Symons.\n[1] 17 Ont.

No trust was declared in the event of P. surviving and failing to perform the conditions or of failure in the lifetime of both parties. In an action by B. to have this deed set aside the trial judge held that B. when he executed it was ignorant of its nature and effect and set it aside on that ground. The full court, on appeal, dissented from this finding of fact, and varied the judgment by directing that the trustees should reconvey the property to B. on the ground that P. had failed to perform the conditions he had agreed to by the deed. On appeal to the Supreme Court :\u2014\nHeld, affirming the decision of the court below, that the conditions to be performed by P. were conditions precedent to his right to a conveyance of the property ; that by failure to perform them the trust in his favour lapsed, and B., the grantor, being the only person to be benefited by the trust, could revoke it at any time and demand a reconveyance of the property.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment of the trial judge in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of this case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note, and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Strong.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for the appellant cited Hall v. Hall[1] ; Phillips v. Mullings[2] ; Campbell v. Edwards[3] ; Henry v. Tupper[4] ; Bryant v. Erskine[5].\nGemmill for respondent referred to Roberts v. Brett[6] ; Goodall v. Elmsley[7] ; Coatsworth v. City of Toronto[8].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The learned trial judge thought :\nThe fact that the covenants or the deed have not been performed is not necessary for the decision of this case. The main question is : Did the plaintiff understand what he was doing when he signed the deed ? Taking into consideration his great age and the non-intervention of a professional or an interested person on his behalf, the deed was undoubtedly executed under the influence of his spiritual adviser, Father Jonckau and without independent advice. I exonerate Father Jonckau from being influenced by any improper motives but he was guided apparently in the matter by the defendant Johnson. In deeds of this character the absence of a power of revocation and the improvidence of the transaction, independent of the question whether or not the grantor understood what he was about, will in certain cases induce the court to set aside a deed, but on the evidence of the case before me and from the surrounding circumstances I think this deed cannot stand. The plaintiff did not understand the settlement he was making and in coming to this conclusion I am supported by the authorities of Dutton v. Thompson[9] and Griffiths v. Robins[10] and Wollaston v. Tribe[11].\nWith regard to the costs, as Johnson admitted he had never acted in the trusts of this settlement, that he had refused to furnish a copy of the deed to his cestui que trust, although payment was offered for such copy, from thus refusing plaintiff the information he was entitled to receive and from the fact of his being the author of the impeached deed he did not think him entitled to costs and made no order in respect thereof ; he directed Poirier to pay plaintiff's costs and directed an account of the live stock (not being the produce of the stock on the farm when taken over by Poirier) sold by Poirier to be taken and the value paid by Poirier to plaintiff ; deeds in defendant's possession to be deposited in court and proper conveyances made at the cost of the trust estate by Johnson to plaintiff, injunction to be made perpetual and Poirier to give up possession forthwith of plaintiff's property.\nOn appeal to the full court this decree was varied, the court refusing to rectify or to set aside the deed and declare it void, but affirmed the decision on the ground that the conditions to be performed by Poirier had not been carried out.\nFrom the purport and intention of this deed, and the object it was intended to compass, I think the performance of the covenants must be considered in the nature of conditions precedent, and it having been clearly established as a question of fact to the satisfaction of the court of first instance that these stipulations had been completely set at nought by Poirier, the court of appeal agreeing in this conclusion, I do not see how justice can be done otherwise than by confirming the judgment of the court of appeal and dismissing this appeal.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia pronounced in an action in which the respondent was plaintiff and the appellant and one Edward Mainwaring Johnson were defendants. By the statement of claim the respondent impeached and sought to have set aside or rectified the deed hereafter mentioned. The learned Chief Justice of British Columbia prefaces his judgment with a concise statement which gives the terms and effect of the deed and embodies the material facts of the case. It is as follows :\nIn and previous to the year 1882 the plaintiff, a French-Canadian farmer, was entitled for his own sole benefit to sections 45 and 46 in Sooke district, and a cottage and some live and dead stock thereon. The plaintiff being of very advanced years, as was also his wife, and the defendant Poirier, also a French-Canadian, being a neighbour and ostensibly at least a farmer, and a much younger man, it appears to have been suggested that Brule should make over all his property both land and chattels to Poirier, in consideration of his supporting and providing for the plaintiff and his wife during their lives, at the termination of which Poirier was to hold the same for his own benefit. After a good deal of preliminary negotiation, the precise nature of which was much disputed but which in our opinion it is neither possible nor necessary for us now to decide, a deed was executed dated 12th of September, 1883, and made between Brul\u00e9 of the first part (therein called the grantor) the defendant Poirier (called the grantee) of the second part, and Father Jonckau, O. M. I. (deceased September 7th, 1888, before the institution of this suit June 22nd, 1889) and the defendant E. M. Johnson (called the trustees) of the third part. This deed was duly registered in the Land Registry Office. It recites the general intention and conveys the land to the trustees as joint tenants in fee on the trusts thereinafter mentioned. It also conveys to them the chattels mentioned in the schedule to be applied on the same trusts as nearly as may be as the land. The trusts declared are if Brul\u00e9 survive Poirier in trust to reconvey to Brul\u00e9. If Poirier survive Brul\u00e9 and shall during the lifetime of the latter and his wife have performed and fulfilled the stipulations in the deed separately enumerated and intended for the support or for the advantage and security of the grantor then the trustees after the death of Brul\u00e9 and his wife are to convey to Poirier for his own benefit, as well the lands in question as also the live and dead stock enumerated in the schedule. But no trust is declared in the contingency of Poirier surviving Brul\u00e9 and having neglected to perform the stipulations set out in the deed. Nor is there any provision for terminating the arrangement during the lifetime of both parties in case of Poirier's continued neglect.\nThe respondent's statement of claim distinctly alleges that the appellant had failed to perform the covenants of the deed which were expressly made conditions precedent to the trust which was limited in his favour in case of his survival of the respondent.\nThe statement of defence on the other hand alleges performance by the appellant of those conditions.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Drake without a jury, and that learned judge pronounced a judgment in favour of the respondent, ordering that the deed should be set aside upon the ground that the respondent had not understood the nature of the settlement he was making.\nAgainst this judgment the present appellant appealed to the full court, whereupon the order now under appeal was made varying the original judgment by discharging so much of it as set aside the deed and substituting therefor a direction that the appellant should forthwith reconvey the lands and reassign the chattel property to the respondent.\nMr. Justice Drake at the trial found that the covenants entered into by the appellant, and which as I have said were conditions precedent to any trust arising in his favour on the death of the respondent, had not been performed. In his written judgment he says :\nThe evidence shows that after the first year but a small portion of the obligations of the defendant Poirier have been performed, and he has dealt with the live stock as his own which under the deed did certainly not belong to him, and were not to become his property until after the death of the grantor.\nAnd in his judgment on the appeal the learned chief justice says :\nThe judge below has found, and we agree with him, that those stipulations have been completely set at nought by Poirier.\nAnd Mr. Justice McCreight also says :\nI think there is no case shown for rectification or rescission, but I think there is an equity open to the plaintiff by which the decision of my brother Drake may be supported. His judgment states that the covenants of the deed have not been performed by the defendant, and the evidence decidedly points in that direction.\nWe must, therefore, in view of these concurrent judgments in both the courts below, take it to be established as a fact that Poirier had failed to perform the obligations which by the deed he had undertaken. According to the clear and distinct terms of the deed the contingent trust in his favour had therefore entirely failed, and he and the trustee consequently held the property of the respondent freed from any trusts except those in the respondent's own favour, the deed containing no ulterior trust and making no express provision for the disposition of the property in this event of the respondent's nonperformance of his covenants. But it is clear beyond doubt that when property is conveyed to a trustee upon trusts which fail the trustee does not himself acquire the beneficial interests but holds the property thenceforth as a trustee for the settlor in whose favour the law raises a resulting trust. It is equally clear that when property is in the hands of a trustee merely for the benefit of the settlor himself he can at any time revoke such trusts and call upon the trustee to reconvey to him.\nIn the present case both these elementary principles of courts of equity relating to trusts have been rightfully applied by the court below.\nBy reason of the appellant's failure and neglect to perform his covenants the contingent trust limited in his favour in the event of his surviving the respondent has failed and cannot possibly arise.\nThen the only remaining trusts are in favour of the respondent himself, and these he is at liberty to put an end to at his option and to call on the trustee to reconvey. I am therefore of opinion that the judgment appealed against was entirely right, and that the reasons assigned for their conclusion in the judgments of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice McCreight are in all respects a correct application of well-settled principles of equity to the facts established by the evidence.\nWhilst I say this I am far from differing with the view of Mr. Justice McCreight that the deed was not sustainable upon the ground he proceeded upon, with this exception, however, that I incline to agree with the full court in thinking that the lapse of time was sufficient to bar the respondent's right to a rescission. We need not, however, consider this. It is impossible that the judgment of the full court, proceeding as it does upon the clearest principles of the law of trust, can be in any way successfully impugned.\nLeave was given by the court to amend the statement of claim by claiming a reconveyance, and although this has not been formally done we may consider the case as if the record had been actually amended. I quite agree that it was a proper case in which to give leave to amend.\nIt is to be observed that the order in appeal does not affect that portion of the decree made by the court of first instance which directs an account to be taken of the live stock and personal estate sold or disposed of by Poirier. This direction therefore still stands. I think it was a proper direction.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant suggested that an account should be directed of what Poirier had expended in the performance of his covenants, and that this should be allowed to him. I cannot assent to such an account. To give such a direction would, it seems to me, be in effect to give damages to a man who has broken his covenants in respect of what he has done and expended towards a performance of them, in which performance, however, he has ultimately failed. An account directed for such a purpose would not, in my opinion, be justified by any principle of either law or equity. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, GWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred in the appeal being dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Theodore Davie.\nSolicitor for respondent: J.
