B\u00e9rard, [1924] S.C.R. 159\nDate: 1924-02-05\nO. Depelteau (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nDame M. E. H. Berard es-qual, and others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1923: November 19; 1924: February 5.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSubstitution\u2014Property owned by several institutes\u2014Undivided ownership Sale without consent of all\u2014Arts. 297, 944, 1487, 1488, 1517, 1535 C.C \u2014 Art. 1342 C.C.P.\nA testator divided an immovable owned by him into six distinct portions which he bequeathed to each of his six sons with substitution in favour of the eldest son of each and a further substitution to the eldest son of each of the latter. He provided that upon the death of any one of his sons without male children, the share of the one so dying should accrue to his surviving sons in equal shares. This accretion, so called, was not ordered to be by distinct portions.\nHeld that the five surviving sons took the share of the predeceased son jointly and in undivided ownership and consequently, even with judicial authorization under Art. 953 C.C., four of the sons, without the consent of the fifth, could not sell four divided fifths of the share of the predeceased son, such a sale being equivalent to a partition to which the fifth institute had not assented. Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Idington J. dissenting.\u2014Any irregularity in the proceedings authorizing the sale has been rectified by subsequent ratification.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 34 K.B. 515) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court (1) and maintaining the respondents' action.\nOne Langelier was owner of a farm having a frontage of six acres by thirty acres deep. By his will a substitution was created, the property being bequeathed to his six sons as institutes, to take effect after the death of the mother to whom was left the usufruct of the property. The will also provided that each of the six sons would be owner as institute separately of one-sixth of the farm in frontage and that, in case of death of one of them without male children, his lot would accrue by equal portions to the other institutes. The father and then the mother having died, the property was divided according to the will between the six sons of the deceased. Later on, one of the sons having died without male children, his lot became the property of the remaining five sons; and another son having also died but leaving a male child, the property was thus owned at the time of the sale to appellant by five institutes, to wit, four remaining sons and the minor child represented by his mother as tutrix. Four of the five institutes, including the minor, were duly authorized by the court under article 953a, C.C. to sell the four lots owned by them and the four-fifths of the other one, as the fifth institute did not consent to the sale; and the property was duly adjudicated to the appellant. It was then discovered that the proceedings were irregular as the tutrix had not been duly authorized to sell the property owned by the minor; but a resolution was passed by a family council representing the latter ratifying the sale and authorizing the tutrix to give title to the buyer. The appellant refused to pay the purchase price on the grounds that the proceedings authorizing the sale were void and that he had the right to delay payment as he could be disturbed by an action in revendication by the institute who had not assented to the sale (art. 1535 C.C). The trial judge and the Court of King's Bench held that the minor alone had the right to invoke the nullity of the sale and that the subsequent ratification was valid. Before this court, the appellant further alleged that the sale of the four-fifths of the lot above mentioned was null, on the ground that the lot was owned jointly (par indivis) by the five institutes and could only be sold with the consent of all.\nA. R\u00e9gnier, for the appellant.\nS. Poulin, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the reasons for allowing this appeal stated by my brother Mignault as the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin and himself.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons respectively assigned by Chief Justice Lafontaine and Mr. Justice Greenshields speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court of King's Bench, now appealed from. I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The transfer in this case virtually, if effective, produces a partition of part of the property sold. This result is accomplished without notice to the interested parties and as the whole proceeding must therefore as to that part be invalid on that ground alone the action should be dismissed. The only doubt I have is a doubt concerning the question of costs, but on the whole I think the costs should follow the event throughout.\nMignault J.\u2014Le jugement qui suit est celui du juge Anglin et le mien.\nLes intim\u00e9s r\u00e9clament de l'appelant la somme de $14,000, \u00e9tant le prix d'adjudication de deux immeubles substitu\u00e9s, savoir les num\u00e9ros 82 et 83 du cadastre de Saint-Jean, sauf une partie distraite de la vente, qu'il a achet\u00e9s d'eux \u00e0 une vente avec autorisation de justice, le 11 octobre 1920, avec de plus la somme de $700 pour int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis cette date jusqu'au jour de l'action. L'appelant se d\u00e9fend en all\u00e9guant que la vente est nulle parce que les formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par la loi n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, et il pr\u00e9tend de plus qu'il a juste sujet de craindre d'\u00eatre troubl\u00e9 par une action en revendication, et qu'il peut diff\u00e9rer le paiement du prix jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les vendeurs fassent cesser ce trouble ou lui fournissent caution (art. 1535 C.C.). A l'audition devant cette cour, l'appellant a fait valoir un autre moyen de nullit\u00e9 de la vente, savoir que cette vente aurait compris certains droits d'un des grev\u00e9s qui ne s'\u00e9tait pas joint \u00e0 la vente et qui partant n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 vendre, ces droits lui \u00e9tant d\u00e9volus indivis\u00e9ment avec les autres grev\u00e9s au d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants d'un des grev\u00e9s originaires.\nLes immeubles, nos 82 et 83, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9s par le testament de feu Charles Langelier, en date du 18 octobre, 1879, devant C. T. Charbonneau et son confr\u00e8re, notaires, cette substitution devant s'\u00e9tendre jusqu'aux arri\u00e8re-petits-enfants du testateur. C'est une terre de six arpents de front par trente arpents de profondeur. Le testateur laissa deux filles, dont il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de parler, et six fils: Charles, Joseph, Henri, Louis, F\u00e9lix et Arthur, auxquels il l\u00e9gua cette terre \u00e0 charge de substitution, \u00e0 l'extinction de l'usufruit laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme.\nLa substitution est cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans les termes suivants:\nA l'expiration de l'usufruit ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 mon \u00e9pouse, je donne et l\u00e8gue, sous la substitution ci-apr\u00e8s exprim\u00e9e, \u00e0 mes six fils ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s, l'immeuble en premier lieu au long ci-dessus d\u00e9crit; j'ordonne qu'ils en soient s\u00e9par\u00e9ment propri\u00e9taires pour un sixi\u00e8me du tout, chacun, l'a\u00een\u00e9 devant prendre son lot du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la dite terre sur toute sa longueur, viendront ensuite les lots de chaque autre enfant, par pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance d'\u00e2ge.\nCet immeuble ainsi divis\u00e9, mesdits fils en jouiront pendant leur vie, comme grev\u00e9s de substitution et devant respectivement transmettre leur portion respective du dit immeuble \u00e0 l'a\u00een\u00e9 de leurs enfants m\u00e2les vivants \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de leur d\u00e9c\u00e8s respectif; la dite substitution devant ainsi se continuer dans les m\u00eames conditions, au profit de l'a\u00een\u00e9 des enfants m\u00e2les de chacun des premiers appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente substitution, lesquels premiers appel\u00e9s deviendront \u00e0 leur tour grev\u00e9s de la dite substitution.\nEt dans le cas o\u00f9 l'un des dits grev\u00e9s de substitution d\u00e9c\u00e9derait sans enfants m\u00e2les, la part de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 lui ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9e accro\u00eetra \u00e0 ceux des autres grev\u00e9s alors vivants, pour \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e au m\u00eame titre de substitution, par portions \u00e9gales, aux appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente substitution, jusqu'au dernier degr\u00e9 d'icelle;\nCependant si aucun des seconds grev\u00e9s ayant recueilli en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente substitution, mourait sans enfants m\u00e2les, sa portion du dit immeuble retournerait \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re cadet, et en cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, sans enfants m\u00e2les, \u00e0 son autre fr\u00e8re, s'il en existe, et ainsi de suite pour ses autres fr\u00e8res, et en cons\u00e9quence l'accroissement ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9 serait exclu.\nMon intention est que cet immeuble soit ainsi recueilli, \u00e0 titre de substitution: 1\u00b0 par mes dits fils, comme institu\u00e9s dans les proportions et sous les conditions ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es; 2\u00b0 par l'a\u00een\u00e9 des enfants m\u00e2les de chacun d'eux dans le sens ci-dessus \u00e9tabli, et 3\u00b0 l'a\u00een\u00e9 des enfants m\u00e2les des premiers appel\u00e9s;\nJe veux aussi que les grev\u00e9s de la dite substitution soient conjointement tenus au paiement des taxes, r\u00e9parations, cotisations et rentes seigneuriales auxquelles le dit immeuble sera assujetti.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de cette disposition que chacun des six fils du testateur a recueilli de lui, \u00e0 charge de substitution, une portion distincte de terre, savoir une lisi\u00e8re d'un arpent de largeur et de trente arpents de profondeur. La clause d'accroissement ou, pour parler plus exactement, de transmission, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s d'un des premiers grev\u00e9s sans enfants m\u00e2les, ne comporte pas semblable division du lot transmis, lequel ne peut \u00eatre recueilli par les grev\u00e9s survivants que par indivis.\nF\u00e9lix Langelier, un des premiers grev\u00e9s, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es sans enfants et son lot a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis aux cinq autres, par indivis, en vertu de la clause cit\u00e9e plus haut. Henri Langelier, un autre des fils du testateur, est \u00e9galement d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, mais subs\u00e9quemment au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de F\u00e9lix, laissant un fils, Alphonse Langelier, qui est encore mineur et qui est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par sa m\u00e8re et tutrice, Dame Marie \"Eva H\u00e9n\u00e9dine B\u00e9rard.\nIl y a donc cinq grev\u00e9s, y compris le mineur, Alphonse Langelier. Chacun d'eux a un lot entier et le cinqui\u00e8me indivis d'un autre lot. Mais les grev\u00e9s qui ont pr\u00e9tendu vendre leurs parts, en y comprenant le mineur Alphonse Langelier, ne sont que quatre des cinq grev\u00e9s originaires. L'un des fils du testateur, Joseph Langelier, n'a pas voulu vendre sa part, et c'est cette part qu'on a pr\u00e9tendu distraire de la vente qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite des lots 82 et 83.\nLes autres grev\u00e9s, au contraire, trouvant qu'il y avait avantage \u00e0 vendre leurs parts, en ont demand\u00e9 l'autorisation en invoquant les dispositions de l'article 953a du code civil, qui permet l'ali\u00e9nation des biens substitu\u00e9s \u00e0 certaines conditions quand c'est de l'avantage du grev\u00e9 et de l'appel\u00e9 que la vente ait lieu. Et \u00e0 cette fin ils ont obtenu l'autorisation que l'appelant dit leur avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement accord\u00e9e.\nSans relater au long les proc\u00e9dures qui ont conduit \u00e0 la vente, nous pouvons dire sommairement qu'on a commenc\u00e9 par faire nommer M. Georges Fortin, avocat de Saint-Jean, curateur \u00e0 la substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le testament de feu Charles Langelier, p\u00e8re. Apr\u00e8s cette nomination, le curateur et Louis Langelier, un des grev\u00e9s, nomm\u00e8rent chacun un expert pour visiter et \u00e9valuer les immeubles substitu\u00e9s, et ces experts \u00e9valu\u00e8rent en bloc la partie \u00e0 vendre \u00e0 la somme de $14,000. Il y eut alors conseil de famille pour aviser sur le n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la vente, et l'avis \u00e9tant favorable, le juge Monet de la cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Saint-Jean, homologua l'avis du conseil de famille et autorisa Georges Fortin, curateur, et Louis Langelier, Arthur Langelier, Charles Langelier et Dame Marie H\u00e9n\u00e9dine Eva B\u00e9rard, \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 Alphonse Langelier, grev\u00e9s, \u00e0 vendre; 1\u00b0 le lot n\u00b0 82, ayant une largeur en front de 3 arpents et une profondeur de 30 arpents,\n\u00e0 distraire cependant du dit lot une lisi\u00e8re de terrain de 36 pieds de largeur en front sur toute la profondeur du dit lot, cette dite lisi\u00e8re comprenant le quatri\u00e8me-cinqui\u00e8me de l'arpent du milieu, ou second arpent du dit lot n\u00b0 82, en allant du sud au nord, avec toutes les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites;\n2\u00b0 Le lot n\u00b0 83, comprenant 3 arpents de front sur 30 arpents de profondeur, \u00e0 distraire cependant du dit lot l'arpent du milieu ou deuxi\u00e8me arpent, avec toutes les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites.\nCe qu'on pr\u00e9tendait ainsi distraire des deux lots, c'est le lot originaire l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 Joseph Langelier, qui ne prenait pas part \u00e0 la vente, et de plus le cinqui\u00e8me du lot l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 F\u00e9lix Langelier, lequel cinqui\u00e8me, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de F\u00e9lix sans enfants, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis \u00e0 Joseph Langelier. Nous nous contentons de faire cette constatation pour le moment, sauf \u00e0 y revenir plus tard.\nLa mise \u00e0 prix fut fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $14,000, le montant de l'estimation des experts, et le cahier des charges exigea de plus le paiement par l'adjudicataire de $1,000 en sus du prix d'adjudication pour les frais.\nLa vente fut faite le 11 octobre 1920, et l'appelant se porta adjudicataire au prix de $14,000. Il paya imm\u00e9diatement $1,000 pour les frais de la vente.\nApr\u00e8s cette adjudication on d\u00e9couvrit une grave irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans cette proc\u00e9dure. Dame B\u00e9rard, la tutrice du mineur Alphonse Langelier, n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re voulue par la loi \u00e0 vendre la part dont son pupille \u00e9tait grev\u00e9, et ce mineur, qui \u00e9tait grev\u00e9, n'\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le curateur. On voulut rectifier cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s coup, et, le 4 novembre, le notaire Brosseau re\u00e7ut \u00e0 M\u00e9gantic, district de St-Fran\u00e7ois, o\u00f9 Dame B\u00e9rard et son pupille \u00e9taient domicili\u00e9s, l'avis d'un conseil de famille convoqu\u00e9 devant lui, lequel conseil de famille d\u00e9clara qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis.\nqu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de vendre les immeubles ci-dessus et de ratifier toutes les proc\u00e9dures qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites pour arriver \u00e0 la vente et ali\u00e9nation finale des dits immeubles, qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du mineur Alphonse Langelier que telle ratification ait lieu, et que la tutrice du dit Alphonse Langelier soit autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure la vente et \u00e0 passer titre.\nCet avis de parents mentionne que le rapport des experts de l'\u00e9valuation en bloc avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lu au conseil de famille, mais aucune \u00e9valuation s\u00e9par\u00e9e de la part dont le mineur \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 ne fut faite. L'avis de parents fut homologu\u00e9 par le protonotaire \u00e0 Sherbrooke le 6 novembre.\nA la suite de toutes ces proc\u00e9dures, Dame B\u00e9rard, la tutrice d'Alphonse Langelier, ainsi que Charles Langelier et Louis Langelier, grev\u00e9s, et Georges Fortin, le curateur, prirent cette action pour forcer l'appelant \u00e0 payer le prix d'adjudication. Arthur Langelier, l'un des grev\u00e9s autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 vendre, est mort apr\u00e8s la vente, mais avant l'action, et Louis Langelier pr\u00e9tend le repr\u00e9senter comme son l\u00e9gataire universel. Arthur Langelier \u00e9tait du reste li\u00e9 par la vente faite, si elle \u00e9tait valide.\nEtant d'avis que l'adjudication faite \u00e0 l'appelant est nulle pour les raisons qui vont \u00eatre expos\u00e9es, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que nous nous prononcions sur la question de savoir si la d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration du conseil de famille de M\u00e9gantic, homologu\u00e9e par le protonotaire \u00e0 Sherbrooke, peut valoir comme ratification de l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de la vente de la part du mineur Alphonse Langelier, cette vente n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement autoris\u00e9e au d\u00e9sir de l'article 297 C.C., et aucune \u00e9valuation s\u00e9par\u00e9e de la part du mineur n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 1342 C.P.C. Nous n'exprimons donc aucune opinion sur cette question importante.\nMais voici ce qui nous para\u00eet entra\u00eener la nullit\u00e9 de la vente.\nNous avons rapport\u00e9 plus haut les termes par lesquels on distrait de la vente ce qu'on a suppos\u00e9 \u00eatre la part de Joseph Langelier. C'est l'arpent du milieu ou deuxi\u00e8me arpent du lot n\u00b0 83, soit le lot originaire l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 Joseph Langelier, et de plus une lisi\u00e8re de terrain de 36 pieds de largeur en front sur toute la profondeur du lot n\u00b0 82,\ncomprenant le quatri\u00e8me-cinqui\u00e8me de l'arpent du milieu ou second arpent du dit lot n\u00b0 82, en allant du sud au nord.\nC'est cette derni\u00e8re lisi\u00e8re de terrain qu'on suppose avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise \u00e0 Joseph Langelier, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de F\u00e9lix Langelier sans enfants, comme son cinqui\u00e8me du lot originaire de ce dernier. En d'autres termes, on a imagin\u00e9 de diviser le lot originaire de F\u00e9lix Langelier, ou l'arpent du milieu du lot n\u00b0 82, en cinq lisi\u00e8res de 36 pieds de largeur chacune, et le quatri\u00e8me-cinqui\u00e8me, ou la quatri\u00e8me lisi\u00e8re, en allant du sud au nord, on l'a pris comme \u00e9tant la part de Joseph Langelier, et on l'a distrait de la vente. On a donc vendu \u00e0 l'appelant les lisi\u00e8res 1, 2, 3 et 5 de cet arpent du milieu, les traitant comme appartenant divis\u00e9ment aux vendeurs.\nOr le lot originaire de F\u00e9lix Langelier est accru aux cinq autres grev\u00e9s par indivis et non pas divis\u00e9ment. Le testateur, il est vrai, avait divis\u00e9 sa terre, nos 82 et 83, qui avait six arpents de largeur et 30 arpents de profondeur, en six parties distinctes, en attribuant \u00e0 chacun de ses fils un sixi\u00e8me du tout,\nl'a\u00een\u00e9 devant prendre son lot du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la dite terre sur toute sa longueur, viendront ensuite les lots de chaque autre enfant, par pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance d'\u00e2ge.\nMais il n'avait pas ordonn\u00e9 telle division s\u00e9par\u00e9e et distincte dans le cas o\u00f9 l'un de ses fils d\u00e9c\u00e9derait sans enfants m\u00e2les, auquel cas il d\u00e9clarait que la part de la dite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 lui ci-dessus l\u00e9gu\u00e9e accro\u00eetra \u00e0 ceux des autres grev\u00e9s alors vivants, pour \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e au m\u00eame titre de substitution, par portions \u00e9gales, aux appel\u00e9s \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente substitution jusqu'au dernier degr\u00e9 d'icelle.\nL'indication de portions \u00e9gales\u2014si elle peut s'appliquer \u00e0 l'accroissement (nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que ce terme n'est pas exact) ordonn\u00e9 en faveur des grev\u00e9s alors vivants\u2014ne comporte pas la cons\u00e9quence que ces portions seront s\u00e9par\u00e9es et distinctes. Cela veut dire que le lot sera transmis par parts \u00e9gales aux cinq grev\u00e9s survivants, c'est-\u00e0-dire que chacun de ceux-ci sera propri\u00e9taire grev\u00e9 de substitution d'un cinqui\u00e8me indivis de ce lot. En d'autres termes, les cinq autres grev\u00e9s ont recueilli le lot qui leur est accru au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de F\u00e9lix par indivis et non divis\u00e9ment.\nLa nature et les effets de l'indivision entre co-propri\u00e9taires, et le grev\u00e9 de substitution est un propri\u00e9taire (art. 944 C.C.), sont bien connus. Chaque co-propri\u00e9taire a une quote-part id\u00e9ale de la chose, et quant \u00e0 cette quote-part, il jouit des droits inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et peut ali\u00e9ner cette quote-part et ses cr\u00e9anciers peuvent la faire saisir, avant tout partage. Cependant les quote-parts id\u00e9ales des co-propri\u00e9taires ne constituent pas des corps certains et aucun des co-propri\u00e9taires ne peut, sans le concours des autres, exercer sur la totalit\u00e9 de la chose commune, ni m\u00eame sur la moindre partie physiquement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de cette chose, des actes mat\u00e9riels ou juridiques emportant exercice actuel et imm\u00e9diat du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (Voir Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d., tome 2, s. 221, et pp. 578 et suiv., dont est emprunt\u00e9 autant que possible le langage m\u00eame).\nOr les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9tendu vendre \u00e0 l'appelant des portions s\u00e9par\u00e9es et physiquement d\u00e9termin\u00e9es du deuxi\u00e8me arpent ou arpent du milieu du lot n\u00b0 82, dont ils \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires grev\u00e9s de substitution, par indivis seulement, avec leur co-propri\u00e9taire et co-grev\u00e9, Joseph Langelier. C'est une vente dont ce dernier peut ne tenir aucun compte, car c'est r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard la vente de la chose d'autrui, nulle aux termes de l'article 1487 C.C. Cette vente \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un partage entre Joseph Langelier et ses co-propri\u00e9taires, et il n'a pas accept\u00e9 ce partage et n'est pas li\u00e9 par la vente. Sur les lisi\u00e8res vendues, Joseph Langelier a autant de droits qu'avaient les autres grev\u00e9s, et ni lui, ni les autres, s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, ne pouvaient disposer, m\u00eame avec l'autorit\u00e9 de la justice, de la chose commune. C'est le d\u00e9faut capital de cette vente qui \u00e9tait impossible sans le concours de tous les propri\u00e9taires grev\u00e9s et qui n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e par le juge sans exiger le concours \u00e0 la vente de Joseph Langelier.\nDonc l'appellant n'a pas acquis \u00e0 cette vente la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des lisi\u00e8res 1, 2, 3 et 5 de l'arpent du milieu du lot n\u00b0 82, et il se trouve sans titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour pr\u00e8s du tiers du lot n\u00b0 82. L'appelant est certainement bien fond\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que cette partie, dont il n'a pas acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, est de telle cons\u00e9quence relativement au tout qu'il n'e\u00fbt pas achet\u00e9 sans elle, et qu'il peut faire rescinder la vente. On trouve ce principe dans l'art. 1517 C.C. qui envisage le cas de l'\u00e9viction.\nCe ne serait pas une r\u00e9ponse de dire que s'il y a plus tard partage entre les grev\u00e9s, cette partie non vendue pourrait \u00eatre mise dans le lot des vendeurs et ainsi passer \u00e0 l'appelant (art. 1488 C.C). On ignore quel pourrait \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat d'un partage qui n'est pas encore fait, et ce sont des chances que l'appelant n'est pas oblig\u00e9 d'assumer. Ce n'est pas non plus une r\u00e9ponse que d'objecter que l'appelant a pour le moins acquis les droits indivis de ses vendeurs, car ce n'est pas cela qu'il a entendu acheter et qu'on a pr\u00e9tendu lui vendre. Et il y a en sus la circonstance d\u00e9cisive que l'autorisation judiciaire de vendre ne couvre aucune des lisi\u00e8res du deuxi\u00e8me arpent du lot n\u00b0 82 car Joseph Langelier, qui \u00e9tait co-propri\u00e9taire par indivis avec les quatre autres grev\u00e9s, n'a pas demand\u00e9 et obtenu cette autorisation, et sans son concours la vente de ces lisi\u00e8res \u00e9tait impossible.\nBien qu'apparemment l'appelant ne se soit pas rendu compte de l'importance du moyen de nullit\u00e9 que nous venons de discuter avant l'audition devant cette cour, on ne peut dire qu'il l'avait enti\u00e8rement n\u00e9glig\u00e9 devant les autres cours. Car sa d\u00e9fense, au paragraphe 22, disait qu'il avait juste sujet de crainte d'\u00eatre troubl\u00e9 par une action en revendication\nd'autant plus qu'un des grev\u00e9s, soit Joseph Langelier, n'a pas voulu consentir \u00e0 la dite vente en question.\nC'est en effet le manque de concours de Joseph Langelier qui rendait la vente des lisi\u00e8res 1, 2, 3 et 5 de l'arpent du milieu du lot n\u00b0 82 impossible, et l'appelant s'en \u00e9tait certainement plaint dans sa d\u00e9fense. Du reste, on peut dire que le vice du titre qu'on veut imposer \u00e0 l'appelant appert par les proc\u00e9dures m\u00eames que les intim\u00e9s ont adopt\u00e9es pour faire cette vente.\nNous en arrivons donc \u00e0 la conclusion que la vente sur laquelle les intim\u00e9s se basent est nulle, et que l'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 et leur action renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours contre eux. Nous r\u00e9servons \u00e0 l'appelant le droit de r\u00e9clamer le remboursement du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de $1,000 qu'il a fait lors de l'adjudication, ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans cause.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Andr\u00e9 R\u00e9gnier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Stanislas Poulin.\n[1] [1922] Q.R. 34 K.B. 515.\n",

(1909) Sections 7321 et seq.\u2014Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. (1906) c. 113, sections 915 to 921\u2014B.N.A. Act, (1867) sections 91, 92\u2014 (Q) 9 Edw. VII, c. 66, s. 1\u2014Arts. 1056, 2390 C.C.\nSections 7321 and 7323 of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Act, in so far as they affect \"workmen, apprentices and employees engaged * * * in any transportation business * * * by water\" are intra vires the provincial legislatures, as they are not in their operation necessarily in conflict with the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act, contained in sections 915 to 921 nor, per Duff J., in their application to the circumstances of this case, with Article 2390 C.C. Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. ([1920] A.C. 184) and McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. ([1923] A.C. 126) discussed.\nThe husband, de facto but not judicially separated from bed and board, has the right to claim indemnity as \"surviving consort\" under the provisions of clause A of section 7323 of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Act.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 35 K.B. 247) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nPaul St. Germain K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The substantial question in this case is whether the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of the province of Quebec, so far as it relates to the liability of shipowners to their workmen employed in transportation by water, is ultra vires of the provincial legislature as being in conflict with the Canada \"Shipping Act\" and its provisions relating to such subject matter.\nThe contention of the appellant company is that the \"British North America Act, 1867,\" had in its 91st section exclusively assigned the subject matter of \"Shipping and Navigation\" to the Parliament of Canada and that such Parliament had dealt fully in the Canada \"Shipping Act\" (R.S.C. c. 113) with the whole subject of the liability of ship-owners to their seamen (sections 916-921) and that the field being so covered the provincial legislation in question is ultra vires.\nThe trial judge rejected the contention of the defendant company and maintained the action of the plaintiff respondent for $1,820, which judgment was confirmed unanimously upon appeal to the Court of King's Bench.\nAt the conclusion of the argument at bar I felt grave doubts whether the company's contention was not well founded. Since then I have given the whole question much consideration and have had the advantage of reading the several judgments of my colleagues and of consulting personally with them. They are unanimously in favour of dismissing the appeal relying substantially on the ground that the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" in question does not deal with the same subject matter as has been dealt with by the Canada \"Shipping Act,\" and upon the two cases decided by the Judicial Committee: Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[2]; McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[3]. While my doubts on the question have not been entirely removed, I do not feel that they are sufficiently strong to justify me in reversing the judgment of the two courts below and allowing the appeal.\nI will not, therefore, dissent from the judgment of my colleagues, dismissing this appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was the owner of a tug called Spray operating in the St. Lawrence river within the province of Quebec.\nThe late wife of the respondent was engaged as cook upon said tug when it collided with a steamer known as Cairndhu about three miles above Sorel on said river and, as a result of such accident, she and five other persons of the crew were drowned.\nThe respondent, her surviving husband, brought this action claiming, under the provisions of the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" the damages allowed, under said Act and amendments thereto, to him under such circumstances.\nThat action was tried before Mr. Justice Loranger of the Superior Court of said province, who maintained same and awarded respondent the sum of $1,820.\nOn appeal therefrom to the appeal side of the Court of King's Bench, that court unanimously maintained the said judgment and dismissed said appeal with costs.\nFrom that judgment this appeal is taken upon two grounds, first, that the said Act is ultra vires the legislature of the province of Quebec, so far as relevant, and secondly, that in any event the respondent and his late wife were de facto separate from bed and board.\nThere is no pretence that such separation had ever been judicially declared and but flimsy evidence of its existence de facto. Unless we are to hold that husband and wife by working in different places, without more, are so separate as to deprive the husband surviving of his otherwise legal rights as such under the provisions of said Act, there seems to me nothing in law to support such pretensions. I cannot maintain said appeal on any such ground.\nThe really important question raised herein is whether or not in view of the \"British North America Act\" assigning to the Parliament of the Dominion, by virtue of section 91 of said Act, and the enumerated items thereof 10. \"Navigation and Shipping\" and 29\nsuch classes of subjects as are expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned to the legislatures of the provinces.\nOf those so excepted in such enumeration there are the following:\u2014\n92. Item 10. (a) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province:\n(b) Lines of steamships between the province and any British or foreign country;\n(c) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province, are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of two or more of the provinces.\nI cannot put the latter on any higher basis than those falling under said item 10 of section 91, or vice versa.\nI think they all stand on the same footing and hence the \"Canada Shipping Act\" invoked herein by the appellant, is not to be read as having any higher class than the incorporation, and all implied therein, for example, of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nNow I find that this court, by its decision in the case of The Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Jackson[4], expressly decided in a case arising under the Ontario \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" wherein the same objection of ultra vires was taken as herein, that such legislation was not ultra vires the legislature of the province of Ontario. The Ontario \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of that day was not our present Ontario Act, but one that in its general features was like unto the present Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" though the latter is said to have been taken from a French Act.\nI cannot distinguish that case from this in principle.\nThe power to enact the \"Canada Shipping Act\" rests virtually upon the same basis as to deal with the subject matter whereupon the Canada Southern Railway Act rested all its powers.\nI hold we are bound in principle to follow this decision though I am bound to say that I have been unable to find any report of the Rowland Case, upon which the learned judge (Taschereau J.) therein relied; unless perhaps it was the same case as referred to in 13 Ont. P.R. 93, which in a later stage as that report indicates highly probable, the question came before this court by way of seeking an appeal here.\nSir Elzear Taschereau, the late Chief Justice of this court, was at that date a puisne judge of this court.\nI may also say that this decision in the Jackson Case[5], though traced by me from another case cited by counsel for appellant, and relied upon by me in the case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The King[6] seems to have escaped the notice of counsel on each side herein.\nI feel so clearly bound thereby that I need not follow the matter further, but may be permitted to rely also upon the decision of the court above in the case of The Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[7], arising out of the application of the provisions of the British Columbia \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nI admit that it is by no means decisive of this case but am reminded thereby of what we have been so often reminded especially in the interpretation and construction of the \"British North America Act,\" that you cannot, under that, do that indirectly which you cannot do directly.\nI submit that bearing that principle in mind this decision furnishes a strong argument in favour of maintaining that the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" is intra vires when the \"Canada Shipping Act\" is closely analyzed, and we are confronted with the proposition of the court below, that it is with only a matter of tort and not of contract that it deals, and thus impliedly leaves all involved in the contractual relations of parties to be dealt with by the local legislature under either item 13 or 16 of the enumerated powers conferred by section 92 of the B.N.A. Act. The case of McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[8], in which the judgment of the Judicial Committee was written by my brother Duff, also seems to me incidentally very helpful in supporting this respondent by following same line of thought. I am by no means presenting this case as a final disposition on such a subject, but as tending thereto and well worthy of consideration.\nI repeat that I feel bound by the decision of this court, above cited, and which I cannot in principle distinguish from what is involved herein, and that these several other considerations just now mentioned tend to support said decision. The decision of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[9] should also be kept in view.\nI must therefore conclude that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014By the decisions of the Lords of the Judicial Committee in Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry.[10], and in McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[11], the proposition was settled beyond controversy that notwithstanding the terms of section 91 of the \"British North America Act,\" by which exclusive legislative authority is reposed in the Dominion in respect of navigation and shipping and in respect of Dominion railways, the province has jurisdiction to provide for the payment of compensation to workmen injured by industrial accidents and to require railway companies and shipping companies to contribute to a fund provided for the purpose of furnishing the means of paying such compensation; and that such legislation may have full operation and impose binding obligations upon such companies so long as the Dominion does not in exercise of the authority mentioned enact legislation which conflicts with and overrides that of the province.\nI think there is no sound distinction relevant to the point immediately under consideration to be drawn between the constitutional authority of a province as respects such legislation as that of Manitoba and British Columbia (considered in the decisions mentioned) and the enactment brought into force by the statute 9 Edw. VII, c. 66, sec. 1, passed by the legislature of Quebec. In substance this enactment provides that a duty shall rest upon the employer\u2014a duty attached by law to the relation between himself and his employees as a statutory term of the contract of employment, as it was put by Lord Haldane in the Case of the Princess Sophia (1)\u2014entitling the injured employee or his representatives to compensation for injuries suffered by the employee in accidents happening by reason of or in the course of his work, where the accident is not brought about intentionally by the person injured. This obligation of the employer is qualified by a provision enabling the court to reduce the compensation where the accident is due to the \"inexcusable fault\" of the workman or to increase it where it is due to the \"inexcusable fault\" of the employer; but save in the case of \"inexcusable fault\" on the one side or the other, and in the case just mentioned of intentional misconduct by the employee, the Act requires the employer to insure his workmen against the consequences of industrial accidents by requiring him to pay compensation according to a definite scale fixed by the statute. Under the scheme of the British Columbia and Manitoba Acts, compensation is not, as a rule, paid by the employer directly, but out of a fund which is created by compulsory contributions levied against employers in accordance with certain principles laid down in the statutes. In neither case is the compensation paid to the employee a payment in the nature of damages as for a tort. The employee is entitled to receive it in the absence of any fault on part of the employer or his agents, and the amount recoverable is not determined by an estimate of the pecuniary loss suffered by the individual in the circumstances of the case, but according to a scale fixed by the statute. Prima facie, therefore, the provision of article 7321 of the Quebec statutes, conferring the right of compensation upon workmen engaged in any transportation business by land or by water is operative as a valid legislative enactment within the authority of the Quebec legislature.\nThe important question remains: Is there Dominion legislation in force applicable to the case presented by the respondent overriding this enactment and excluding his right of recovery? Secs. 915-917 inclusive of the Canada \"Shipping Act\" appear to apply only to damages arising through non-observance of the regulations in force under part 14 of the Act, and so far as appears from this record, have no application to the circumstances out of which this litigation arose. I postpone for the moment the consideration of section 921. At the time of Confederation there was in force in the province of Quebec article 2390 of the Civil Code, which was in the following words:\nThe owners are civilly responsible for the acts of the master in all matters which concern the ship and voyage and for damages caused by his fault or the fault of the crew. They are responsible in like manner for the acts and faults of any person lawfully substituted to the master.\nThe question whether after the passing of the \"British North America Act\" it was competent to the province of Quebec to amend this article by substituting therefor, in the case of injuries to employees, a right of compensation such as that given by the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of 1909 in lieu of all right of recovery of damages for fault except in the case of \"inexcusable fault,\" is one which I do not think it is necessary to pass upon for the purposes of this appeal, and for this reason; Art. 2390 C.C., for reasons similar to those given in McCoil's Case[12], conferred no right of action in respect of fault causing the death of the victim. In such a case resort must be had to article 1056 C.C. Now Article 1056 C.C. is an article strictly dealing, not with the subject of shipping or navigation, but with civil rights, and one which it is competent to the province of Quebec to amend without restriction. That article is unquestionably affected by the provisions of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" and ceases to have any operation in cases where death has arisen in circumstances giving a right to compensation under that Act. The case of the plaintiff is therefore not a case in respect of which Article 2390 C.C. could be invoked. The province was, I think, in the circumstances free to legislate with regard to such cases. Neither the province nor the Dominion was represented on the argument, and notwithstanding the ability with which the subject was discussed, I prefer to put my opinion on this branch of the appeal on this narrow ground, without passing upon or intimating any opinion upon the broader question. I now come to sec. 921 of the Canada \"Shipping Act.\" The answer to the contention based upon that section is succinctly and sufficiently stated, I think, in the judgments of Tellier J. and Hall J. If the appellants' premises be correct and that section applies and overrides the provisions of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" in so far as it is inconsistent with those provisions, then it is to be observed that the section does not deal with the subject of the conditions of liability, but only with the quantum of \"damages\" recoverable where the conditions of liability exist. It was open to the appellants in answer to the action to show that the sum prima facie recoverable under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" could not consistently with the provisions of sec. 921 be awarded to the plaintiff. No attempt was made to show this, and I agree with the Court of King's Bench that there is no material before us upon which it can be affirmed that the plaintiff's right of recovery is affected by that section.\nI express no opinion upon the question whether or not the decision in the case of the Princess Sophia (Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[13]), that the analogous provisions of the \"Merchant Shipping Act\" of 1894 had no application to a liability such as that imposed upon employers by the British Columbia statute to contribute to a fund to be administered by a Workmen's Compensation Board, for indemnifying workmen in respect of injuries in industrial accidents governs the question of the application of this section to an employer's obligation under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of Quebec. The judgment in the case of the Princess Sophia13 was not addressed to any such question, although some observations made in the course of the judgment may fairly be said to have not a little relevancy to it. I desire to intimate no opinion in either sense upon the point.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The applicability of the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" to\nworkmen, apprentices and employees engaged * * * in any transportation business * * * by water\n(unless where the navigation of the vessel is by means of sails, 8 Geo. V, c. 71, s. 1) is clear upon the face of the statute. That persons so engaged may be given the benefit of such provincial legislation is conclusively established by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[14]. That the plaintiff, as the consort of a deceased employee of the defendant company who lost her life in the sinking of their tug-boat Spray, on which she worked, is a person entitled to compensation under the combined operation of Arts. 7321 and 7323 R.S.Q., is therefore apparent, subject to two contentions pressed by the defendant\u2014\n(a) That the plaintiff was \"separated from bed and board\" within the meaning of clause (a) of Art. 7323; and\n(b) That Arts. 7321 and 7323, in so far as they affect workmen or employees engaged on a vessel to which the provisions of the Canada \"Shipping Act\" (R.S.C. [1906], c. 113) apply, as they did to the Spray, are ultra vires of the Quebec legislature.\nI agree with the learned judges of the provincial courts that the exception made by Art. 7323 (a) and relied on by the appellants applies only to a consort judicially separated. The plaintiff was not so separated from his wife.\nIn determining the nature of the right to compensation conferred by the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" I cannot think it material that that statute (in this respect unlike the British Columbia \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" dealt with in Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.14, and the Manitoba \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" considered in McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[15], does not provide for the creation of a fund under the control of a Board appointed by the Government out of which claims for compensation shall be paid, but imposes direct liability for such claims upon employers. The right to the compensation is none the less on that account\nthe result of a statutory condition of the contract of employment with a workman;\nit arises in both cases alike\nnot out of tort but out of the workmen's statutory contract\nand is\na civil right within the province to compensation in the nature of \"insurance against fortuitous accident.\" The competency of the Quebec legislature \"to pass laws regulating the civil duties\" of a company such as the defendant,\nwhich carried on business within the province and in the course of that business was engaging workmen whose civil rights under their contracts of employment had been placed by the Act of 1867 (the B.N.A. Act) within the jurisdiction of the province\ncannot be controverted. These matters are concluded by the decision in Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[16], at pp. 191-2.\nThe decision in McColl's Case[17] also serves to make it clear that, at all events in cases of claims for damages resulting from personal injuries causing death, liability independently of the operation of the provincial law is not created by sec. 917 of the \"Canada Shipping Act.\"\nThat it was competent for the Quebec legislature to enact, as it has done by Art. 7335, that in cases in which compensation under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" is recoverable (see Art. 7347a, 4 Geo. V, c. 57, s. 2) there shall be no other right of recovery under provincial law against the employer by the person injured or his representatives cannot, I think, be questioned.\nBut it is contended that there is a necessary conflict between the rights conferred by articles 7321 and 7323 of the Quebec statute and section 921 of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" limiting the liability of the ship-owner where, as in the case before us, he is not privy to the cause of the injury, loss or damage which forms the subject of claim, and that the Dominion legislation must prevail.\nThe view taken in the Court of King's Bench on this part of the case was that it could be disposed of on the ground that the evidence does not disclose any other claims against the defendant arising out of the sinking of its tugboat and that the recovery in this action is well within the limit prescribed by section 921. But, with respect, I do not think those facts afford an answer to the contention that articles 7321 and 7323 in so far as they give rights against owners of vessels subject to the \"Canada Shipping Act\" are ultra vires. To the extent that those rights might in any case conflict with the restriction imposed by section 921 of the Canada Shipping Act the validity of articles 7321 and 7323 probably could not be upheld. It would seem necessary, therefore, to face the issue whether there may be such conflict.\nSection 921 of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" deals with liability for damages\u2014\nthe owners * * shall not * * be answerable in damages * *.\nI find in that section itself and in its collocation abundant evidence that it deals only with \"damages\" in the sense of indemnity for actionable injury or loss caused by tort for which the vessel owner is legally responsible.\n\"Dammages \"\u2014Damma in the common law hath a speciall signification for the recompence that is given by the jury to the plaintife or defendant (qy. demandant?

Jacob: 4 Encyc. 93-109; Stroud's Judicial Dictionary (2nd ed.), p. 459.\nThe damages recoverable from the ship-owner dealt with by s. 921 are, as Lord Haldane (1) said, in speaking of s. 503 of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act (in part in pari materia)\nfor injury arising out of what has not the less to be proved as a tort because it may have happened, in the language of s. 503, without his actual fault or privity.\nIt is upon the recovery of such damages that section 921 imposes a restriction in favour of the vessel owner. That section does not bear upon compensation claims arising solely out of contractual rights and in no wise dependent upon the establishment of some breach of duty for the consequences of which it is sought to make the vessel owner liable. The application of article 2434 of the R.S.Q. is obviously subject to the same restriction.\nIn Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[18] the circumstance that an employer who has not fully contributed to the accident fund is required by the British Columbia \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" to make good the capitalized value of the compensation payable to an injured employee was regarded as not bringing that statute into conflict with the limitation upon liability provided for by section 503 of the \"Merchant Shipping Act,\" 1894. Nor did it involve a departure from the scheme of the Compensation Acts to provide \"insurance against fortuitous injury.\" The fact that under the Quebec statute, as under the English \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" compensation is required to be made directly by his employer to the injured workman instead of by a Government Board out of a fund to which the employed is obliged to contribute does not afford a ground for distinguishing it in these respects from the British Columbia statute dealt with by the Judicial Committee[19]. In my opinion there can be no conflict between section 921 and the \"Canada Shipping Act\" and the clauses of the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" with which we are dealing. The sole subject matter of section 921 is the ship-owner's liability for actionable loss or damage arising from tort or breach of navigation regulations for which he is legally responsible. If in the opinion of Parliament it should be desirable that the restriction of liability for which that section provides should apply to claims of employees for compensation under \"Workmen's Compensation Acts,\" its scope must be extended to embrace them. As it now stands such claims are outside the limitations which, in my opinion, cannot be enlarged by the courts upon such considerations as influenced the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in South Pacific Co. v. Jensen[20].\nOther objections to the validity of the provincial statute based on provisions of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" providing for the care of sick and disabled seamen (ss. 215 and 394) would seem to be met by the observation of Viscount Haldane (3), at page 193 that they do not cover the same field as the provisions of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant questions the validity, from the constitutional point of view, of the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" sections 7321 and following, R.S.Q., 1909, on which the respondent's action is based. Its contention is that, in so far as compensation is claimed under this statute for the death of the respondent's wife by drowning in the foundering of the appellant's tug Spray, the Act conflicts with the provisions of the \"Canada Shipping Act,\" R.S.C. [1906] c. 113, and is therefore ultra vires of the Quebec legislature.\nWithout entering into a detailed examination of the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" I may say, as to its general scope, that it grants compensation, not on the basis of a liability for fault or negligence, but of a legal obligation to compensate the injured workman or the dependents of the deceased workman, without it being necessary to prove any fault or negligence. Perhaps this legislation would be better described by saying that the right to compensation is made by the statute an incident to the contract of employment.\nThat such a general law is within the legislative jurisdiction of the province cannot be doubted, but it is urged that section 7321 R.S.Q., which inter alia applies to any transportation business by water, and that was the business carried on by the appellant, comes into conflict with \"The Canada Shipping Act,\" with the consequence that the latter statute must prevail.\nThe question thus raised is not entirely a new one, but came before the Judicial Committee, it is true with respect to a \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of a different character, in Workmen's Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co,[21].\nBoth the British Columbia Act in question in that case and the Quebec statute have this in common that compensation for injuries or death is granted without proof of negligence. The scheme really is equivalent in its results to a species of insurance in favour of workmen, and, to quote the language of their Lordships in the British Columbia Case (p. 191), the right conferred\nis the result of a statutory condition of the contract of employment made with a workman resident in the province, for his personal benefit and for that of members of his family dependent on him. This right arises, not out of tort, but out of the workman's statutory contract, and their Lordships think that it is a legitimate provincial object to secure that every workman resident within the province who so contracts should possess it as a benefit conferred on himself as a subject of the province.\nThe appellant singles out several provisions of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" which, it says, are inconsistent with the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Act\" and should prevail against it.\nThus we are referred to sections 215 and following which provide for medical attendance to seamen injured in the service of their ship, or who are taken ill; but, as observed by their Lordships in the case above referred to (p. 193), these sections do not purport to cover the same field as the provincial statute.\nSections 381 and following of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" as to the care of sick and distressed mariners were also mentioned, and the same observation disposes of any contention that these provisions conflict with the Quebec law. This is true also of sections 394 et seq., relied on by the appellant, and which are of the same character.\nBut the chief argument of the appellant is that there is a direct conflict between a limited liability under section 921 of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" and a liability such as is created by the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" of Quebec. The latter liability is by no means an unlimited one, but it is conceivable that where several persons on a ship perish in the same accident, the total sum payable by the ship-owner may be greater under the Quebec statute than under section 921 of the \"Canada Shipping Act.\"\nI think it should first be observed that section 921 does not create a liability, but leaves the existence of liability to be determined by the law of the province where the accident occurs. It is a defence to, or rather a limitation on, a liability assumed to exist by virtue of the provincial law. It is concerned with damages, while the Quebec statute fixes a scale of compensation irrespective of the real damages. Moreover, the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" deals with the relations inter se of employers and workmen, while section 921 limits the legal liability in favour of the owner of the ship, who is not necessarily the employer of the injured seaman.\nIt may be added that the field covered by section 921 is much wider than that of the Quebec statute since it would apply to a claim for damages suffered not only by a seaman, but by a passenger on a ship, as well as to a claim for damages to goods carried on the ship. Whether or not section 921 may be resorted to in the case of several claims arising out of the same accident under the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" and the appellant has not made out in evidence such a case here, there is no necessary conflict between the two statutes, and consequently I would not be justified in adopting the appellant's conclusion that the Quebec statute is ultra vires in so far as it applies to contracts of employment made by a person carrying on a transportation business by water. The same remark can be made in connection with section 918 of the \"Canada Shipping Act\" which applies the admiralty rule of division of damages where a collision occurs through the common fault of two colliding vessels.\nOn the whole case, I come to the conclusion that the appellant's attack on the Quebec statute fails.\nThere was another ground on which the appellant relied in the courts below, but which was not strongly pressed in this court, and that is that a state of separation existed between the plaintiff and his wife. The only separation, under the Quebec \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" which would serve as a bar to an action by the consort is a judicial separation from bed and board. Here the separation was purely voluntary and the plaintiff's right of action was not taken away.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robichon & M\u00e9thot.\n[1] Q.R. 35 K.B. 247.\n[2] [1920] A.C. 184.\n[3] [1923] A.C. 126.\n[4] [1890] 17 Can.

The plaintiffs appealed from the judgments dismissing their contestation.\nHeld that, \"the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal\" being under $2,000, these cases were not appealable under section 39 (a) of the Supreme Court Act as enacted by 10-11 Geo.

In each case the amount of the plaintiff's claim was much less than $2,000, the combined claims of both amounting to less than $1,000.\nThe respondents move to quash the appeals on the ground that the amount involved is less than $2,000 and the question thus raised is the point to be decided.\nThe relevant provision of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is sec. 39 (a) as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 32, s. 2. It will be observed that this provision contains nothing corresponding to s.s. 2 of sec. 46 of c. 139 R.S.C., that the \"amount in dispute\" shall be\nunderstood to be that demanded and not that recovered if they are different,\nsec. 46 having been expressly repealed by sec. 2 of the Act of 1920. Since the amendment the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal must exceed $2,000, unless special leave to appeal is obtained.\nThe decision of this question, we think is governed by the judgment of this court in Kinghorn vs. Larue[1].\nOn facts indistinguishable in any pertinent sense it was there held conformably to the principle of Macfarlane vs. Leclaire[2], that the \"amount in controversy\" was the amount claimed by the appellant plaintiff and not the amount or value of the claim of the respondent opposant.\nMr. Belcourt relies upon the subsequent decisions in Cot\u00e9 vs. Richardson[3], and Pulos vs. Lazanis[4]. The first of these decisions is expressly based upon the provision above mentioned of sec. 46 (2). That provision, it was considered, required the court to resort to the demand in the intervention to determine the \"amount in controversy\"; and the later decision proceeded upon the authority of the earlier.\nWe have come to the conclusion that the provision in question having been repealed the last-mentioned decisions are no longer applicable; that the decision in Kinghorn vs. Larue[5] ought to be followed in passing upon questions arising under sec. 39 (a); and accordingly that the \"amount in controversy\" on the present appeals is, within the meaning of that subsection, less than $2,000.\nThe appeals should be quashed with costs of the motions.\nMotions granted with costs.\n[1] [1893] 22 Can.

Whether correctly applied or not is chiefly a question of fact upon which two courts have passed adversely to the appellants.\nA book might be written on all that appellants' factum touches.\nI am not convinced that they are right in fact or in law, and cannot reverse the judgments of two courts supported by the reasons given, and now therefore hold that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014At the conclusion of his judgment in the Superior Court Mr. Justice Pouliot assigns as one of the reasons for dismissing this action that it was begun almost six years after the homologation of the report which it attacks. No allusion is made to this circumstance by Mr. Justice Letourneau, who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench, and I do not find any reference to it in the plea either of the defendant, the county of Drummond, or of the mise-en-cause, although acquiescence on other grounds, held to be ill-founded, is suggested by the defendant. The only prescription to which an action brought under Art. 50 C.C.P. is subject is the general prescription of thirty years declared by Art. 2242 C.C. To hold that the present action is barred merely because of the delay in bringing it would be to impose a prescription not found in the law. It may be that the remedy under Art. 50 C.C.P. is so special and extraordinary that the granting of it is a matter of sound judicial discretion and that in certain cases it should not be accorded where there has been great delay, though short of thirty years, in bringing action. Th\u00e9riault v. Notre Dame du Lac[1]. But where a defendant intends to rely upon dilatoriness in bringing the action as a defence it should at least be pleaded and the plaintiff given an opportunity to explain or excuse it. Where no such issue has been discussed at the trial effect should not, in my opinion, be given to a suggestion that the action, though not prescribed, was begun too late.\nHaving regard to the explicit reservation by Art. 433 (2) of the Municipal Code (new) of the right to invoke the jurisdiction conferred on the Superior Court by Art. 50 C.C.P., the plaintiff's failure to resort to the Circuit Court under Art. 430 M.C. (new) does not afford an answer to this action. The applicability of the recent decision of the Privy Council in Shannon Realties v. La Ville St. Michel[2] would seem to be thereby excluded.\nNot only are the applicants persons whose lands are drained by the two water-courses, the La Loutre and the G\u00e9n\u00e9reux or Grande D\u00e9charge, but, upon evidence that may possibly be regarded as somewhat conflicting, the Superior Court has found that they have aggravated the servitude imposed by law on the owners of land at a lower level along these two water-courses, in contravention of Art. 501 C.C., as the result of drainage work done on their lands in excess of what would fall within the description \"ordinary works of cultivation.\" That finding has been unanimously affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. The question is one of fact. After careful consideration of the evidence in the light of the elaborate factum of the appellants, I am satisfied that the concurrent finding of the two provincial courts is not so clearly wrong that we would be justified in reversing it here. On the contrary, there seems to be evidence, quite sufficient if believed, to support the finding of aggravation of servitude. It follows that the appellants, as parties interested, may properly be made liable under Art. 887 M.C. (old) (515, new) for work on the lower stretches of the water-courses in question.\nThey also complain, however, that they are required by the proc\u00e8s-verbal to do on the portions of those watercourses which pass through their own lands work that is quite unnecessary for the drainage of them in direct contravention of Art. 881 M.C. (old) (511, new). The evidence of Joseph Ruel, a witness called for the defence, is:\nQ. A pr\u00e9sent ces deux ruisseaux \"La-Loutre\" et \"G\u00e9n\u00e1reux\" sont suffisants pour prendre toute l'eau de ces terres-l\u00e0 en haut?\nR. Ah! oui.\nThe proc\u00e8s-verbal requires that the two water-courses in question should be \"faits, ouverts et entretenus\" of certain defined widths and depths where they pass through the appellants' lands. The evidence does not disclose the present widths and depths of the water-courses in these stretches. But counsel for the mise-en-cause, when pressed upon this point, admitted that a literal enforcement of the proc\u00e8s-verbal would be illegal, adding, however, that it has never been enforced and that nobody has any interest to enforce it. He stated that the purpose of the \"verbalisation,\" so far as it affects these stretches of the water-courses, was merely the re-enactment of a by-law which was rendered necessary by the erection of the new municipality of Wendover and Simpson and that it was not intended to require the appellants to do more than to maintain in their existing condition the stretches of the two water-courses passing through their lands\u2014in fact, that all that was contemplated as to these stretches was the cleaning out of the existing water-courses and the putting of them in a proper state of repair.\nWhile I doubt, if it has been shown that the widths and depths prescribed by the proc\u00e8s-verbal exceed those of the existing water-courses through the appellants' lands, that the answer made by counsel for the mise-en-cause would be sufficient, on the other hand in the absence of definite proof of those facts and of evidence making it reasonably clear that allowing the proc\u00e8s-verbal to remain in force will expose the appellants to serious and palpable injustice, there being no suggestion of fraud or indirect motive or want of good faith on the part of the municipal council, I incline to the view that we should not in this court exercise the special jurisdiction conferred by Art. 50 C.C.P., the Superior Court and Court of King's Bench of the province having already declined to do so. The stretches of the two water-courses which pass through the appellants' lands are comparatively of trifling importance in the extensive drainage scheme dealt with by the proc\u00e8s-verbal. Although the point appears to be covered by paragraph 9 of the declaration, insistence by the appellants that the proc\u00e8s-verbal involves a distinct violation of Art. 881 M.C. (old) would seem to be an after thought, no allusion being made to it either in the judgment of Mr. Justice Pouliot or in that of Mr. Justice Letourneau. I am not satisfied that the case falls within the limitations to which the courts have declared the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by Art. 50 C.C.P. to be subject. Mercier v. County of Belle-chasse[3]; La Corporation de Ste. Julie v. Massue[4]. Had the appellants' case been rested upon Art. 881 M.C. at the trial we probably should have had definite evidence as to the present widths and depths of the stretches of the two water-courses which pass through the appellants' lands. Had the objection based on this article been brought to the attention of the municipal council at an early date the proc\u00e8s-verbal could, if necessary, readily have been amended to meet it, or, if that relief were denied, the difficulty could have been satisfactorily dealt with at comparatively small expense by an application to the Circuit Court under Art. 430 M.C. (new).\nUnder all the circumstances I am, for these, reasons, of the opinion that the appeal fails.\nMignault J.\u2014Les appelants, all\u00e9guant \u00eatre propri\u00e9taires contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9 des cantons de Wendover et Simpson, attaquent un proc\u00e8s-verbal verbalisant, entr'autres cours d'eau, le cours d'eau \"G\u00e9n\u00e9reux,\" aussi connu sous le nom de \"Grande D\u00e9charge\" ou \"Cours d'eau de la Fromagerie,\" et que j'appellerai ci-apr\u00e8s la \"Grande D\u00e9charge,\" et le cours d'eau \"La Loutre,\" qui est un tributaire de la \"Grande D\u00e9charge.\" Ce proc\u00e8sverbal fut homologu\u00e9 le 14 septembre, 1914, par le bureau des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s des comt\u00e9s de Drummond et d'Yamaska, mais les appelants attendirent pr\u00e8s de six ans apr\u00e8s cette homologation avant de porter leur action, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e le 2 septembre, 1920.\nIl convient d'ajouter que ce proc\u00e8s-verbal r\u00e8glemente un grand syst\u00e8me d'irrigation et d'\u00e9coulement d'eau, comprenant pas moins de dix-huit cours d'eau, dont la principale art\u00e8re est la \"Grande D\u00e9charge\" et les autres, \"La Loutre\" comprise, sont des tributaires.\nA l'audition devant cette cour, les intim\u00e9es ont pr\u00e9tendu que, les appelants ne s'\u00e9tant pas pourvus par appel \u00e0 la cour de circuit dans les trente jours de l'homologation du proc\u00e8s-verbal, comme le permettaient les articles 1062 et suivants de l'ancien code municipal, tout droit d'action sous l'article 50 C.P.C. est maintenant prescrit. Et ils invoquent la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans Ville Saint-Michel v. Shannon Realties, Limited[5], confirm\u00e9e depuis par le conseil priv\u00e9[6].\nCette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sous l'empire de l' \"Acte des Cit\u00e9s et Villes\" qui ne contient pas de disposition semblable \u00e0 l'art. 100 de l'ancien code municipal (voy. maintenant les art. 430 \u00e0 433 inclusivement du nouveau code). Malgr\u00e9 le droit d'appel ou d'action \u00e0 la cour de circuit ou \u00e0 la cour de magistrat et la prescription de ce droit, ces articles conservent l'action en nullit\u00e9 devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure en vertu de l'article 50 C.P.C. La prescription de ce que l'art. 433 nouv. C. M. appelle \"le recours sp\u00e9cial\" ne para\u00eet donc pas entra\u00eener la prescription de l'action en nullit\u00e9 devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nJe me h\u00e2te d'ajouter, cependant, que si l'on ne peut dire qu'il y ait \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'action en nullit\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure d'autre prescription proprement dite que celle du droit commun, trente ans, la cour sup\u00e9rieure, exer\u00e7ant une juridiction extraordinaire sous l'art. 50 C.P.C., dont l'opportunit\u00e9 est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, peut tr\u00e8s bien refuser d'intervenir lorsqu'on a laiss\u00e9 s'\u00e9couler un long d\u00e9lai avant de demander la cassation d'un acte municipal. (Voy. le dictum du juge Andrews dans Th\u00e9riault v. Notre-Dame-du-Lac[7]). Sans faire \u00e9tat de la distinction que faisait la juris- prudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec entre le recours pour irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s devant la cour de circuit et Taction en nullit\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure, dont j'ai parl\u00e9 dans mon opinion dissidente dans Ville Saint-Michel v. Shannon Realties, Limited[8], je ne vois rien qui emp\u00eacherait la cour sup\u00e9rieure de prendre en consid\u00e9ration le fait que le demandeur avait un recours facile par voie d'appel ou d'action devant la cour de circuit ou la cour de magistrat et qu'il n'en a pas profit\u00e9. Je ne dis pas que cette circonstance est d\u00e9cisive, mais lorsqu'elle se complique, comme dans le cas actuel, d'un long d\u00e9lai, totalement inexpliqu\u00e9 depuis la mise en vigueur de l'acte municipal, je suis d'opinion que la cour sup\u00e9rieure peut tr\u00e8s bien refuser d'exercer son droit de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le.\nJ'en viens maintenant au m\u00e9rite de l'action des appelants et aux griefs qu'ils invoquent. Le proc\u00e8s-verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sous l'empire de l'ancien code municipal et ce sont les articles de ce code que je vais citer, en indiquant toutefois les articles correspondants du nouveau code, qui n'est entr\u00e9 en vigueur que le 1er novembre 1916.\nLes appelants se plaignent qu'on les ait assujettis aux travaux de construction et d'entretien des cours d'eau \"Grande D\u00e9charge\" et \"La Loutre,\" malgr\u00e9 que leurs terrains, \u00e0 raison de leur \u00e9l\u00e9vation, puissent s'\u00e9goutter par ces cours d'eau sans travaux d'art. Ils disent qu'il y a eu en cela violation de la servitude l\u00e9gale qu'ils poss\u00e8dent en vertu de l'art. 501 C.C., la pente de leurs terrains \u00e9tant telle que l'eau s'en \u00e9coule naturellement sur les fonds inf\u00e9rieurs au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice desquels le proc\u00e8s-verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Ils pr\u00e9tendent que ces deux cours d'eau sont des cours d'eau naturels, qu'ils sont suffisants pour leurs besoins et que, s'il est n\u00e9cessaire de les creuser ou \u00e9largir, les appelants ne doivent pas \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 contribuer aux travaux.\nQuant \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention, je puis dire que dans l'origine tout ce territoire \u00e9tait couvert de bois. Il y avait alors des coul\u00e9es ou foss\u00e9s naturels peu profonds par lesquels l'eau s'\u00e9coulait. Le d\u00e9frichement de cette r\u00e9gion a augment\u00e9 le volume des eaux et les coul\u00e9es se sont creus\u00e9es graduellement. Il est certain d'apr\u00e8s la preuve qu'on a travaill\u00e9 de main d'homme \u00e0 la \"Grande D\u00e9charge,\" mais il n'est pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'on ait fait des travaux dans le lit de \"La Loutre.\" Ce qui est clair cependant, c'est que ces cours d'eau sont bien plus larges et profonds qu'autrefois, car il faut maintenant des ponts pour les traverser. Ce qui me para\u00eet encore d\u00e9montr\u00e9, c'est que les appelants ont creus\u00e9 sur leurs terrains des foss\u00e9s tr\u00e8s profonds sans l'aide desquels une partie seulement des eaux de surface parviendrait aux cours d'eau, car s'il y a une pente g\u00e9n\u00e9rale vers le nord, cette pente n'exc\u00e8de pas un pied par arpent et elle est interrompue par des plateaux de six \u00e0 huit cents pieds de largeur o\u00f9 il n'y a aucune d\u00e9clivit\u00e9. Il faut donc chez les appelants des foss\u00e9s tr\u00e8s profonds pour drainer leurs terrains. Il est clair que de tels foss\u00e9s n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaires pour les fins ordinaires de la culture, s'il ne s'\u00e9tait agi d'amener artificiellement le surplus d'eau jusqu'aux cours d'eau, et en cela il y a eu aggravation de la servitude de l'art. 501 C.C.\nDevant cette cour, les appelants se sont surtout plaints de la pr\u00e9tendue violation de l'art. 881 C.M. (art. 511 nouveau code) qui dit que nul n'est tenu de faire ou d'aider \u00e0 faire, en aucune mani\u00e8re, sur son propre terrain, un cours d'eau d'une profondeur plus grande que celle qui lui est n\u00e9cessaire pour l'\u00e9gout de ce terrain.\nLe proc\u00e8s-verbal donne \u00e0 la \"Grande D\u00e9charge\" six pieds de largeur dans le fond depuis sa source jusqu'\u00e0 sa jonction avec le cours d'eau \"Elie Chartrand,\" de l\u00e0 dix pieds de largeur dans le fond jusqu'\u00e0 la route entre les cantons de Wendover et Simpson qui est plus bas que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des appelants. Le cours d'eau \"La Loutre\" aurait, d'apr\u00e8s le proc\u00e8s-verbal, huit pieds de large dans le fond depuis sa source jusqu'au centre du lot de terre n\u00b0 7 du troisi\u00e8me rang de Simpson et dix pieds de large depuis ce dernier point jusqu'\u00e0 la route entre Wendover et Simpson.\nCe que la preuve a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer, c'est en quoi ces dimensions diff\u00e8rent de la grandeur actuelle de ces deux cours d'eau. On sait que ces cours d'eau existent depuis m\u00e9moire d'homme et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 continuellement en s'agrandissant, ce qui s'explique par l'effet du d\u00e9boisement qui y amenait une plus grande quantit\u00e9 d'eau et aussi par la nature du terrain qui est sablonneux et partant se d\u00e9sagr\u00e8ge facilement. Les t\u00e9moins qui les ont vus il y a environ quarante ans ne les reconnaissent pas et trouvent qu'ils sont bien chang\u00e9s. Parlant de la \"Grand D\u00e9charge,\" Hilas Larivi\u00e8re, un des anciens, dit qu'elle a dix pieds de large, et plus encore \u00e0 quelques endroits. Les cours d'eau en question sont aussi tr\u00e8s profonds.\nSans l'admission faite \u00e0 l'audition devant cette cour par M. Marier, avocat de la mise en cause, la corporation des cantons de Wendover et Simpson, que si on ex\u00e9cutait \u00e0 la lettre le proc\u00e8s-verbal il y aurait ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, je serais d'avis que la pr\u00e9tention des appelants qu'on a viol\u00e9 l'art. 881 C.M. en les astreignant \u00e0 faire un cours d'eau d'une profondeur plus grande que celle qui leur est n\u00e9cessaire pour l'\u00e9gout de leurs terrains, est enti\u00e8rement insoutenable en l'absence de preuve des dimensions actuelles des cours d'eau. Si j'ai \u00e9prouv\u00e9 quelques h\u00e9sitations, c'est uniquement \u00e0 raison de cette admission, car apr\u00e8s avoir lu bien attentivement toute la preuve je suis fermement d'avis qu'il n'y a rien dans cette preuve qui fasse voir qu'on ait viol\u00e9 en fait l'article 881. Et apr\u00e8s avoir tout pes\u00e9 je ne crois pas devoir m'arr\u00eater \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration de M. Marier, car il est prouv\u00e9 qu'il y a eu de la part des appelants aggravation de la servitude l\u00e9gale, et je ne trouve nulle part qu'il y ait eu soit injustice flagrante, soit oppression, soit fraude, de la part des autorit\u00e9s municipales.\nDu reste, le jugement tr\u00e8s complet et tr\u00e8s bien raisonn\u00e9 de l'honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau d\u00e9montre que c'est une toute autre cause que les appelants ont soumise \u00e0 la cour d'appel. Ils cherchaient alors \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un \u00e9tat de faits qui am\u00e8nerait l'application des principes pos\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel dans Comtois v. Dumontier[9], d\u00e9cision qui a fait jurisprudence. L'honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau discute longuement l'article 501 C.C., mais il ne mentionne m\u00eame pas l'article 881 C.M., et il m'est impossible de croire que si les appelants s'\u00e9taient appuy\u00e9s sur ce dernier article en cour d'appel, comme ils l'ont fait devant cette cour, le juge L\u00e9tourneau ne l'aurait pas discut\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. Je rejette donc la pr\u00e9tention des appelants qu'il y a eu violation de l'art. 881, Le juge L\u00e9tourneau d\u00e9montre que la cause de Comtois v. Dumontier[10] ne s'applique pas dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Je concours enti\u00e8rement dans ce qu'il dit \u00e0 ce sujet.\nEt je crois aussi que l'honorable juge Pouliot en cour sup\u00e9rieure a eu raison de dire \u00e0 la fin de son jugement que cette action intent\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de six ans apr\u00e8s l'homologation du proc\u00e8s-verbal ne devait pas \u00eatre accueillie. Un des appelants, le nomm\u00e9 Joseph C\u00f4t\u00e9, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pris une action pour faire annuler le proc\u00e8s-verbal, et il perdit sa cause en cour sup\u00e9rieure et en cour de revision. Il s'est alors joint aux autres appelants pour instituer cette action qui vient \u00e0 cette cour apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 des juges par la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour d'appel. Tous ces frais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus par les appelants afin de t\u00e2cher d'\u00e9chapper \u00e0 l'obligation de fournir quelques heures d'ouvrage aux travaux de ces cours d'eau. Dans ces circonstances, je ne puis dire que leur action n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e.\nJe rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Garceau & Ringuet.\nSolicitor for defendant respondent: C.

Rep. 29) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of McDonald J. and granting a petition by the respondent under the \" Land Registry Act\" for an order upon the registrar to register a title to certain land.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The land in question herein being owned by the late Sheriff Higginson, was sold by him by virtue of an agreement in writing before his death, which occurred on or about the 15th of September, 1911, to Stonehouse and Carlow for the sum of $6,000, of which there was due at his death $1,207.84, including accrued interest.\nOn the 29th November, 1911, William Burdis, the executor of the last will and testament of said Higginson, who had meantime obtained probate of said will, conveyed said lands to said vendees.\nBy several mesne conveyances pursuant to respective purchases the said lands were conveyed for respective good and valuable consideration until thereby the land became vested in one Arbuthnot, who mortgaged same to respondent and then conveyed the equity of redemption to Maud Peck. And respondent thereafter foreclosed said mortgage and got final order therefor on the 29th of May, 1922, and on the 5th of June, 1922, made an application to the registrar of titles in Vancouver to have said final order duly registered, as all said previously mentioned conveyances had been.\nOn the 27th of November, 1922, said registrar declined to do so, except subject to a lien for succession duties payable in respect of the estate of said Higginson.\nHence the petition of respondent praying for an order directing the said registrar to register said final order of foreclosure clear of all encumbrances and especially the lien claimed by appellant for the said succession duties.\nThe registrar had received for registration, at 10 a.m. of the 5th of June, 1922, from the Minister of Finance of the Crown, on behalf of British Columbia, a caution claimed to have been so tendered pursuant to section 50 of the \" Succession Duty Act\" of British Columbia enacted in 1907.\nThat section provides\nand any subsequent dealing with such land, mortgage or charge shall be subject to the lien for such duty.\nI fail to see how that can help the appellant under the facts in question herein whereby the registered title of the many prior grantees had become under the provisions of the \" Land Registry Act,\" absolute.\nThere had also been registered in the said Registry Office, prior thereto, on the 1st of August, 1921, a certificate of lis pendens in said foreclosure action.\nTrue the said section 50 ends by saying.\nbut nothing herein contained shall effect the rights of the Crown to claim a lien independently of the said caution.\nThat does not in itself give any lien.\nBut had the Crown any lien under the said Act under the circumstances in question herein? I am presently about to show why I think it had not, but if it had any such effective lien why was this enacted?\nThe lien, if any, is given by section 20 of the \" Succession Duty Act,\" and I must look to the purview of the whole Act to realize how far and how and when it really was intended to become operative.\nThere are parts of the Act providing for the valuation of the property of the deceased, and a list thereof in detail to be made, and how it is to be dealt with in way of execution thereof.\nThen it is only after all that has been done that a grant of probate or of letters of administration can be made by the proper court, but not until ample security, fixed by the order of the Minister of the Crown having charge of finance, and aided by his officers, has been given by the executor or administrator for the payment of the succession duties. The security may be given by the executor and sufficient sureties, or an approved corporate company having power to give same.\nThere is no distinction made between real estate and personal property in all this.\nAre we then to assume that this statutory provision for the realization of the assets is to be read as if a lien existed also on each and every item of the said assets although by section 20 of the Act which gives such lien it is clearly contemplated by the provision for interest being only to run after two years from the death, that such length of time shall elapse before the assets are realized?\nI submit not, for it is clear to my mind that the security alone is looked to and substituted for any lien existent prior thereto.\nHow could the executor effectively dispose of much of some estates, especially those largely composed of personal chattels which may have to be sold advantageously by carrying on the business of the deceased?\nIs each purchaser of such articles to be supposed to investigate the title of each item he so buys? I submit not, and that such a scheme never was contemplated by the legislature. On the contrary the whole scheme is to enable the executor, or administrator, to realize the assets and then, as he does so, pay thereout from each item the succession duties payable in respect thereof.\nFrom the moment the grant of probate is given\u2014which must be preceded by the giving of ample security as was given in this case at the cost, no doubt, of a heavy premium, the executor is entitled to proceed to realize by sale the several assets of the estate.\nThe same view must also be taken as to the collection of debts due the testator, as was the small item for balance of purchase money in question herein.\nWhen the executor realized, as he did, the sum of $1,207.84, including accrued interest for the balance of the purchase money in question, the right to claim any lien thereon was gone, unless upon that which the executor had in his hands as the result of such realization. There are several later provisions in the Act for enforcing payment by application to a judge as against those liable, but nothing, I submit, justifying such pretension as set up herein.\nUnless we actually realize by applying a little common sense to what people are about, the legislators especially, we are apt to misinterpret and misconstrue their real purpose.\nThere are many sections in this Act, of which the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal below has selected section 28, and the respondent's factum has selected many more, as indicating the true interpretation and construction of the Act, including the references to liens of the Crown.\nI submit that interpretation gives no encouragement to the pretensions set up by the appellant herein.\nThe claim that each item of the estate of a testator is liable to bear the burden of the entire succession duty and the rights of the parties concerned be blotted out thereby, when clearly it is contemplated that it is only the aliquot part thereof according to a great variety of ratios that the Act provides, which have to be considered, seems to me, with great respect, hardly arguable.\nMy brother Duff, in his opinion which I have had the opportunity of reading, points out in cogent reasoning, which I need not repeat here, why the subject matter in question herein cannot be held the subject of a lien such as claimed by appellant.\nI agree in the main with the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice of the court below and am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014This appeal raises a question as to the construction of the \" Succession Duty Act\" of British Columbia, R.S.B.C., c. 217. The question arises in these circumstances: Thomas Sheriff Higginson, who died in September, 1911, and whose will was proved in November of that year by one Burdis, who was named one of his executors, had, before his death, sold to William H. Stonehouse and Frederick G. Carlaw for the sum of $6,000 certain real estate, the identity of which is of no importance, under an agreement for sale which, at the time of his death, was still in fieri; and under which there was owing at that date the sum of $1,207.84 for principal and interest. The purchase having been completed by payment of the purchase money and conveyance of the land to the purchasers, the title passed by several further conveyances to one George Allan Arbuthnot, who became the registered owner in indefeasible fee. Arbuthnot having mortgaged the land to the respondent, the Caledonian Insurance Company, foreclosure proceedings were ultimately taken by the respondent, and, a final order for foreclosure having been obtained by the 29th May, 1922, an application was made to the registrar of titles for the registration of the respondent as owner in fee simple. It then appeared that on the 5th June, 1922, after the final order for foreclosure had been obtained, a caution had been filed by the Minister of Finance, professing to act under the authority of section 50 of the \" Succession Duty Act,\" in which it was declared that succession duty was claimed by the Minister in respect of the lands which were the subject of the respondent's application.\nThe statute enacts that on any application for probate or for letters of administration, the amount of the succession duty payable shall be determined in the manner thereby directed, and immediate payment made or a bond given by the applicant or applicants, with surety or sureties, for the payment of the duty; and by s. 5 of c. 60 of the British Columbia Statutes of 1917, the issuing of letters probate or letters of administration is prohibited unless and until the duty is paid or security given. By section 7,\nall property situate within the province, or so much as passes,\neither by will or intestacy (as the case may be), is made liable to duty; and by section 2, the \"interpretation\" section, \" property \" includes,\nreal and personal property of every description and every estate or interest therein capable of being devised or bequeathed by will, or of passing on the death of the owner to his heirs or personal representatives;\nand by section 20, the duties imposed by the Act are made payable at the death of the deceased and \" shall,\" it is declared,\nbe and remain a lien upon the property in respect of which they are payable until the same are paid.\nBy section 50, it is enacted that\nin case it is claimed that any land or money secured by any mortgage or charge upon land is subject to duty, the Minister, or the solicitor acting in his behalf, may, when deemed necessary, cause to be registered in the proper registry office a caution stating that succession duty is claimed by the Minister in respect of the said land, mortgage, or charge on account of the death of the deceased, naming him, and any subsequent dealing with such land, mortgage, or charge shall be subject to the lien for such duty; but nothing herein contained shall affect the rights of the Crown to claim a lien independently of the said caution.\nOn behalf of the Crown it is contended that a lien, the quantum of which was measured by the total amount of the duty which might ultimately prove to be payable, attached, upon the death of the testator, the deceased Thomas Sheriff Higginson, upon his interest in the lands which had been sold under the agreement for sale mentioned, and that the lien still attaches as security for the residue of the duty still unpaid. The amount involved is small, but leave to appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on the 8th November, 1923.\nOn behalf of the respondent, it is contended that the acceptance of the bond, which was duly given by the executor, effects a discharge of any lien arising by virtue of section 20, and, in the alternative, that the whole of the duty payable by the estate is not charged upon each particular parcel of property, but only an aliquot part of it, measured by the ratio which the value of that part bears to the value of the estate as a whole.\nThe former view is that which prevailed with the Chief Justice in the court below. I do not think it necessary to pass upon the questions raised by these contentions of the respondent. At the death of the testator the purchase moneys under the agreement of sale became moneys to which his legal personal representative would be entitled as legal assets, virtute officii, and the executor, upon the grant of probate, became entitled to them by virtue of the probate; Attorney General v. Brunning[2]. The effect of the agreement of sale in the events which occurred may be stated in the terms of the following passage, taken from the judgment of Lord Justice James in Rayner v. Preston[3] :\nI agree that it is not accurate to call the relation between the vendor and purchaser of an estate under a contract while the contract is in fieri the relation of the trustee and cestui que trust.. But that is because it is uncertain whether the contract will or will not be performed, and the character in which the parties stand to one another remains in suspense as long as the contract is in fieri. But when the contract is performed by actual conveyance, or performed in every thing but the mere formal act of sealing the engrossed deeds, then that completion relates back to the contract, and it is thereby ascertained that the relation was throughout that of trustee and cestui que trust. That is to say, it is ascertained that while the legal estate was in the vendor, the beneficial or equitable interest was wholly in the purchaser. And that, in my opinion, is the correct definition of a trust estate. Wherever that state of things occurs, whether by act of the parties or by act or operation of law, whether it is ascertained from the first or after a period of suspense and uncertainty, then there is a complete and perfect trust, the legal owner is and has been a trustee, and the beneficial owner is and has been a cestui que trust.\nThis passage is entirely consistent with the judgment of Lord Parker in Howard v. Miller[4], delivered on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the principle is not affected by the fact that the interest of the purchaser under the real property law of British Columbia is technically a charge upon the real estate. This is involved in the reasoning of Lord Parker's judgment, as well as in the decision of this court in Church v. Hill[5] . It follows that it was upon this interest of the testator, the purchase money, that the lien, if lien there was, attached. Assuming that the purchasers were bound to see to the application of the purchase money in payment of the duty, then their responsibility was a personal responsibility which did not in any way attach to the property, and the burden of it did not pass to their grantees. This alone would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal, but it is sufficiently clear to me that the statute cannot be held to impose upon debts payable to the executor, recoverable by him virtute officii, a charge while still in the hands of the debtor in such fashion that the debtor must ascertain at his peril, before paying his debt to the executor, that the duty has been paid. The statute contemplates the payment of the duty or the giving of a bond as security for the payment of the duty as the condition of granting probate. Prima facie the executor, upon a grant of probate, is clothed with authority to receive and give a good discharge for moneys payable to him in his capacity as executor, and it can, I think, never have been contemplated that in addition to the authority conferred by probate or letters of administration, the legal personal representative must receive from the Crown some additional authority enabling him as agent of the Crown to give a discharge to persons indebted to the estate for the moneys which it is his official duty to get in.\nDuring the argument, I was inclined to think that the language of section 50 was a serious obstacle for the respondent. Further consideration, however, convinced me that, rightly construed, that section is not at all inconsistent with the view I have expressed. The effect, no doubt, is that where land or money secured by a mortgage, or a charge upon land is subject to a lien for the duty, then the proceedings therein specified may take place. This, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in his judgment, is not necessarily inconsistent with the idea that where probate or letters of administration have been granted, the legal personal representative may be entitled to get in the property of the estate and to perform other acts of administration virtute officii without encountering the lien as a hindrance at every stage of his proceedings. If the foregoing reasoning be correct, then as a rule money secured by a mortgage or charge upon land in favour of the testator would be an asset which it would be the duty of the executor to realize; and land, if subject to an agreement for sale executed by the testator in his lifetime, which the vendee was able and willing to carry out, and in respect of which he desired to pay the purchase money to the executor, would not be an asset which could be affected by proceedings under this section.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Taking into consideration all the provisions of the British Columbia Succession Duty Act, I am of the opinion that the better construction is that put on the statute by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, namely, that upon the taking of the prescribed security for succession duties the lien of the Crown therefor is superseded. The implication of section 37 that that is the case seems to me to outweigh any contrary inference that might be drawn from the provisions of section 50. For the purposes of the grant of probate or administration and of the right of the personal representative to deal with and make title to the property of the decedent free from succession duty the taking of the prescribed security and actual payment of the duties seem to be put on the same footing.\nI also agree that the succession duties imposed by the statute are chargeable distributively upon the several properties of the estate made subject to them and not as one entirety, or collectively, upon the whole estate and every part of it.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Duff.\nMALOUIN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.

V, c. 37, ss. 48, 57 (2) and 61 (N.B.)\u2014Industry under Part I\u2014Failure to furnish statements to Board\u2014Transfer to operation of Part II\u2014Continuance of default\u2014Operation of s. 48.\nBy section 48 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of New Brunswick every employer shall, on or before the first of January in each year, furnish the Workmen's Compensation Board with a statement giving an estimate of the pay-roll for that year of each of its industries within the scope of Part I and by section 57 (1) the Board may levy upon each employer a provisional amount based upon such estimate and other information obtained and collect the same, the money thus obtained to furnish a fund out of which compensation may be paid to any employee injured by negligence of his employer or in consequence of a defective system. If an industry falls only under the operation of Part II of the Act the compensation must be paid by the employer.\nSection 57 also provides (s.s. 2) that if the estimate required by section 48 is not furnished the Board may itself estimate the amount due from the employer and collect same, and section 48 (2) prescribes a penalty for such default. Then section 61 provides that (1) Any industry in respect of which the employer neglects or refuses to furnish any estimate * * * shall, during the continuance of such default, be deemed to be an industry within Part II * * * and except as provided in subsection (3) no compensation shall be payable under Part I during the continuance of such default; (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) such employer shall be liable to pay to the Board the full amount or capital value of any compensation to which any workman would be entitled under Part I * * * (3) If, and to the extent, that such employer shall pay to the Board such amount or capital value he shall cease to be liable under subsection (1) and such workman shall be entitled to compensation under Part I.\" Subsection (4) provides for relief where the default is excusable.\nHeld, that section 61 does not, in case of default, place the employer permanently under the operation of Part II; nor does it give him a right of election as to which Part he will be subject; notwithstanding the terms of this section the Board may proceed to assess the employer as provided in section 57 (2).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent. The question for decision on this appeal is whether or not the respondent company is subject to assessment under Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act or is only within the operation of Part II. The material sections of the Act and the circumstances under which the question arose are set out in the head-note. The court below held, White J. dissenting, that the respondent only came under Part II.\nLafleur K.C. and W. B. Wallace K.C. for the appellant.\nTeed K.C. and Geoffrion K.C., (George Gilbert K.C. with them) for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs, for the reasons stated by my brother Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought against appellant by the respondent, an incorporated company carrying on at Bathurst in New Brunswick the business of logging, lumbering, manufacturing lumber and pulp and other wood products, and other kinds of industries, and in its said work and operations employs large numbers of workmen.\nThe respondent, therefore, clearly falls within the category of those to whom the scope of Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1918, and according to section three, and amendments since, apply.\nSection thirty of said Act reads as follows:\u2014\n30. (1) The Board shall have jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine all matters and questions of fact and law necessary to be determined in connection with compensation payments under this Part and the administration thereof, and the collection and management of the funds therefor; provided that no decision or ruling of the Board shall be binding upon it as a precedent for any other decision or ruling, the intent of this proviso being that each case shall be decided upon its own merits.\nThat is followed by section 31, giving appellant the like powers of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for compelling the attendance of witnesses and production of books; and by section 32, enabling it to act upon the report of any of its officers, or other person it appoints to make any inquiry.\nAnd by section 33, it was enacted that except as provided in sections 35 and 66, the decisions and findings of the Board upon all questions of law and fact should be final and conclusive.\nThe only restriction thereon would seem to be as provided in said sections 35 and 66, and anything falling thereunder would not seem to me to justify such a suit as this, which turns upon the interpretation and construction of section 61 of the Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n61. (1). Any industry in respect of which the employer neglects or refuses to furnish any estimate or information as required by section 48 shall, during the continuance of such default, be deemed to be an industry within Part II, and such employer shall be liable for damages as provided in Part II, and except as provided in subsection (3) no compensation shall be payable under Part I during the continuance of such default;\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) such employer shall be liable to pay to the Board the full amount or capital value of any compensation payments to which any workman would be entitled under Part I, by reason of any accident occurring during the continuance of such default and such amount or capital value may be assessed against and collected from, such employer by like process and means as in the case of other assessments under Part I.\n(3) If, and to the extent that, such employer shall pay to the Board such amount or capital value he shall cease to be liable under subsection (1) and such workman shall be entitled to compensation under Part I.\n(4) If satisfied that such default was excusable, the Board may relieve such employer in whole or in part from liability under subsection (1) or subsection (2), or both, on such terms as the Board may deem just.\nThe courts below give such a comprehensive meaning to the words \"shall be deemed to be an industry within Part II\" as, if correct, to eliminate any defaulter from coming within the substantial feature of the Act as a Workmen's Compensation Act, as such Acts are, in recent years, usually understood.\nI cannot understand any draftsman of such an Act as this, or legislature enacting, having such serious intention.\nIf such had been the intention of the legislature, they surely would have started with declaring that they desired to enable such captains of industries as chose voluntarily to form an association for producing a scheme to compensate workmen employed by any of them for injuries suffered in the course of their respective employments; or in some such like phraseology suitable for such purpose, and elaborated a scheme in harmony therewith.\nFor the net result of maintaining the judgment appealed from must simply reduce the operation of the Act to serve the wishes of the employers of labour or to absolutely nothing but what they can produce by a voluntary association.\nAs each may see fit he or it can according to said judgment simply make default and then, upon having done so is to be only liable, as at common law or as amended by a few enactments in Part II of this Act, and give a right of action to each employee coming within said law and its said several amendments.\nThat of course would restore all the evils of costly and worrying litigation, which would impose a burden upon suffering workmen that they cannot bear, and enable their masters to give them only such inadequate compensation as to each seemed fit.\nI cannot conceive that any Canadian Provincial Legislature in recent years could have had any such purpose in view in enacting a statute such as now presented for serious consideration.\nI submit that such evils as this statute was clearly enacted to remedy were those arising from such causes as I have just mentioned.\nTo nullify such an attempt at reform on the part of the legislature seems, I respectfully submit, the entire object of this litigation.\nThere are so many enactments therein tending to demonstrate that the purview which the legislature had in view was entirely inconsistent with such an interpretation and construction as the courts below have put upon said section 61, subsection (1) of the Act, that I cannot accept said interpretation and construction as correct.\nThat due and obvious purview can easily be observed, and a rational interpretation in accord therewith be given said subsection, which obviously to my mind was intended to give possible sufferers from their employer's default (tending to hinder the main operations of the Act) the right of action given by the Part II, and temporarily ameliorate the condition of those suffering from such default pending the action to be taken by the appellant to enforce the observance by such defaulters of their legal obligations under Part I of the Act.\nAlternatively as tending to help to induce by the probable result of enforcing such enactments in said Part I there appears in harmony therewith subsections (2), (3) and (4).\nThe enactment in subsection (1), read in light of said subsection, is easily understood and has to be given a very narrow range of operation. Call it penalizing if you will, it certainly is intended to check such obstructive tactics as this action of appellant shews may be expected and exceptional cases of a like kind arising therefrom.\nIn harmony with such purpose we have in section 48, subsection (2), the enactment imposing penalties for the defaulter.\nI am glad to find that Mr. Justice White's judgment, dissenting from the majority in the Appeal Division, has set forth many other enactments which, as well as those I have above referred to, present the purview I find in the legislative mind bearing upon the question in a way to strengthen same.\nI agree in the view presented by that great master of our law, Lord Cairns, in the case of Atkinson v. Newcastle Waterworks Co. (1), where he had to deal with another kind of statute than that now presented but which like it required the consideration of what was the proper way to look at some statutes.\nA single sentence thereof from page 448 shews we must grasp, if we can, the purview of the legislature relative to the enactment as a whole:\u2014\nI cannot but think that that must, to a great extent, depend on the purview of the legislature in the particular statute, and the language which they have there employed, and more especially when, as here, the Act with which the court have to deal is not an Act of public and general policy, but is rather in the nature of a private legislative bargain with a body of undertakers as to the manner in which they will keep up certain public works.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nDuff J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal in its substance may be put concisely; it is whether an employer, carrying on an industry assigned by the Board to one of the classes under the Act, and having failed to furnish to the Board the estimate or estimates required by section 48 or any of the other information demanded by the Board\n(1) 2 Ex. D. 441. under that section, is subject, so long as his default continues, to be assessed pursuant to section 57 of the Act; or whether, on the contrary, by force of section 61, the employer and the industry cease to be subject to assessment under Part I. An alternative point, which must not be overlooked, made by Mr. Geoffrion, is to the effect that any \"default\" under section 48 comes to an end and ceases to be a \"default\" within the meaning of section 61 when the Board, acting upon its own estimate under subsection (2) of section 57 has levied the amount assessable in virtue of that estimate. I think there is no serious obstacle in point of interpretation in the way of giving effect to the provisions of section 57 and those of section 61 according to what appears to be the natural meaning of both of them. It is quite true that section 61, in declaring that any industry, during the continuance of the \"default\" of the employer in respect of his duty to furnish any estimate or information as required by section 48, shall be\ndeemed to be an industry within Part II, and such employer shall be liable for damages as provided in Part II,\nif these words be read literally and without regard to the context, would appear to be inconsistent with the provisions of section 57. When the language of section 61, however, is read as a whole, one sees that section 61 is a section which is primarily concerned with protecting the interests of the workman. Subsection (4) shews, of course, that it is, in part at least, designed to be punitive and deterrent, but the subject to which it is mainly directed is the position of the workman in respect of compensation in a case in which an employer has neglected or refused to provide estimates and information in compliance with section 48 as the necessary basis for determining the amount of his contribution under the normal operation of Part I. In that event section 61 provides very clearly that the workman shall be entitled to recover damages under Part II, and while he is not entitled to be paid compensation by the Board out of the general fund, he is entitled to recover compensation out of a fund to be provided by the employer himself. Subsection (2) requires the employer to pay to the Board the capital value of any compensation payments to which any of his workmen would be entitled under Part I, a sum which can be ascertained by the Board by the ordinary methods established for determining compensation; and such compensation shall by subsection 3 be paid by the Board to the workman; and to that extent the employer is \"relieved\" from liability under the first subsection to pay damages under Part II. It may seem to savour of harshness that an employer, whose responsibilities are governed by section 61, responsibilities which, under that section alone, are assuredly onerous, can, at the same time, be subjected to an assessment on an estimate made by the Board itself under section 57 for a contribution to the general fund. Two points, however, may be observed. One is that the delinquency of the employer consists in failing to furnish information simply, a course of action prompted, it may be assumed, in most cases by a determination to refuse his co-operation with other employers in working the scheme set up by the Act. The legislature may have been advised that rigorous measures were necessary for the purpose, in such circumstances, of disciplining recalcitrants. Moreover, by subsection (4) of section 61, a very wide authority is given to the Board, if satisfied that the default was excusable, to relieve the employer from the burden of the obligations imposed by the provisions of section 61.\nThe argument most strongly pressed upon us was that a presumption, and a rather weighty presumption, arises against the existence of an intention on part of the legislature to impose a double liability, which the Act, upon this construction, does seem to impose; and the alternative view is suggested that the legislature really intended that employers should have the right to elect between two courses: First, to come under the liabilities and obligations imposed upon employers who participate in the general scheme provided by Part I; or, secondly, to come under the exceptional scheme provided by section 61.\nThere is, however, nothing in the language of the Act that points to such a construction as giving effect to the deliberate intention of the legislature. The language of section 61, on the contrary, speaking, as it does, of \"default\" in failing to furnish estimates and information under section 48 and of such \"default\" being in some cir- cumstances \"excusable,\" seems to imply that during the whole of the period while the \"refusal\" or the \"neglect\" continues, the employer is still under an obligation under section 48 to provide such estimates and information. And subsection (4) of section 61, in providing for relief against the rigours of subsections 1 and 2, seems almost conclusively to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature inconsistent with the view that the section was setting up an alternative system to which the employer might properly, that is to say, as of right, resort at his option. In this view it seems to follow, inevitably almost, that under section 57 (2) the Board is entitled to proceed as it is proceeding in this case. As to the alternative point, I have great difficulty in finding any justification in the words of the Act for limiting the scope of the word \"default\" in the manner suggested. So long as the duty imposed by section 48 remains unfulfilled, it would appear that the default continues.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The New Brunswick Workmen's Compensation Act, 1918, the construction of which is in issue between the parties, is divided into two parts.\nPart I is a general Workmen's Compensation law applicable to employer and workmen in a large number of specified industries, with a Workmen's Compensation Board empowered to levy an annual assessment upon the industries subject to this part of the Act and with the obligation of employers to furnish to the Board, on or before the 1st of January in each year, a statement of their estimated pay-roll for the year (section 48). The provisions of Part I are in lieu of all claims and rights of action, statutory or otherwise, to which a workman or his dependents are or may be entitled against the employer for, or by reason of, any accident in respect of which compensation is payable under this part (section 12). I may add that a fund for the payment of compensation to workmen is formed by means of the assessments which the Board is empowered to levy on employers subject to Part I.\nPart II applies to industries to which Part I does not apply. Briefly it gives an action of damages to the workman for personal injury, and to his legal representatives in case of his death, by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises of the employer, or by reason of the negligence of the employer, or of any person in his service acting within the scope of his employment. The doctrine of contributory negligence and common employment does not constitute a bar to the right of recovery. Compensation cannot exceed the sum of $3,500, but contributory negligence is taken into account in assessing the damages (sections 82, 83).\nThe difficulty between the parties has arisen in connection with the construction and effect of section 61 of Part I of the Act. Whatever may have been the intention of the draughtsman, he has succeeded in rendering it extremely obscure, and the legislature would be well advised should it redraft this provision so as to remove it from the class of legislative puzzles. I do not propose to place a construction on it any further than is necessary to determine whether the contention which the respondent bases on this section is well founded.\nSection 61 reads as follows:\u2014\n61. (1) Any industry in respect of which the employer neglects or refuses to furnish any estimate or information as required by section 48 shall, during the continuance of such default, be deemed to be an industry within Part II, and such employer shall be liable for damages as provided in Part II, and except as provided in subsection (3) no compensation shall be payable under Part I during the continuance of such default;\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) such employer shall be liable to pay to the Board the full amount or capital value of any compensation payments to which any workman would be entitled under Part I by reason of any accident occurring during the continuance of such default, and such amount or capital value may be assessed against, and collected from, such employer by like process and means as in the case of other assessments under Part I.\n(3) If, and to the extent that, such employer shall pay to the Board such amount or capital value he shall cease to be liable under subsection (1) and such workman shall be entitled to compensation under Part I.\n(4) If satisfied that such default was excusable, the Board may relieve such employer in whole or in part from liability under subsection (1) or subsection (2), or both, on such terms as the Board may deem just.\nThe respondent contends that this section allows any employer subject to Part I to free himself from the obligations imposed upon him by this part, and to place himself under Part II, by his mere neglect or refusal to furnish any estimate or information as required by section 48. To my mind such a construction would nullify the whole policy of the Act, and cannot in any event be reconciled with subsection (2) of section 57, which empowers the Board, when the employer has refused or neglected to furnish any estimate or information as required by section 48, to make its own estimate of the amount due by the employer and to levy and collect such amount. I think the object of section 61 is to protect the workman notwithstanding the default of the employer. It gives the workman, by subsection (1), a right to claim damages from the employer as provided in Part II; subsection (2), notwithstanding subsection (1), obliges the employer to pay to the Board the full amount or capital value of any compensation payment to which the workman would be entitled under Part I by reason of any accident occurring during the employer's default; and by subsection (3), when the employer has paid to the Board such amount or capital value, he ceases to be liable under subsection (1), and the workman is entitled to compensation under Part I. Finally it is provided by section 4 that if the Board is satisfied that the employer's default was excusable, it may relieve him in whole or in part from liability under subsections (1) or (2), or both, on such terms as it may deem just.\nI cannot think that the intention of the legislature was to give to the employer an easy means to escape by his mere inaction from the obligations imposed on him by the other provisions of Part I of the Act. It is sufficient to hold, and I do not intend to go any further, that the contention of the respondent that it can thus relieve itself from its liability for the assessments imposed by the Board, is without foundation.\nThe respondent has proved that it paid during the year of assessment $2,878 as compensation to its workmen entitled to claim compensation under the Act. I think this sum should be taken into account by the Board in making its assessment, for to that extent the fund was relieved from liability.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the respondent's action with costs throughout. Malouin J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff, with which I concur, I would allow this appeal and dismiss the action with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

[1914] c. 183\u2014Application of ss. 194 and 195\u2014Special condition in policy\u2014Representation\u2014Materiality to risk.\nSection 194 of the Ontario Insurance Act, notwithstanding its position among a group of sections under the heading \u201cContracts of Fire Insurance\u201d applies to all kinds of insurance and requires the statutory conditions to be printed on every policy insuring against fire and other causes of loss.\nQu. Should they be printed on a policy that does not insure against loss by fire?\nIn an action on a policy insuring, on payment of a single premium, an automobile against loss by fire or theft in which action loss by theft is alleged, the insurer cannot invoke breach of a special condition restricting the use of the automobile when such condition is not printed in the form required by section 195 of the Act.\nIf the insured, on applying for the insurance, in answer to a question asked by the company\u2019s agent states that the car was paid for when he had given a promissory note for part of the price which was paid at maturity he is not guilty of omitting to disclose a circumstance material to the risk which would avoid the policy.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe respondent brought action on a policy insuring his automobile against loss by fire or theft alleging that it had been stolen. The main defence of the appellant was that the insured had violated a condition indorsed on the policy prohibiting the use of the automobile in carrying passengers for hire. The other defence was that the insured had suppressed a fact material to the risk, namely, that the car was not fully paid, a note having been given for part of the price. The trial judge held against the insurers on both grounds and his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division. J.H. Fraser for the appellant referred to In re Keet[1] on the question of non-disclosure.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the respondent relied on Rockmaker v. Motor Union Ins. Co.[2] as to the application of section 194 of the Insurance Act.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After the argument of this appeal, and during it, I entertained some doubts as to its proper disposition. After giving the facts a very thorough investigation, I am still somewhat doubtful, though inclined on the whole to dismiss the appeal. Since I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of my brother Duff, my doubts have been very largely removed and my conclusion is to dismiss the appeal, concurring with the reasons stated by him.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action by the respondent to recover from appellant insurance under and by virtue of a policy of insurance issued by said appellant to respondent upon his automobile, and covenanting thereby to indemnify him against loss or damage to said automobile, by fire, or by stranding, or by burglary, pilferage or theft.\nThe learned trial judge held defendant, now appellant, liable and directed a reference to determine the amount of damage suffered by reason of the said automobile having been stolen in Detroit.\nThe defences set up were that the auto had, contrary to the condition in said policy, been used as a taxi on some horse-racing days in Windsor, and that the respondent had represented the car to have been paid for when bought.\nIt turned out that the purchase price was $3,700, of which $2,675 had been paid in cash, and the balance by a promissory note, paid when due, within two months after the insurance in question. And some other trivial suggestions, not taken seriously below, seem to have been made.\nThere is no pretence that there was any lien or charge against the auto for the said promissory note. And as there was no written application for the policy, but merely a note or memorandum by the appellant\u2019s agent of the material features in question, I think the answer made to him in this regard was quite justifiable and the attempted defence in that connection not a thing to be entertained here.\nThe condition, or so-called warranty, relative to the payment indicates, I submit, nothing more than an assurance that there was no lien or mortgage or other charge against the auto.\nThe appellant, on appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, had the satisfaction of that court dividing equally, and hence this appeal here in which the only important question raised is whether or not the policy of insurance in question falls within the provisions of section 194, and subsequent sections, of the Ontario Insurance Act.\nThe learned trial judge held that it does and in support thereof pointed out subsection 14 of section 2 of the said Insurance Act, defining \u201cContract of Insurance\u201d as therein used.\nI would add thereto the due consideration of subsection 32 of said section 2 of said Act, and the further subsections (a) to (g) inclusive, of said subsection 32.\nAnd I beg to call attention to subsection 45 of said section 2 defining \u201cPolicy\u201d as follows:\u2014\n\u201cPolicy\u201d shall include any contract of insurance within the meaning of this Act.\nI submit that there are many other features of the said interpretative section 2 aforesaid, which may also be referred to, if we are to decide correctly the issue of law that turns upon the application of sections 194, 195 and 196 to the policy in question herein.\nAnd moreover the entire scope and purview of said Act must be considered.\nThese statutory conditions no doubt originated half a century ago when fire insurance and the conduct of those carrying on the business gave rise to a rather acute situation needing remedy.\nThe legislature has made many changes since (as the business of insurance has grown in many directions) but they have ended in grouping all in one Act, and continuing amendments thereof. The policy in question herein covers fire insurance as well as theft, yet the appellant has paid no regard to the provisions of the Act and therefore I agree with the learned trial judge and those supporting him in the Appellate Division below, that the conditions in this policy upon which appellant relies are null.\nThe foregoing was written shortly after the first argument and before the second argument being ordered.\nThis second argument does not present anything to change my opinion relative to the result. I may be permitted, however, to add that the references to the evidence of the respondent\u2019s use of the car as a taxi cab are far from being conclusive and go no further than to suggest a possible suspicion. The occasions on which said use was alleged were of the kind when the respondent may have merely been helping friends. As read to us I could not find any proof of payment for the carriage of passengers, and against that there is the oath of respondent.\nAgain as to the case of Curtis\u2019s & Harvey v. North British & Mercantile Ins. Co.[3], I may remark that that arose under Quebec law, whereas this policy was issued under the entirely different Ontario Act as it now stands. And I may add that if Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[4], could ever have been circumvented by means of joining a trifling item of other insurance than as against fire, it is remarkable that no one ever was ingenious enough to suggest and apply such a method as presented in argument herein to frustrate the operation of the Act. I may remark in that connection that there was only one premium for a named sum paid or thought of. It turns out that such total single sum covered separate rates. When that is considered without any explanation on the face of the contract, I fail to see how appellant can be helped herein especially in view of the fact that more than half of the total premium entitled respondent to have the statutory conditions observed.\nI think it is conceivable that one policy might, if so expressed, as this is not, be made to cover two substantially different contracts, but this is not of that character.\nHence I would dismiss this appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division below. DUFF J.\u2014The appellants, the Western Assurance Company, on the 19th June, 1920, delivered to the respondent, David Caplan, a policy of insurance upon an automobile, the property of the respondent. The perils insured against are described in Articles I and II of the policy, in the following words:\u2014\nArt. 1. Against direct loss or damage to the automobile hereby insured caused by fire arising from any cause whatsoever, including explosion, self-ignition and lightning; also while being transported in any conveyance by land or water, against loss or damage caused by stranding, sinking, collision, burning or derailment of such conveyance; also against general average and salvage charges for which the assured is legally liable; and\nArt. 2. Against loss or damage by burglary, pilferage or theft of automobile or accessories or spare parts in or on same belonging to assured and described in said declaration, by persons not in the employment, service or household of the assured, excluding, however, other than in case of total loss of the automobile described herein, the theft, robbery or pilferage of tools and repair equipment.\nAmong the conditions to which the policy is expressly declared to be subject is Condition \u201cK,\u201d in these words:\u2014\nIt is a condition of this policy that the automobile hereby insured shall not be used for carrying passengers for compensation, nor rented, nor leased, nor operated in any race or speed contest during the term of this policy, unless assented to by the company in writing.\nWhether this condition is operative as part of the contract is the important question on the appeal, and strictly it turns upon the view to be taken of section 194 of the Ontario Insurance Act. If that section applies to this contract, as it does ex facie, then condition \u201cK\u201d is not operative as part of the insurance contract. On the contrary, if that section has no application to this contract in so far forth as the contract creates an obligation on the part of the company to indemnify the respondent in respect of loss arising from the perils insured against other than fire\u2014from theft, to be precise\u2014then effect must be given to the condition in accordance with its terms.\nThe introductory words of section 194 are these:\nThe conditions set forth in this section shall as against the insurer be deemed to be part of every contract in force in Ontario with respect to any property therein or in transit therefrom or thereto, and shall be printed on every policy with the heading Statutory Conditions, and no stipulation to the contrary, or providing for any variation, addition or omission, shall be binding on the assured unless evidenced in the manner prescribed by sections 195 and 196;\nand it will be observed that the section by its express terms applies to \u201cevery contract in force in Ontario,\u201d which prima facie means every contract of insurance. Prima facie, therefore, the policy under consideration comes within the sweep of this enactment, and the rights of the parties must be governed by the enactment, unless there be something in the section itself\u2014that is to say in the Statutory Conditions, which are set out as part of the section\u2014or in the context, pointing to a different conclusion.\nAs to the context, section 194 is one of a group of sections, beginning with section 191, which are all brought together under the heading, \u201cContracts of Fire Insurance\u201d; and sections 191, 192 and 193, by their terms or by necessary implication, are limited in their application to fire insurance. Moreover, the plan of bringing together provisions relating to a particular class of insurance in a group under an appropriate heading seems to have been contemplated by the authors of the Act, although in practice this plan does not appear to have been carried out with any great exactitude. Compare, for example, section 154 with section 159. As to the Statutory Conditions, the terms of them, no doubt, do suggest in a pointed way that they are framed as stipulations of a contract which is, in part at least, a contract of fire insurance.\nThe position of section 194 as part of a group of sections labelled \u201cContracts of Fire Insurance,\u201d the character of the provisions with which this section is grouped, as well as the terms of some of the Statutory Conditions, afford some grounds for reading section 194 as relating exclusively to contracts of fire insurance in the sense of contracts providing for indemnity against loss arising from fire, as defined by the conditions.\nWhen the history of the legislation, however, is considered, these considerations appear to lose much of their force. In the Revised Statutes of 1897 the section corresponding to the present section 194 was numbered 168, and the operation of that section was limited in express terms to contracts of the insurance. Section 168 read: \u201cThe conditions set forth * * * shall * * * be deemed to be part of every contract of fire insurance in force in Ontario.\u201d In 1914, the words, \u201cof fire insurance,\u201d were struck out. This change of language cannot be disregarded as without significance, but still more significant are the changes in the Statutory Conditions themselves.\nBy Condition 13, as it appears in section 168, R.S.C. 1897, it was stipulated that the assured with his proofs of loss should furnish a statutory declaration declaring, among other things,\nwhen and how the fire originated, so far as the declarant knows or believes, (and) that the fire was not caused through his wilful act or neglect.\nIn the revision of 1914, the corresponding condition is numbered 18, and there the paragraphs prescribing the contents of the statutory declaration in relation to the matters dealt with by the paragraphs just quoted from the Act of 1897 assume a different form. They read thus:\nWhen and how the loss occurred, and if caused by fire, how the fire originated, (and) that the loss did not occur, or if caused by fire, that the fire was not caused through any wilful act or neglect * * * of the assured.\nThese changes, first in the form of the enactment prescribing the Statutory Conditions (section 194), and then in the form of the conditions themselves, seem to imply a deliberate intention that the operation of the enactment shall not be limited to policies of insurance in which fire, as defined by the conditions, is the only peril insured against. It is not necessary to pass upon the question now whether or not section 194 applies to policies of insurance in which loss by fire is not one of the subjects of indemnity. As already indicated, arguments of some plausibility may be derived from the conditions themselves in opposition to that view; but I see no reason to doubt that section 194 in its present form does contemplate the application of the conditions to policies of insurance in which the perils insured against are not limited exclusively to fire, and in which there is a single, indivisible contract of indemnity in consideration of the payment of a single premium. That appears to be the view of the Court of Appeal as expressed in Rockmaker v. Motor Union Ins. Co.[5], and I think on the whole it is the preferable view. The contract of insurance in question being governed by section 194, it follows that section 195 applies also, and that Condition \u201cK,\u201d not being evidenced in the manner thereby prescribed, is not operative as part of the contract. Mr. Fraser argued that the policy was a policy containing several contracts of insurance; in other words, that the contract of insurance against loss by theft is severable from the contract providing for indemnity for loss by fire. I cannot agree with that view. The so-called application upon which Mr. Fraser relies\u2014it is described on its face as a Daily Report\u2014does, it is true, profess to apportion the total premium, ascribing to part the office of premium for fire insurance and to the remainder that of premium for theft insurance; but the evidence is conclusive that the assured had nothing to do with this so-called application, which he never saw, of the contents of which he was ignorant, and which he did not in any way authorize. The evidence of the responsible agent, Mr. Morton, leaves no doubt upon the point.\nTwo questions remain: The first arises from the contention of the appellant that the first statutory condition was violated in the statement of the assured that the automobile had been \u201cfully paid for by the assured.\u201d It appears that at the time the policy was issued the vendor of the automobile, from whom the respondent purchased it, held the respondent\u2019s promissory note, which had been given in part payment of the purchase money. In the autumn of 1921 the obligation under this note was discharged by payment. In these circumstances it cannot be seriously disputed that the statement of fact attributed to the respondent was strictly correct. Marreco v. Richardson[6]; Hadley v. Hadley[7]. The appellants argue, however, that the respondent\u2019s representation ought to be construed in a popular sense and given a larger meaning than the words themselves strictly express. I can see no justification for this. The appellants must establish their case. They do not prove a misdescription under the first condition by giving evidence of a representation which, strictly and accurately construed, is no misdescription. The appellants further suggest that there was within the meaning of the first condition an omission to communicate a circumstance material to the risk, the circumstance being that the automobile, though fully paid for, had been in part paid for by a promissory note, which was still current. This contention must also be rejected. The respondent\u2019s statement was elicited by a question put by the appellants\u2019 agent. The question was fully answered: it was answered correctly. If the mode of payment\u2014in cash or by promissory note\u2014had been regarded by the company as material to the risk, we may fairly assume that a further question would have been directed to the elucidation of that point. In the absence of any such inquiry, I think the circumstance relied upon must be treated as immaterial.\nThe other point arises out of a contention based upon the second of the Statutory Conditions, which provides that any\nchange material to the risk within the control or knowledge of the assured shall avoid the policy as to the part affected thereby.\nThere was, it is said, a breach of this condition in the fact that the respondent, as it is alleged, used his automobile on one or two occasions during the currency of the policy for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire; and in support of their contention the appellants rely upon a statement in the policy that\nthe uses to which the automobile described are and will be put are private and business calls, excluding commercial delivery.\nThe requirements of section 195 not having been complied with, this statement cannot take effect as an addition to or variation of the Statutory Conditions; and assuming that as against the assured this must be taken as a correct description of the uses to which the automobile was put at the date of the policy, and assuming further that the adoption of a new practice in this respect might be a \u201cchange material to the risk\u201d within the second Statutory Condition, the appellants must fail on this point, for the reason that there is no evidence of any such change of practice as could fairly be held to fall within the words of the condition.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.M.

Section 7 of the War Measures Act does not create a liability but only provides a mode of ascertaining the amount of compensation when the right to receive it is admitted.\nHeld, per Idington J., that the court or judge to which a claim is referred is curia designata whose decision is final.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing the appellants' claim.\nIn 1916 the appellant company chartered the SS. G. R. Crowe from the owners for a period of five years and used it in their business for a few months when it was requisitioned by the Dominion Government for the use of the British Admiralty. In 1919 the ship was returned to the owners who received compensation from the respondent. The appellant claimed to be entitled to compensation also and its claim was referred to the Exchequer Court under the provisions of section 7 of the War Measures Act, 1914. The two questions raised on this appeal was, as stated in the head-note, first, was there a demise of the ship, and secondly, if not could the charterers claim compensation? The first depends on the terms of the charter party, the material provisions of which will be found in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff and need not be stated here. The second is a question of the law of shipping.\nBelcourt K.C. for the appellant. The provisions of the charter party clearly indicate a demise of the ship which was under the absolute control of the charterers and the captain and crew subject to their orders only. See Baumwoll v. Furness[2], Scrutton on charter parties (9 ed.), pages 4 and 5.\nThe master was manifestly the servant of the charterers. Admiralty Commissioners v. Page[3].\nThe appellant was deprived of the use of the ship from the date of the requisition by the Crown and is entitled to recompense therefor and for the higher prices paid to replace it. Gaston Williams v. The King[4].\nNewcombe K.C. and J. Philip Bill for the respondent. The Government of Canada is under no responsibility for compensation in respect to the G. R. Crowe which was requisitioned on behalf and for the use of the British Admiralty which caused it to be employed all the time until its restoration to the owners. Moreover, compensation is not to be made as a matter of course in every case but has to be agreed upon.\nThis claim is not within the meaning of section 7 of the War Measures Act and the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction.\nThe charter party does not effect a demise of the ship and the charterer has no claim for loss of contractual rights. See Omoa & Cleland Iron Co. v. Huntley[5].\nBelcourt K.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C. and J. Philip Bill for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Duff I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Audette of the Exchequer Court upon a reference to that court under section 7 of the War Measures Act, 1914. I am inclined to hold that the peculiar order of reference in question does not permit of any right to appeal from said judgment to this court.\nCertainly the rights of appeal given by the Exchequer Court Act do not apply hereto.\nThe reference does not profess to be made under the Exchequer Court Act and, therefore, its ordinary jurisdiction cannot be relied upon.\nThe words with which said section 7 of the War Measures Act, 1914, end, are\nthe claim shall be referred by the Minister of Justice to the Exchequer Court or to a superior or county court of the province within which the claim arises or to a judge of any such court.\nCould it for a moment be contended that if the reference had been made to any of the judges of the said courts that an appeal would lie, by either party, from his disposition of the claim? I submit not.\nAnd I cannot think that any more extensive rights, in way of appeal, were conferred upon either party in the event of the Exchequer Court being selected.\nThe said section simply enumerated a number of possible authorities from whom a curia designata might be selected to finally dispose of the question of right to any damages and, if any, determine the measure thereof.\nThe cases of Gosnell v. Minister of Mines and Wigle v. The Corporation of the Township of Gosfield[6], seem to me to dispose of the question of jurisdiction.\nBut fortunately after hearing a very elaborate argument on the merits of this case and considering same, I have come to the conclusion for the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge, with which I quite agree, that his judgment is right and is well supported by many other decisions than those he relies upon cited to us herein and hence that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court in which that court purported to exercise the jurisdiction given by section 7 of the War Measures Act. The Minister of Justice in the reference reserved the right to deny the existence of any legal right or title to compensation and to assert the absence of jurisdiction in the Exchequer Court to take cognizance of the claim and his own authority to refer the claim for adjudication.\nIn this court Mr. Newcombe advanced the further contention that section 7 of the War Measures Act contemplates a determination by the court to which the claim is referred that is to be final and non-appealable.\nThe questions raised by these exceptions are questions of some little difficulty, and as I have come to a clear opinion upon the merits of the claim advanced by the appellant I do not propose to consider them. The points of controversy divide themselves into two. The first of these is the question whether by the charter party of the 16th of May, 1916, the appellants acquired possession of the tank steamer G. R. Crowe.\nThe question whether a charter party operates as a demise of the ship is one which is to be determined by the construction of the terms of the charter party. As a rule and for the purposes of this case the question may be put in the terms in which it is stated by Mr. Carver, p. 173 of his book on \"Carriage by Sea\":\nOn each charter party the question is who, on the whole instrument taken together, was intended to have the possession of and to work the vessel? Whose servants were those in charge of her to be? Where they are the shipowner's, then generally he acts as a carrier of goods for the charterer; while if they are to be servants of the charterer, the shipowner generally ceases to be a carrier and the contract is really one of hiring.\nThe distinction, so far as pertinent, between a charter which effects a demise and one that does not is very lucidly stated in the judgment of Cockburn C.J., speaking on behalf of the Court of Queen's Bench in Sandeman v. Scurr[7], in these words:\u2014\nIn the first case (that in which a demise is created) the charterer becomes for the time the owner of the vessel; the master and crew become to all intents and purposes his servants, and through them the possession of the ship is in him. In the second (that in which no demise is created) notwithstanding the temporary right of the charterer to have his goods loaded and conveyed in the vessel, the ownership remains in the original owners and through the master and the crew, who continue to be their servants, the possession of the ship also.\nIn Baumwoll Manufactur v. Furness[8], Lord Herschell, at pp. 14 and 18, uses language of much the same purport. Where there is no demise, he says, the master and crew remain truly the servants of the owner, and where there is a demise, or where there is the equivalent of a demise, the vessel is put altogether out of the power and control of the then owners, power and control over her being vested in the charterers, so that during the period of the hiring she must be regarded as the vessel of the charterers and not the vessel of the owners. In Manchester Trust v. Furness[9], the test laid down by Lord Herschell was adopted and applied by the Court of Appeal; and in the course of his judgment Lindley L.J., uses the following language at p. 546:\u2014\nAlthough there is a great difficulty in reconciling all the earlier cases about demises of ships and so on, the test in each case is that which was applied by the House of Lords in the case of Baumwoll Manufactur v. Furness[10]\u2014Whose servant is the master?\nMr. Belcourt mainly relies upon three paragraphs in the charter: The first paragraph, in which the owner \"agrees to let,\" and the charterer \"agrees to hire,\" for a period commencing from the date of \"the delivery of the steamer,\" and it is provided that the steamer \"is to be delivered by the owner\" at Montreal on the date mentioned; paragraph 8, which provides that the captain, although appointed by the owner, shall be under the orders and direction of the charterers as respects employment agency or other arrangements; as well as par. 20, which explicitly gives the charterer the option of \"subletting\" the steamer. If these phrases in the first and twentieth paragraphs were the only significant phrases of the charter, they would, no doubt, lend a great deal of force to the argument. The authorities shew, however, that the use of such words is far from decisive. Such phrases as \"let\" and \"deliver,\" it is pointed out, in Scrutton and Mackinnon on Charter Parties, at p. 5 (Note U), are due to the \"influence of the older system of demise.\" Such words must yield to the intention of the parties to be gathered from the instrument as a whole. Omao v. Huntley[11]; Manchester Trust v. Furness9; Weir v. Union S.S. Co. (6). It is to be noticed that by clause 8, upon which Mr. Belcourt relies, the control of navigation is retained by the owners, a circumstance noted in the last case mentioned, as indicating that responsibility for the safe navigation of the vessel was still to rest upon the owners. It is to be noticed, too, that by clause 2, the owners are to provide and pay the wages of the captain, officers, engineers, firemen and crew; and by clause 10, if the charterers are dissatisfied with the conduct of the captain, officers or engineers, the owners engage to investigate any complaint, and if necessary make a change in the appointments. The appointment, that is to say, of the captain, officers and engineers, remains with the owners, together with the power of dismissal. There are, moreover, provisions of the charter party which would appear to be quite unnecessary if the charterers were to be in possession of the vessel through the captain and crew as their agents. By section 7, for example, the owners undertake that the captain shall prosecute his voyages with the utmost despatch, and render all possible assistance with the ship's crew and boats; and by article 9, the captain is to attend daily, if required by the officers of the charterers and their agents, to sign bills of lading, and the charterers agree to indemnify the owners from all consequences or liabilities that may arise from the captain signing bills of lading or other documents. The significance of such terms is adverted to in the judgment of Denman J., in Omoa v. Huntley[12]. The learned judge observes, referring to similar provisions, that\nthese provisions are quite inconsistent with the contention of the defendant that the navigation of the vessel was to be committed to the control of the plaintiffs; for if the master and crew had been their servants, these stipulations would have been useless.\nAnd lastly, there is the language of article 13, in which the master and mariner are explicitly designated as \"servants of the shipowners.\" These provisions all point to the conclusion that the instrument envisages the relation of the master and the crew to the owners as that of servant and master, while the rights of the charterers in respect to the conduct of the master and crew are treated as contractual rights arising from contractual stipulations with the owners.\nThe appellants therefore acquired under the charter contractual rights entitling them to have the ship employed for their benefit and according to their directions during the currency of the charter, but no possession of the ship and no interest in the ship as a thing.\nThe second question is whether, such being the character of the charter party, the appellants are entitled to compensation. Section 7 of the War Measures Act is in these words:\u2014\n7. Whenever any property or the use thereof has been appropriated by His Majesty under the provisions of this Act, or any order in council, order or regulation made thereunder, and compensation is to be made therefor and has not been agreed upon, the claim shall be referred by the Minister of Justice to the Exchequer Court or to a Superior or County Court of the province within which the claim arises, or to a judge of any such court.\nAssuming this section gives a right of compensation, it is a right of compensation where property or the use of property has been appropriated, and the compensation to be made is compensation for such appropriation. The effect of the requisition was undoubtedly to appropriate the use of the ship for the period during which the requisition was operative, with the consequence, assuming there was no suspension of the contractual rights aforesaid resulting from that exercise of sovereign authority, of depriving the appellants of the advantage of having the contractual obligations undertaken by the owners specifically executed. The question is: In such circumstances is the possessor of such rights entitled to compensation under section 7? I think Mr. Newcombe's contention is well founded, that such a case does not fall within the scope of that section. True, the section does not specify the conditions under which the right of compensation arises or the persons or classes of persons to whom it is given. Obviously, however, the enactment cannot be supposed to contemplate reparation in respect of pecuniary loss of every description which anybody may suffer in consequence of the fact that property or the use of it is appropriated for public purposes and thereby withdrawn from the power of its owner or possessor, who may in consequence be disabled from applying it in the fulfilment of contracts and other obligations arising out of his business or other private relations. I think the reasoning by which the courts have been constrained to hold that a wrongdoer, whose wrongful act causes damage to a chattel, is not answerable to everybody who indirectly may have suffered loss in consequence of that injury, is apposite.\nIt is worth while, perhaps, to refer to the authorities in some detail. There is the well-known judgment of Lord Blackburn (then Blackburn J.), in Cattle v. Stockton[13], in which the eminent judge had to deal with a claim by a contractor who had a contract for constructing certain works which had been delayed by an inundation in respect of which the defendants would be responsible to the owner of the land on the principle of Fletcher v. Rylands[14]. Blackburn J., having pointed out the consequences of admitting the validity of such claims, proceeded:\u2014\nIn the present case the objection is technical and against the merits, and we should be glad to avoid giving it effect. But if we did so we should establish an authority for saying that, in such a case as that of Fletcher v. Rylands[15] the defendant would be liable, not only to an action by the owner of the drowned mine, and by such of his workmen as had their tools or clothes destroyed, but also to an action by every workman and person employed in the mine, who in consequence of its stoppage made less wages than he would otherwise have done. And many similar cases to which this would apply might be suggested. It may be said that it is just that all such persons should have compensation for such a loss, and that, if the law does not give them redress, it is imperfect Perhaps it may be so. But, as was pointed out by Coleridge J. in Lumley v. Gye (3), courts of justice should not allow themselves, in the pursuit of perfectly complete remedies for all wrongful acts, to transgress the bounds, which our law, in a wise consciousness as I conceive of its limited powers, has imposed on itself of redressing only the proximate and direct consequences of wrongful acts. In this we quite agree. No authority in favour of the plaintiff's right to sue was cited, and, as far as our knowledge goes, there was none that could have been cited.\nThen there is the passage in the judgment of Lord Penzance in Simpson v. Thomson[16], beginning at p. 289:\u2014\nThe principle involved seems to me to be this\u2014that where damage is done by a wrongdoer to a chattel not only the owner of that chattel, but all those who by contract with the owner have bound themselves to obligations which are rendered more onerous, or have secured to themselves advantages which are rendered less beneficial by the damages done to the chattel, have a right of action against the wrongdoer although they have no immediate or reversionary property in the chattel, and no possessory right by reason of any contract attaching to the chattel itself, such as by lien or hypothecation. This, I say, is the principle involved in the respondents' contention. If it be a sound one, it would seem to follow that if, by the negligence of a wrongdoer, goods are destroyed which the owner of them had bound himself to supply to a third person, this person as well as the owner has a right of action for any loss inflicted on him by their destruction.\nBut if this be true as to injuries done to chattels, it would seem to be equally so as to injuries to the person. An individual injured by a negligently driven carriage has an action against the owner of it. Would a doctor, it may be asked, who had contracted to attend him and provide medicines for a fixed sum by the year, also have a right of action in respect of the additional cost of attendance and medicine cast upon him by that accident? And yet it cannot be denied that the doctor had an interest in his patient's safety. In like manner an actor or singer bound for a term to a manager of a theatre is disabled by the wrongful act of a third person to the serious loss of the manager. Can the manager recover damages for that loss from the wrongdoer? Such instances might be indefinitely multiplied, giving rise to rights of action which in modern communities, where every complexity of mutual relation is daily created by contract, might be both numerous and novel.\nThe reasoning of these passages was applied by Lord Sumner (then Hamilton J.), in Remorquage v. Bennetts[17], in which he held that the owner of a tug was not entitled to sue a wrongdoer who had sunk his tow, although thereby he lost the benefit of his contract of towage; and the principle was acted upon by Scrutton L.J., in Elliott v. The Shipping Controller[18], where he held that a charterer, under a charter not creating a demise of the ship, would have had no right of action at common law against a person depriving him of the opportunity of earning profits through the exercise of his contractual rights by taking away the ship which was the subject of the charter. The judgment of the majority, who held that the plaintiff under the statutory provisions governing the case was entitled to compensation, is not in conflict with this view. In McColl v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[19], the same principle was followed in the construction of section 385 of the Railway Act, 9-10 Geo. V, c. 68, which imposes upon railway companies acting contrary to orders of the Railway Board,\nliability to any person injured * * * for the full amount of the damages sustained thereby.\nThe phrase \"person injured\" was there held, on the same reasoning, not to include persons who are injured in their pecuniary interests only by reason of being deprived of advantages which they might reasonably have expected to enjoy if the person directly injured had not thereby been disabled from performing his contractual obligations or carrying out his business or professional engagements or making provision in the usual way for his family.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I have had the advantage of fully considering the carefully prepared reasons for judgment of my brother Duff and I entirely concur therein.\nThat the charter party relied on by the appellant was not a demise of the ship is made clear by the provisions whereby it was agreed that the owners should pay the wages of the captain, officers, engineers, firemen and crew, and that if the charterers were dissatisfied with the conduct of the captain, officers, or engineers, the owners would investigate the complaint, and if necessary make a change in the appointments. This shews that during the charter party, the captain, officers and crew were to be the servants of the shipowner and not of the charterer. They were appointed by the former and could not be dismissed by the latter. The right of the charterer was a mere contractual one, and notwithstanding the use of the terms \"let\" and \"hire\" as applied to the ship, the whole instrument indicates that the agreement of the shipowner was to navigate his ship for the benefit of the charterer, and for the carriage of his goods. The owner therefore retained the possession of the ship during the life of the charter party.\nIf the special provisions of the War Measures Act, 1914, sections 6 and 7 of which were relied on by Mr. Belcourt, give to the owner of property a right of action for compensation against the Crown for the appropriation of such property or of the use thereof\u2014a point which it is unnecessary to determine in this case\u2014they certainly do not give an action to a person, not the owner, who may suffer damage merely by reason of a contract which he has made with the owner. Section 7 deals with the case where compensation is to be made but the amount has not been agreed upon. It does not create the right to compensation but provides a mode whereby the amount, where the right to compensation is admitted, may be determined. Otherwise, the imperative provision, requiring the Minister of Justice to refer the claim to the Exchequer Court or to a Superior or County Court, would not be easily comprehensible. Such a requirement, on the contrary, is quite conceivable where the Crown admits that the claimant is entitled to compensation but disputes the amount of his claim.\nThese are really the two vital questions in the case, and as to both I find myself unable to accept Mr. Belcourt's contentions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMalouin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Belcourt, Leduc & Genest.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court (1) and maintaining the respondent's opposition to a seizure of immovables made by the appellant.\nThe respondent, in 1911, obtained from the town of Maisonneuve, then a suburb of Montreal and now a part of the city, a ten years' exemption from taxation for a manufactory which he proposed to establish therein. After being granted this exemption, he fulfilled all its conditions, and as between the town of Maisonneuve and himself the alleged contract was faithfully observed. But the city of Montreal, having in 1918 annexed the town of Maisonneuve, disputed the legality of this exemption, which, at the time the proceedings were initiated, had almost run out. There were, however, some years of taxation unpaid since the date of the annexation, and it is as to this liability that the contest arose. The trial judge decided the case in favour of the city, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of King's Bench, Mr. Justice Rivard dissenting. The city now appeals.\nThe exemption was granted in April, 1911, by a mere resolution adopted by the town council. It is urged that a by-law was necessary and further that such a by-law required the approval of the municipal electors who were proprietors.\nLaurendeau K.C. and Parent for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. and J albert K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014Having, after I had perused and considered the several judgments of the respective judges in the courts below, availed myself of the opportunity of perusing the judgment of my brother Mignault, I have come to the conclusion that the reasoning adopted by him is correct and, agreeing therewith, I think this appeal should be allowed with costs herein and in the court appealed from, and the formal judgment of the Superior Court be restored. Duff J. (dissenting) \u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench reversing a judgment of Mr. Justice Mercier. The point in controversy concerns the validity of a resolution of the town of Maisonneuve of the 19th April, 1911, purporting to exempt from taxes for ten years the property of the Dominion Die Company on certain specified conditions. \"The Dominion Die Company\" was a trade name under which the respondent carried on business, in which he alone was interested. At the time of the passing of the resolution the respondent was not carrying on any business in Maisonneuve. The sole question for consideration on the appeal is the validity of the resolution mentioned.\nMaisonneuve, by 8 Geo. V, c. 84, was annexed to Montreal, but by paragraph (b) of section 1 of that statute it was provided that the resolutions of the annexed municipality should remain in force, notwithstanding the annexation. It is admitted that the resolution in dispute was, down to the time of the annexation, recognized as valid by Maisonneuve. The charter of the town was consolidated in 1898, previous to the granting of the exemption, by 61 Vict., c. 57, and subject to special provisions of the charter the municipality came under the operation of the \"Cities and Towns Act.\"\nThe respondent invokes in support of the resolution sections 4559, 4642 and 4643, R.S.Q., 1888. On behalf of the appellant municipality it is contended that the first mentioned section authorizes exemptions only in favour of persons who at the time of the passing of the resolution are carrying on the industry, trade or enterprise in respect of which the exemption or commutation authorized by the section is granted; and as regards the two last mentioned of these sections, it is said that by force of other enactments of the Revised Statutes, and especially of sections 4404 and 4406, the exemption thereby authorized can only be effectively granted after the submission to the ratepayers of a by-law creating such exemption; and subsidiarily, that by the express terms of sections 4642 and 4643, the exemption must be embodied in a by-law which before the passing of it has been twice considered at separate meetings of the council The attempt, it is therefore argued, to execute the power given by these two sections by a simple resolution was merely inoperative.\nThe language of section 4559, read without reference to other provisions of the Revised Statutes, seems to be sufficiently clear; the relevant paragraph is in these words:\n4559. The council may, by a resolution exempt from the payment of municipal taxes, for a period not exceeding twenty years, any person who carries on any industry, trade or enterprise whatsoever, as well as the land used for such industry, trade or enterprise.\nThe adjectival clauses,\nwho carries on any industry, trade or enterprise whatsoever\nand\nused for such industry, trade or enterprise,\ncontemplate the state of affairs to exist during the currency of the exemption granted, and import the conditions upon which the grantee is to be relieved from taxation, which relief is to be operative, obviously, only while the conditions are fulfilled.\nThat is the natural reading of the language, which is not ambiguous, and the authority conferred seems to be exerciseable in favour of persons who are about to establish a business or industry, as well as in favour of those who are carrying on an established one. The distinction now made between established industries and industries to be established is not to be found in the language which the legislature has employed in this section to express its meaning.\nThe appellant municipality advances the view that notwithstanding the language of section 4559, an inference is to be drawn from sections 4404 and 4642 making this construction of section 4559 inadmissible. When these sections are read together, the legislative policy said to be revealed is that two separate and mutually exclusive systems of relief from taxation are to be in operation side by side, the one system being operative for the benefit of newly established industries, and the other for the benefit of existing industries alone.\nFor the purpose of examining this argument it is more convenient, I think, to deal with these sections historically; and it is well to observe at the outset that it is of cardinal importance to notice that the statute bringing in force the Revised Statutes of 1888 contains this clause (50 Vict., c. 5): 8. The said Revised Statutes shall not be held to operate as new law, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said acts and parts of acts so repealed, and for which the said Revised Statutes are substituted.\nSections 4559 and 4642 were both originally enacted in the year 1870: they are found in separate statutes. Section 4559 reproduces in slightly modified form (and with an extension of the period of exemption from five to twenty years) section 943 of c. 68 of the statutes of that year, which brought into force for the first time the Municipal Code of the province. Section 943 applies to local municipalities, and local municipalities include parishes, villages, and towns to which the Municipal Code applies; that is to say, towns not incorporated by special charter. Towns so incorporated, and all cities, are excluded from the ambit of the code. The code is what its name imports a code of the laws governing the municipalities, as municipalities, to which the enactment applies. Effect must therefore be given to the enactments of section 943 according to their terms, in the absence of any qualifying context in the provisions of the code itself and of any clearly expressed overriding enactment to be found elsewhere. Section 943, in so far as material, is in these words:\n943. The council of every local municipality may, by a resolution, exempt from the payment of municipal taxes, for a period not exceeding five years, any person who carries on any business, trade or mining or manufacturing enterprise whatsoever, as well as the land used for such enterprise * * *.\nThere is nothing in the code itself which is referred to as a qualifying context, and there can, I think, be little room for controversy that this provision, considered in itself, was sufficient to authorize (for the period of five years) such an exemption as was granted to the respondent by the town of Maisonneuve.\nIn the same year the statute was passed which appears later as sections 4642 and 4643 R.S.Q., 1888. That enactment was entitled, \"An Act to encourage the introduction and establishment of new manufactories in the province.\" It was stated in the recitals that the introduction and establishment of such manufactories would tend to develop the productive resources of the province and increase its prosperity; and the enactment proceeded to authorize municipal corporations, including cities, towns and villages, to grant exemptions for ten years from taxation. The contention advanced on behalf of the appellant is that the enactment of this legislation involved by necessary implication a qualification of the language of section 943 of the Municipal Code enacted in the same year, by which section 943 was restricted in its scope to businesses, trades and enterprises already existing at the time of the passing of the resolution.\nSection 943 and chapter 18 are, it is said, complementary enactments; the one providing for the exemption of industries to be established, and the other for the exemption of something already established.\nThis argument fails when the two enactments, in point of scope and practical effect, are considered and compared. The Municipal Code applies to townships, villages and towns not incorporated by special charter; while chapter 18 applies to all cities and all towns, as well as to villages. The Municipal Code authorizes exemptions for five years; chapter 18 authorizes exemptions for ten years. Chapter 18, moreover, by section 3, makes special provision for granting exemptions to established industries, indicating, and this was probably the fact, that the municipalities which were considered most likely to avail themselves of its provisions were municipalities of a class to which the Municipal Code did not apply; that is to say, cities and towns incorporated by special Act. To all this may be added a distinction of great significance, which seems to have been overlooked in the argument on behalf of the appellant, that chapter 18 authorizes the exemption of manufactories only, while under the provisions of the Municipal Code the exemptions granted may affect any business, trade or mining or manufacturing enterprise.\nIt is indeed difficult to perceive any good reason for ascribing to the legislature by a non-natural reading of the words of section 943 the intention to limit the operation of that section to businesses and enterprises already established and to exclude from its ambit those to be established in the future. As already observed, chapter 18 authorizes the exemption of manufactories only, and on the construction contended for, no business, trade or enterprise not a manufactory could be exempted by any municipality, unless it was already established at the time of the passing of the resolution creating the exemption. If exemption of such establishments was to be permitted, it seems singular, to say the least, that a municipality should be disabled from creating an exemption for the purpose of encouraging new trades and industries as well as assisting those already in operation; and I can think of no justification for departing from the normal reading of section 943 for the purpose of giving it such effect.\nIt is difficult to think of any definite policy in relation to manufactories which could be supposed to have inspired the enactments of c. 18 as well as that of section 943 of the Municipal Code; in truth we seem to have here two independent chapters of legislation which accidentally overlap, an occurrence neither startling nor uncommon.\nThe next stage in the history of the legislation is the enactment in 1876 of the \"Town Corporations General Clauses Act,\" which was chapter 29 of the statutes of that year, 40 Vict. By sections 1 and 2, the provisions of that Act were made applicable to every town corporation or municipality to be thereafter established by the legislature of the province; and it was declared that they should constitute part of the special Act unless expressly excluded by the terms of that Act. By section 366 of the Act of 1876 the provision of section 943, slightly changed (but ipsissimis verbis in so far as pertinent to the questions in controversy on this appeal), was re-enacted, the changes being that for \"business, trade, mining or manufacturing enterprise,\" were substituted \"industry, trade or enterprise,\" and the period of five years was replaced by twenty years. Here, again, it is to be observed that this statute of 1876 is in form and effect a municipal code for the municipalities governed by it; and prima facie its provisions are to take effect according to the proper construction of the words in which they are expressed, read in light of other parts of the code and without regard to the provisions of other statutes. This statute contains nothing which qualifies the language of section 366.\nThe next stage in the progress of the law is marked by the enactment of the Revised Statutes of Quebec of 1888, in which the provisions under discussion are, as already mentioned, reproduced, section 366 of the Act of 1876 appearing as section 4559 and c. 18 of 1870 as sections 4642 and 4643; and in construing them they are, by the express direction quoted above, to be read precisely as they should have been read before they were brought into the revision.\nThe next step, and it is one of very considerable importance, is a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench affirming the decision of the Circuit Court in 1890, in Chambly v. Lamoureux[2]. The controversy arose in respect of a resolution passed by the council of the appellant municipality on the 3rd January, 1881. The resolution is expressed to be in conformity with section 943 of the Municipal Code, and it provides that one Samuel T. Willett should be exempt for a period of twenty years on his new factory and outbuildings, and then proceeded to grant a general exemption, not only to Willett and his legal representatives, but to others, on \"all buildings to be erected\" within the limits of the municipality, for the purpose of industry or trade, and for the land used for such purposes; the exemption to be granted from the date the factory and outbuildings should be put into operation. The defendants, who were sued for taxes, had after the passing of the resolution established and put into operation a brewery, and in respect of this brewery they claimed exemption under the terms of the resolution. Taschereau J., in the Circuit Court, held that the exemption was not ultra vires. The municipality appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, and the argument as reported is in substance the same as the argument addressed to us on this appeal, with the additional contention that the resolution, in so far as it purported to grant a general exemption to persons establishing industries after the passing of the resolution, was beyond the intendment of section 943, which had contemplated not a general regulation on the subject, but resolutions dealing with particular cases. This argument was rejected and the judgment of the Circuit Court was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The decision of the Court of Queen's Bench is necessarily a decision on the points raised on behalf of the appellant municipality which, as I have already said, were in substance points now urged in criticism of the judgment appealed from. There can be no doubt that the Court of Queen's Bench (Dorion C.J., Tessier, Cross, Boss\u00e9, Doherty JJ.) dealt with the merits of the question of the validity of the resolution, although according to the report an argument seems to have been advanced on behalf of the respondent touching the competency of the appeal. This is made quite plain by the formal judgment, a certified copy of which has been furnished us.\nBy the judgment of the Circuit Court it was, as I have mentioned, formally declared that\nle dit r\u00e8glement n'est pas ultra vires;\nand the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is in these words:\nLa cour, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, par leurs avocats, sur le m\u00e9rite, examin\u00e9 le dossier de la proc\u00e9dure en cour de premi\u00e8re instance, le requ\u00eate d'appel et sur le tout m\u00fbrement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9: Consid\u00e9rant qu'il n'y a pas mal jug\u00e9 dans le jugement rendu par la Cour de Circuit pour le Bas Canada, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le dix-huiti\u00e8me jour de f\u00e9vrier mil huit cent quatre-vingt-neuf et dont est appel, confirme le dit jugement avec d\u00e9pens contre l'appelante en faveur des dits intim\u00e9s.\nThe series of reports in which this case is reported was edited by Mr. Justice Mathieu of the Superior Court, and the case itself is cited in that learned judge's edition of the Municipal Code published in 1894, in these terms:\nUne corporation municipale peut, sous les dispositions de cet article, exempter des taxes municipales, non seulement les manufactures sp\u00e9cialement mentionn\u00e9es dans une resolution pass\u00e9e \u00e0 cet effet, mais encore toutes les industries nouvelles, qui s'\u00e9tabliront \u00e0 l'avenir dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9, et cette exemption comprend les taxes sp\u00e9ciales impos\u00e9es pour aider \u00e0 la construction d'un chemin de fer. (La corporation de village du canton de Chambly et Lamoureux et al, C.B.R., Montreal, 23 mai 1890, Dorion J. en C. Tessier J., Cross J., Boss\u00e9 J., et Doherty J., confirmant le jugement de C.S., Montreal, 18 f\u00e9vrier, 1889, Taschereau J., 19 R.L., p. 312.)\nIn 1898 the decision is cited by Mr. B\u00e9dard K.C., in the first edition of his book on the Municipal Code published in that year, and again in the second edition, published in 1905, as authority for the same proposition. The Municipal Code continued unamended in this respect down to 1916, when it was re-enacted in amended form, and the authority to grant exemptions of every description was abrogated. The next step to be noticed is the re-enactment of the \"Towns Corporations Act,\" in 1909. Section 4559 of the revision of 1888 is reproduced as section 5775, which is in form identical with the earlier section except in this, that it is expressed to be subject to sections 5929 and following. Now it is important to observe that section 5929 deals with bonuses to manufactories to be established, as distinguished from manufactories already established. As the distinction seems to be clearly drawn throughout these statutes between exemption from taxation and bonuses, although in effect exemption from taxation is necessarily a subsidy, it is difficult to say what application these sections can have to the subject dealt with by section 5775. The reference to section 5929, however, which deals only with industries to be established, certainly gives no countenance to the construction contended for on behalf of the appellant municipality. Subject to that, the legislation is re-enacted in the form in which it appeared in the \"Towns Corporations Act\" of 1876, and in substance in the same words as those which were the subject of the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in Chambly v. Lamoureux[3].\nThe authority of decided cases, it is needless to say, in the province of Quebec stands upon a footing which is not the same as that upon which it is based in the law of England. Nevertheless, the central idea of stare decisis has not often been better expressed than in the sentence of Paul:\nMinime sunt mutanda ea quae interpretationem certam semper habuerunt. D. 1.3.23;\nand the importance of adhering to an interpretation of a statute given in an authoritative decision which has been accepted for many years without challenge is recognized by writers on the French law; for example, 1 B.L., section 261. It is impossible to suppose that the legal advisers of municipalities governed by the \"Towns Act\" and of municipalities governed by the Municipal Code have not been familiar, since the appearance of the report, with the decision in Chambly v. Lamoureux3, or that they have failed to treat it as an authoritative exposition of section 943 in the sense ascribed to the decision by Mr. Justice Mathieu in the note quoted above; I cannot doubt that it must have been acted upon in this sense. Certainly the municipality of Maisonneuve assumed, in passing the resolution now in dispute, the existence of the authority under section 4559 which municipalities were held by the Court of Queen's Bench to possess under section 943 of the Municipal Code; and I cannot suppose that this was an isolated case. This, taken together with the circumstance that in 1909 section 4559 was re-enacted without material alteration in the Revised Statutes of that year, convinces me that the decision in 1890 is a decision which ought not now to be departed from, even if there were better reasons than have been adduced on this appeal for disagreeing with the decision in so far as it is relevant here.\nAs to section 4404, that section in the main is a reproduction of section 229 of the \"Towns Corporation General Clauses Act,\" 40 Vict., c. 29, which provided for aiding in certain ways, not including exemption from taxation, the construction of public works by incorporated companies and by the provincial government. Later this was amended by adding industrial undertakings to the enterprises to which aid might be granted under that section, but still authority was withheld to give aid in the form of exemption from taxation. It was not until the revision of 1888 that a sub-paragraph was added\u2014sub-paragraph (4)\u2014 which authorizes aid,\nby exemption from the payment of municipal taxes, assessments and dues, certain industrial establishments, according to the provisions of\nsection 4642 of the Revised Statutes and following. This reference, which was introduced into section 4404 by the revisers to the provisions of sections 4642 and following cannot legitimately be regarded as affecting the construction of section 4559 when the provision of the statute under which the revision took place is kept in view, which has already been referred to, that the Revised Statutes\nshall not be held to operate as new law, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law\nin the statutes for which the Revised Statutes are substituted.\nCounsel for the respondent also supports the resolution under the authority of section 4642. Two answers to this contention are put forward: First, it is said that by force of section 4643 an exemption under section 4642 can only take effect when embodied in a by-law passed after consideration at two meetings of the council; and second, it is said that by force of section 4406 the by-law is inoperative unless sanctioned by the approval of a vote of ratepayers. The first of these answers is met by the respondent with a reference to section 65 of the Charter of Maisonneuve, 61 Viet., c. 57, which provides that except as regards bylaws other than those which must be submitted for the approval of the electors, the town council may exercise its powers by by-law or resolution. It is answered that this is a general provision, which can have no application to special powers given by special enactment, which in explicit terms require that they shall be exercised by by-law. Now it is to be noted that this provision does except the particular case of by-laws which must be submitted for the approval of the electors, an exception which, apart from special mention, would naturally be implied if any exception was to be implied; and I find it a little difficult, in face of this explicit exception, to imply an exception merely because it is required that a given power shall be exercised by a by-law passed after it has been considered at two separate meetings of the council. On the whole I think this objection fails.\nAs to the second objection, I am inclined to think it may fairly be affirmed that a by-law passed under the authority given by section 4642 is not a by-law passed in virtue of section 4404, and therefore that section 4406 does not apply to it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014Were it not for the rather unskillful draftsmanship of the Quebec Revised Statutes of 1888, this case would give rise to but little difficulty. But the compilers of the revision introduced therein overlapping and what at first sight might appear irreconcileable provisions, and the dispute between the parties is as to which set of enactments should be applied. In my consideration of this question, I have not been a little aided by the memorandum of statutes filed by the parties at our request.\nThe respondent, in 1911, obtained from the town of Maisonneuve, then a suburb of Montreal and now a part of the city, a ten years exemption from taxation for a manu- factory which he proposed to establish therein, employing sixty or seventy hands. After being granted this exemption, he fulfilled all its conditions, and as between the town and himself the alleged contract was faithfully observed. But the city of Montreal having, in 1918, annexed the town of Maisonneuve, and with it its many liabilities, disputes the legality of this exemption, which, at the time the proceedings were initiated, had almost run out. There were, however, some years of taxation unpaid since the date of the annexation, and it is as to this liability that the contest arose. The trial judge decided the case in favour of the city, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of King's Bench, Mr. Justice Rivard dissenting. The city now appeals.\nThe exemption was granted in April, 1911, by a mere resolution adopted by the town council. It is urged that a by-law was necessary and further that such a by-law required the approval of the municipal electors who were proprietors.\nWe have been referred to no less than three sets of enactments as to exemption from municipal taxation in the Revised Statutes of 1888 by which this case is governed.\nFirst there is article 4559, the first paragraph of which reads as follows:\nThe council may, by a resolution, exempt from the payment of municipal taxes, for a period not exceeding twenty years, any person who carries on any industry, trade or enterprise whatsoever, as well as the land used for such industry, trade or enterprise, or agree with such person for a fixed sum of money payable annually for any period not exceeding twenty years, in commutation of all municipal taxes.\nThis article allows the granting of the exemption by a resolution of the municipal council. It is, however, argued that it applies only to an existing industry, not to one to be established, and this is said to result from the words \"who carries on any industry,\" etc., in the French version \"qui exerce une industrie.\" As to new manufactories, it is contended, resort must be had to other provisions. This brings us to the second and third sets of enactments which must be considered together.\nTaking them in their order, I will first give the text of articles 4404, 4405 and 4406 of the same Revised Statutes. These sections are among those which deal with the powers of the town council exerciseable by by-law.\n4404. To aid in the construction of any bridge, causeway, pier, wharf, slide, macadamized or paved road, railroad, or other public works, or any manufacturing establishments situated in whole or in part within the municipality or in its vicinity, undertaken and built by any incorporated company, or by the Provincial Government:\n1. By taking and subscribing for shares in any company formed for such purpose;\n2. By giving or lending money to such company or to the Provincial Government;\n3. By guaranteeing by endorsation or otherwise any sum of money borrowed by such company;\n4. By exempting from the payment of municipal taxes, assessments and dues certain industrial establishments according to the provisions of section sixth of chapter second of this title.\n4405. To subscribe for or hold stock in any company formed for the purpose of constructing electric telegraph lines.\n4406. Every by-law, passed in virtue of the two preceding articles, before coming into force and effect, shall be approved by the electors of the municipality who are proprietors, in the manner prescribed in articles 4531 and following to article 4535 inclusively.\nThe reference in the last paragraph of article 4404 to \"section sixth of chapter second of this title\" brings us to the third set of enactments which we find in articles 4642 and 4643.\nThese latter articles, preceded by the title \"Exemption of new manufactories from municipal taxes,\" are as follows:\u2014\n4642. For the purpose of encouraging the introduction and establishment of new manufactories within their limits, it is lawful for any city, town, or village municipality to exempt from all taxes, assessments and municipal imposts whatsoever, for a space of time not exceeding ten years, any manufactory, not being a flour-mill, gas-works, or distillery, which any individual, commercial firm, or corporation may have undertaken, or may undertake to establish.\n2. Such exemption shall extend, not only to the buildings and grounds used by such manufactory, but also to all the moveables and machines employed in such manufactory, as well as to all articles manufactured therein.\n3. In any case in which the exemption from taxes as hereinabove mentioned, in favour of a new manufactory, would prejudice the interests of any manufactory already established, or would create an undue privilege against the latter, it shall be lawful for the municipal authorities to grant the same, or a proportionate exemption to every such pre-existing manufactory.\n4643. Any person, desiring to establish a manufactory as aforesaid, is obliged to ask the permission of the municipal council and state the nature of the manufacture, its locality, the extent of the intended site, and whether he intends to use steam power. Such permission shall not be given unless previous notice be given by the person applying therefor to the council, and the council may make a by-law for the purpose, which by-law must be brought before the council at two different meetings thereof, and when the by-law is agreed to, it shall be equivalent to a contract in favor of the proprietors of the manufactory therein mentioned, their heirs and assigns, for all the time specified in such resolution.\nThe first point to be considered in connection with all these enactments is the distinction between existing and new manufactories. It is argued that the language of article 4559 is wide enough to comprise both, but the special provisions of the second and third sets of enactments cannot be ignored, and both refer to industries to be established or new industries.\nTo test whether the distinction is a real one, it will be useful to consider the history of this legislation, and for this purpose the memorandum of statutes to which I have referred is most helpful.\nGoing back to the consolidated statutes of Lower Canada of 1860, chapter 24, section 57, we see that it was provided that the municipal council might by agreement\nwith any person carrying on, or proposing to undertake any mining or manufacturing business,\nwholly exempt any such business from assessment during a period of not more than five years.\nThe distinction between an existing and a proposed business is expressed here, but the same rule is applied to each. We will find however that, while maintaining this distinction, each class was afterwards differently dealt with. This brings us to the legislation adopted in 1870.\nIn that year, the legislature adopted, by chapter 68 of 34 Victoria, the municipal code of the province of Quebec which came into force by proclamation on the 2nd of November 1871. On the day it was sanctioned, 24th of December, 1870, Royal assent was given to the statute, 34 Victoria, chapter 18, intituled \"An Act to encourage the introduction and establishment of new manufactories in this province,\" and which in substance was to the same effect as articles 4642 and 4643 above quoted, the exemption period being also ten years.\nAnd article 943 of the municipal code adopted at the same session allowed the exemption from municipal taxes for a period not exceeding five years (subsequently extended to twenty years) of any person\nwho carries on any business, trade, or manufacturing enterprise what soever, etc.\nThe municipal code applied to all the territory of the province, excepting cities and towns incorporated by special statutes, and 34 Victoria, chapter 18, was made applicable to any incorporated city, town or village. It would, therefore, seem that at least as to the latter\u2014and it is not necessary to consider any other municipalities\u2014and as to the scope of article 943 of the municipal code, the distinction between existing and new enterprises was preserved, the exemption period however not being the same in both cases.\nWe now come to the enactment, in 1876, by 40 Victoria, c. 29, of the Town Corporations General Clauses Act.\nIn section 366 of this statute we find a provision to the same effect as article 943 of the municipal code, as amended.\nThe exemption period is twenty years, the mode of granting it is by a resolution and the exemption can be made in favour of\nany person who carries on any industry, trade, or enterprise whatsoever.\nThis section was included in the revision of 1888 as article 4559 above quoted.\nSection 229 of the same statute empowered the town corporation\nto aid in the construction of any bridge, causeway, pier, wharf, slide, macadamized or paved road, railroad or other public work situated in whole or in part within the municipality or in its vicinity, undertaken and built by any incorporated company, or by the provincial government:\u2014\n1. By taking and subscribing for shares in any company formed for such purpose;\n2. By giving or lending money to such company or to the provincial government;\n3. By guaranteeing by endorsation or otherwise any sum of money borrowed by such company.\nBy section 230 the council was authorized to subscribe for or hold stock in any company formed for the purpose of constructing electric telegraph lines.\nFinally section 231 provided that every by-law passed in virtue of the two preceding sections, before coming into force and effect, should be approved by the electors of the municipality who are proprietors in the manner prescribed in sections 356 and the following to section 360 inclusive.\nIn 1881, by 44-45 Victoria, chapter 20, section 229 was amended by adding after the words \"public work\" in the first paragraph the words \"or any manufacturing establishment.\"\nWith this amendment, the council could by by-law\u2014for section 229 was among the sections describing the powers of the council exerciseable by by-law (section 223)\u2014aid in the construction of any manufacturing establishment by the means enumerated in subparagraphs 1, 2 and 3 above mentioned.\nIt seems clear that to aid in the construction of any manufacturing establishment means to aid a new or not yet established industry, so that we find here the same distinction between existing and new establishments which is further emphasized by article 4642 cited above.\nWhen the revision of 1888 was effected, a new and fourth paragraph was added to section 229 which became article 4404 of the Revised Statutes. There was no warrant for this addition in previous legislation, and it is difficult to say why the Commissioners who prepared the revision inserted it here, for they had provided for the exemption from taxation in article 4559 and articles 4642 and 4643 of the revision, to the latter of which indeed they refer. This fourth paragraph, the principal cause of the controversy which has arisen in this case, reads as follows:\u2014\n4. By exempting from the payment of municipal taxes, assessments and dues certain industrial establishments, according to the provisions of section sixth of chapter second of this title.\nThe words I have italicized refer to articles 4642 and 4643, the text of which I have given above. It is to be remarked that under articles 4642 and 4643 a by-law is sufficient, provided it be brought before the council at two different meetings, to form a contract in favour of the proprietor of the manufactory therein mentioned, his heirs and assigns, for all the time specified in such by-law. The addition of paragraph 4 to article 4404, the appellant argues, shews that not only must the exemption by-law be thus brought before the council at two different meetings, but that it must also, before coming into force and effect, be approved by the electors of the municipality who are proprietors. I will examine this contention in a moment. To complete the review of the pertinent enactments, I may say that, in 1899, by 62 Victoria, chapter 39, section 1, the first paragraph of article 4404 was amended so as to permit the council to grant the contemplated aid to a person as well as to a company or to the provincial government.\nBefore attempting to place a construction on these articles, reference must be made to some provisions of the charter of the town of Maisonneuve, 61 Victoria, chapter 57, passed in 1898.\nSection 60 states that notwithstanding article 4404 of the Revised Statutes and in the spirit of that article, permission is granted to the town to grant aid to any railway, manufactory, brewery, distillery, or other industrial or commercial establishment now established or which may wish to establish themselves within the limits of the town by giving or undertaking to give them land for their buildings and operations. And some bonuses and privileges already granted are confirmed.\nBy section 65 of the same statute it is stated that with the exception of the by-laws which must be submitted to the approval of the proprietors who are municipal electors, the town council may exercise its powers by by-law or resolution.\nFinally in 1900 the charter of Maisonneuve was further amended by 63 Victoria, chapter 53, section 19, by adding thereto section 60a which declares that the town may exercise all the powers contained in articles 4402, 4403, 4404 and 4405 as well as in article 60 of 61 Victoria, chapter 57, in favour of any person, partnership, corporation or public body, and that it may exercise such powers in the form of a sale, loan, donation, exchange, lease, subscription * * * exemption from taxation, or in any other way it may deem expedient.\nIn his factum the respondent calls attention to section 26 of the same statute which states that, among others, articles 4531, 4532 and 4533 shall not apply to the town of Maisonneuve, these articles being precisely among those referred to by article 4406 as prescribing the mode whereby the approval of the municipal electors may be obtained. This enactment would possibly complicate the situation were it not that the same section 26 declares that all the provisions of the municipal code that are not inconsistent with the Act or with the town corporations general clauses shall apply thereto and form part thereof, so far as the same is possible, mutatis mutandis. At that time, the municipal code fully provided for the mode of submitting by-laws for the approval of the municipal electors (article 671 et seq.).\nHaving now cited all the pertinent statutory enactments, my opinion is first that the distinction between existing and new industries, in so far as the exemption from municipal taxes is concerned, has been maintained throughout, and that consequently article 4559 of the Revised Statutes of 1888 and article 943 of the municipal code do not apply to the case of the respondent.\nWe are thus restricted to what I have called the second and third sets of enactments, that is to say to articles 4404 to 4406 and articles 4642 and 4643 of the Revised Statutes.\nParagraph 4 of article 4404 in connection with article 4406 furnishes the whole difficulty of construction. After serious reflection, I have come to the conclusion that paragraph 4 is less an enabling provision than a mere reference to the really enabling provisions of section 6 of chapter 2 of this title, that is to say a reference to articles 4642 and 4643. Such references (dispositions de renvoi) are not unfamiliar in statutory enactments and the Quebec Civil Code contains a number of them. If this construction be adopted it will be possible to harmonize articles 4404 to 4406 with articles 4642 and 4643, and the rule governing exemptions as to new industries will be found in the latter articles. It follows that the approval of the municipal electors who are proprietors is not necessary for the exemption is not granted in virtue of article 4404 but of articles 4642 and 4643.\nThis construction being adopted, it remains to be seen whether the respondent's exemption was legally granted. There was no by-law brought before the council at two different meetings, but merely a resolution submitted and voted upon at one meeting. Consequently the conditions of articles 4642 and 4643 were not satisfied. The respondent however relies on section 65 of the Maisonneuve charter the substance of which I have given above. But assuming that a mere resolution was sufficient, it should have been considered at two meetings of the council, for this is not an idle formality but one destined to ensure due deliberation. And in my opinion there must be strict compliance with all the conditions laid down for the granting of an exemption from taxation so that, even giving full effect to section 65, these conditions were not fulfilled. I do not think that the saving provision of article 4186 of the Revised Statutes can avail the respondent, for these requirements are not mere formalities but are conditions going to the jurisdiction of the town council to grant an exemption from municipal taxation. I cannot therefore think that this exemption was validly granted to the respondent.\nThe respondent relies on the decision of the Court of King's Bench in Corporation du Village de Chambly v. Lamoureux[4].\nThe report of this case is most unsatisfactory. No reasons for the judgment of the Court of King's Bench are given; it is merely stated that the judgment of the first court was unanimously confirmed, and all we find in the report is a statement of the arguments of the parties. The judgment of the first court is extremely short and it refers to a by-law granting the respondent the exemption he invoked. The head-note speaks of a resolution, not a by-law, and in a foot-note a resolution is cited granting an exemption from taxation to Samuel T. Willett and to anybody else who would erect buildings for manufacturing purposes. It would not seem possible to contend that under the statute 34 Victoria, chapter 18, or articles 4642 and 4643 R.S.Q., 1888, a mere resolution could grant an exemption from taxation to any unnamed person who might in the future erect a building in the municipality for manufacturing purposes. Such an exemption would be void under this statute and these articles, and yet the head-note asserts that the council could grant it by a resolution passed under article 943 of the municipal code. That the Court of Queen's Bench did so decide seems very questionable, for the judgment of the first court, which was confirmed, speaks of\nle r\u00e8glement invoqu\u00e9 par les d\u00e9fendeurs * * * les exemptant de payer toutes les taxes qui leur sont r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par cette action. If it had been shewn that this decision, as reported, had been followed in spite of its obvious error, I would hesitate to disturb a jurisprudence founded on it, but no such jurisprudence is shewn to exist. I, therefore, feel that I cannot accept this decision as an authority against the enactments I have mentioned.\nI regret to have to come to a decision adverse to the respondent who observed in good faith the conditions of an exemption which was respected by the town of Maisonneuve until it became a part of the city of Montreal. But I must hold that the respondent has not shewn that the exemption from taxation was validly granted to him by the resolution which he invokes.\nSince writing the above opinion I have had the advantage of reading and fully considering the reasons for judgment of my brother Duff. Perhaps I may be permitted to say that the fact that my learned brother has arrived at a different conclusion after an able and exhaustive study, in its different stages of development, of all this legislation, shews the difficulty of the problem which we have to solve. And while I have been unable to place, on article 4559 of the revision of 1888, a wide construction which would comprise even the manufactories mentioned in articles 4642 and 4643 of the same revision, with the result that an exemption from municipal taxation of a new manufactory could be supported under article 4559, although not granted in the manner specified by articles 4642 and 4643, I think, if I may say so with great respect, that the legislature of the province of Quebec would be well advised should it place the matter beyond any possible controversy by redrafting all these provisions which appear in a scarcely modified form, in so far as tax exemptions are concerned, in the revision of 1909 (articles 5685, 5686, 5687, 5775, 5922 and 5923). There is moreover no conceivable reason why the exemption period should not be the same in all cases.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. Malouin J.\u2014L'intim\u00e9 a obtenu du conseil municipal de Maisonneuve en 1911 une exemption de taxes pour dix ans sur une manufacture qu'il se proposait d'\u00e9tablir dans les limites de cette municipalit\u00e9. Cette exemption de taxes lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par une simple r\u00e9solution du conseil L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9tabli sa manufacture dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9 en conformit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution.\nEn 1918, la ville de Maisonneuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 annex\u00e9e \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Jusqu'\u00e0 l'annexion, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas pay\u00e9 de taxes; mais apr\u00e8s l'annexion l'appelante, pr\u00e9tendant que l'exemption de taxes accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, en a exig\u00e9 le paiement. Sur son refus de payes, elle a fait saisir les biens de l'intim\u00e9 pour la somme de $2,197.19, montant de taxes que ce dernier est cens\u00e9 devoir pour l'ann\u00e9e 1918-19.\nL'intim\u00e9 a fait une opposition aux fins d'annuler \u00e0 cette saisie, invoquant l'exemption de taxes que la ville de Maisonneuve lui a accord\u00e9e.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que cette exemption de taxes est nulle parce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par simple r\u00e9solution, tandis que le conseil municipal aurait d\u00fb proc\u00e9der par r\u00e8glement \u00e0 \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 l'approbation des \u00e9lecteurs propri\u00e9taires de la municipalit\u00e9.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'appelante; mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel, le juge Rivard \u00e9tant dissident.\nLa seule question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider en est une d'interpr\u00e9tation de statuts. Il s'agit de savoir quel est l'article de la loi en vertu duquel le conseil municipal de Maisonneuve devait proc\u00e9der pour accorder \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 l'exemption de taxes sollicit\u00e9e. Les parties ont admis que les statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888 s'appliquent \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce.\nLe conseil municipal para\u00eet avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 4559 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888. Je le reproduis en partie:\nLe conseil peut par une r\u00e9solution exempter des taxes municipales pour une p\u00e9riode de vingt ans au plus toute personne qui exerce une industrie, un m\u00e9tier, ou se livre \u00e0 une exploitation quelconque, ainsi que le terrain occup\u00e9 par cette industrie, ce m\u00e9tier, cette exploitation, etc.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que cet article du statut ne s'applique qu'aux personnes exer\u00e7ant une industrie dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 l'exemption est accord\u00e9e et non aux personnes exer\u00e7ant leur industrie en dehors de la municipalit\u00e9. C'est, je crois, l'interpr\u00e9tation juridique et litt\u00e9rale du texte m\u00eame. L'exemption de taxes est de droit strict, et l'interpr\u00e8te ne peut l'\u00e9tendre au del\u00e0 du cadre fix\u00e9 par ce texte.\nL'intim\u00e9 a beaucoup insist\u00e9 sur un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent[5] o\u00f9 la cour d'appel para\u00eet avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire. Cette d\u00e9cision n'est pas motiv\u00e9e et ne peut nous aider dans la solution du pr\u00e9sent litige.\nLa majorit\u00e9 des juges de la cour d'appel para\u00eet s'\u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur les articles 4642 et 4643 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1888 pour donner gain de cause \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9. Je cite l'article 4642 en partie et l'article 4643 en entier:\n4642. Dans le but d'encourager l'introduction et l'\u00e9tablissement de nouvelles manufactures dans leurs limit\u00e9s, il est loisible aux municipalit\u00e9s de cit\u00e9, de ville et de village, d'exempter des taxes, cotisations et imp\u00f4ts, pour un temps n'exc\u00e9dant pas dix ann\u00e9es, les manufactures autres que les moulins \u00e0 farine, usines \u00e0 gaz et distilleries, que des individus, des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales ou corps politiques et corporations ont entrepris et entreprennent d'y \u00e9tablir.\n4643. Quiconque d\u00e9sire \u00e9tablir une manufacture, comme ci-dessus, est tenu de demander au conseil municipal le privil\u00e8ge de l'\u00e9tablir, de sp\u00e9cifier le genre de manufacture le lieu, l'\u00e9tendue du terrain requis, et s'il entend se servir d'engins \u00e0 vapeur.\nCe privil\u00e8ge ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 sans avis pealable adress\u00e9 et donn\u00e9 au conseil; sur ce, le conseil peut passer \u00e0 cet effet un r\u00e8glement qui doit \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 sa d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration \u00e0 deux assembl\u00e9es diff\u00e9rentes; une fois adopt\u00e9, le r\u00e8glement a force de contrat en faveur des propri\u00e9taires de la manufacture y mention\u00e9e, leurs hoirs et ayants cause, pour tout le temps sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 dans ce r\u00e8glement.\nJe reproduis aussi au long les articles 4404 et 4406 de la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes qui s'appliquaient \u00e0 la ville de Maisonneuve, car le texte de ces articles est essentiel \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du pr\u00e9sent litige. Ils se lisent comme suit:\n4404. Aider \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de ponts, chauss\u00e9es, jet\u00e9es, quais, glissoires, chemins macadamis\u00e9s ou pav\u00e9s, chemins de fer ou autres ouvrages publics ou tout \u00e9tablissement industriel situ\u00e9s en tout ou en partie dans la municipalit\u00e9 ou dans les environs, entrepris et construits par des compagnies constitu\u00e9es en corporation, ou par le gouvernement provincial:\n1.

J'infirmerais le jugement dont est appel et je renverrais l'opposition de l'intim\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nMaclean J. (dissenting).\u2014The question involved in this appeal is the validity of a resolution of the council of the town of Maisonneuve, passed on April 11, 1911, exempting from taxation for the period of ten years the business of the respondent, carried on in that municipality under the name of The Dominion Die Company. Since the passage of this resolution the town of Maisonneuve has become a part of the city of Montreal, but that fact in no respect affects the issue. During the period which the corporation of Maisonneuve maintained its separate existence the tax exemption granted by the resolution was observed, but the city of Montreal, after its absorption of Maisonneuve, in 1918, questioned the validity of the exemption granted by the resolution, and by steps which need not be mentioned, the issue reached the courts, and is now before this court on appeal, from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, which appellate court reversed the trial judge, who found the resolution in question invalid.\nAny difficulty in resolving the issue is due chiefly to the existence of three separate groups of articles to be found in the statutes of Quebec, 1888, all of which it is admitted were applicable to the corporation of Maisonneuve at the time the exemption was granted, and each of which enabled the corporation in certain events to grant exemptions from taxation.\nThe charter of the town of Maisonneuve, c. 57 Q.S. 1898, provides that the council of the town shall have all the powers, rights and privileges granted by the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, and by the Municipal Code to municipal councils. The provisions of the Revised Statutes referred to are the articles referable to town corporations, title XI, chapter first. The first clause enacts that every provision of that chapter applies to every town and corporation established by the legislature of Quebec unless expressly modified or amended, and becomes part of its charter. The next clause enacts that in order to exclude any of the provisions of this chapter from the charter of the town, they must be expressly excluded; and the excluded provisions must be specified by their numbers. The charter of the town of Maisonneuve, expressly and by numbers, declared certain of such provisions as not being applicable to that town; but in the enumerated articles are not to be found the important ones hereinafter mentioned. The charter also provides that the provisions of the Municipal Code shall apply to the town, except such provisions as are inconsistent with the charter itself, or the Town Corporation General Clauses Act.\nIt is agreed that articles 4404, 4405, 4406, 4559, 4642 and 4643 as they read in the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, applied to the town of Maisonneuve at the time the exemption in question was granted, the two last mentioned articles being part of chapter two of the Town Corporation General Clauses Act, the remainder being part of chapter one. At the time of the granting of the tax exemption now in question, there was not, I think, any provision in the Municipal Code applicable to Maisonneuve upon the subject of tax exemption.\nIt would perhaps be convenient to here set forth the important parts of such articles, upon which this case turns:\nCHAPTER FIRST\n1. Article 4559.\u2014The council may, by a resolution, exempt from the payment of municipal taxes, for a period not exceeding twenty years, any person who carries on any industry, trade or enterprise whatsoever, as well as the land used for such industry, trade or enterprise, etc.\nCHAPTER SECOND\n2. Article 4642.\u2014For the purpose of encouraging the introduction and establishment of new manufactories within their limits, it is lawful for any city, town, or village municipality to exempt from all taxes, assessments and municipal imposts whatsoever, for a space of time not exceeding ten years, any manufactory, not being a flour-mill, gas-works or distillery, which any individual, commercial firm or corporation may have undertaken or may undertake to establish.\nArticle 4643.\u2014Any person, desiring to establish a manufactory as aforesaid, is obliged to ask the permission of the municipal council and state the nature of the manufacture, its locality, the extent of the intended site, and whether he intends to use steam power. Such permission shall not be given unless previous notice be given by the person applying therefor to the council, and the council may make a by-law for the purpose, which by-law must be brought before the council at two different meetings thereof, and when the by-law is agreed to, etc.\nCHAPTER FIRST\n3. Article 4404.\u2014To aid in the construction of any bridge, causeway, pier, wharf, slide, macadamized or paved road, railroad, or other public works, or any manufacturing establishment situated in whole or in part within the municipality or in its vicinity, undertaken and built by any incorporated company, or by the Provincial Government:\n1. By taking and subscribing for shares in any company formed for such purpose;\n2. By giving or lending money to such company or to the Provincial Government;\n3. By guaranteeing by endorsation or otherwise any sum of money borrowed by such company;\n4. By exempting from the payment of municipal taxes, assessments and dues certain industrial establishments according to the provisions of section sixth of chapter second of this title;\nArticle 4406.\u2014Every by-law, passed by virtue of the two preceding articles, before coming into force and effect shall be approved by the electors of the municipality who are proprietors, in the manner prescribed in articles 4531 and following to article 4535 inclusively. The respondent claims that the resolution granting his exemption was authorized by article 4559, while the appellant contends that the power granted to town councils under this article only extended to persons \"carrying on any industry, trade or enterprise\" prior to, or at the time of, the passage of the resolution. This article is very general indeed, and were it not for articles 4642 and 4643, one should find little difficulty in adopting the respondent's view.\nChapter second, within which are to be found articles 4642 and 4643 is entitled \"Special provisions applicable to cities, towns and other corporations,\" while the heading of the articles themselves is \"Exemption of new manufactories from municipal taxes.\" I therefore think that these articles are in the nature of special legislation, and I find it impossible to resist the conclusion that they supersede or qualify the general enactment contained in article 4559. These articles employ language that is quite clear, and the object of the legislation, namely, the encouragement of the establishment of new manufactories, is quite obvious. Where a general intention is expressed and also a particular intention which is incompatible with the general one, the particular intention should, I think, be considered an exception to the general one. Alternatively, the respondent relies upon these articles. Subject to a later consideration of the validity of the exemption as to the form and procedure adopted in its enactment, which also is contested, I am of the opinion that it was within the power of the municipality of Maisonneuve to grant the exemption which it did in this instance, under these articles.\nThe appellant urges that the exempting resolution is invalid under the articles I have above just referred to, and that articles 4404 to 4406 supply the test which the exemption must undergo before its validity is established. Upon their face these articles appear to be partially in conflict with articles 4642 and 4643 and attempt in some degree to invade the same area of legislation. It is particularly to be observed that article 4406 introduces the reference of a tax exempting by-law to the electors for approval, before becoming effective. It might later on be helpful to now point out that as originally enacted in 1876, article 4404 contained no reference to \"any manufacturing establishments,\" and these words were added by amendment in 1881. In 1899 also were added to the end of the first part of article 4404 the words \"or by any person whatsoever,\" which words do not appear in article 4404, as appearing in the Revised Statutes. It should also be stated that subsection 4 of article 4404 was first enacted in 1881.\nBefore attempting to construe the effect of the last mentioned group of articles, it might be well now to revert to the second group of enactments, articles 4642 and 4643, to inquire if, standing by themselves, anything further was required to be done by the Town Council to make the resolution and the exemption effective as against the corporation and in favour of the respondent.\nArticle 4642 clearly gives the corporation the power to exempt from taxation some one intending to start a new manufactory. Article 4643 requires that any person desiring to establish a manufactory shall ask permission to do so and shall state the nature of the manufactory, etc. The reason for such requirements are obvious. While the municipality at this period in its history was evidently very solicitous about the establishment of new industries within its bounds, still other considerations prompted reservations and restrictions. For instance, flour-mills, gas-works, and distilleries were disqualified from tax' exemption. Again, it was desirable to learn if any proposed manufactory seeking tax exemption was to engage in the same line of industry as a pre-existing one, when the latter might become entitled to similar treatment. Further, some proposed manufactory might be desirable in one location but objectionable in another, or conceivably, altogether objectionable in its character and objects. For these, and possibly other reasons, permission of the council was first required before establishing any new manufactory. More importance seems to be attached to securing this \"permission\" than to the formal declaration of tax exemption by the council. However the respondent made application for permission to establish \u00e1 new manufactory at a specific location, which was granted along with tax exemption. The second part of 4643 requires that such permission must be expressed in the form of a by-law. Nothing is expressly said about the passage of a by-law with respect to tax exemption and much is to be said in support of the view of Mr. Justice Greenshields of the appellate court below in this respect. However, a resolution of council was passed in terms exempting the respondents' proposed manufactory, to be located on specified lots of lands, from taxation for the period of ten years. Is the passage of a resolution a compliance with this empowering statute? The article requires that the by-law must be considered by the council at two separate meetings before adoption. Section 65 of the charter of the town of Maisonneuve provides that\nwith the exception of the by-laws which must be submitted to the approval of the proprietors who are municipal electors, the town council may exercise its power by by-law or resolution.\nThis statutory enactment (1898) qualifies the article under consideration, and I am of the opinion that a resolution is, so far as this case is concerned, the equivalent of a by-law.\nIs the resolution incomplete by reason of the fact that it was once only considered by the council? I think this question must be answered in the negative. It seems to me quite clear that section 65 of the charter was intended to so amend or qualify article 4398 of the Town Corporation Clauses that the town of Maisonneuve could legislate within its powers by by-law or by resolution, except in the case of by-laws that required the approval of the ratepayers. Under article 4643, a proposed by-law was not an effective by-law unless considered twice by the council, but a resolution when passed by the council of Maisonneuve was effective when passed. In this group of articles there is nothing to suggest that the tax exemption required the approval of the ratepayers. Maisonneuve, it will be found an reference to its charter, was continually cutting down by enactments of the legislature the Town Corporation Clauses and extending its own exclusive powers, and the power acquired enabling it to legislate by resolution, instead of by-law, was not at all unusual.\nIt is urged by the appellant, that article 4404 is the only legislation under which the tax exemption might have been granted and that in order to make the same effective and valid it should receive the approval of the municipal electors as prescribed by 4406. It is contended that these articles are in direct conflict with and control the second group of articles, 4642, etc., as to the procedure making effective any resolution or by-law, and of course this requires consideration. As originally enacted in 1876, article 4404 was intended merely to authorize the municipality to grant unusual aids to undertakings in the nature of public works, by way of loans, guarantees and even by becoming a shareholder, and no mention was made of tax exemption whatever. As these suggested subventions involved direct money payments from the municipal treasury, or the assumption of liabilities by way of guarantee, it was sound policy to require ratification of the same by the electors before any by-law authorizing the same became effective. The wisdom of a different procedure in such cases as compared with exemption from taxation only, is obvious. Later, the added and unusual power to aid in the construction of \"manufacturing establishments\" by purchase of shares, loans or guarantees, was granted to municipalities. In 1888 the commissioners appointed to revise and consolidate the public statutes (Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888), inserted what is now paragraph 4 of article 4404. That is, they added the power to grant exemption from taxation to the other three enumerated methods by which the municipality might \"aid in the construction of bridges, etc., and any manufacturing establishments\" and which required reference to the electors. Subsection four says the exemption from taxation may be granted\naccording to the provisions of section sixth of chapter second of this title,\nbeing articles 4642 and 4643. Altogether the legislation enabled municipalities to commit themselves to extensive and unusual subventions, and it is fairly to be presumed that it was intended they should apply to unusual undertakings, requiring for special reasons assistance beyond the one of simple exemption from taxation. A careful reading of article 4404 clearly reveals this. For instance, under this article, assistance might be given to manufacturing establishments partly without the municipality, or in its vicinity, while under article 4642 the manufactory was to be within the limits of the municipality.\nTo construe paragraph four of article 4404 in the manner urged by the appellant, as a modification of articles 4642 and 4643, is to suggest that the legislature intended to amend article 4643 by requiring a reference to the electors instead of merely passing a by-law or resolution. I do not think it was intended to amend articles 4642 and 4643 at all, which was in the nature of special legislation. Any intention to so amend was so simple of accomplishment that one must conclude something else was intended. Article 4404, before paragraph four was added, did not deal with tax exemptions, but was legislation upon an entirely different subject. However, as the article now stands with this paragraph added, I construe it to mean that a municipal council might\naid in the construction of any manufacturing establishment,\nby (a) subscribing for shares; (b) a loan of money; (c) a guarantee; (d) exemption from taxation. The council might grant aid by employing any one or more, or even all of the four methods. If any persons intending to construct a manufacturing establishment required aid by way of a loan, or guarantee, or purchase of shares, it may safely be presumed that the same persons in their financial infirmities would seek tax exemption as well. In that event legislation already existed (article 4642) empowering the latter to be given and prescribing the procedure (article 4643), and accordingly the scope of the powers for granting tax exemption, and the procedure to accomplish that end, already existing, they were here incorporated by way of reference. I construe articles 4404 and 4406 to mean that if any manufacturing establishment was to be aided under any one or all of the methods prescribed by subsections 1, 2 or 3, the approval of the electors was required, but if in addition it was to have exemption from taxation, that portion of the by-law need not be submitted to the electors, but was to be enacted according to the provisions of article 4643.\nIf the true construction of articles 4404 to 4406 upon this point is in doubt, or my construction of them untenable in respect of the tax exemption clause, I am still of the opinion that the tax exemption in question is valid under articles 4642 and 4643. If the legislature expresses its mind clearly in one place, it ought to be presumed that it is of the same mind still, unless it clearly appears that it has changed it. It did very clearly express itself in articles 4642 and 4643, and the statute seems to say what the legislature meant, and neither directly or by implication does the legislature appear to have intended any modification whatever. Before the express words of a statute can be changed so as to have a different meaning that alteration ought to be clearly expressed. Articles 4404 and 4406 hardly suggest such an inconsistency with 4642 and 4643 as to indicate modification by implication. It is also a reasonable presumption that the legislature did not intend to keep contradictory enactments on the statute book, or to amend a statute without saying so, and such an interpretation is not to be adopted unless it is inevitable. The language of each should be restricted to its own object or subject, and a reading of each indicates they were intended for different purposes. Articles 4404 to 4406 empower municipal councils to grant unusual aids to certain undertakings which involved payments from its revenues, as in the cases of loans, and subscription of and payment for shares, and the assumption of liabilities as in the case of guarantees. Basically, that is the policy of the legislation. The policy of the legislation involved in articles 4642 and 4643 is clearly another thing. I do not think that a bylaw or resolution passed in virtue of article 4642 is a bylaw passed under the authority of article 4404 and that article 4406 does not apply to it. I am of the opinion that the tax exemption in question is valid under articles 4642 and 4643, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jarry, Damphousse, Butler & St. Pierre.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Where there is conflicting evidence on a question of fact, whatever may be the opinion of the judges of an appellate court as to the value of that evidence, the verdict of the jury should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe action was taken by the appellant against the respondent company for damages arising from the death of her husband, which occurred as the result of a collision between a motor truck which he was driving across the respondent company's track and one of the respondent company's locomotive engines. The jury found that the accident was the result of the combined negligence of the appellant's husband, in heedlessly crossing the line without taking proper precautions, and of the servants of the respondent company in failing to give the statutory signal. The jury having assessed the damages at $12,000 and reduced them to $8,000 in consequence of the fault of the victim, judgment was given for the last mentioned sum; but the appellate court reversed this judgment and dismissed the action, being of the opinion that the verdict was contrary to the evidence.\nLafleur K.C. and Lamothe K.C. for the appellant.\nWells K.C. and Chass\u00e9 K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The jury before whom this case was tried answered a number of questions submitted to it by the learned trial judge in such a manner as to demonstrate that according to the view of the jury each of these parties was to blame for the accident. The learned trial judge entered judgment accordingly and, according to Quebec law, both parties being to blame the relative proportion of blame must be assessed by the jury as was done herein.\nThe answers of a jury to questions submitted to them by the learned trial judge must be read in light of the charge he has given the jury.\nThe jury in this case answered questions four and five as follows:\u2014\n4. Was the accident due only to the fault and negligence of the said late Oliva Paradis, and if so state in what consisted this fault and this negligence?\nNo. Nine for, three against.\n5. Was the said accident due to the common fault of the said Oliva Paradis and the defendant or of persons under its control and for whom it is responsible, and if so state in what consisted, respectively, this common fault?\nY. The Canadian Pacific at fault by not whistling in time for the crossing. Paradis, for neglect for not looking before crossing the railroad track. Nine for, three against.\nThe turning point of this appeal is the answer to question number five from which it clearly appears, if we have regard to law and common sense, that the jury did not believe that part of the evidence of the respondent's servants that the required whistling took place at the exact point the law required, but took place after that had been passed and hence not legally in time for the crossing at which the accident herein in question took place.\nThere was evidence clear and convincing, that the whistling took place after the whistling post had been passed; especially if regard is had to the absolute oath of respondent's servants that only one whistling took place.\nIn such case the evidence of others (having no interest either way) indicates a whistling did take place quite close to the crossing if not actually upon it. Which is to be credited, in such a case of conflict, the interested or the disinterested set of witnesses?\nA jury has not only a perfect right, but an absolute duty, to believe and accept one part of a witness's statement, and discard another part thereof which it does not believe. And that is evidently what this jury did in this case.\nCounsel for respondent so persistently insisted upon arguing that the whole evidence of these servants of respondent should be accepted as final and conclusive that I am quite convinced they had no other case to rely upon.\nThe evidence on both sides in any case must all be considered and the true story contained therein as it is found in and by the minds of the jury or of the majority of nine, as Quebec law provides, is that upon which, when reported to the judge, he must act.\nUnless the findings are clearly such as no nine reasonable men in Quebec can reach, they are final and conclusive and should not be interfered with by any court of appeal.\nWith great respect the appellate court below departed from this clear and absolute rule of law.\nThe opinions of the learned trial judge and Mr. Justice Guerin, dissenting, in the Court of King's Bench, were overruled.\nI am therefore of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant recovered judgment for $8,000 in an action against the respondent company under Art. 1056 of the Civil Code for damages arising from the death of her husband, which occurred as the result of a collision between a motor truck which he was driving across the respondent company's track and one of the respondent company's locomotive engines. The negligence alleged by the appellant was the failure to give the statutory crossing signal by whistling. The jury found that the accident was the result of the combined negligence of the appellant's husband, in heedlessly crossing the line without taking proper precautions, and of the servants of the company in failing to give the statutory signal. The jury having assessed the damages at $12,000 and reduced them to $8,000 in consequence of the fault of the victim, judgment was given for the last mentioned sum. From this judgment the respondent company appealed, and the Court of King's Bench reversed the judgment of the trial judge and dismissed the action. The grounds upon which the Court of King's Bench proceeded are set out in the formal judgment in these words:\u2014\nAttendu que la seule faute reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 la compagnie appelante est que ses employ\u00e9s n'auraient pas fait crier le sifflet de la locomotive \u00e0 temps; Consid\u00e9rant qu'il appartenait \u00e0 la poursuite de prouver cette faute et qu'il est au contraire \u00e9tabli que les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie ont fait entendre plusieurs fois, et \u00e0 temps, le sifflet de la locomotive, sp\u00e9cialement qu'ils ont donn\u00e9 des coups de sifflet r\u00e9glementaires avant le passage \u00e0 niveau o\u00f9 la collision s'est produite, et \u00e0 la distance requise de cet endroit;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve ne justifie pas le verdict du jury;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'aucune faute imputable \u00e0 l'appelant n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e, que le verdict rendu est contraire \u00e0 la preuve et qu'il appert d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9vidente que nul jury ne serait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre un verdict autre qu'en faveur de l'appelante.\nThe sole question on this appeal is whether there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably find that the negligence charged against them was properly imputable to the respondent company's servants. The crossing signal is a well-understood signal, and consists of two long and two short blasts. Another signal is spoken of in the evidence, called the \"alarm,\" or the \"danger\" signal, and the difference between the two signals is very clearly explained by Parmelee, the locomotive engineer. The alarm, or danger signal, consists in a series of rapidly repeated short whistles.\nThere is little conflict between the witnesses called on behalf of the appellant and those of the respondent company upon the point that only one signal was given. The point in dispute is whether that signal was the alarm signal given at the moment of the impact, just as the engine was about to strike the truck, or whether it was the usual crossing signal given some seconds before, at the whistling post. Parmelee, the engineer, is perfectly explicit upon the point that the usual crossing signal was given some seven or eight seconds before he actually reached the crossing, and that it was the last signal before the collision occurred. According to his statement, the signal was the usual one, two long and two short blasts. Other witnesses called on behalf of the respondent company are equally explicit, and their evidence is quite unshaken in cross-examination. But as against that there is evidence, which is quite as positive, quite as unequivocal, given by witnesses who, if they are to be believed, were in a position to speak, that the only signal given was a signal consisting of three sharp blasts in rapid succession, just at the moment of impact. One of these witnesses was Rev. Father Lavigne, who was travelling in the train. Another was Leduc, an employee of the Post Office, who was standing on the platform at the Rang-Double de St. Gr\u00e9goire, a distance of twenty arpents from the Kemp crossing, watching the train, which he says he could see distinctly, and in a position in which, as he says, he could have heard the crossing signal, had it been given. His evidence may usefully be quoted:\u2014\nQ. Lorsque vous regardiez le train qui s'en venait, avez-vous entendu quelque chose de la locomotive?\nR. J'ai entendu crier trois cris de sifflet.\nQ.

Oui.\nI am unable to concur in the conclusion of the Court of King's Bench that the verdict of the jury, who had such evidence before it, can be set aside as an unreasonable verdict. There was the sharpest contradiction between the two sets of witnesses, and it may be that there were powerful reasons which ought to have influenced the jury to accept the evidence produced by the respondent company in preference to that produced on behalf of the appellant; but the question of credibility in all its phases was entirely a question for the jury. It was for them to judge whether Allard and Leduc were worthy of credit when they stated that if the crossing signal had been given they would have heard it. It was for them to say whether the Rev. Father Lavigne was to be credited when he stated that the alarm signal\u2014a signal, that is to say, which he recognized as the usual alarm signal\u2014was given just at the moment of the impact. It was for them to accept or reject the evidence of Leduc that the alarm signal was given just at that moment. If this evidence was believed by the jury, it involved the rejection of the testimony given by the witnesses called on behalf of the respondent company, who were quite positive that only one signal was given, the usual crossing signal, consisting, as above mentioned, of two long and two short blasts.\nI have already mentioned that there was little or no conflict upon the point that only one signal was given. On this there was such a degree of unanimity that the jury could not consistently with the evidence have taken the view that there was more than one. Starting from that point, if they believed the evidence of Allard, Leduc and Lavigne, for example, the case for the respondent was conclusively established. Whatever the jury might have thought of the likelihood that the attention of the witnesses called for the appellant would be directed to the subject of the crossing signal (so that if given they would probably have heard it) it was entirely for the jury to say how much of the evidence given by witnesses called for the respondent company they should accept and how much they should reject. It was within their province to decide whether, having accepted their evidence upon the point that only one signal was given, they should reject it in so far as it bore upon the issue whether that signal was the usual crossing signal or an alarm signal given just at the moment of impact. Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[1].\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nMignault J.\u2014The photographs which were put in evidence at the trial graphically depict a railway crossing which no one would imagine a dangerous one. The highway, called the Kempt road, crosses the railway line at an angle in an open country, while the railway itself runs along an embankment making it a conspicuous object for a considerable distance. At the time of the accident the sun was about setting, but there was still light enough to dim the glare of the locomotive's head lights which were burning. The appellant's husband, who was killed, was driving an automobile truck along the highway with two companions, one of whom lost his life and the other saved himself by jumping. The respondent's train was running at a speed of forty-five miles an hour and struck the automobile on the further track of a double tracked line. The only evidence we have of the speed of the motor truck is that when it mounted the incline leading to the railway crossing it was going at about ten miles an hour, a speed which is said to have been reduced as it crossed the nearer track.\nThe jury found that the railway company and the driver of the car were both in fault, the former by not whistling in time for the crossing, the latter for not looking before crossing the railroad track. They reduced the assessed damages, $12,000, to $8,000 by reason of the negligence of the appellant's husband. Judgment having been rendered in accordance with the verdict, the appellate court reversed this judgment and dismissed the action being of the opinion that the verdict was contrary to the evidence.\nThe question now is whether the verdict should have been disturbed. In other words, was the Court of King's Bench justified in disregarding the verdict of the jury on the facts in evidence?\nIt seems unnecessary to say at this late date that it is wholly within the province of the jury, properly directed as to the law, to find the facts. The Court of King's Bench set the verdict aside on the ground that it was not justified by the evidence. It is true that a verdict clearly contrary to the weight of evidence cannot stand, but the Quebec code of civil procedure (art. 501) states that a verdict is not considered against the weight of evidence unless it is one which the jury, viewing the whole of the evidence, could not reasonably find, and article 508 adds that a judgment different from that rendered by the trial judge may be rendered when it is absolutely clear from all the evidence that no jury would be justified in finding any verdict other than one in favour of the party moving or inscribing.\nThe weight of the evidence adduced and the credibility of the witnesses are also matters for the jury alone. As long ago as 1878, Lord Blackburn in an often quoted passage, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[2], said:\u2014\nThe jurors are not bound to believe the evidence of any witness; and they are not bound to believe the whole of the evidence of any witness. They may believe that part of a witness's evidence which makes for the party who calls him, and disbelieve that part of his evidence which makes against the party who calls him, unless there is an express or tacit admission that the whole of his account is to be taken as accurate.\nI do not apprehend that there is any difference between the Quebec law under the articles of the code which I have cited and the opinion expressed by Lord Blackburn. It may be epitomized by saying that the jurors are the sole judges of the facts.\nHere the crucial point is as to the fault found by the jury against the respondent, for there has been no attack on the finding of negligence against the driver of the truck. This fault is that the train did not whistle in time for the crossing.\nThe Railway Act (9-10 Geo. V, ch. 68), section 308, when a train is approaching a highway crossing at rail level, requires that the engine whistle be sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing and that the bell be rung continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed the highway. There was a post eighty rods from this crossing known as the whistling post, and it was there that the whistle should have been sounded and from that point to the crossing the bell should have been rung.\nThe jury's finding was as to the whistling, there was no mention of the bell not having been rung. At the speed the train was travelling, it would take twenty seconds to cover the distance from the whistling post to the crossing, a quarter of a mile.\nAs might have been expected, the testimony was contradictory as to this whistling, but the jury found, not that the whistle was not sounded, but that it was not done in time. It might have been desirable to put a further question to the jury in order to determine whether the train whistled at the statutory distance from the highway, for if it did there would have been ample time for the car to stop, and the respondent could not be said to have been in fault.\nThere was however evidence that the train whistled immediately before the collision and therefore not at the whistling post. Probably the testimony which the jury considered the most impressive was that of a mail carrier, Ernest Leduc, who from the station of St. Gr\u00e9goire, three quarters of a mile from the crossing, watched the train as it approached the station. He swore that he heard three short blasts of the whistle at the place where the collision occurred and immediately he saw a cloud of dust, for the truck was laden with bags of flour. He heard no other whistle before the three short blasts.\nThe engineer and the fireman testified that the engine whistled but once and then at the whistling post. But the jury could disbelieve their evidence in so far as they stated that the whistle was sounded at the whistling post, and believe that of Leduc who said that the whistling, as he heard it, was at the moment of the collision. If that story was true, and its truth or falsity was entirely a matter for the jury, then the whistle was not sounded in time for the crossing and therefore not at the whistling post.\nThe construction of the jury's answer that the train did not whistle in time for the crossing at first gave me some difficulty, but I think that, taken in connection with Leduc's statement, what the jury meant was that the whistle was sounded immediately before the accident, or practically at the same time as it would appear to an observer placed at a distance of three-quarters of a mile who heard the whistling at the same time as he saw the cloud of dust, sound travelling much slower than light.\nIf therefore the finding means that the train did not whistle at the whistling post, there is a finding that the respondent committed a breach of its statutory duty, and therefore that it was in fault. The jury could infer that if the regulation signal had been given it would have been heard by the appellant's husband and the accident might have been averted. It was for them to say whether the failure to give the statutory signal was a contributing cause of the accident.\nThere is just a further remark which I venture to make. Several cases, closely resembling the present one, have been referred to where, under the doctrine governing contributory negligence, damage actions have been dismissed by reason of the negligence of the injured party. But in the province of Quebec negligence of the plaintiff contributing to, but not being the sole cause of, the accident is not a bar to the right of recovery, but only a reason for reducing the damages that the negligent plaintiff has suffered by reason of his injury. It is for the jury to say whether the plaintiff's negligence was the sole cause of the accident or merely a cause contributing thereto with the negligence of the defendant, and the verdict will stand if there be evidence in support of it. This will serve to distinguish the case under consideration from the decision of this court in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith[3] strongly relied on by the respondent. The decision of the Privy Council in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Fr\u00e9chette[4], also cited by the respondent, is an instance of a case where an appellate court may come to the conclusion that there was no evidence to justify the verdict of the jury, but the facts in that case show that the plaintiff had done something he was forbidden to do and had thereby assumed the risk of injury. Also in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Labr\u00e8che[5] referred to, the verdict was set aside because the alleged fault found against the railway company was no fault in law. In no subject perhaps in the whole realm of jurisprudence is reference to cases which turn on particular facts more apt to prove delusive. It is the rule which has been applied to the facts which should be followed, and not the conclusion which consideration of the facts themselves led the court to adopt. Were it otherwise, there would be no guiding principle in a matter where facts vary ad infinitum.\nWith great deference therefore it appears to me that the Court of King's Bench had not sufficient ground for disregarding the verdict of the jury. The question for the appellate court was whether there was any evidence upon which the jury, if they believed it, could come to the conclusion that the regulation signals were not given or, as they put it, not given in time. It was not whether the appellate court itself found the evidence sufficient to establish fault on the part of the respondent. That again was a question for the jury and the jury alone, and as there was some evidence, as I have shewn, that the whistle was sounded practically at the time of the accident, the verdict must stand.\nThis does not mean that I believe that the jury should have come to the conclusion it did. The circumstances I have mentioned at the beginning of my opinion show to my mind that the driver of the car was guilty of almost incredible carelessness and brought on his own misfortune. But an appellate court is not entitled to substitute its opinion on the facts for that of the jury. Its duty is to accept the verdict if there be evidence to support it, however much it may disagree with the conclusion arrived at by the jury.\nMy opinion is therefore to allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and to restore the judgment on the verdict.\nMalouin J.\u2014L'appelante r\u00e9clame de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse, tant en son nom personnel qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses deux enfants mineurs, la somme de $26,200 \u00e0 titre de dommages r\u00e9sultant de la mort de son mari, Oliva Paradis, tu\u00e9 accidentellement le 27 septembre 1922 dans une collision survenue \u00e0 un passage \u00e0 niveau entre le camion automobile qu'il conduisait et un train de la compagnie intim\u00e9e.\nLe proc\u00e8s a eu lieu devant un juge assist\u00e9 d'un jury.

Le jury reproche \u00e0 Paradis de n'avoir pas regard\u00e9 avant de traverser le passage \u00e0 niveau et aux employ\u00e9s de la d\u00e9fenderesse de n'avoir pas fait crier \u00e0 temps le sifflet de la locomotive.\nLe jury a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les dommages \u00e0 $12,000, mais les a r\u00e9duits \u00e0 $8,000, vu la faute commune des parties, accordant $4,000 \u00e0 la demanderesse personnellement et $4,000 en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses deux enfants mineurs. Le juge qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s a accord\u00e9 jugement conform\u00e9ment au verdict.

En d'autres termes, cet article de la loi n'autorise le tribunal ou la cour d'appel \u00e0 casser un verdict ou \u00e0 infirmer un jugement bas\u00e9 sur un verdict que dans le cas o\u00f9 il n'y a aucune preuve quelconque au dossier pour le justifier.\nJe soumets respectueusement que lorsqu'il y a au dossier une preuve suffisante pour cr\u00e9er un doute, cette preuve doit \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du jury et son verdict doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s le verdict, la demanderesse a fait motion pour jugement suivant le verdict; et la d\u00e9fenderesse a fait motion pour jugement nonobstant le verdict. Le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal a accord\u00e9 la motion de la demanderesse et a rejet\u00e9 celle de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Il est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que si le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion qu'il n'y avait aucune preuve pour justifier le verdict, il aurait accord\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re motion au lieu de la rejeter.\nJe suis d'opinion qu'il y a suffisamment de preuve au dossier \u00e0 l'appui du verdict pour emp\u00eacher le tribunal de substituer son appr\u00e9ciation \u00e0 celle du jury sur les faits.\nM. le juge Duff, dans ses notes pr\u00e9par\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, cite des extraits de la preuve qui justifient cette opinion.

C. as amended by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nCohen for the appellant.\nBertrand for the respondent. Idington J.\u2014The appellant was found guilty by one of the judges of the Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal of having fraudulently concealed and parted with much of his properties previous to his insolvency, and other like charges, and said learned judge sentenced him to pay a fine of $400 and, on default of payment thereof, to imprisonment for six months.\nThe appellant immediately paid said fine. Thereupon, within what seems to me to have been a reasonable time, the Attorney General for Quebec, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial with his consent and direction, appealed to the Court of King's Bench for Quebec, under section 1013 of the Criminal Code, as amended by chapter 41 of 13-14 Geo. V, sec. 9, repealing the said section and others and substituting therefor in part section 1013 of said statute, of which subsection 2 thereof reads as follows:\u2014\n(2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave of a judge of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.\nThe Court of King's Bench having heard the case added to said sentence, imprisonment for six months.\nMr. Justice Bernier alone dissented but gave no reasons for said dissent.\nThereupon the appellant, so convicted and condemned to imprisonment, appealed from the said judgment of the Court of King's Bench to this court. Upon said appeal coming on for hearing herein, some members of our court took the objection that we had no jurisdiction.\nI suggested to counsel for appellant, who was thereby taken by surprise, that he better urge anything he had to say on the merits, and take a few days to submit a further factum, answering the point of want of jurisdiction.\nA week has elapsed but nothing further submitted, possibly because I had submitted to him that I could see no merits in the appeal, including the objection upon which he chiefly relied, that the fine having been paid there could be no appeal to the Court of King's Bench.\nThe only foundation for appeal here is the enactment in section 1024 of the Criminal Code, of which the first subsection reads as follows:\u2014 1024. Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the court of appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney General within fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.\nSection 1013 of the Code, as it stood until repealed as above stated, had to be read in connection with said section 1024, to clearly understand same.\nBut I do not see in the section or sections substituted therefor any help for us in regard to the interpretation and construction of said section 1024.\nIn the initial words thereof\nAny person convicted of an indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed\nI find some doubt and difficulty.\nIn the common use of the words \"convicted\" and \"conviction\" a man found guilty is, even before sentence, referred to as having been convicted and the finding of him as guilty a conviction.\nBut is that to be our legal interpretation of these words, or proper legal use thereof, unless and until he has been sentenced, and only then inclusive of the actual sentence, and thus read in this section as necessarily including the sentence, and that as determined by the Court of King's Bench, sitting in appeal.\nIn this latter sense of these words it is fairly arguable that there is a right of appeal.\nTurning to Stroud's Judicial Dictionary I find the following:\u2014\nConvicted.\u2014The word \"convicted,\" or the \"conviction\" of a person accused, is equivocal. \"In common parlance no doubt it is taken to mean, the verdict at the time of trial; but in strict legal sense, it is used to denote the judgment of the court\" (per Tindal C.J., Burgess v. Boetefeur, cited Acquittal), and, accordingly, it was there held that a person who pleaded guilty to keeping a brothel, on an indictment instituted under s. 5, 25 G. 2, c. 36, and who at a subsequent Sessions came up for judgment, was not \"convicted\" when he pleaded, but when judgment was pronounced.\nThat is followed by citations of many decisions which may or may not be read as qualifying this dictum of Tindal C.J. I cannot therefore confidently assert and hold that there is no appeal possible under such circumstances as involved herein.\nI, however, having come to the conclusion that even if there is jurisdiction there is no case submitted herein entitling us to exercise it, and would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nDuff J.\u2014As my brother Idington points out, the word \"conviction\" cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification including the sentence. Section 1013 does, however, I think, distinguish very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for the purposes of appeal, and the Act of 13-14 Geo. V, by which the present section was brought into force, made no change in section 1024. Accordingly, I think the word \"conviction\" in the last mentioned section should be read in its less technical sense, and consequently that there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an appeal under subsection (2) of section 1013.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant was found guilty of an offence under \"The Bankruptcy Act\" by a judge of the Sessions of the Peace in Montreal, and was sentenced to pay a fine of $400 or to be imprisoned during three months in default of payment. The fine was paid.\nUnder article 1013 of the Criminal Code as amended by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9 (1923), the Attorney General appealed against this sentence, and by judgment of the Court of King's Bench, sitting in appeal, in addition to the fine, the appellant was condemned to be imprisoned in the common gaol for the period of six months. He now appeals to this court against this judgment.\nOur jurisdiction is governed by article 1024 of the Criminal Code, which states, with a proviso which need not be mentioned here, that any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under article 1013, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction.\nAs now amended, article 1013 gives a right of appeal against a conviction, and against a sentence pronounced by the trial court against a person convicted on indictment. Article 1024 was not amended by the 1923 statute and under it the right of appeal is restricted to an appeal against the affirmance of the conviction. Reading it with article 1013, as amended, the appeal from the sentence under paragraph 2 of article 1013 cannot be brought before this court.\nI would therefore quash the appeal.\nMalouin J.\u2014Je suis d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas d'appel \u00e0 cette cour du jugement rendu par la cour du Banc du Roi, juridiction d'appel, pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par le juge Mignault.\nMaclean J.\u2014I concur.\nAppeal dismissed.\n",

The appellant's action was brought against the respondent company upon an agreement for the sale of pulpwood, the terms of which were contained in a letter by the appellant dated December 23, 1920, confirming a verbal understanding, as follows: \"We beg to confirm sale of all our rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut) about four thousand cords (4,000 cords) * * *.\" The appellant contends that under the contract the respondent was obliged to take the whole of its 1920 cut of rough pulpwood and claims $10,342.03 as the balance due. The respondent refused to accept and pay for more than 4,400 cords, adding to the 4,000 cords specified in the contract the usual ten percentage.\nLafleur K.C. and A. Langlais K.C. for the appellant.\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant is a lumber company operating timber limits in the county of Montmagny in the province of Quebec and makes pulpwood thereon.\nThe respondent is a pulp and paper company in that business at Grand'M\u00e8re, and in course thereof using pulpwood as its raw material.\nIn the years 1918 and 1919 respectively the respondents had by verbal contract in each of said years bought rough pulpwood from appellant.\nThe verbal contract for the first of said years was based on an estimate of 600 to 700 cords, but it turned out appellant was able to produce, by including purchases from small farmers in the district, and supply respondent therewith, 1,162 cords.\nAnd for the next year the verbal contract was based on an estimate of 2,500 cords, but it turned out that by including not only its own product, but that got from farmers, as in the previous year, it was able to turn over to respondent 3,121 cords.\nWhen the time came for dealing with the product, 1920-21, a verbal discussion took place between the respective managers of appellant and respondent at some meeting in Quebec and something was said about the possibility of 4,000 cords being supplied at same price as previous years. There was nothing definite reached and as the price was likely to go down the respondent's manager had issued orders that no new contracts were to be taken for purchase of rough pulpwood.\nThis gave rise to the following correspondence between said respective managers of the appellant and the respondent, which constitutes the only contract between said parties now in question herein.\nHamilton, the respondent's manager, wrote as follows:\u2014\nGrand'M\u00e8re, December 20, 1920.\nGordon McLeod, Esq.,\nc\/o Van Dyke Land Company,\n56 Palace Hill,\nQuebec, P.Q.\nDear sir,\u2014It will be necessary for you to confirm sale of rough pulpwood sold me verbally when last in Quebec by letter to enable me to protect your price for this wood, as at present we are not in the market and are reducing our purchases as much as possible.\nYour prompt attention to this will greatly oblige.\nYours very truly,\nH. F. Hamilton,\nPulpwood Division.\nand appellant replied as follows:\u2014\nQuebec, December 23, 1920.\nMr. H. J. Hamilton,\nLaurentide Company, Limited,\nGrand'M\u00e8re, Quebec.\nDear sir,\u2014Replying to your letter of the 20th inst, and confirming verbal agreement made with you in Quebec a short time ago.\nWe beg to confirm sale of all rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut) about four thousand cords, 4,000 cords, at a price of \u00a720 per cord of 128 cubic feet delivered at your mill in Grand'M\u00e8re.\nWe will send you a letter from Mr. Langlois as promised very shortly.\nWishing you the compliments of the season, and with all good wishes for the new year.\nYours very truly,\nT. H. Van Dyke & Co.,\nC. MacLeod,\nAgent.\nand respondent's manager replied:\u2014\nGrand'M\u00e8re, April 28, 1921.\nT. Van Dyke Company,\n58 Palace Hill, Quebec, P.Q.,\nAttention Mr. G. McLeod.\nDear sirs,\u2014I have made arrangements to permit you to start loading your pulpwood after the 1st of May at the rate of two carloads per day.\nAs soon as we are able to increase this, we will advise you.\nYours truly,\nLaurentide Co., Ltd.,\nH. F. Hamilton,\nLogging Division. The question raised herein is whether or not the appellant is entitled to recover for more than 4,400 cords. And that must turn upon the meaning to be attached to the words \"about four thousand (4,000) cords\" in said letter of 23rd December, 1920, when interpreted in light of all the surrounding circumstances and especially the evidently urgent need of accuracy.\nThe learned trial judge, Sir F. X. Lemieux, decided against the plaintiff, now appellant, allowing nothing beyond the price for 4,400 cords adding thereby the usual ten percentage added when a contract is made for a named specific quantity and that is accompanied by words such as \"about\" or \"more or less\" or such facts and circumstances as to indicate that such ten per cent of the named quantity as the parties concerned could be reasonably held to have had in their mutual view when contracting.\nThe reasons pointed out by respondent's letter above quoted clearly indicate that there was urgent need for knowing what the respondent could rely upon, and beyond which it would not be expected to go. The result shews the appellant's guess was not such as the respondent was entitled to expect and rely upon, and hence is not entitled to claim further than the learned trial judge has allowed.\nThe appellant was the only one to know. The respondent knew nothing of appellant's situation and facilities for production.\nI need not dwell further upon the very many details and requirements upon which the argument for appellant is founded. The necessity of appellant's situation created by itself cannot justify going so far.\nContracts such as that in question cannot be interpreted properly if we disregard the peculiar surrounding facts and circumstances which led to the use of the term \"about.\" Sometimes the circumstances may justify discarding entirely the word \"about\" but not here.\nI agree in the main with the reasoning of the learned judges in the Court of King's Bench who concluded that the appeal from the learned trial judge should be dismissed.\nThe very peculiar circumstances I have alluded to which evoked the contract herein in question are such as to leave little room for the application of decisions cited to us and which were not founded on such peculiar circumstances as gave rise to what we are concerned with.\nI am of the opinion therefore that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the appellants against the respondents upon an agreement for the sale and purchase of pulpwood, the terms of which are admittedly stated in a letter addressed by the appellants to the respondents, dated the 23rd December, 1920, in these words:\nDecember 23, 1920.\nDear sir,\u2014Replying to your letter of the 20th inst, and confirming verbal agreement made with you in Quebec a short time ago.\nWe beg to confirm sale of all rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut) about four thousand cords, 4,000 cords, at a price of $20 per cord of 128 cubic feet delivered at your mill in Grand M\u00e8re.\nWe will send you a letter from Mr. Langlois as promised very shortly.\nWishing you the compliments of the season, and with all good wishes for the new year.\nYours very truly,\nT. H. Van Dyke & Co.,\nG. MacLeod.\nIt is not seriously open to dispute that the appellants'\nrough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut)\namounted to approximately 5,000 cords. The price of pulpwood having fallen the respondents declined to accept more than 4,400 cords, being the quantity indicated by the figure mentioned, 4,000 cords, with the addition of ten per cent of that quantity as an allowance for inaccuracy of estimate, as admittedly contemplated by the letter.\nThe appellants contend that the agreement as expressed is an agreement for the sale and purchase of the whole of their rough pulpwood answering the description in the letter, and that this designation of the subject matter of the contract is not qualified by the words of quantity, \"about four thousand cords.\" On behalf of the respondents two alternative constructions are put forward: The first of these is, that the quantity mentioned, \"about four thousand cords,\" is the governing element of the description of the subject matter, and that the vendor was not bound to deliver more and the purchaser not bound to accept more than that quantity. The alternative view advanced by the respondents as to the effect of the contract is that while the vendor bound himself to sell and deliver the whole of his \"rough pulpwood,\" as described, the words of quantity import a contractual representation that the pulpwood described would not exceed in quantity 4,000 cords or thereabout.\nI do not think myself that there is any difficulty in construing the language of the letter. The subject matter of the contract seems to be plainly described, and I do not think that the words of quantity introduce any qualification. If they have any effect at all they can, I think, more naturally be read as indicating the minimum quantity of rough pulpwood which may be expected to be embraced by the description. At the lowest, the effect of the words appears to be altogether too disputable to treat them as qualifying the description of the subject matter in the manner contended for by the respondents.\nThe majority of the court below have taken another view, and the judgments, in this sense, appear to rest upon two principal grounds. First, it is said that according to the rule in French law such a phrase as that which is here the subject of controversy imports a warranty; that the words of quantity form the governing element in the description. But the citations in support of this view appear to be far from conclusive, and the passage quoted by Mr. Justice Greenshields from 6 Marcad\u00e9, par. 2, is quite in accord with the view just indicated. As observed by Sir Montague Smith in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in McConnell v. Murphy[2].\nIt is seldom, in mercantile contracts, that any technical or artificial rule of law can be brought to bear upon their construction. The question really is the meaning of language, and must be the same everywhere.\nThe courts in England, as well as in the United States, have as a rule treated such phrases as being words of expectation and estimate only, and not amounting to warranty or to a qualification of the description of the subject matter. This is very plainly brought out in the speeches of the Law Lords in Tancred, Arrol & Co. v. The Steel Company of Scotland, Ltd.[3], cited by Mr. Justice Greenshields in his judgment, as well as in the judgment of Lindley L.J., in McLay v. Perry[4], and in the judgment of the Privy Council just referred to.\nThen it is argued that the case comes within the scope of the rule of the French law by which, in cases of ambiguity, a contract of sale is to be read in the sense least favourable to the vendor. An argument is presented in the factum of the respondent based upon the omission from the Code Civil of the province of Quebec of arts. 1586, 1587 and 1602 of the Code Napol\u00e9on; that this rule has not formed part of the law of Quebec since the promulgation of the Code. Whatever significance may properly be attached to the omission mentioned, for the purposes of this case it is, I think, sufficient to refer to the judgment of Sir Montague Smith above mentioned, in which these words are found:\n* * * in cases of doubt, it may be that the interpretation should be against the vendor, but that must be understood of cases of doubt which cannot be otherwise solved. It would follow from these rules, that where a stipulation is capable of two meanings equally consistent with the language employed, that shall be taken which is most against the stipulator and in favour of the other party. But their lordships think that this contract is not properly capable of two meanings. In questions of difficult interpretation, not only two, but frequently many constructions may be suggested; and if that true construction can be arrived at with reasonable certainty, although with difficulty, then it cannot properly be said that there are two meanings to the contract.\nIn the case before us it is impossible, I think, to say, even admitting ambiguity, that the ambiguity is one which can be solved only by the application of the rather artificial maxim so invoked. Where ambiguity does occur in commercial contracts, it is a rule supported by good sense as well as by judicial practice to look to the previous dealings of the parties, if there have been such dealings, for assistance in ascertaining the sense in which the language of the contract has been employed by them. Now it so happens that contracts admittedly in virtually the same terms, that is to say, the same in all pertinent respects, had been made between the same parties in each of the two preceding years, and executed. In a letter dated the 16th September, addressed by the appellants to the respondents, it is asserted by the appellants that in each of these years, although the market price had risen above the contract price in the meantime, the appellants had delivered to the respondents pulpwood far in excess of the estimated quantities mentioned; the excess being in one case over twenty-five per cent, and in the other nearly one hundred per cent. This statement of fact is not disputed in the correspondence, although it is true that Mr. Hamilton, in his oral evidence, while admitting that the market price rose above the contract price in one of these years, denied that this occurred in both. I think it may be taken as established that the construction which both parties placed deliberately in one, at least, of the two preceding years upon a contract between them not sensibly different in language from that now in question, was the construction now contended for by the appellants.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the trial judge be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff with costs of the action. The precise amount which the appellant is entitled to recover depends to some extent upon the amount of his undelivered cut for 1920 and if the parties cannot agree as to this it should be spoken to on the settlement of the minutes.\nMignault J.\u2014The difficulty here has arisen in connection with the construction and effect of a contract whereby the appellant sold to the respondent\nall our rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut) about four thousand cords, 4,000 cords, at a price of $20 per cord of 128 cubic feet delivered at your mill in Grand'M\u00e8re.\nThe contract was verbal but was reduced to writing in the above terms in a letter written by the appellant company to the respondent, at the latter's request, on the 23rd of December, 1920. The price was subsequently reduced to $15 per cord f.o.b. loading point, and the appellant's letter to the respondent, dated the 28th of January, 1921, confirming the reduction, referred to the\nsale of all our rough pulpwood cut during 1920.\nThis letter was accepted by the respondent's representative, Mr. H. J. Hamilton, the latter states in his testimony.\nThe whole question now is whether the sale was of all the appellant's rough pulpwood cut during the 1920 season, or merely of \"about 4,000 cords\" of this pulpwood. The two courts below placed the latter construction on the contract, and consequently decided that the respondent having taken and paid for 4,400 cords had fulfilled its entire obligation under the contract. They considered that an addition of 10 per cent to the 4,000 cords would give full effect to the word \"about.\" The appellant appeals and contends that under the contract the respondent was obliged to take the whole of its 1920 cut of rough pulpwood, and claims the sum of $10,342.03 as the balance due.\nThere being here merely a question of construction, I do not think it necessary to look for similar cases in order to place a meaning on the language of the contract. The judgments of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench have moreover almost exhausted the possibility of further research and they have dealt both with English and French sources of authority. I do not think it necessary to follow their example and were I to do so I would restrict my inquiry to civil law authorities, the question arising under the civil and not under the common law. But, with great deference, I think that the language of the contract is clear and cannot give rise to any doubt as to its meaning.\nWhat the appellant sold to the respondent was\nall our rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut).\nAnd in its letter of January 28 to the respondent, it again refers to the \"sale of all our rough pulpwood cut during 1920.\" It is true that in the appellant's letter of December 23rd there is an estimate of quantity, \"about 4,000 cords.\" But these are obviously words of estimate, and not a description of the thing sold. This is not a case where a contract is attacked because of an error induced by an estimate made by one of the parties. Both the appellant and the respondent adhere to the contract and the question is what did the former sell and the latter buy? On my construction of the appellant's letter, the sale was of all its rough pulpwood cut of 1920 then hauled and being hauled, and not of a quantity of rough pulpwood estimated at about 4,000 cords.\nThe only remaining question is what amount is due to the appellant on this contract? The total quantity of rough pulpwood actually shipped by the appellant to the respondent, according to a statement filed by the appellant was, after correcting an error in addition, 4917\u00b761 cords. The appellant had on hand 509\u00b721 cords, and this was not shipped on account of the respondent's refusal to accept any more. Mr. Hamilton, the respondent's representative, in his testimony, stated that on the pulp-wood actually shipped to the respondent by the appellant, in excess of the quantity paid for, there would be due to the appellant, at contract prices, $2,841.11.\nThe state of accounts between the parties, according to exhibit P. 6, and to Mr. Hamilton's statement, would be then as follows:\nBalance due on rough pulpwood actually shipped\u2026....\n$2,841 11\n509 21 cords in hand at $15\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n7,638 15\n$10,479 26\nIt would appear, however, that out of the pulpwood in hand a certain quantity was made up of pulpwood purchased by the appellant from farmers, which would not come within the description of all the pulpwood cut by the appellant which alone was comprised in the sale it made to the respondent. By the copy of the appellant's books it purchased 302 cords of rough pulpwood from farmers. This wood, at $15 per cord, would amount to $4,530, and should not be charged to the respondent.\nDeducting this sum of $4,530 from the above amount of $10,479.26, the balance due by the respondent to the appellant would be $5,949.26, and the appellant must deliver to the respondent 207\u00b721 cords of rough pulpwood of the 1920 cut, this figure representing the residue of 509\u00b721 cords after deducting the 302 cords purchased from farmers.\nI would, therefore, with great respect, allow the appeal with costs throughout and give judgment to the appellant for $5,949.26 with interest from the service of the action upon the appellant shipping to the respondent 207\u00b721 cords of rough pulpwood of the 1920 cut in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nThe above figures of the undelivered balance of the pulpwood, after deduction of wood bought from the farmers, I have taken from the appellant's books. But the judgment of the court gives the parties the opportunity of coming to an agreement as to the balance due on the undelivered pulpwood, the matter, if they fail to agree, to be spoken to on the settlement of the minutes.\nMalouin J.\u2014L'appelante poursuit l'intim\u00e9e pour une somme de $10,342.03, balance de prix d'un contrat de vente de bois de pulpe non \u00e9corc\u00e9.\nLe contrat intervenu entre les parties est verbal; mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1920 dans une lettre adress\u00e9e par l'appelante \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e dans les termes suivants:\nWe beg to confirm sale of all rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut) about 4,000 cords, at a price of $20 per cord of 128 cubic feet delivered at your mill in Grand'M\u00e8re.\nCe prix fut plus tard r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $15 par corde, de consentement mutuel.\nL'appelante a exp\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 4,967.61 cordes et elle veut encore lui livrer 509\u00b721 cordes.\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu'en vertu de son contrat elle n'est pas tenue d'accepter plus de 4,400 cordes et se refuse d'accepter la diff\u00e9rence.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas tenue d'accepter plus de 4,000 cordes de bois avec en plus une marge de 10 pour 100.\nLa cour d'appel a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, le Juge Greenshields \u00e9tant dissident. C'est ce jugement qui nous est soumis.\nPour d\u00e9cider la question en litige, il faut se demander quel a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet de la vente, quelle est la chose que l'appelante a vendue et qu'elle a promis de livrer et que l'intim\u00e9e a promis d'accepter.\nLa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question se trouve dans le contrat m\u00eame. L'appelante a vendu toute sa coupe de bois de pulpe non \u00e9corc\u00e9 de 1920. Je soumets avec toute la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible que la coupe de 1920 est l'objet de la vente. Les mots \"4,000 cordes environ\" qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s dans le contrat ne sont l\u00e0 que comme estimation probable du nombre de cordes de bois qui se trouvait dans le lot vendu, ne liant en aucune mani\u00e8re la partie qui l'a faite.\nLe r\u00f4le ou la fonction du mot environ varie avec les circonstances. Si ce mot est ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l'objet du contrat, il a sa valeur et il faut en tenir compte; mais s'il est ajout\u00e9 a une chose accessoire il est sans importance.\nJe reproduis ci-dessous un passage de l'American and English Encyclopedia of Law, absolument au point, que je lis au mot \"about\":\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has laid down three rules for the construction of the terms \"about\" or \"more or less\" in executory contracts of sale, and the cases set out in the notes will be found in accord with these rules:\nFirst. Where the goods are identified by reference to independent circumstances, e.g., all the goods deposited in a certain warehouse, or all that may be manufactured by the vendor in a certain establishment, or to be shipped in certain vessels, and the quantity is named with the qualification of \"about,\" or \"more or less,\" or words of like import, the contract applies to the specific goods, and the naming of the quantity is not regarded as in the nature of a warranty, but only as an estimate of the probable amount, in reference to which good faith is all that is required of the party making it.\nSecond. Where no such independent circumstances are referred to, and the engagement is to furnish goods to a certain amount, the quantity specified is material, and governs the contract. The addition of the qualifying words, in such cases, only provides against accidental variations arising from slight and unimportant excesses or deficiencies in number, measure, or weight.\nThird. But the qualifying words may be supplemented by other stipulations or conditions, e.g., \"as much as the seller shall manufacture or the buyer shall require,\" and they will then govern the contract.\nJe cite ce passage comme autorit\u00e9 de raison. Les r\u00e8gies qui y sont pos\u00e9es sont raisonnables et peuvent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es utilement dans les contrats pass\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec comme partout ailleurs. Au reste, elles sont conformes aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par le conseil priv\u00e9 dans les causes cit\u00e9es par M. le juge Greenshields en cour d'appel et celles cit\u00e9es par M. le juge Duff dans ses notes pr\u00e9par\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Ces r\u00e8gies sont aussi conformes \u00e0 celles pos\u00e9es par Marcad\u00e9, vol. VI, en commentant les articles 1585 et 1586 du Code Napol\u00e9on cit\u00e9s par M. le juge Greenshields en cour d'appel.\nPar ces motifs, j'infirmerais le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de la cour d'appel et je condamnerais la d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e a payer \u00e0 la demanderesse la somme de $2,841.11 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, \u00e9tant la balance du prix du bois livr\u00e9, avec en outre le prix \u00e0 $15 la corde du bois non livr\u00e9 de sa coupe de 1920 (mais non celui achet\u00e9 des fermiers) payable sur livraison de bois, avec d\u00e9pens des trois cours. Maclean J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the appellant against the respondent, under a contract for the purchase and sale of pulpwood, the appellant being a producer of pulpwood, and the respondent a manufacturer of pulp and paper. The material part of the agreement is contained in a letter dated the 23rd December, 1920, written by the appellant, and in response to a letter from a representative of the respondent, asking confirmation of an oral agreement previously made respecting the same subject matter. The important part of the letter reads as follows:\nWe beg to confirm sale of all our rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut) about four thousand cords (4,000 cords) at a price of $20 per cord of 128 cubic feet delivered at your mill in Grand'M\u00e8re.\nAll the relevant facts are fully set forth in the judgments given in the court below, and I need not repeat them here, nor are they seriously in dispute. Neither is the good faith of the parties in the action in question.\nThe question is whether on the true construction of the contract, the respondent is liable to take delivery of the remainder of the appellant's entire cut of rough pulpwood for 1920, about 5,000 cords, and the point for our determination is whether, under the contract, there was a sale of about 5,000 cords of pulpwood, and whether the quantity, \"about four thousand cords\" are mere words of estimate, the subject matter of the sale being \"all our rough pulpwood now hauled and being hauled (1920 cut).\"\nI am of the opinion that the subject matter of the sale was all the rough pulpwood cut by the appellant in 1920. The appellant was on the one hand contracting to sell, and the respondent on the other hand contracting to buy, the appellant's 1920 cut of rough pulpwood, whatever that might happen to be. The estimate of 4,000 cords was substantially exceeded, but nevertheless the buyer is bound to take the excess whatever it turns out to be. In the course of previous dealings between the parties, in respect of the same subject matter and under contracts of substantially the same terms, the respondent accepted deliveries in excess of quantities estimated.\nThe respondent bargained for the 1920 cut of rough pulpwood, and it was that he purchased. The words \"about 4,000 cords\" are used merely as an estimate. In McLay & Company v. Perry & Company[5], the parties were dealing with a heap of scrap iron in a yard. The estimate was much greater than the heap turned out to be but inasmuch as it was held that what the parties bargained about was the heap, the fact that the estimate of what was in the heap was incorrect, was immaterial. In cases in which the bargaining was about \"cargo\" or \"remainder of cargo\" of some commodity, followed by estimates of quantity, it has been held that effect must be given to these words without reference to the quantity specified; Levi v. Berk[6]; Borrowman v. Drayton[7]. The offer to supply \"all the steel required by you for the Forth bridge\" was held to be the subject matter of the contract and not to be affected by words estimating the probable quantity required, Tancred Arrol & Co. v. The Steel Company of Scotland[8]. This rule of construction is affirmed in McConnell v. Murphy[9].\nIn all these cases one must look to the particular contract and construe it. It is perhaps difficult to lay down a general rule, but one must apply the ordinary rules of construction and endeavour to give to the words their reasonable and ordinary meaning. I think it is quite clear that in this case the appellant sold and the respondent purchased, the 1920 cut of rough pulpwood. The language used, and which is quite plain, permits only of this meaning. That was the subject matter of the contract, and it is not to be affected by any estimate of quantity. In my view the correct interpretation of this contract requires the acceptance of delivery by the respondent, of the quantity of pulpwood tendered by the appellant.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the trial judge should be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff with costs. The amount of the undelivered pulpwood belonging to the cut of 1920 has not been precisely fixed. If the parties cannot agree upon this the point may be spoken to on the settlement of the minutes.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Roy, Langlais, Langlais & Godbout.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\n[1] [1923] Q.R. 34 K.B. 565.\n[2] [1873] L.R. 5 P.C. 203, at p. 219.\n[3] [1890] 15 A.C. 125.\n[4] [1881] 44 L.T. 152.\n[5] 44 L.T. 152.\n[6] [1885] 2 Times L.R. 898, at p. 899.\n[7] [1876] 2 Ex.

Supreme Court Act, section 37.\nThe judgment appealed against was affirmed as to the question of damages.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming with a variation the judgment of a judge on appeal from a referee\u2019s report and on an application for payment of money out of court. In 1914 the appellant agreed to purchase certain lands from the respondent company on terms and conditions set out in the agreement and went into possession and sold some lots. In 1916 respondent purported to cancel the agreement, took possession of the land and cancelled the agreements for sale made by appellant and made new ones with the same parties. Appellant then brought action to have his agreement declared to be in force and for an accounting and damages. In this action the Supreme Court of Canada directed a reference to ascertain the damages suffered on matters specified. The referee reported over $6,000 due to appellant which was paid into court and a further sum due which was struck out by the judge in chambers who also refused an application by appellant for payment to him of the money in court. The appellant appealed to the Appellate Division to obtain the amount so struck out of the report and for payment of the money in court. The appeal was dismissed but the judgment was varied by allowing $800 of the money in court to be paid to appellant, no order being made as to the residue until the rights of the mortgage of the land originally purchased were determined. The appellant then took this appeal.\nChristopher Robinson K.C. and Cohen for the appellant.\nH.J. Scott K.C. and Newman for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Duff, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant entered into an agreement on the 6th day of November, 1914, with the respondents the Western Realty Company, Limited, and Davidson and one Hunter, whereby the said respondent company agreed to sell a large number of lots in the subdivision of part of lot no. 114 and lot no. 125, in the township of Stamford, known at Lundy Park, according to registered plan no. 44, and except lots coloured on the blueprint attached to said agreement.\nThe prices of each of said lots were named and the terms of payment set forth in said agreement.\nThe moving causes of the agreement evidently were that the respondent company had not been very successful in their venture to sell and hoped that the appellant, an experienced hand at the business, might, if encouraged by a liberal profit, do very much better than it had done.\nThe surplus over the prices named for each class or number was to become the property of the appellant.\nThe prices named, so far as necessary to entitle the appellant\u2019s sub-purchasers to get conveyances clear of encumbrances, were to be paid to the mortgagees, Davidson (now one of the respondents) and one Hunter\u2014the latter being no longer one.\nThe sales were to be made at a rate or rates of progress set forth in the agreement and, in default thereof, the further operation of the agreement was to cease upon notice to the now appellant.\nHe seems to have been very successful at first but later on rather slower than strictly entitled to be and, on the 19th of July, 1916, the said Western Realty Company gave notice pretending to cancel the said agreement as of said date, and took possession of the property.\nThe present appellant thereupon, on the 6th August, 1916, brought this action against the respondents and was unsuccessful at the trial and on appeal until reaching this court, when we found that the conduct of respondents herein had been such as to waive the right of either to give the notice of cancellation above referred to, and awarded him damages for the gross breach of the contract by not only dispossessing him of the property, but also advertising the fact.\nThe respondent Davidson was also held liable personally for damages for enticing away from his employment said Charles Bettal.\nAnd we directed there should be a reference to a referee to assess said respective claims for damages, and made several other directions.\nThe Official Referee made his first report on the 8th June, 1920.\nUpon appeal to Mr. Justice Middleton he made a number of changes in that report and sent it back to the referee, when he, as directed, went into many new features and reported finally on the 21st June, 1921.\nBy that report he found damages under the direction of our judgment to something over $6,000, which does not surprise me but seems to have appalled Mr. Justice Middleton who disallowed any damages.\nFrom that judgment appeal was taken by the appellant herein to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nOn the 7th September, 1918, an order was made appointing Davidson receiver of moneys payable by sub-purchasers of the appellant herein but as he had failed to account therefor Mr. Justice Middleton made an order that he should pass his accounts as such receiver before the said referee having in charge the other reference under the said judgment of this court.\nIt would seem as if after some difficulty he was got to do so and the referee reported the sum of $6,619.27 as having been got by him from sub-purchasers of the appellant.\nAgain that sum was reduced by order of Mr. Justice Middleton to $6,393.27, and that forms an item which came up for consideration by the said Appellate Division and that court refused to direct the payment out to the appellant of said sum.\nHence the appeal here as to the said damages and said moneys in court.\nIn the result the appellant\u2019s money is withheld apparently to meet some claim of the respondents, or either of them.\nAccording to my interpretation of the contract neither respondent had any right to collect said moneys or meddle with same but having done so merely as custodian under the direction of the court they are, I submit, in the hands of the court merely for the appellant.\nAs I understood whilst considering this appeal that the majority of this court were taking another view and holding that the appeal should be dismissed I concluded it would be entirely useless labour to go further into details and verify some of the items of the allowance for damages as I had intended to do, and the accuracy of the figures of what appellant is entitled to have paid out of court.\nI desire now only to present my reasons for dissenting from the judgment of the majority. The question of the case not being ripe for judgment seems to me answered by what I have just said.\nAnd as to the suggestion, only very mildly or faintly put forward in argument, that the appellant should have appealed from Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s first ruling that the report of the referee exceeded his jurisdiction, with that ruling I agree and clauses 12 and 13 were properly stricken out.\nI fail to see how there could have been any legitimate appeal. And I fail to see how, under Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s direction, the damages should not be stated in figures by the referee and properly assessed, and the items of interest and taxes the appellant might have been freed from by prosecuting and possibly finishing the work had he not been improperly meddled with, are clearly, to my mind, deserving of the most serious consideration both directly and indirectly.\nTo say that there is no evidence of any damages therein or any other aspect of the wrongful dealing by respondent with appellant\u2019s rights from the 19th July, 1918, to 17th February, 1919, seems beyond my comprehension after much reading of the evidence herein.\nWho knowing of the world and its affairs would like to take that as a guide to his chances in a deal such as in question?\nI would allow the appeal subject possibly to some modification of the figures.\nDUFF J.\u2014Effect must, I think, be given to Mr. Scott\u2019s objection that sub-paragraph (b) of the fourth paragraph of the judgment appealed from, in which the court refuses to make any order in respect of the residue of the moneys paid into court until the rights of the mortgagees have been ascertained, and without notice to purchasers who have not been received releases from the mortgagees, is not appealable. The judgment, in this part of it, does not determine \u201cin whole or in part any substantive right\u201d of the parties (3-4 Geo. V, c. 51, s. 2 (e); moreover, in this respect the judgment is discretionary in its nature within the meaning of R.S.C., c. 139, s. 45. The other question concerns the appellant\u2019s right to damages under clause 5 (b) of the judgment of this court on the 17th February, 1919, under which a reference is ordered to determine\nwhat damages have been suffered by the appellant by reason of the breaches by the respondent company of the said agreement dated the 6th of November, 1914, and of the wrongful interference by the respondent company with the rights of the appellant under said last mentioned agreements made by the appellant for the sale of lots\nin the subdivision in question. The referee, by his report of the 8th June 1920, directed (clauses 12 and 13 of the report), in purporting to deal with the matters referred under this head, that the date from which interest was payable by the appellant under the agreement of the 6th November, 1914, should be postponed for fifteen months and eighteen days, and the date from which taxes were payable should be postponed for seventeen months and twelve days respectively, after the confirmation of the final report. These clauses of the report (clauses 12 and 13) were struck out by Middleton J., on appeal, and the report was referred back to the referee to consider whether the appellant was entitled, under clause 5 (b) of the judgment, to any damages \u201cin lieu of the matters dealt with\u201d by those clauses. On this subject Middleton J., says:\u2014\nThis, as I understand it, covers two inquiries: first, as to damages by reason of breach of the agreement; and secondly, damages by reason of wrongful interference by the respondents with Diamond\u2019s sub-purchasers; and, thirdly, the Master is to find and report the damages suffered by the appellant by reason of the tampering with Bettel.\n1. By paragraph 12 of the Master\u2019s report he finds that the date from which interest is payable by the plaintiff should be postponed for a period of fifteen months and eighteen days after the date on which the final report is confirmed.\nBy the agreement it is provided that no interest shall be payable by the purchaser of a period three years from the 6th of November, 1914, but after the expiration of that period the purchaser shall pay on the unpaid purchase money, interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum, payable half-yearly. The Supreme Court has declared that this agreement, in its entirety is a valid and subsisting agreement, and I do not think that the Master had any jurisdiction to make the direction given.\n2. By paragraph 13 of the report the Master has found that the date from which taxes are payable as provided by the agreement is to be postponed for a period of seventeen months and twelve days after the date on which the final report is confirmed. The agreement provides that the vendor shall pay the taxes upon the whole of the property u to and inclusive of the year 1917, and, for the reasons given in dealing with the question of taxes, I can find no jurisdiction upon the reference to make the direction complained of. The referee, by his second report, dated 21st June, 1921, found that the appellant was entitled against the respondent company under clause 5 (b) of the judgment to the sum of $6,763.38 as damages. But this sum allowed by the referee as damages is made up of a series of items considered by him to be the equivalent, in a pecuniary sense, of the postponements allowed by his previous report and disallowed by the judgment of Middleton J. On appeal from this second report, Middleton J. discusses this feature of the report thus:\u2014\nThe next matter is the finding of the Master as to the damages to be allowed by reason of the wrongful cancellation of the agreements. This, I think, has been dealt with by the Master in an entirely erroneous way. In an earlier report he had followed, substantially, the same course and I allowed the appeal referring it back to the Master to allot damages upon a proper footing and my judgment was not appealed from. The present report is a reiteration of what was then deemed to be erroneous. What the Master has done is to allow to Diamond, by way of damages, a sum equivalent to interest on the amount of unpaid purchase money from November, 1917, to the 30th of June, 1921, which he estimates as the date upon which his report would become confirmed, and interest over a further period of six months thereafter, and a third sum as representing six months\u2019 interest on the price of 50 lots at $65 per lot, a fourth sum representing the interest on the price of 100 lots at $65 per lot for three months, and a fifth sum, representing taxes from 1st January, 1918, to the 30th June, 1921, and a sixth sum representing the assumed charge of the taxes for 17 months and 12 days up to the 1st July, 1921, these sums amounting to something over $6,000. It is manifestly inconceivable that this is the proper measure of damages. The theory is that because the agreement was cancelled when Diamond comes to purchase the remaining lots he may have to pay interest upon his purchase money, and he may have to pay taxes. But he has not paid this interest and he may never have to pay it; he may never carry out his purchase or pay the purchase price. What the Supreme Court no doubt thought was that damages should be paid by the company by reason of its wrongful interference with Diamond\u2019s right to purchase and sell to sub-purchasers. If it could be shewn that he had some organized scheme on hand for the selling of this land, and he had lost purchasers by reason of the wrongful cancellation, there would be some foundation for such a claim. He had already recovered damages for what was actually done. The company took over his organization, retained his agent and sold lots wherever a purchaser could be found, and it is not suggested in the evidence that any sale could have been made other than those that were made. Five hundred dollars has been fixed, and paid, in discharge of the claim for wrongful interference, and it has not been shewn that outside of this any damage whatever has been sustained. There was a period from the date of the cancellation to the date of the Supreme Court Judgment, that is, from 19th July, 1916, to 7th February, 1919, in which the company appeared as vendor instead of Diamond, but Diamond has taken over all those agreements, he has, on the accounting received credit for nine thousand odd dollars paid under them, and there is a further sum of about four thousand dollars to be paid by sub-purchasers of which he will have the benefit. All these accounts have been obtained for $900 allowed by way of commission, which is much less than the actual outlay for agent\u2019s commission and advertising. I think that this claim for damages is entirely unfounded and should be disallowed. As the company is in liquidation and has no assets, this matter is not one of importance, for clearly no such liability for damages could be allowed to interfere with the rights of the mortgagees whose claim will overtop the balance due for purchase money if the contract is carried out in its entirety.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of Middleton J. was on this point affirmed.\nI agree with the view of Middleton J. Virtually there is a finding of fact by him that the appellant, having had the advantage of the efforts put forth and the moneys expended by the Western Realty Company for the purpose of selling the land in which the appellant was interested, had not in fact suffered any loss (within the categories of damages the referee was directed to consider) other than that for which compensation had been made by the allowance ($300) mentioned. That finding of fact cannot be successfully impeached.\nIn truth, in the argument addressed to us by Mr. Robinson it was hardly contended that there was evidence which could justify a finding that damages had in fact been sustained by the appellant to the amount found by the referee. The real point of his argument was that Diamond having been prevented from performing his contract by the vendor, he was in point of law relieved from his obligation to pay interest and taxes accruing during the interregnum or for a period corresponding with the interregnum.\nNow to this argument there appears to be one conclusive answer. The point raised by it was decided against Diamond in the judgment given by Mr. Justice Middleton on the appeal from the first report. The claim thus advanced was one he held which the referee, under the terms of the reference, had no jurisdiction to examine. This judgment of the learned judge was a definite decision upon a definite point of law. From that decision no appeal was taken, and it seems to put an end to the controversy.\nIt is true that in a sense the decision was interlocutory; that is to say, the proceeding in which it was given was an interlocutory proceeding; but it was nevertheless a final decision in the sense that in the absence of appeal it became binding upon all parties to it.\nAs Lord Macnaghten said, in Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin[1]:\u2014\nIn the words of the Digest, lib. xliv, t. 2, s. 7 \u201cexceptio rei judicatae obstat quotiens eadem quaestio inter easdem personas revocatur.\u201d It is not competent for the court, in the case of the same question arising between the same parties, to review a previous decision not open to appeal. If the decision was wrong, it ought to have been appealed from in due time.\nThe application of the principle is not affected, it is, perhaps, needless to say, by the circumstance that the first decision is pronounced in course of the same action; Badar Bee v. Habib1; Ram Kirpal Shukul v. Mussumat Rup Kuari[2]; Hesseltine v. Nelles[3]; nor is it material that the reasons for judgment, as distinguished from the formal judgment itself, must be examined in order to ascertain the scope of that decision. Hook v. Administrator General of Bengal[4]; Ramachandra Rao v. Ramachandra Rao[5].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMALOUIN J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Duff.\nMACLEAN J.\u2014I concur in the judgment which has been prepared by Mr. Justice Duff and think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cohen & Cohen.\nSolicitor for the respondent Davidson: George E.

Had the legislature of Manitoba authority to enact chapter 17 of its statutes of 1923, intituled \"An Act to provide for the collection of a Tax from persons selling grain for Future Delivery? \"\n2. If the said Act be, in the opinion of the Court, ultra vires in part only, then in what particulars is it ultra vires?\nSection 3 of said Act enacts as follows:\u2014\n3. Upon every contract of sale of grain for future delivery made at, on or in any exchange, or similar institution or place of business in Manitoba, except as hereinafter provided, the seller or his broker or agent shall pay to His Majesty for the public use of the province a tax computed upon the gross quantities of grain sold or agreed to be sold, as follows: Upon every thousand bushels of flaxseed, twelve cents; upon every thousand bushels of wheat, six cents; upon every thousand bushels of oats, barley or rye, three cents.\nThe chief question argued herein was whether this enactment is within the power of the Provincial Legislature which admittedly is confined to item no. 2 of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, for the power to impose the tax.\nAnd the old-time dispute as to what may fall within the words therein \"Direct taxation within the province\" is started again, under some rather curious conditions peculiar to the city of Winnipeg and the province of Manitoba.\nThe tax is specific upon the respective quantities named of each kind of grain in question. It cannot, therefore, find any support for the maintenance and enforcement of a tax by way of licence fee for permission to carry on business as was upheld in the case of Brewers and Malsters Association of Ontario v. The Attorney General of Ontario[6].\nIt is therefore quite open for the provinces objecting to this legislation to argue, as they have done, not only that it is quite within the right of the broker or agent buying to add to the price current this tax, but that it is the inevitable result of his being human that he will do so. Hence it is argued that it cannot be said to be direct taxation that is imposed. I must say that there is in the cases cited much to support such contention. Indeed the clear and obvious result in fact inevitably leads me to the conclusion that there is involved in the enforcement of such legislation a clear violation, as regards grain coming from Saskatchewan or Alberta, of section 121 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014\n121. All articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other provinces.\nWhy the objection taken in the letter of complaint from the Attorney General of Saskatchewan to the Minister of Justice for Canada seems to have been dropped I cannot say.\nTo me it seems an invitation to legislatures disposed to violate or ignore said enactment\u2014as some have been known to do\u2014to await such recognition as a means of entitling them to enact similar statutes, and by degrees get rid of such express prohibition.\nIn this case it will become all the more offensive, if the Act now in question be upheld, as it leads to the favouring of the province of Manitoba, which surrounds Winnipeg, the centre of the grain trade of the West, getting by virtue of the exceptions in section 4 of the said Act a very serious advantage over more remote provinces.\nIt would be easy for these grain growers, within a day's drive of Winnipeg, to take advantage of the exceptions, whilst almost impossible for those in Alberta and Saskatchewan to do so, in ways I need not dwell upon but obvious to any one giving the exceptions and surrounding circumstances careful study.\nI am of the opinion that, for the foregoing reasons alone, the Act in question is ultra vires.\nI can see no useful purpose that any part of it can serve if I am right in the views I have expressed.\nWe must recognize the well known facts that crossing Manitoba is, for grain growers west thereof, almost an absolute necessity in order to get to their best market, whether we call it Liverpool or Fort William, and all important therefore that no impediment be thrown in their way.\nAnd the grain dealers in either of said western provinces having bought from the farmers therein their crops of grain grown there, or part thereof, are entitled to enter Manitoba, and even Winnipeg, and sell such crop there free of any tax, if said section 121 is to mean anything.\nIt is quite clear that under the Act in question said grain dealers in doing so will have to pay said tax.\nAnd that, without touching or playing upon the old question of direct or indirect tax, renders the Act ultra vires.\nDuff J.\u2014This reference raises again the question of the construction of head no. 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act. The legislation in dispute is an Act of the Legislature of Manitoba, c. 3, passed in the session of 1923, entitled An Act to Provide for the Collection of a Tax from Persons Selling Grain for Future Delivery. The important sections are sections 3, 4 and 5, and they are in these terms:\n3. Upon every contract of sale of grain for future delivery made at, on or in any exchange, or similar institution or place of business in Manitoba, except as hereinafter provided, the seller or his broker or agent shall pay to His Majesty for the public use of the province a tax computed upon the gross quantities of grain sold or agreed to be sold, as follows: Upon every thousand bushels of flaxseed, twelve cents; upon every thousand bushels of wheat, six cents; upon every thousand bushels of oats, barley or rye, three cents.\n4. No such tax shall be payable in any case in which:\n(a) the seller is the grower of the grain, or\n(b) either party to the contract is the owner or tenant of the land upon which the grain is to be grown, or\n(c) the sales are cash sales of grain or other products or merchandise which in good faith are actually intended for immediate or deferred delivery (such transactions for the purposes of this Act to be evidenced by the actual transfer of the tickets, storage or warehouse receipts, bills of lading or lake shippers' clearance receipts, or other documents of title for grain transferring actual ownership from the vendor to the purchaser in exchange for the price at the maturity of the contract), or\n(d) the sales are \"transfer\" or \"scratch sales\" or \"pass-outs,\" provided that the purchase and sale are made at the same exchange, on the same day, at the same price, and for the accounts of the same person, or\n(e) the sales are made by a broker on account of a principal, and the name of the principal is not disclosed to the buyer, provided the principal sells to the broker the same quantity and the same grade and kind of grain at the same price, on the same day, on the same exchange, the only tax in this case being the tax payable by the principal.\n5. The tax imposed by this Act shall be a direct tax upon the person actually entering into the contract of sale, whether such person is the principal in the contract or is acting only in the capacity of a broker or agent for some other person and is imposed solely in order to supplement the revenues of this province.\nAgainst this legislation the governments of Saskatchewan and Alberta protested and petitioned the government of the Dominion to put into effect the power of disallowance; and the question of the validity of the statute was referred to this court by an order of the Governor in Council. The grounds of attack are set out very clearly in the correspondence which has been put before us, and an agreed statement of facts placed in our hands by counsel indicates the course of business in connection with dealings in western grain. As a rule a sale of grain, whether by the farmer graingrower or the country warehouseman or the lake terminal dealer, is accompanied by a \"hedge\" by the purchaser, who sells an equivalent quantity for future delivery, which sale he in turn cancels as a rule by a purchase for future delivery when the grain to which he has actually acquired the title is sold. These transactions by grain dealing firms or companies\u2014elevator companies, milling companies and exporters\u2014are effected in most, though by no means in all, cases on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, and constitute a large part of the dealings in futures. Then a good many transactions take place through the medium of brokers, and dealers, members of the Exchange, acting as brokers, who act for persons who are not members of the Exchange, and receive a commission for their services. Then again, members of the Exchange buy and sell future rights on their own account, usually by way of speculation. The price in these transactions is that fixed in the international market, and the price received by the farmer is governed by that which the dealer expects to get or knows he will get. The argument on behalf of Alberta and Saskatchewan is that in its normal operation the tax is ultimately borne by the farmer, who receives a price which is the dealer's price less profit and the costs of the transaction; and these costs, it is contended, must include the tax. It may be assumed that the tendency would be to throw this tax, as a part of the costs of the transaction, upon the seller, but many circumstances may combine to determine the actual practice, and where the tax is very small, as in this case, it may well be that dealers would prefer to bear the incidence of it themselves; and according to the statement of facts so far as known that is the practice. If this were the only point to consider in connection with this legislation, I should be disposed to think there was little doubt that this was the expected and intended operation of the law, and that the legislature had desired to levy a tax which should be paid by the person actually entering into the contract and borne by him; and that as the tax in its actual operation does fall upon the dealer, who is called upon to pay it, it is one which is within the competence of the legislature.\nThe point is of some little importance because it raises the question whether, in controversies arising upon item number 2 of section 92, we are entitled to proceed by relating the tax whose legality is impeached to the class\u2014 as direct or indirect\u2014to which as a rule taxes of its general nature would be referred, and to uphold or condemn it accordingly. A tax on the sale of commodities, for example, would, as an excise duty or a customs duty, be regarded according to this procedure as an indirect tax and outside the powers of the provinces. But a tax on production or upon sale may have, and in special circumstances undoubtedly has, no effect upon price. Where, for example, the ultimate price at which a commodity from time to time is sold is determined in an international market, and is known to everybody concerned through daily quotations, an annually recurring tax will have no effect, even in determining the price so fixed, unless it be of such magnitude and levied in such circumstances as to reach the marginal supply. And obviously the ultimate price, once fixed in such circumstances, will govern the terms of transactions throughout the entire series, from the initial seller to the ultimate buyer. Again, to take another example, a tax levied on sales by western farmers of grain grown by themselves would be in fact, as well as in intention, a tax to be borne by the very person who is called upon to pay it.\nI think counsel for Manitoba is right in his contention that the actual, normal operation of the tax, as the legislature may be assumed to know it, must be considered.\nThe statute, therefore, in so far as it levies a tax upon principals in the transactions to which it applies, would, if the legislation were so limited, be in my opinion valid. I am unable, however, to perceive how, consistently with the decisions upon the subject, it is possible to sustain the tax upon brokers and agents as a legitimate exercise of the authority of the provinces in relation to direct taxation. Insignificant in amount as the impost is, one is not surprised to find that in practice, as a rule, the broker charges the sum paid on account of it to his principal. The aggregate of such sums paid by any broker in the course of the year would, no doubt, be considerable. In this respect the statute must, I think, on the authority of Cotton's Case[7] as explained and applied in the subsequent decisions, be held to be obnoxious to the restrictions imposed upon the provincial authority. Section 5 makes it impossible to treat the broker as \"agent\" of the principal for collection.\nThe question which has given me most concern is whether the illegal part of the statute can be severed from the legal part. Not without some hesitation I have come to the conclusion that section 5 precludes this. As I read that section it is the person, whether as broker, agent or principal, who does the act by which the principal is bound as seller, who incurs legal liability to pay under the statute, and only he. The effect, therefore, of eliminating from section 3 the words \"or his broker or agent,\" would be to remove from the operation of the statute all those transactions which are effected by brokers or agents. I am by no means confident that an enactment expressed in such terms would be an enactment which the legislature intended to pass, but however that may be I am unable to discover in the language of these sections any sufficient expression or evidence of intention to pass such an enactment.\nAnglin J. takes no part in the judgment.\nMignault J.\u2014The point submitted for the opinion of the court is whether the Legislature of Manitoba had the right to pass chapter 17 of the statutes of 1923, being an Act imposing a tax on persons selling grain for future delivery. There are two questions. The first is whether the legislature had authority to enact this statute, and the second, in the event of the court being of opinion that the Act is ultra vires in part only, asks in what particulars it is ultra vires.\nThe taxing provision of this statute is section 3, which is in the following terms:\u2014 3. Upon every contract of sale of grain for future delivery made at, on or in any exchange, or similar institution or place of business in Manitoba, except as hereinafter provided, the seller or his broker or agent shall pay to His Majesty for the public use of the province a tax computed upon the gross quantities of grain sold or agreed to be sold, as follows: Upon every thousand bushels of flaxseed, twelve cents; upon every thousand bushels of wheat, six cents; upon every thousand bushels of oats, barley or rye, three cents.\nSection 4 contains certain exceptions which cut down the generality of section 3. It is as follows:\u2014\n4. No such tax shall be payable in any case in which:\n(a) the seller is the grower of the grain, or\n(b) either party to the contract is the owner or tenant of the land upon which the grain is to be grown, or\n(c) the sales are cash sales of grain or other products or merchandise which in good faith are actually intended for immediate or deferred delivery (such transactions for the purposes of this Act to be evidenced by the actual transfer of the tickets, storage or warehouse receipts, bills of lading or lake shippers' clearance receipts, or other documents of title for grain transferring actual ownership from the vendor to the purchaser in exchange for the price at the maturity of the contract), or\n(d) the sales are \"transfer\" or \"scratch sales\" or \"pass-outs,\" provided that the purchase and sale are made at the same exchange, on the same day, at the same price, and for the account of the same person, or\n(e) the sales are made by a broker on account of a principal, and the name of the principal is not disclosed to the buyer, provided the principal sells to the broker the same quantity and the same grade and kind of grain at the same price, on the same day, on the same exchange, the only tax in this case being the tax payable by the principal.\nSection 5 declares that the tax shall be a direct tax upon the person actually entering into the contract of sale, whether such person is the principal in the contract or is acting only in the capacity of a broker or agent for some other person. Of course, stating that the tax is a direct tax will not make it one, but this section is not without importance in determining what was the intention of the legislature when it imposed the tax.\nThe parties heard on this reference have agreed upon a statement of facts explaining the course of business in the sale of grain from its point of origin to its final destination. It is apparent from this statement that the grain produced in the grain growing areas of the West is the subject of several transactions, many of them of a speculative character, although it must be assumed that the legislature had in view real and not fictitious or gambling dealings, for the latter would be illegal. By the process of \"hedging,\" the same quantity of grain may be sold and bought several times, and one \"hedge\" may be offset against another, so that, in the final analysis, with the \"hedging\" transactions balancing or offsetting each other, there may well be but one sale and one purchase really carried into effect in each step as the grain passes from the producer, through one or more middlemen, until it reaches the consumer. The complication of this situation is further enhanced by the fact that the producer may sell the same quantity of grain to a country elevator, the country elevator to a terminal elevator, and the latter to the exporter who in turn will sell it on the foreign market, and on each of these transactions there will probably be \"hedging\" purchases and sales with the object of protecting the seller or the purchaser. This is clearly shewn by the statement of facts to which I need not further refer.\nThe exceptions to the taxing rule enumerated in section 4, in so far as they concern the producer, free him from the obligation to pay a tax on the sale of grain grown by him, and where either party to the contract is owner or tenant of the land upon which the grain is to be grown no tax is payable. Also free from the taxing rule are cash sales of grain which in good faith are actually intended for immediate or deferred delivery, and are evidenced by the actual transfer of the documents of title representing the grain.\nThis shews that the sales which are subject to the tax will often, but of course not necessarily, be speculative sales, and it is when they are effected on or in any exchange or similar place of business in Manitoba that they become taxable under the Act. By speculative sales I mean those that are real as opposed to fictitious or gambling transactions. This I have already said must be assumed.\nWe are told that the price of grain is determined by the conditions of the world market in Liverpool, England. There are several grain producing countries outside of Canada. In the selling market at Liverpool the economic rule of supply and demand determine the price at which the grain can be sold. And the selling price at Liverpool for grain to be delivered at the time contemplated, regulates the price which the intermediate purchasers, the terminal elevator and the country elevator, will pay to the producer. It is therefore argued by the attorney generals of Saskatchewan and Alberta that this tax really falls on the producer of the grain, for it must be deducted, with all other expenses, from the price which will be paid for his grain, the selling price at Liverpool remaining the same.\nIt is conceivable that it could also be said that this tax will fall upon the purchaser at Liverpool, for producers of grain in the grain growing countries of the world will not sell their grain at a loss, and they will consider, and the purchaser at Liverpool must expect that they will consider, what it will cost to bring their grain to the Liverpool market. Any withholding of the grain by the producers of the world would very conceivably tend to enhance the price which the purchaser at Liverpool would have to pay.\nIn either case the tax in question would come within John Stuart Mill's definition of an indirect tax which the Judicial Committee in Cotton v. The King[8], accepted as authoritative, for it is a tax which is demanded\nfrom one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another.\nThat this is the character of the tax imposed by the Manitoba statute I cannot doubt. It is exacted from the seller or his broker or agent (section 3), and section 5 states that it is a tax\nupon the person actually entering into the contract of sale, whether such person is the principal in the contract or is acting only in the capacity of a broker or agent for some other person.\nSurely where the actual sale is by a broker on account of a principal\u2014and sales on a grain exchange will in the vast majority of cases be sales effected by a broker or agent for principals\u2014and the broker pays the tax, he will charge it to his principal. This must have been in the contemplation of the Legislature of Manitoba when it imposed the tax on the person actually entering into a contract of sale in the capacity of a broker or agent for some other person. The tax is none the less an indirect tax because conceivably sales may sometimes be effected by the principal himself without any broker, if indeed a principal can sell upon an exchange which does not recognize him as a member, and even then the seller would have regard to the amount of the tax in determining the price at which he will sell his grain. I might add that although the amount of the tax in respect of the unit of one thousand bushels may appear small, it would be much more considerable on large transactions, so it would be vain to expect that the broker would absorb the tax among his expenses and not charge it to his principal.\nSome of the decisions of the Judicial Committee may be referred to as shewing where taxes on account of their incidence have been held to be indirect.\nAttorney General for Quebec v. Queens Ins, Co.[9]. A statute of the province of Quebec had imposed a tax upon certain policies of insurance and renewal receipts, computed at a certain percentage of the premium charged to the insured, and payable by means of adhesive stamps affixed by the insured on the policy or receipt at the time of the delivery thereof. This was held to be indirect taxation.\nAttorney General for Quebec v. Reed[10]. The statute here under consideration imposed a duty of ten cents upon every exhibit filed in court in any action therein pending. This also was held to be indirect taxation.\nIn Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[11], the tax was upon certain commercial corporations, including banks, carrying on business within the province, and varied in amount with the paid-up capital and number of offices of the corporation. This was decided to be direct taxation, their Lordships observing (p. 584):\u2014\nIt is not a tax upon any commodity which the bank deals in and can sell at an enhanced price to its customers. It is not a tax on its profits, nor on its several transactions. It is a direct lump sum, to be assessed by simple reference to its paid-up capital and its places of business.\nThe tax on the grain futures in question here is not a tax on the business carried on, or the capital owned, by the seller. It is a tax on the transaction itself which would naturally be charged by the broker to the person on whose behalf he has entered into the contract of sale. It would clearly be indirect in its incidence. The case of Cotton v. The King[12], may be referred to as shewing that in the view of their Lordships took of the statute, the tax was indirect because the person who paid it, notary or executors, would naturally call upon the beneficiary for whom he was acting to recoup him, and thus their Lordships considered that the tax came within the definition of an indirect tax which they adopted.\nUpon my best consideration of the questions submitted, my opinion is that the tax which the Legislature of Manitoba seeks to impose is an indirect one. The statute is therefore ultra vires.\nI would answer question one in the negative.\nQuestion 2 does not require any answer because in my opinion the statute in substance and as a whole is ultra vires.\nMalouin J.\u2014The Governor General in Council has referred to this court, for hearing and determination, chapter 17 of the Statutes of the Province of Manitoba, 1923.\nThis Act is intituled\nan Act to provide for the collection of a tax from persons selling grain for future delivery.\nIt received the Royal assent on the 27th of April, 1923.\nThe province of Saskatchewan made representations to His Excellency the Governor General in Council in regard to the enactment in question upon the ground that it was ultra vires the provincial legislature.\nThe following questions have been referred to this court:\u2014\n1st. Had the Legislature of Manitoba authority to enact section 17 of its statutes of 1923 intituled \"An Act to provide for the collection of a tax from persons selling grain for future delivery?\"\n2nd. If the said Act be, in the opinion of this court, ultra vires in part, then in what part is it ultra vires.\nThe submission on behalf of the province of Saskatchewan and Alberta is that the statute is ultra vires of a provincial legislature. Special exception is taken to sections 3, 4 and 5 of the enactment. The three following sections are those to which exception is taken:\n3. Upon every contract of sale of grain for future delivery made at, on or in any exchange, or similar institution or place of business in Manitoba, except as hereinafter provided, the seller or his broker or agent shall pay to His Majesty for the public use of the province a tax computed upon the gross quantities of grain sold or agreed to be sold, as follows: Upon every thousand bushels of flaxseed, twelve cents; upon every thousand bushels of wheat, six cents; upon every thousand bushels of oats, barley or rye, three cents.\n4. No such tax shall be payable in any case in which:\n(a) the seller is the grower of the grain, or\n(b) either party to the contract is the owner or tenant of the land upon which the grain is to be grown, or\n(c) the sales are cash sales of grain or other products or merchandise which in good faith are actually intended for immediate or deferred delivery (such transactions for the purposes of this Act to be evidenced by the actual transfer of the tickets, storage or warehouse receipts, bills of lading or lake shippers' clearance receipts, or other documents of title for grain transferring actual ownership from the vendor to the purchaser in exchange for the price at the maturity of the contract), or\n(d) the sales are \"transfer\" or \"scratch sales\" or \"pass-outs,\" provided that the purchase and sale are made at the same exchange, on the same day, at the same price, and for the account of the same person, or\n(e) the sales are made by a broker on account of a principal, and the name of the principal is not disclosed to the buyer, provided that the principal sells to the broker the same quantity and the same grade and kind of grain at the same price, on the same day, on the same exchange, the only tax in this case being the tax payable by the principal.\n5. The tax imposed by this Act shall be a direct tax upon the person actually entering into the contract of sale, whether such person is the principal in the contract or is acting only in the capacity of a broker or agent for some other person and is imposed solely in order to supplement the revenues of this province.\nThe taxing powers of a provincial legislature are determined by section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, as follows:\u2014\n92. In each province, the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say:\u2014\n(2) Direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nThe first exception taken to the Act by the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta is that while the object of the Act in question is undoubtedly the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, it is not in its operation and effect confined to direct taxation in the province of Manitoba.\nIt seems to me that the remarks of Lord Hobhouse in the Lambe Case[13], is a complete answer to that:\u2014\nIt is urged that the bank is a Toronto corporation having its domicile there and having its capital place there; that the tax is on the capital of the bank; that it must therefore fall on a person or persons or on property not within Quebec. The answer to this argument is that class 2 of section 92 does not require that persons to be taxed by Quebec are to be domiciled or even resident in Quebec. Any person found within the province may legally be taxed there if taxed directly. This bank is found to be carrying on business there and on that ground alone it is taxed.\nThe second exception taken to the Act is that the tax imposed by this statute is an indirect tax.\nThe definition of the expression \"direct tax\" given by John Stuart Mill, in his book on Political Economy, seems to be accepted by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This definition is as follows:\u2014\nTaxes are either direct or indirect. A direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another; such are the excise or customs.\nIn Cotton v. The King[14], the Act provided that executors, administrators and trustees should be personally liable for the duties chargeable in respect of the estates which they represented. The Privy Council held in that case that this was an attempt to impose taxation upon persons who were intended not themselves to bear the burden but to be recouped by someone else and that the taxation was therefore indirect and the Act ultra vires.\nApplying that authority to this case, I say that Chapter 17 of the Statutes of the Province of Manitoba intituled: \"An Act to provide for the collection of a tax from persons selling grain for future delivery\" is ultra vires, because it is enacted in sections 3 and 5 of the Act that the tax is imposed not only on the principal in the contract but on the broker or agent for some other person. It is obvious that the broker or agent for another person will not bear the burden but will be recouped by someone else. This taxation is therefore indirect.\nTo the first question, I answer: No.\nBeing of opinion that the statute as a whole is ultra vires the second question needs no answer.\n[1] [19191 60 Can.

V, c. 8 (D)\u2014Ontario Temperance Act\u2014Prohibition of sale of liquor\u2014Action for declaratory judgment\u2014Parties\u2014Status.\nPart IV of the Canada Temperance Act enacted by 10 Geo. V, c. 8, prohibiting, in a province which adopts it, the manufacture and importation of intoxicating liquor, is in force in Ontario.\nThe Ontario Temperance Act, 6 Geo. V, c. 50 and its amendments, is an Act prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes and enables the Legislative Assembly, by resolution and a vote favourable thereto, to make Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act a law of the province notwithstanding it permits the manufacture and sale of wine containing a large percentage of alcohol, the manufacture and export of malt and spirituous liquors and extra-provincial transactions in liquor.\nS., residing in Ontario, gave an order to a firm in Montreal to send him a specified quantity of intoxicating liquor. The firm refused the order on the ground that by filling it the Ontario Temperance Act would be violated and S. brought an action against the Attorney General of Ontario asking for a judgment declaring that Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act was not in force in that province.\nHeld, that S. had no status to maintain such action. Judgment of the Appellate Division (53 Ont. L.R. 572) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial which dismissed the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe circumstances which led to the bringing of the action for a declaratory judgment are stated in the above head-note. This appeal raises the question of whether or not Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act is in force in Ontario which depends on the further question, namely, is the Ontario Temperance Act an \u201cAct prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes?\u201d The appellant claims that it is not.\nRowell K.C. for the respondent moves to quash the appeal on three grounds: 1. Leave should have been obtained. 2. It involves a matter of practice and procedure in Ontario. 3. The judgment appealed from was given in the exercise of judicial discretion. The court reserves judgment and orders that the hearing proceed on the merits.\nH.J. Scott K.C. and Tilley K.C. for the appellant. When the resolution purporting to bring Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act into force in Ontario there was no law in the province \u201cprohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.\u201d The Ontario Temperance Act which allowed native wine to be sold and authorized transactions for sale of malt and spirituous liquors was not such an Act, and the subsequent proceedings under Part IV were nugatory. See Gold Seal Co. v. Attorney General of Alberta[2].\nThe appellant was entitled to bring this action for a declaratory judgment. [1924] 1 D.L.R. 1; Dyson v. Attorney General[3].\nRowell K.C. and Brennan for the respondent. If such an action as this lies at all the Attorney General of Canada should be the defendant. See Independent Cordage Co. v. The King[4] at page 630.\nAn action for a declaratory judgment cannot be brought against the Crown. Dyson v. Attorney General3 does not apply to Ontario practice. Electrical Development Co. v. Attorney General for Ontario[5].\nThe law in force in a province when the resolution is passed to bring Part IV into force need not provide for absolute prohibition.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant by this action seeks to have a declaratory judgment as to the effect of certain legislation relative to the prohibiting of importing intoxicating liquors into Ontario. He has no other foundation for his action against the Attorney General than that he wrote several dealers in Montreal requesting each of them to supply him, in Toronto, with such liquors, by shipment from Montreal, in the province of Quebec, and their respective refusals on the ground that doing so would be illegal.\nThe respondent had taken no steps in such matter, nor threatened to do so. Nor had any one on his behalf done so.\nHe rests his case upon the authority of Dyson v. The Attorney General[6], and subsequent cases following same and founded on facts analogous to those on which that case turned. The concrete cases presented therein of claims, so respectively made, demonstrate a legal situation whereby a claim was actually made on behalf of the Crown of which the Attorney General was the representative and hence likely to prosecute or liable to be brought into litigation actually threatened.\nThe appellant presents no such concrete case but a merely speculative case as a British subject that he might, in certain eventualities which have not transpired, be followed by the Attorney General although as yet no such attempt has been made or even threatened or the foundation laid for such action or threat.\nIn my opinion this is a straining of the said decisions a long way beyond what they are founded upon.\nIn short it is an attempt to elicit an opinion from the courts which, under the facts, they have no right to give either one way or the other.\nSo strongly do I hold this to be the case that I must respectfully decline to express any opinion on the questions sought to be raised.\nTo declare upon such request the interpretation or construction of such acts as in question, under such circumstances, I respectfully submit, is beyond our province.\nI, therefore, am of the opinion, with all due respect, that such should have been the view taken by the courts below and should be that of this court in regard to this appeal unless we are quite prepared to assent to such like requests on any point of law puzzling any private citizen on any question, for the Attorney General may be said to represent on behalf of the Crown the due and correct appreciation of any statute enacted by the Crown by and with the advice of any duly constituted legislature.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff and Maclean JJ. was delivered by Duff J.\nDUFF J.\u2014It is convenient first to discuss the question raised by the objection taken in limine on behalf of the Attorney General. On behalf of the appellant the decision of the Court of Appeal in Dyson v. Attorney General[7] is cited, and that decision and the series of cases which followed it are relied upon in support of the proposition that in the circumstances of this case the appellant has a title to ask for a judicial declaration on the point in dispute, whether, namely: Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act has been brought into force in relation to Ontario. We assume, against the Attorney General, that if the appellant has a title at all the Attorney General of the province is the proper defendant\u2014or at all events a proper defendant\u2014without giving a decision on the question. We assume also, and as regards this point we may as well say that we have been quite unable to follow the argument addressed to us on behalf of the Attorney General, that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ontario to pronounce declaratory judgments is a jurisdiction exercisable in cases in which the Crown is a defendant, and without the Crown\u2019s consent.\nThe circumstances giving rise to the action, stripped of non-essentials, are that the appellant, who is a resident of Toronto, ordered from a dealer in Montreal a case of Dewar\u2019s Scotch Whisky and some ale and lager beer. In reply the dealer said that in view of the fact that the Canada Temperance Act had been brought into force in Ontario, and that importation of whisky into the province was thereby prohibited, he declined to accept the order. Counsel on behalf of the appellant points out that the order of the Governor General in Council professes under section 153 of the Canada Temperance Act to declare that part in force in Ontario, that the validity of the order in council has been assumed, and that the Act has been enforced by the exaction of the penalties prescribed by it, and by the Ontario Temperance Act, relative to the possession or transport in Ontario of liquor imported into the province. Contending, as he does, that the order in council is illegal and invalid, and that these penalties are not legally exigible, he is debarred, he says, from exercising his legal right to bring liquor into the province, except under conditions which are in practice intolerable\u2014that is to say, by subjecting himself and everybody acting for him to criminal proceedings with their humiliating incidents; indeed that the very existence of the order in council, coupled with the fact that the penal clauses of the statutes are being enforced on the assumption that they are the law of the land, has the effect of preventing dealers in Canada selling him liquor for import into Ontario, and prevents transport companies and others acting for him in course of their lawful business in the transport of such merchandise into or in that province.\nOf the decisions relied upon by the appellant, Dyson\u2019s Case[8] and Burghes v. Attorney General[9] may be considered typical. They arose in these circumstances:\u2014\nThe Finance Commissioners, having certain strictly defined powers by statute, delivered to the plaintiffs a list of questions with a peremptory demand that they should be answered within a nominated time, and the notice contained an intimation, which amounted to a threat, that, unless the demand was complied with, proceedings would be taken to recover the penalties authorized by the statute under which they professed to act. The time nominated was less than the time permitted by the Act; the answers demanded were not answers which the Act authorized the Commissioners to require; and the demands therefore were illegal demands. These notices had been sent broadcast over the country under the authority of the Commissioners, and it may be added that the penalties to which the threat referred were penalties recoverable in the Supreme Court of Judicature, at the instance of the Attorney General. There was in each case a demand actually made by the Finance Commissioners, professing to act under the authority of statute, a demand which they were not entitled to make, accompanied by a threat that if the illegal demand were not complied with the person to whom the notice was addressed would be subjected to proceedings at the suit of the Attorney General for penalties.\nTwo points should be noted in relation to these authorities: first, there was no decision upon a hypothetical state of facts, and secondly, the demand in each case was a personal demand and an illegal attempt to constrain the plaintiff personally by an illegal threat addressed to him as an individual. These points appear, superficially at all events, to mark rather important distinctions between the circumstances of the decisions cited and those of the case now under appeal. As to the penalties, the appellant was subjected to no actual threat and no actual risk; only if the liquor ordered were actually shipped, that is to say, only in a contingency which has not happened, could the appellant be put in jeopardy.\nIt is not the function of a court of justice to advise parties as to their lights under a hypothetical state of facts.\nGlasgow Navigation Co. v. Iron Ore Co.[10]\nAs to the second point, it is convenient first to indicate more precisely the argument advanced by Mr. Tilley. It is argued that the effect of the order in council bringing the Act into force and the actual enforcement of the Act, by the prosecution of offenders and the exaction of penalties, was to create a situation which in itself constituted an attack by the constituted authorities of the Dominion and the Province upon what were in law the rights of individuals, including the plaintiff, the attack having the consequence of preventing such persons exercising their legal rights in pursuit of their lawful business and otherwise; that this is shown by the refusal of the dealer in Montreal which was one of the natural, direct and intended consequences of the situation so created. There are methods by which the Provincial Government, or the Dominion Government, as the case may be, may ascertain the opinion of the courts with respect to such questions as that raised by this appeal. The governments, we are informed, have declined to resort to these methods. Other methods of testing the validity of the Act are, it is said, not practicable for citizens who, in order to bring before the courts an arguable question of constitutional law, are naturally reluctant to expose themselves to the embarrassing incidents of criminal proceedings. The conduct of the authorities concerned constitutes, it is said, an announcement to everybody, including the appellant, that any attempt to exercise his legal right to purchase liquor for transport into Ontario, or to transport it in Ontario, will expose him to prosecution under the statutes; and although there has been no attempt to coerce him into doing any act he is thereby constrained from exercising his legal rights by the certainty that if he attempts to do so he will be exposed to such proceedings. In principle it is said there is no distinction between such a state of facts and circumstances giving rise to the decisions mentioned.\nMuch may be said, no doubt, for the view that an individual in the position of the appellant ought, without subjecting himself to a prosecution for a criminal offence, to have some means of raising the question of the legality of official acts imposing constraint upon him in his daily conduct which, on grounds not unreasonable, he thinks are unauthorized and illegal. We think, however, that to accede to appellant\u2019s contention upon this point would involve the consequence that virtually every resident of Ontario could maintain a similar action; and we can discover no firm ground on which the appellant\u2019s claim can be supported which would not be equally available to sustain the right of any citizen of a province to initiate proceedings impeaching the constitutional validity of any legislation directly affecting him, along with other citizens, in a similar way in his business or in his personal life.\nWe think the recognition of such a principle would lead to grave inconvenience and analogy is against it. (An individual, for example, has no status to maintain an action restraining a wrongful violation of a public right unless he is exceptionally prejudiced by the wrongful act. It is true that in this court this rule has been relaxed in order to admit actions by ratepayers for restraining ultra vires ex- penditures by the governing bodies of municipalities; MacIlraith v. Hart[11]. We are not sure that the reasons capable of being advanced in support of this exception would not be just as pertinent as arguments in favour of the appellant\u2019s contention, but this exception does not rest upon any clearly defined principle, and we think it ought not to be extended.\nOn the whole we think the principle contended for, since it receives no sanction from legal analogy, and since it is open to serious objection as calculated to be attended by general inconvenience in practice, ought not to be adopted. But the question is an arguable one; and, as the merits of the appeal have been fully discussed, we are loath to give a judgment against the appellant solely based upon a fairly disputable point of procedure; and accordingly we think it right to say that in our opinion the appellant\u2019s action also fails in substance.\nWe now turn to the substantive question raised by the appellant\u2019s action, whether, that is to say, the prohibitions of Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act have the force of law in, and in relation to, the province of Ontario. On the 27th April, 1920, the Ontario Legislature, purporting to act under section 152 of Part IV of that Act passed a resolution in the form prescribed by that section, and the vote taken at the resulting poll having been favourable to prohibition the order in council provided for by section 153, declaring the prohibitions of Part IV in force, was duly passed.\nIn order that such a resolution may take effect under section 152 it must be passed by the Legislative Assembly of a province in which there is, at the time, in force, a\nlaw prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.\nIn substance the contention on the part of the appellant is that this condition was not fulfilled, and consequently, of course, that the resolution of the Ontario Legislature had no legal operation.\nIn support of this contention certain sections of the Ontario Temperance Act, as it stood at the date of the resolution, are referred to. Under these provisions, it is said, so much liberty in dealing in intoxicating liquor was allowed by that Act as to remove the enactment from the category described by section 152, as a\nlaw prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.\nThe sections are 41, 44, 45, 46 and 139. The fundamental enactment of the statute is section 40 which provides that nobody, by himself, clerk, servant or agent, shall expose or keep for sale or sell or barter or, for any valuable consideration, give to any other person any liquor without having first obtained a license under this Act authorizing him so to do, and then only as authorized by such license and as prescribed by the Act. Licences may be granted to vendors, and licences by the Government of Canada for the manufacture of liquor are recognized by the Act. The vendor\u2019s licence does not authorize the sale of liquor in quantities greater than those mentioned in the Act or otherwise, or in any other place, or to other persons or for other persons, than provided by the Act. Vendors may sell alcohol for mechanical and scientific purposes, and physicians may give prescriptions in case of actual need, where, in the judgment of the physician, the use of liquor is necessary, and, under the sanction of such prescriptions, the vendor is authorized to sell specified minimum quantities of fermented and distilled liquors and wines. There are also provisions authorizing physicians, dentists and veterinary surgeons to keep on hand limited quantities of liquor for use in the practice of their respective professions. Severe penalties are prescribed for the abuse of these provisions. By section 139 it is declared that the Act is not intended to affect bona fide transactions in liquor between a person in the province of Ontario and a person in another province or in a foreign country, and by sections 45 and 46 provision is made authorizing manufacturers of liquor to keep the product of their manufacture in a warehouse for export, and there is likewise provision for the maintenance of bonded warehouses. By section 47 the Act prohibits the use or consumption in Ontario of liquor which has been purchased or received from any person in Ontario except a licensee. By section 44 authority is given to manufacturers of native wines made from grapes grown in Ontario, subject to regu- lations or restrictions imposed by the Board, to sell the same in wholesale quantities, i.e., not less than 5 gallons.\nCounsel for the respondent, I think rightly, contends that the object of section 139 is to make it clear that the province in enacting the Ontario Temperance Act was not exceeding the limits of its lawful jurisdiction. In the case of the Manitoba Licensed Victuallers, Attorney General of Manitoba v. Maritime Licensed Holders\u2019 Association[12], Lord Macnaghten pointed out that the decision of the Privy Council in 1896 had left undetermined the question whether the authority of the provinces to suppress the sale of liquor was an authority derived from head 13-92 \u201cProperty and civil rights\u201d or from head 16, the residuary subdivision, \u201cMatters merely local or private within the province,\u201d but intimated an opinion that it must be ascribed to the latter head. The presence in the Manitoba Act of a provision similar to section 139 was noted in the judgment as manifesting an intention on the part of the legislature to deal with the subject of the sale of liquor as a strictly provincial matter. Similar declarations have appeared as a rule in provincial legislation on this subject since then. Section 139 does not in any pertinent respect differ from the section in the Manitoba Act, and ought, we think, to be interpreted as filling the same office. The sections relating to the sale of liquor by \u201cvendors\u201d are not enactments dealing with the sale of liquor \u201cfor beverage purposes,\u201d and obviously, the same may be said with regard to sales for manufacturing and scientific purposes. Nor again can it be contended with much plausibility that the recognition of manufacturing establishments operating under Dominion licences and of bonded export warehouses touches the subject. It is quite true that the manufacturer sells to a customer beyond Ontario and that the bonded warehouseman sells for export, but though they sell \u201cfor beverage purposes,\u201d they do not sell for consumption within the province. These provisions seem to be entirely consistent with the scope of the statute, as a measure of provincial operation, suppressing the sale of liquor as a beverage. There is, we think, nothing in any of these provisions just discussed which could even raise a serious doubt upon the point whether or not the Ontario Temperanct Act falls within the category described by the words quoted from section 152. That section contemplates a provincial prohibitory law and therefore a law within the constitutional competence of a Canadian province. Neither do we consider it at all doubtful that it must be construed with reference to the existing practice, and with reference to the prevailing view as to the form which provincial legislation should take in order to enjoy security from attack as beyond the powers of a province.\nA more serious question, however, arises in respect of section 44. That section gives authority to manufacture and sell native wines without restriction, save as to the minimum quantity sold on any one occasion, and beyond doubt is intended to, and does, authorize the manufacture and sale of wines of such alcoholic strength as to fall within the scope of the expression \u201cintoxicating liquor.\u201d The intention is to exempt from the prohibitions of the statute the native wine industry, and to that extent to encourage the development of the manufacture and sale of wines, made from grapes produced in Ontario, as a beverage. The evidence shews that this industry has grown since the enactment of the Ontario Temperance Act, and it may be assumed that if the law is not changed this growth will be much greater still; and on behalf of the appellant it is argued, by no means without force, that a law protecting and encouraging such an industry and traffic cannot be described properly as a law prohibiting the sale of alcoholic liquor \u201cfor beverage purposes.\u201d\nWe have come to the conclusion that counsel for the Attorney General has made good his contentions:\n(1) That notwithstanding this provision the Ontario Temperance Act when viewed as a whole falls within the description in section 152, rightly understood, and\n(2) That Part IV itself does recognize the possibility that the prohibitions of that enactment may be brought into force in relation to a province in which the prohibition created by the provincial law is a limited one. Counsel for the appellant bases his attack upon the order in council upon the proposition that the condition laid down by section 152 is expressed in language which cannot fairly be interpreted as applicable to the Ontario Temperance Act, and that the other provisions of the statute of 1919 must be construed as giving effect to this principle, not as qualifying it.\nWe are content to assume the correctness of the view advanced that the critical question is whether or not the phrase used in section 152 can fairly be interpreted as embracing a statute containing such a departure from the prohibition principle as that which is found in section 44.\nThe term \u201cprohibition\u201d as applied to legislation affecting the drink traffic has never, we think, in Canada denoted, exclusively, a system of repression involving the total abolition of the sale of intoxicating liquor for use as a beverage. For over fifty years Canadians have been familiar with two legislative methods of dealing with the trade in liquors. One, in which the trade, including sales in saloons, inns and restaurants where liquor might be consumed on the premises where it was sold, as well as sales by manufacturers and wholesale and retail merchants, was regulated by means of a system of licences. The other under which, in localities in which the law was in force, the retail trade in spirituous and fermented liquors and in imported wines was wholly abolished. In some instances under this system what was commonly called the \u201cwholesale\u201d trade (sales in considerable quantities) was left unmolested.\nLegislation of this last mentioned order has generally been designated as \u201cprohibitory.\u201d\nBy the Temperance Act of 1864 (27-28 Vict., c. 18) for example, the councils of municipalities of the old province of Canada were empowered by by-law to \u201cprohibit the sale\u201d within the jurisdiction of the counsel \u201cof intoxicating liquors and the issue of licences therefor.\u201d The by\u2011law, by the requirement of the statute, was to be limited to the declaration that under the authority of the Act such sale and the issue of such licences \u201cis prohibited,\u201d and the provisions of the statute under which this authority was given were grouped under the heading \u201cProvisions as to Local Prohibition.\u201d And yet by these provisions any brewer or distiller, as well as a merchant or trader having his place of business within the locality affected by the by-law, was permitted to sell spirituous liquors (in the case of the distiller of his own manufacture) in quantities of not less than 5 gallons on any one occasion, and beer (which in the case of the brewer must be of his own manufacture), in quantities of not less than one dozen bottles.\nThis measure has, I think, always been classed as a measure of local prohibition, according to the description contained in the statute itself, and is so referred to in the judgment of Lord Watson, in A.G.O. v. A.G.[13],\nThe Temperance Act of 1864 was repealed by the Canada Temperance Act, which came into force in 1878; and by that enactment the sale of spirituous and fermented liquors and imported wines, for consumption as beverages in any county in which Part II of the Act is in force, is wholly abolished; but the manufacture of native wines from grapes grown in Canada and the sale of such wines in quantities of not less than 10 gallons is permitted.\nPart II of the Canada Temperance Act is described in the Act itself as legislation relating to \u201cthe prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors,\u201d and in popular speech as well as in more formal utterances it has received the same designation. The references by counsel for the Attorney General to judgments and to arguments before the courts illustrate this; indeed nobody familiar with the course of the discussion in this country upon the subject of the drink traffic could be ignorant of the fact.\nIt may well be doubted whether an enactment modelled on the Temperance Act of 1864 would be an enactment conforming to the present day conception in Canada of a measure \u201cprohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors.\u201d At the time it was enacted it was no doubt considered to be an effective method of repressing that part of the liquor traffic giving rise to its most dangerous abuses, namely, the retail trade and especially the bar and saloon trade. The Canada Temperance Act was, of course, a much more stringent measure, and notwithstanding the exemption of the native wine industry from its prohibitions it has, as we have already observed, always been considered and described as a prohibitory enactment, without a thought of impropriety or inaptitude of expression. There has been no doubt a very good reason for this. The use of native wine, that is to say, wine manufactured in Canada, has never been a habit widely or even considerably indulged in by the Canadian people, and the traffic in such wines is not a traffic against which an enactment for the repression of the liquor traffic would naturally be directed. The exemption of such wines, if it attracted attention at all, would be regarded as a harmless concession to a native industry, not seriously impairing the efficiency of the measure as one for the repression of the traffic in liquor.\nWe are not, however, for the moment concerned with the question whether the phrase under consideration, namely,\nlaw prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes.\nwould, if read in vacuo, be properly descriptive of an enactment containing such exemptions as those to be found in sections 121 and 122 of the Canada Temperance Act and in section 44 of the Ontario Temperance Act.\nThe immediate question is whether in the enactment in which it appears, in a statute dealing with the subject of repression of the liquor traffic passed by the Parliament of Canada in the year 1919, this language is reasonably capable of such a construction. Counsel for the Attorney General has very properly referred us to the phraseology of the orders in council upon the same subject, passed by the Governor in Council in the years 1917 and 1918. We shall not discuss these instruments in detail. It is sufficient to mention that, in one passed on the 11th of March, 1918, under the War Measures Act of 1914, there is a recital in these words:\nWhereas laws have been passed in all the provinces of Canada, prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor and such laws are now in force save in the province of Quebec where the prohibitory law is to come into effect by May 1, 1919,\nand that it is indisputable that the statutes referred to falling under the description \u201cprohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors,\u201d include the Ontario Temperance Act. The reference to the prohibitory law \u201cabout to come into force in Quebec\u201d together with the language of the second paragraph shews that the words \u201cprohibit\u201d and \u201cprohibitory.\u201d as applied to the subject of the orders, cannot be employed in a sense which excludes an enactment having for its general object the suppression of the liquor traffic, by reason solely of the fact that special exemptions such as that found in section 44 are permitted by its terms.\nIt is needless to say that the construction of the language of the Act of 1919 cannot be governed by orders in council passed by the Dominion Government in execution of its powers under the War Measures Act or otherwise; but as Lord Hobhouse said in speaking for the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[14]:\nThe common understanding of men * * * is one main clue to the meaning of the legislature.\nWe think that the existence of the usage to which we have referred, in its various phases, in popular speech, and in more formal speech as exemplified in the judgments of the courts and in official instruments such as statutes and orders in council, justifies the conclusion that the words \u201cprohibition\u201d and \u201cprohibit\u201d when employed in connection with this subject have not, in the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of Canadians, the inflexible signification which the appellant in his argument ascribes to them; and that section 152 is capable of a construction which would not exclude the Ontario Temperance Act from its purview.\nIn this view we cannot, of course, accept the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant, that section 152 ought to be read as establishing the dominant principle that the Act of 1919 is to be applied only in those provinces in which a prohibitory law is in force in the sense of a law wholly abolishing all sales of liquor for beverage purposes. That section being at least capable of a less rigorous construction the context in which the section occurs must be examined, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not its true effect and meaning are those contended for by the appellant.\nThe proviso of section 154 appears to us to shew that these provisions do at least contemplate the possibility that the enactments of section 154 may come into operation in a province where the prohibition laid upon the \u201csale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes\u201d is not absolute but is subject to exceptions. We have not overlooked the argument that the words \u201cother than for the manufacture or use thereof as a beverage\u201d exclude this view of the proviso. That phrase must be taken, in our opinion, as imposing a qualification upon the right which, in other respects, the proviso gives absolutely, that is to say, independently of the character of the provincial law, the right to introduce intoxicating liquor into the province for sacramental or medicinal purposes or for manufacturing or commercial purposes. It has little relevancy to the question of the proper construction of the concluding words of the proviso which give a right dependent entirely upon the character of the provincial law, and authorize in the language of the statute the import into the province of \u201cintoxicating liquors,\u201d which, under the laws of the province may lawfully be sold therein. We can perceive no legitimate reason for limiting these words in such a way as to exclude liquor falling within any class of liquor which under the provincial law may, notwithstanding its prohibitory enactments, be sold for beverage purposes. We find nothing in the proviso justifying such a limitation of the language which the legislature has employed, nor, as we have said, do we think that the language of section 152, when rightly construed, in view of the conditions and usage we have mentioned, requires such a limitation.\nOur opinion is that on the true construction of these provisions, when read as a whole, the Ontario Temperance Act is an enactment falling within section 152.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The very full and satisfactory judgment rendered by my brother Duff on behalf of Mr. Justice Maclean and himself, permits me to express my views in a few words.\nThe preliminary objection of the respondent is that the appellant has not made out a case which would justify him, under the authorities, in asking, in a suit against the Attorney General, that the legislation in question be declared invalid or inoperative. The appellant contends that an intolerable situation has been created by this legislation, the validity of which he questions, and that, if his action cannot be received, he must either submit to an unjustifiable abridgment of his legal rights, or suffer, so as to be in position to assert them, the ignominy of criminal prosecution and possible imprisonment. There might conceivably be such a situation of oppression, by reason of drastic and arbitrary legislation, that would entitle this argument to very serious consideration, but here the position of the appellant does not differ, in point of any interest which he can assert, from that of hundreds of other citizens of the province who are opposed to prohibition, and he is not in jeopardy by reason of any act of his or of any threat of a penalty unless he submits to an unjustifiable demand. Moreover, the inconvenience of allowing actions of this nature to be taken by one who pretends, without shewing any special interest, that certain legislation is ultra vires or inoperative is too obvious for discussion. Even were the situation an intolerable one, a convenient mode of testing the validity of an obnoxious statute might possibly be found in such a proceeding as was resorted to in Union Colliery v. Bryden[15]. I can therefore see no reason for extending the rule laid down in Dyson v. Attorney General[16], and followed in a number of well known cases.\nThis preliminary objection suffices to dispose of the appeal, and it is not absolutely necessary to express an opinion upon the merits. However, as the question is one of great public interest and as doubt has been cast upon the validity of legislation given effect to after the electorate had been invited to pass upon its advisability, I think I should give the parties the benefit of the views I have formed after listening to the very full argument of counsel. I can do so with all the more brevity that I entirely concur in what has been well said by my brother Duff.\nThe question, as I understand it, is whether the Ontario Temperance Act is, within the meaning of Part IV of the Canada Temperance Act, a law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. It is not whether it is an absolute prohibition, but merely whether it is what the Parliament of Canada must be assumed to have intended to describe in section 152 of the Canada Temperance Act as\na law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. Section 44 of the Ontario Temperance Act, allowing under certain conditions the sale of native wines, furnishes the only serious difficulty. But it must be observed that, under the Canada Temperance Act, the sale of native wines was not considered inconsistent with the prohibition of the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes (section 122 in Part II, which bears the title \u201cProhibition\u201d). And the only question being what Parliament intended by the words I have quoted, I do not think that such an exception, in the Ontario Temperance Act as Parliament had itself admitted in section 122 of the Canada Temperance Act would take the provincial prohibitory law out of the class of laws which Parliament contemplated as prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes. I need go no further, for without this express exception in the Canada Temperance Act the question might well be considered a doubtful one, and it is unnecessary to say whether or not exceptions of this nature may not, if extended, prevent the provincial law from coming within the category of prohibitory liquor legislation.\nOn the whole, I think the appellant fails on the preliminary objection of the respondent as well as on the merits of his action.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Edward Bayly.\n[1] 53 Ont.

The respondent had taken fire insurance policies in several companies, amongst which were the appellant company and The Farmers' Company, both represented by one Dace as their agent. The property insured having been destroyed by fire, the respondent received from the adjuster a memorandum shewing him entitled to $2,864.45 as against The Farmers' Company, and to $1,841.45 and $2,861.60, as against the appellant company, under two policies. Later on, The Farmers' Company, sent to Dace their cheque payable to the respondent; and Dace appropriated its proceeds by forging the signature of the respondent. The latter, pressing Dace for a settlement, accepted as an accommodation Dace's personal cheque for the amount of his claim against The Farmers' Company. On the afternoon of the same day, Dace informed the respondent that the cheque of The Farmers' Company had arrived. At that time, Dace had also received from the appellant company two drafts, payable to the order of the respondent, for the amounts already mentioned. Dace then obtained the respondent's endorsement on the larger one of the drafts on the representation that it was the cheque of the Farmers' Company, which he would use to reimburse himself for his personal cheque, and also secured' the respondent's signature on the other draft on the representation that it was a receipt, the execution of which was a formality required by The Farmers' Company. Dace endorsed both drafts and deposited them to his own credit, and they were later paid and charged to the appellant's account by its bank. The respondent sued the appellant company on his policies and the defendant pleaded payment and release.\nHeld, Davies C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, that Dace, in the fraud practised upon the respondent, was acting within the scope of his agency so as to make his fraud that of his principals, the appellant company; and the endorsements on the drafts of the appellant company were not binding on the respondent in the circumstances in which they were given.\nPer Davies C.J. and Duff J.

Dace did not profess to act and was not in fact acting within the scope of his authority as agent of the appellant company; and as to the larger draft endorsed by the respondent, the latter was estopped from claiming upon it, as by his conduct he represented to the bank that Dace was authorized to collect it.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1923] 3 W.W.R. 897) affirmed, Davies C.J. and Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Tweedie J. at the trial[2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Ford K.C. for the appellant.\nNesbitt K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014I concur with the reasons for judgment stated by my brother Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014This action was brought by respondent to recover insurance due on two policies of insurance issued by the appellant and was tried by Mr. Justice Tweedie in the trial division of the Supreme Court of Alberta who, after apparently most careful consideration, gave judgment for the respondent.\nFrom that judgment said company appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, taking almost every imaginable ground of objection.\nMr. Justice Beck of the Appellate Division, in an elaborate and comprehensive judgment, concurred in by his colleagues, assigned reasons, with which I fully agree, why said appeal should be dismissed and it was dismissed accordingly.\nThe statements of fact set forth in said respective judgments of the court below, in my opinion, entitle the respondent to rely, as his counsel did herein, upon the decisions in the cases of Lloyd v. Grace[3], and Carlisle & Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg[4], in appeal, which seem applicable to the facts herein presented as I read them.\nI cannot, with all due respect, after due consideration, accept the interpretation of said facts adopted by counsel for appellant and pressed upon us herein.\nI, therefore, see no useful purpose to be served by repeating what the learned judges in the courts below have stated as to the facts or the law, and, agreeing therewith, am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent sued the appellants to recover $1,841.45 and $2,861.60 under two policies of insurance insuring against fire his restaurant in Edmonton and its fittings and furniture. In answer to the respondent's claim the appellants produced two warrants or drafts drawn upon the Standard Bank of Canada for these amounts, payable to the order of the respondent, to each of which was appended the respondent's endorsement, and which, on faith of these endorsements, had been paid by the bank and charged to the appellants' account. The endorsements were in fact procured by the fraud of one Dace, the appellants' local agent at Edmonton, and the questions for decision are: First, assuming that the appellants are not responsible for Dace's fraud, are the endorsements or either of them binding on the respondent in the circumstances in which they were given? and, second, if this question should be answered unfavourably to the respondent, was Dace, in the fraud practiced upon the respondent, acting within the scope of his agency so as to make his fraud that of his principals? An affirmative answer to this question would, of course, involve a decision against the appellants.\nThe respondent had taken insurance in several companies, only one of which, in addition to the appellants\u2014 The Farmers' Company\u2014it is necessary to mention. After the fire, which occurred on the 28th August, 1921, the usual adjustment occurred, and the respondent received an apportionment slip shewing that he was entitled as against the Farmers' Company to $2,864.45, and as against the appellants in respect of his two policies the sums already mentioned, for which the action was brought.\nOn the 10th October, 1921, the Farmers' Company sent to Dace, who also acted as their agent at Edmonton, their cheque payable to the respondent for the sum to which he was entitled from them, with a form of receipt attached. To these documents Dace appended the forged signature of the respondent, and having cashed the cheque, appropriated the proceeds. Pressed by the respondent's inquiries concerning this claim against the Farmers' Company, Dace on the 26th October offered the respondent his personal cheque for the amount of this claim as an accommodation, and this proposal being accepted, the respondent received Dace's cheque upon his personal account, which was by him post-dated 27th October. In the afternoon of the 26th October, after this interview, Dace informed the respondent that the cheque of the Farmers' Company had arrived.\nIn point of fact, Dace had received from the appellants the two drafts in question in this litigation, and then and there proceeded to obtain the respondent's endorsements upon both. One of the drafts\u2014the larger one\u2014Martin was told was the cheque of the Farmers' Company, which he was asked to endorse pursuant to his understanding with Dace, so that, as Dace said, \"he could get his money.\" This request Martin complied with, notwithstanding the fact that Dace's post-dated cheque had not been deposited or marked, and was, as Martin said, in his wife's possession at his house. The other draft he endorsed on Dace's representation that it was a receipt: the execution was a formality which the company required. Martin saw that the first mentioned draft was an order on the Standard Bank of Canada for the payment of the amount mentioned; and he noticed as he thought, that it corresponded with the sum payable to him by the Farmers' Company, and that it was payable only upon acceptance by the Calumet Underwriters Department of the National Union Fire Insurance Company. Martin had in his possession at the time his apportionment slip, which he had read, and on which his policies with the National Union Company were referred to under the denomination \"Calumet.\" Nevertheless, having asked Dace for an explanation of this term in the draft, he accepted his explanation that the Calumet Department was the clearing house for paying the Farmers' Company's losses. Martin had no suspicion throughout the interview that he was dealing with Dace in any other capacity than that of agent for the Farmers' Company or that any trick of any description was being practiced upon him. He endorsed the larger draft under the absolute conviction that Dace was entitled to have him do so unless he gave up possession of Dace's personal cheque.\nIt is convenient to consider first the second of the questions stated above, whether, namely, the appellants are responsible for what Dace did in the proceeding just described.\nThe answer to this must in turn be governed by the conclusion \"we reach upon the question whether, to quote the language of Lord Macnaghten in Lloyd v. Grace[5], a case to be discussed later, Dace was acting \"in the ordinary course of his employment,\" as the appellants' agent, \"and not beyond the scope of his agency.\" Dace was professing to act in part for himself and in part for the Farmers' Company. When he informed the respondent that the cheque of that company had arrived, he was professing to perform a duty within the scope of his employment as agent of that company. So, also, when he procured the signature of the respondent to one of the documents by misrepresenting it as a receipt which the company required; so also when he produced the other document and exhibited it as a cheque in his possession as agent for delivery to the respondent in payment of the company's liability. In procuring the respondent's endorsement upon that document to enable him to cash it he was purporting to act in his own behoof. It was, moreover, essential to his plan that he should mislead the respondent by concealing from him the fact that he was holding these documents for delivery to him in his capacity as agent of the appellants.\nI suggested at the argument that he was purporting to act for the Calumet Underwriters Department of the appellants: that suggestion, I am convinced, quite fails to do justice to the facts as a whole, and is quite untenable in light of a critical examination of the findings of the trial judge.\nDace was not purporting to act on behalf of the appellants; on the contrary, he was discarding his character as agent for the purpose of enabling him to cheat both his principals and the respondent. His acts, on their face, were the acts of a person who was a stranger to the appellants, and the respondent dealt with him on that footing.\nI am emphasizing these facts as of cardinal importance, the significance of which I think, with great respect, was not quite fully appreciated by the learned judges of the Appellate Division.\nThe company, therefore, cannot be held responsible for Dace's acts on the ground that these acts were within the apparent scope of his authority as the appellants' agent. Responsibility, if it exist, must rest upon the ground that in doing what he did Dace was acting within the actual course of his employment and not beyond the actual scope of his agency. It seems to be abundantly clear that he was not acting within the course of his employment. There may, no doubt, be occupations in which it is contemplated that in the ordinary course of his employment, an agent, without passing beyond the scope of his authority, shall at times represent himself as acting for another. But it would be an almost fantastic suggestion that a local insurance agent, entrusted as Dace was with cheques or orders to be delivered in payment on behalf of his company of an insurance loss, would be within the course of his employment in concealing the fact that he was in possession of such orders for that purpose, with the object of obtaining the signature of the payee for the purpose of appropriating the proceeds to himself. The orders, on the face of them, fully disclosed their character and the particulars of the claims they were intended to satisfy. Dace had obvious duties in relation to them: to inform the respondent that he had received them; to give any explanations that might be necessary to enable the respondent to understand and procure payment of them (although it would be difficult to suggest any point upon which explanation could be required); and if, in the performance of that duty, while professing to act in his capacity as agent for the appellants, he had deceived or misled the respondent to his detriment, it is conceivable that there might, in special circumstances, be some responsibility on part of the appellants. But even maintaining his proper character of representative of the appellants, it would seem to be impossible to contend that he would be acting within the course of his duty in procuring the respondent's endorsement for the purpose of enabling him to apply the proceeds of the orders in payment of a debt due by the respondent to himself. Such an act could only be viewed by Dace, as well as by the respondent, as an act done by the respondent on his own behalf. In point of fact, as I have already said, the respondent could not have failed to understand that Dace, in procuring the endorsement of the order for twenty-eight hundred odd dollars, was acting for himself, to serve his own personal purpose. The principle is stated in the judgment of Blackburn J., in McGowan v. Dyer[6], in the following passage: In Story on Agency, the learned author states, in s. 452 the general rule that the principal is liable to third persons in a civil suit \"for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances or misfeasances and omissions of duty of his agent in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or indeed know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them.\" He then proceeds, in s. 456: \"But although the principal is thus liable for the torts and negligences of his agent, yet we are to understand the doctrine with its just limitations, that the tort or negligence occurs in the course of the agency. For the principal is not liable for the torts or negligences of his agent in any matters beyond the scope of the agency, unless he has expressly authorized them to be done, or he has subsequently adopted them for his own use and benefit.\"\nChristie, as managing director, had a most extensive authority to act for the company, and we do not at all question that the company must be bound by every act of his when acting for them within the scope of that extensive authority. But what he did here was in his private capacity, receiving payment of his own individual debt, and, extensive as his authority was, that act did not come within it. We see no principle on which the company should be liable for what he did, any more than an ordinary employer would be answerable for the act of his agent not acting within the scope of his authority.\nThe appeal must on this issue succeed because, as Lord Herschell said in Thorne v. Heard[7]:\nIf the person, although he has been employed as agent, is not, in the transaction which is the wrongful act, acting for or purporting to be acting for the principal, it seems to me impossible to treat that as the fraud of the principal;\nand as Lord Lindley said in Farquharson v. King[8],\nI do not myself see upon what ground a person can be precluded from denying as against another an authority which has never been given in fact, and which the other has never supposed to exist.\nThe court below have considered that the case in this aspect of it is governed by the decision in Lloyd v. Grace[9]. As this is a point of considerable importance, it is well, perhaps, that the facts as found by the trial judge, Scrutton J., should be stated. The findings were as follows:\nIt was within the scope of Sandles' employment to advise clients who come to the firm to sell property as to the best legal way to do it and the necessary documents to execute; that the appellant did rely on the representations of Sandles professing to act on behalf of the firm that the documents in question were necessary to facilitate and carry out the sale of the land to her; that she did not know she was signing conveyances to Sandles outside the scope of his employment, and that she was justified in relying on the representation of Sandles without reading and trying to understand the documents tendered to her.\nLord Macnaghten adds in his judgment, at p. 731:\nThat seems to me a clear finding that the fraud was committed in the course of Sandles' employment and not beyond the scope of his agency.\nThere is hardly a relevant particular in respect of which the facts of this case present any analogy to the facts as disclosed by these findings. It is perfectly clear that the respondent did not rely upon any representation of Dace professing to act on behalf of his principal. It would be beside the question to say that the respondent did not know that Dace was doing something outside of the scope of his employment as the appellants' agent when he believed that he was dealing with Dace in a different capacity altogether. Indeed, in Lloyd v. Grace[10], the essential point in the grounds of the decision is that the clerk was held out by his employer as having, on the employer's behalf, authority to transact business of the confidential nature he was professing to transact, and as being a person upon whom clients might rely as representing his principals, not only in preparing documents and advising about them, but in explaining their contents and effect and in advising as to the manner in which such transactions should be effected. In all cases of the class to which Lloyd v. Grace10 belongs)\nIt is * * * assumed (as Lord Selborne said in the passage referred to above) in all such cases that the third party, who seeks the remedy, has been dealing in good faith with the agent in reliance upon the credentials with which he has been entrusted by the principal.\nThe supposed credentials in the agent's possession were the last things in the world the respondent relied upon. Had he done so, his, Dace's, fraudulent designs must have been foiled.\nI come now to the first of the questions stated above. And, first, of the larger draft for twenty-eight hundred odd dollars. The doctrine of estoppel, as Lord Macnaghten said in Whitechurch v. Cavanagh[11].\nis founded upon a broad principle which enters * * * deeply into the ordinary dealings and conduct of mankind\nand it has been expounded many times; but the precision of Parke B's judgment in Freeman v. Cooke[12], has never been impugned, and it is that statement of it which is most opposite to the question presented by this case. I quote the passage so far as material:\nThe rule is Pickard v. Sears[13], said Parkes B., in Freeman v. Cooke12, is \"that where one by his words or conduct wilfully causes another to believe in the existence of a certain state of facts, and induces him to act on that belief, or to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded from averring against the latter a different state of things se existing at the same time\" * * * The proposition contained in the rule itself, as above kid down in the case of Pickard v. Sears[14] must be considered as established. By the term \"wilfully,\" however, in that rule, we must understand, if not that the party represents that to be true which he knows to be untrue, at least that he means his representation to be acted upon, and that it is acted upon accordingly; and if, whatever a man's real intentions may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take the representation to be true, and believe that it was meant that he should act upon it, and did act upon it as true, the party making the representation would be equally precluded from contesting its truth.\nThe second proposition laid down by Brett J., in Carr v. London & North Western Ry. Co. (3), may with advantage also be kept in mind:\nAnother recognized proposition seems to be, that if a man, either in express terms or by conduct makes a representation to another of the existence of a certain state of facts, which he intends to be acted upon in a certain way, and it be acted upon in that way, in the belief in the existence of such a state of facts, to the damage of him who so believes and acts, the first is estopped from denying the existence of such a state of facts.\nThere can be no doubt that the respondent did intend to invest Dace with authority to procure payment of the draft, and the critical question is whether his conduct, taken as a whole, involved a representation to the Standard Bank that he had invested Dace with such authority.\nBefore proceeding with a discussion of the facts immediately relevant, there are one or two subsidiary points which ought to be mentioned. There seems to be little reason to doubt that the draft, when it left Dace's hands, had all the acceptances required for presentation to the Standard Bank. It was in due course honoured, and it seems unlikely, first, that a draft which was still incomplete in this respect, would be in Dace's hands for delivery to the respondent, and more unlikely still that such a draft would have been paid by the Dominion Bank at Edmonton. I do not consider the question of the character of the instrument as regards negotiability at all important. Negotiability by estoppel is at best a slippery expression, and we need not concern ourselves with it here. The actual signature of the payee was, I think, a sufficient endorsement in the sense that if accompanied by delivery to a bona fide transferee for value it would have been sufficient to entitle such a transferee to assert Martin's rights against the appellants. \"Proper endorsement\" means a sufficient endorsement by the proper person, the payee, and this is not affected by the instructions on the back, the first sentence of which is couched in language of advice in contradistinction to the last, which contains an imperative direction. I do not suggest that the absence of the words, \"operating as the Shasta Caf\u00e9,\" would not probably in fact have given rise to some difficulty with the bank; for the present I am speaking only of the legal position.\nThe respondent, as already mentioned, had agreed to repay Dace's advance by endorsing in his favour the Farmers Company's cheque when it arrived, and this understanding he thought he was carrying out by endorsing the draft in such a manner as to enable Dace to procure payment of it according to its tenour.\nDid the respondent then by his conduct represent to the Standard Bank that Dace was authorized to collect this draft?\nBoth parties, of course, intended that Dace should be, and both thought he had been invested with this authority. Assuming, as was held in the court below, and I think rightly, that the draft was not a negotiable instrument, the respondent's action, intended as it was to have this effect, must be treated as giving Dace authority to act for him in the collection of the draft\u2014an authority which would have been irrevocable had the transaction been what the respondent conceived it to be.\nBy endorsing the draft and giving it to Dace with authority to procure payment of it, he seems to have authorized Dace to make such a representation, which he, in effect did, by presenting the draft for payment through his own bank. Dace was unquestionably intended by both to have authority to do this effectually, and assuming that Dace exceeded the limits of his actual authority implied from this understanding, by adding the description \"operating as Shasta Caf\u00e9,\" it is difficult to see how, as against the bank, the respondent, who had by his signature accredited the endorsement, could dispute his authority.\nI have refrained from speaking of estoppel by negligence, because this is a case of estoppel by representation arising from conduct or it is not a case of estoppel at all. If Martin's conduct amounted to a representation within the principle as enunciated above, that is the end of the matter; if not, that is also the end of the matter.\nWith respect, there is not much analogy between this case and Carlisle v. Bragg[15]. Rigg's fraud was similar to Dace's and Bragg's stupidity on the same plane as Martin's; but Bragg did not execute a document, knowing it to be a guarantee, or a document of any description, which Rigg was intended to present to the bank for the purpose of obtaining money or credit upon it. In short, Bragg made no representation himself and authorized Rigg to make no representation as to Rigg's authority or as to the validity of the document Rigg produced. Consequently, the appellants could only succeed by shewing that Bragg was under some duty to them to exercise care for their protection.\nThe case of Swan v. North British Australasian Co.[16] also is easily distinguishable. The blank transfers in themselves amounted neither to a representation nor to authority to make one, because the clerk was not put into possession of the indicia of title. It was his felonious act in possessing himself of these which enabled him to represent himself as having authority to transfer the shares. \"Estoppel by negligence\" availed nothing because of the absence of any duty to exercise care owing to the people who suffered by the fraud.\nIt was urged on behalf of the respondent that Dace's act in adding the words mentioned to the endorsement was an independent wrongful act interrupting the chain of causation\u2014novus actus interveniens\u2014between the respondent's conduct and the act of the bank in paying the draft. The essential thing, it is to be observed, in applying the principle of estoppel as above enunciated, is to consider whether the conduct relied upon as constituting the estoppel has given rise to the belief upon which the person misled has acted, and that is the decisive question in this case. An analogous question has come up for consideration again and again in cases in which, like this, the courts have had to decide which of two innocent persons who have been defrauded by a third person shall bear the loss caused by the fraud. The famous dictum of Ashurst J., in Lickbarrow v. Mason[17], to the effect that he should bear the loss who has \"enabled\" the third party to commit the fraud is, as a general proposition, much to wide, and the question in such cases is not whether the defendant has \"enabled\" by his conduct the third party to commit the fraud, but whether his conduct has directly led to the deception which the defrauder has been \"enabled\" to practice. All such cases involve, and any general principle derived from them postulates, the intervention of a fraud in the absence of which nobody would have suffered. A reference to one or two examples may be useful. In Brocklesby v. Temperance Building Society[18], a father intrusted his son with title deeds for the purpose of raising a limited sum, the son's authority being expressed in a document delivered to him by the father. The son by an ingenious series of frauds, by concealment of the written authority and by means of forgery, succeeded in borrowing a larger sum, secured by equitable mortgage by deposit of the title deeds, and appropriated the difference between the sum borrowed and the sum authorized to be borrowed. The father was held by his conduct to be bound, following the earlier case of Perry-Herrick v. Attwood[19] where a mortgagee having permitted the mortgagor to have possession of the title deeds for the purpose of borrowing money upon them for the benefit of the mortgagor but limited in amount, was held to be bound by his license to the mortgagor and the delivery of the title deeds to recognize the priority of the equitable mortgage created by the deposit of them to secure a much larger sum than that authorized. In both these cages, of course, it was the fraud of the defrauder that was immediately responsible for the loss. In the later of the two, Brocklesby's Case[20], the fraud involved misrepresentation and forgery. Neither case proceeded upon the principle of agency. In Brocklesby's Case20, although the son obtained possession of the title deeds as his father's agent, the fact of his agency was concealed from the parties with whom he dealt. Both decisions are based upon the ground that, the indicia of title having been intrusted to the defrauder with authority to deal with them for the purpose of raising money (though limited in amount), the responsibility for the fraud practiced upon third parties must rest upon the owner, who armed the defrauder with the instrument that enabled him to carry his criminal designs into effect. In Union Credit Bank v. Mersey Docks[21], Bigham J., had to consider a curious case, in which the bank, holding as security eighteen hogsheads of tobacco warehoused with the Mersey Docks Board, gave the person who was the owner of the goods subject to their security a delivery order complete, with the exception that a blank was left in the space for the numbers of hogsheads, the understanding being that the owner, who had repaid his advance on one of these, should fill in the number of that hogshead. Instead of doing so, he filled in the blank in such a way as to enable him to obtain delivery of the whole eighteen hogsheads. The responsibility of the bank for the owner's action was affirmed by Bigham J., who rejected an argument founded upon the language of the head-note in Swan's Case[22] to the effect that\nthe doctrine of estoppel by executing instruments in blank is confined to negotiable instruments.\nThat learned and experienced judge held that the case was one of estoppel by representation, and that the bank was bound by the representation made by the person whose representation they had accredited by intrusting him with the delivery order in blank. In London Joint Stock Company v. MacMillan[23], the House of Lords had to consider a question arising out a forgery by a clerk who had presented for signature to Mr. Arthur, a member of the respondent firm, a cheque which was represented to be a cheque for petty cash to the amount of \u00a32. Mr. Arthur signed the cheque without observing the body of it. In point of fact, the space provided for stating in words the sum to be drawn was left blank, while the space for stating the sum in figures had the figure \"2\" in it, but so placed that the clerk was able, without exciting suspicion through the appearance of the cheque, to insert a \"1\" to the left and a \"0\" to the right of the \"2,\" and to present a cheque to the bank for \u00a3120 accredited by a genuine signature. Their Lordships maintained the responsibility of the customer, all of them on the ground that the customer had made default in the exercise of the care which he owed to the bank arising out of the relation of banker and customer; but Lord Hardane, at pp. 817-820 of the report, deals with the questions raised by the appeal in their relation to the general principles of estoppel, and refers to Brocklesby's Case[24] and Perry-Herrick's Case[25] as illustrations of the general doctrine to be applied.\nA very different situation, however, confronts us in considering the smaller of the two drafts. The respondent was not aware that this was a draft for a sum of money payable upon the authority of his signature. He believed he was signing a receipt, and, in doing so, observing a formality, connected with the settlement of the claim by the larger draft. There is no ground for saying that he intended to make any representation upon which the bank was to act, nor, I think, that he did anything which a reasonable man would have considered to be calculated to have the effect of such a representation. And he certainly had no intention to make any representation to the appellants, nor had he any reason to believe that his act would be used as a representation to them; nor can I discover any breach of any duty incumbent upon him to exercise care in respect of that particular document. Consequently I think, as regards that issue, that the appellants must fail. In the result the appellants succeed as to the larger draft and fail as to the smaller. Success, in this view, having been divided throughout, I think the most just and convenient way to deal with the costs would be to award none to either party in respect of the proceedings of the action or in either of the appeals.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nThe agency of Dace for the appellant company is fully established. It is a reasonable inference from all the circumstances that the procuring of Martin's signature to the documents sent by the appellant company to Dace was within the scope of his duties as its agent. His misrepresentation to Martin as to the relation of the appellant company to the Farmers' Insurance Company involved the statement to Martin that his signature was being sought for the appellant, as in fact it was. Invoking the documents signed by Martin as the basis of release from his claim under his insurance policies, the appellant cannot escape responsibility for the fraud by which its agent obtained his signature to them. Martin's failure to read the papers to which Dace asked his signature for the appellant in my opinion affords no answer to the position taken on his behalf that, as between him and the appellant company, his signature to them is wholly ineffective because of the fraud by which it was obtained.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the appellate divisional court of Alberta affirming a judgment of Mr. Justice Tweedie in favour of the respondent.\nThe respondent sued the appellant, claiming indemnity for loss by fire insured against under two policies issued by the appellant, which loss was adjusted at $1,841.45 on policy No. 11278 and at $2,861.80 on policy No. 11346. The respondent at the same time had policies of insurance in several other companies, under which his loss was also adjusted. Among these policies was one of the Farmers' Fire and Hail Insurance Co. of which the adjusted amount was $2,864.45.\nThe plea of the appellant was that the moneys due under policies Nos. 11278 and 11346 were fully paid and satisfied by two drafts for $1,841.45 and $2,861.80 respectively on the Standard Bank of Canada, Toronto, payable to the order of the respondent, which said drafts were properly endorsed by him and paid to him or to his order. On this issue the learned trial judge found that these so-called drafts were sent by the appellant company to one Thomas Dace, who represented it in Edmonton, with what instructions was not disclosed, but that it was very clear that he had received them as agent of the company; that after the losses were adjusted, the respondent frequently called at Dace's office to inquire concerning the money payable under the policies, and, on October 4th, received from Dace two cheques of the Canada Security Insurance Co. in settlement of the claims against it, and that from October 4th he made frequent calls upon Dace up to October 26th, but without results; that in the meantime Dace received from the Farmers' Company its cheque drawn on the Merchants Bank at Calgary, dated October 11th, for the sum of $2,864.45, payable to the respondent with a voucher for the above amount to be signed by the latter; that Dace forged on this cheque and on the voucher the respondent's name, and the cheque was further endorsed for deposit by Dace and deposited by him to his credit on October 18th and paid by the bank; that on the 26th of October in the forenoon the respondent again called at Dace's office and made further inquiry for the money due him under the remaining policies, whereupon Dace gave him his own cheque dated October 27th for $2,864.45, which he said was in anticipation of the cheque which he was to receive from the Farmers' Company, the respondent accepting Dace's cheque as he was in urgent need of the money to re-establish his business.\nThe finding of the learned judge as to what was done, on October 26th, after the respondent had received Dace's personal cheque, with respect to the two drafts of the appellant company, had better be given in his own words:\nAt noon Dace telephoned the house of the insured and left a message to the effect that he had received the cheque from the Farmers' Insurance Company and asked to have him come in and endorse it. Without knowledge of this request plaintiff went to the office of Dace, shortly after noon of the same day when Dace informed him that the Farmers' cheque had arrived and asked him to endorse it so that he could get the money which he had advanced to him. For this purpose they both sat at a table, the plaintiff sitting to the right of Dace. The documents were presented, the one relating to the claim of $2,861.80 being face up with Dace's hand upon it was visible to a very large extent to the plaintiff. He' admits having read the words \"Upon acceptance by the Calumet Agency Department\" as his own name and the amount ($2,861.80) two thousand eight hundred and sixty-one dollars eighty cents, and may have read the words \"National Fire Insurance Company\" and \"The Standard Bank of Canada, Toronto.\" He paid particular attention to the amount which was within two or three dollars of the amount of the claim which he had against the Farmers' Fire and Hail Insurance Company, which undoubtedly he believed to be the correct amount of that claim and induced him to believe and rely upon the statements of Dace made in explaining the nature of the documents which he was signing. When the plaintiff made inquiries of Dace as to the opening words of the documents which referred to the Calumet Underwriters' Agency and which immediately preceded the \"National Union Fire Insurance Company\" he was informed by him that this company were the underwriters of the Farmers' Insurance Company and that its losses were cleared and paid through it, which statement the plaintiff accepted. All this time Dace kept his hand upon the document and turned it over after which he kept his hand upon the back of it and I am satisfied never released control or custody of it. When he turned the document over he directed the plaintiff where to endorse it, which he did. He then presented the second document for $1,841.45, the face of which the plaintiff did not see and explained that that was a receipt which was required by the insurance company whereupon the plaintiff wrote his name on the back. The words \"Operating as Shasta Cafe\" which form part of the endorsement on each of the documents were not written by the plaintiff nor at his request, nor with his authority, nor did he subsequently approve the same.\nOn October 26th the day upon which the plaintiff endorsed the two documents Dace subsequently endorsed each of them \"For deposit T. Dace, Real Estate and Insurance\" and deposited them to his credit at a branch of the Dominion Bank in which he did business. The bank credited his account with the proceeds, cleared them on the 27th and they were accepted and paid by the Standard Bank of Canada at Toronto on October 31, 1921, and charged to the defendant's account. The defendant subsequently acknowledging the correctness of its account.\nIt may be added that the respondent continued to press Dace for payment of the insurance due him by the appellant and finally threatened suit, whereupon shortly afterwards, Dace absconded from Edmonton and has not since been heard from.\nThe appellant relies on the endorsement on these drafts as conclusive evidence against the respondent that he was paid the amounts due under the policies of insurance. The respondent answers that this endorsement having been obtained by the fraud of Dace, the appellant's agent, for which fraud the appellant is liable, it cannot set it up as evidence of a payment which was never effected. To this the appellant replies that by a more inspection of the documents which Dace tendered him for endorsement, the respondent could have discovered that these drafts were not those of the Farmers' Company but of the appellant, and that by reason of his negligence the respondent is estopped from denying that he had been paid the amount for which these drafts were issued.\nThat Dace was the appellant's agent for some purposes was not disputed. It was stated in the policies that they would not be valid until countersigned by the duly authorized agent of the company at Edmonton, and Dace countersigned them as such. However the drafts in question were sent to Dace to be by him handed over to the respondent. Unfortunately we have not the covering letter from the appellant to Dace which no doubt accompanied the drafts. But I think we are entitled to assume from all the circumstances that it was within the scope of Dace's agency to hand over the drafts to the respondent and to see that they were properly endorsed by him. On the back of the drafts were instructions for the endorsement to be made by the payee as described on their face, and no doubt the appellant sent these drafts to Dace and not to the respondent, in order to ensure their proper endorsement. I therefore conclude that Dace was acting as the appellant's agent when by his fraud he obtained the signature of the respondent on the back of these drafts.\nBut it was argued that Dace in his dealings with the respondent, having represented these drafts to be those of the Farmers' Company, did not purport to act as agent for the appellant but as agent for the Farmers' Company. Dace undoubtedly received the appellant's drafts as its agent and was within the scope of his agency when he obtained the endorsement of the respondent. His representation that the larger of these drafts was that of the Farmers' Company\u2014which the respondent was willing to endorse over to Dace who had given him his personal cheque for the amount of the payment\u2014was a fraudulent misrepresentation in the course of the carrying out of Dace's agency for the appellant. And it seems clear that the appellant which relies on the endorsement so obtained as acknowledgment of payment of its debt towards the respondent cannot take benefit of this endorsement and repudiate the fraud by which it was obtained (Kerr, on Fraud and Mistake, 5th edition, p. 94, and cases cited). The appellant's plea of estoppel by reason of the respondent's negligence\u2014and that is the only estoppel set up as I read the pleadings\u2014cannot in my opinion be entertained. Through the fraud of the appellant's agent the suspicion which came to the mind of the respondent when he read on the face of the larger cheque the words \"upon acceptance by the Calumet Underwriters Agency Department of National Union Fire Insurance Company\" was dispelled by Dace's assurance that this was the clearing house for the insurance company and that the Farmers' claim was being paid through this clearing house. The respondent's attention was chiefly directed to the amount of this draft, which was within two or three dollars the same amount as that of the Farmers' Company. And assuming that he was somewhat careless in endorsing the larger draft, for no estoppel can be asserted as to the smaller one the face of which was concealed from the respondent, I cannot see how the appellant being liable in law for the fraud of its agent can set up as a ground of estoppel against the respondent, a negligence induced by the very fraud for which it is responsible. In so far as these fraudulent representations of its agent are concerned the appellant is not an innocent third party entitled to set up estoppel.\nThe contention of the appellant in the courts below that these drafts were negotiable instruments was not repeated before this court and need not be discussed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMalouin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Beck in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ford, Miller & Harvie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P.

City of Toronto, [1924] S.C.R. 368\nDate: 1924-03-22\nBoard of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the City of Toronto (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Toronto (Defendant) Respondent.\n1924: March 12, 13, 22.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff and Mignault JJ. and Maclean J. ad hoc.\n(The Chief Justice presided at the hearing but died before judgment was given).\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nMunicipal law\u2014By-law\u2014Building restrictions\u2014Prior status of owner\u2014Deposit of plans Legal right to permit\u2014Municipal Act, 11 Geo. V, c. 63, s. 10.\nThe Municipal Act of Ontario by section 399a passed in 1921 empowers the council of a city, inter alia, to pass a by-law to prohibit, within a defined area, the erection of any building other than a private dwelling but such by-law is not to apply to any building the plans for which were approved by the city architect before it was passed. The city of Toronto passed such a by-law in respect to part of a street on which the Separate School Board owned two lots on which it intended to erect a school house and had filed the plans there for with the architect who refused to grant the permit to build by direction of the Board of Control in view of the contemplated by-law.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (54 Ont. L.R. 224) and applying Cridland v. City of Toronto (48 Ont. L.R. 266) Idington J. dissenting, that the architect had no right to refuse to issue the permit; that under the law as it stood the Board was entitled to have its plans considered and approved if in conformity with the law; and the by-law in this case was not a valid exercise of the statutory authority.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the order of Middleton J.[2] in favour of the respondent.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The only question raised on the appeal is whether or not the city by-law, prohibiting the erection on a part of Arthur street of buildings other than private dwellings, applied to the Separate School property owned by the Board when the by-law was passed and on which it proposed to build a school house, the plans for which had been filed with the city architect. Under the Act empowering the city to pass such by-law it would not have applied if the plans had been approved and the permit to build issued.\nThe courts below held that the by-law applied and the school house could not be built. The Board has appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nTilley K.C. and Day K.C. for the appellant. The architect had no rights to refuse the permit Cridland v. City of Toronto[3]. The city cannot use the statutory against an individual, City of Toronto v. Virgo[4].\nGeary K.C. and Colquhoun for the respondent referred to City of Toronto v. Williams[5] Commissioners of Taxation v. St. Marks[6].\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal is brought by leave given in an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, but only upon the two following grounds:\u2014\n1.That the user of the property in question was such that the by-law-did not apply thereto and that the non-user of a part of the property was no ground for holding that as to that part of the by-law did apply; and\n2. That the passing of the by-law after application for a permit had been made was not a proper exercise of the power conferred by the statute.\nThis restricted form of leave is a novelty which there is room for doubting the efficacy of under the powers given the court below under the Supreme Court Act, as amended recently. I assume, however, for the present, that it is herein effective.\nThe litigation herein in question arises out of the facts that one of the Board\u2019s schools, consisting of four rooms, having been partly expropriated in the course of extending Terauley street by said city, the Board had to look elsewhere for new school grounds, and acquired two parcels of ground fronting on Prince Arthur avenue, a residential district in Toronto, and proceeded to turn the building on one of said parcels into a school-house of four rooms, and part of the other parcel into a playground for use by the scholars attending same, and fenced that part of the said second parcel off from its front part, which was at that time used as a dwelling-house wherein boarders were kept.\nThat front part of said parcel, known as No. 18, had been under lease when so acquired by the Board and so continued and, according to one of the formal admissions made by these litigants for the purposes of the trial and of these causes in appeal, had never been in the possession of the Board, or used as school property.\nThe questions raised must turn upon the correct interpretation of an amendment made to the Municipal Act, by section 399 (a) of said Act, 1921, 11 Geo. V, c. 63, section 10, which provided as follows:\u2014\n399a. By-laws may be passed by the councils of cities, towns and villages, and of townships abutting on an urban municipality;\nEstablishing restricted districts or zones.\n1. For prohibiting the use of land or the erection or use of buildings within any defined area or areas or abutting on any defined highway or part of a highway for any other purpose than that of a detached private residence.\n2. For regulating the height, bulk, location, spacing and character of buildings to be erected or altered within any defined area or areas or abutting on any defined highway or part of a highway, and the proportion of the area of the lot which such building may occupy.\n(a) No by-law passed under this section shall apply to any land or buildings which on the day the by-law is passed is erected or used for any purpose prohibited by the by-law so long as it continues to be used for that purpose, nor shall it apply to any building in course of erection the plans for which have been approved by the city architect prior to the date of the passing of the by-law, so long as when erected it is used for the purpose for which it was erected.\nThe city council, on the 26th September, 1921, passed the by-law now in question which, as required by said Act, before becoming valid, got the approval of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board on the 28th of November, 1921, over three months before the Board of School Trustees got possession of said part of lot 18, now in question.\nThat by-law enacted as follows:\u2014\nNo. 8834. A by-law\nTo prohibit the use of land or the erection or use of buildings on the property fronting or abutting on either side of Prince Arthur Avenue between Avenue Road and Huron Street, for any other purpose than that of a detached private residence.\n(Passed September 26, 1921.)\nThe Council of the Corporation of the city of Toronto enacts as follows: No person shall use the land fronting or abutting on either side of Prince Arthur Avenue, between Avenue Road and Huron Street, or erect or use any buildings on the said land for any other purpose than that of a detached private residence.\nThe exception in subsection (a) above, is what is relied upon as entitling the Board appellant to claim exemption from the operation of said by-law.\nI cannot convert the word \u201cused\u201d into the word \u201cowns\u201d as we are asked to do here under the foregoing facts. To do so would violate the plain meaning of the language.\nI agree with the reasoning of the judgment of the Appellate Division, written at length by the late lamented Chief Justice Sir William R. Meredith, and need not repeat same here.\nI cannot see any ground upon which to hold, as we are asked to do, that the passing of the by-law after a permit to build was asked by appellant, can be held in law not to have been a proper exercise of the powers given.\nSuppose a person had bought but had never got possession of a lot in a residential district and had intended to erect thereon a building to be used by him as a business place that would destroy the value of all surrounding residences if insisted on, would his ownership be held as a user of it for such purpose simply because he had absolutely determined to do so, and had applied for a permit? I submit not.\nI confess appellant\u2019s case at first blush seemed a hard one, and I approached the consideration of it from that point of view for they were driven out of one place because of public needs. But on seeing how much better they are off now I do not see why we should, by a metaphysical train of reasoning, set aside the plain reading of the act and thus strain the law.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff, Mignault and Maclean JJ. was delivered by Duff J.\nDUFF J.\u2014In August, 1921, the appellants, who for many years had conducted a school on St. Vincent street in Toronto, having been deprived by compulsory proceedings of their school premises, which were required for the situs of a street, purchased for school purposes, pursuant to their statutory duty to provide schools for the children of separate school supporters, numbers 14 and 18 on Prince Arthur avenue. On the nineteenth of that month work was commenced on number 14 to convert the building, a dwelling house, into a temporary school-house, the intention of the Board being to erect a new school building upon the premises acquired. On the 9th September an application was made to the city architect for a permit authorizing the necessary alterations in number 14. On the 14th September the residents of the street (they appear to have acted with unanimity) requested the Board of Control to submit a by-law to the council regulating the character of buildings to be erected on the street in such a way as to prevent the erection of the projected school-house. On the following day the plans of a new school building to be erected on numbers 14 and 18 were filed with the City Architect, and a permit requested.\nNeither of these applications for a permit was considered, the architect having received instructions from the Board of Control not to consider them, in view of the contemplated by\u2011law, and applications for mandamus made by the appellants were dismissed. On the 28th September, the City Council passed by-law 8834, in these terms:\u2014\n1. No person shall use the land fronting or abutting on either side of Prince Arthur Avenue, between Avenue Road and Huron Street, or erect or use any buildings on the said land for any other purpose than that of a detached private residence.\nThis by-law shall take effect from and after receiving the approval of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board,\nThis by-law was passed in professed execution of the authority given to the council by 11 Geo. V, 1921, c. 63, section 10, which is in these words:\u2014\nThe Municipal Act is amended by inserting after section 399 the following section 399a:\n399a. By-laws may be passed by the councils of cities, towns and villages, and of townships abutting on an urban municipality.\n1. For prohibiting the use of land or the erection or use of buildings within any defined area or areas or abutting on any defined highway or part of a highway for any other purpose than that of a detached private residence.\n2. For regulating the height, bulk, location, spacing and character of buildings to be erected or altered within any defined area or areas or abutting on any defined highway or part of a highway, and the proportion of the area of the lot which such building may occupy.\n(a) No by-law passed under this section shall apply to any land or building which on the day the by-law is passed is erected or used for any purpose prohibited by the by-law so long as it continues to be used for that purpose, nor shall it apply to any building in course of erection or to any building the plans for which have been approved by the city architect prior to the date of the passing of the by-law, so long as when erected it is used for the purpose for which it was erected.\n(b) No by-law passed by this section shall come into force or be repealed or amended without the approval of the municipal board; * * *\nApplications for mandamus, made by the appellants, were refused.\nThe by-law having been approved by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board by a majority of two to one, the chairman dissenting, an action was brought by the appellants, praying a declaration that the by-law was invalid, or, in the alternative, a declaration that it did not apply to the lands of the appellants, and that the appellants were entitled to a permit to erect a school-house; and for a mandatory injunction requiring the city architect to issue a permit; and damages.\nThis action was tried by Mr. Justice Middleton, who dismissed it. Mr. Justice Middleton had already held in Cridland v. City of Toronto[7] that the city architect ought not to delay the approval of plans with a view to effectuating the purpose of a proposed restrictive by-law. \u201cHad this course been adopted,\u201d in relation that is to say to the application of the appellants, he observed in his judgment,\nand had the plans been approved before the by-law was passed, the rights of the Board would have been saved, but the situation is now governed by the law which I have quoted,\nthe statute above set out, \u201cand I can grant no relief.\u201d The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal.\nThe statute on which the by-law rests endows the councils of municipalities of the designated classes with authority to restrict, in a material degree, the exercise by an owner of land of his rights of ownership. The legislature no doubt thought that, under the conditions nominated, a municipal council might not unreasonably consider that a landowner ought, in the general interest, to submit to some abridgement of his freedom. But it is very evident that when such a power is put into execution in an occupied street or district, there must be some provision for the protection of the existing status in order to avoid the possibility of serious, if not intolerable, injustice. Accordingly we find that the legislature, as might have been expected, has provided that no by-law, enacted under the authority of the statute, shall affect the use of any existing building for any purpose for which it is in use, at the date of the passing of the by-law, or the completion of any building then in process of erection, or the erection of any building, the plans of which, before that date, have been approved by the city architect.\nThe right of the owner of land, therefore, to make use of it, subject to the existing by-laws, in the erection of such buildings upon it as he thinks proper to erect, is preserved inviolate down to the point of time when the restrictive by-law is actually passed, and thereafter, in the limited degree prescribed, in the special cases mentioned. That right, as Mr. Justice Middleton held in the case already cited, includes the right to receive the necessary permit for the erection of a building proposed to be erected in conformity with the law in force for the time being. It is quite manifest that in the result, if effect be given to the judgments of the Ontario courts, this right is denied the appellants.\nThe by-law producing this result cannot, in view of the circumstances, in our opinion, be sustained as a valid exercise of the authority given by the statute. The protection of the existing status is a substantive element in the purpose of the enactment. The by-law, passed in the circumstances in which it was passed, necessarily had the effect (and it was so designed) of depriving the appellants of the benefit of a status of which the statute guaranteed the protection. That, in our opinion, is not according to the tenor of the authority created.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and there should be a declaration in the sense of the opinion just expressed. The judgment will include a declaration that the appellants are entitled to have their plans considered by the architect, and, if they conform to the law, approved. An injunction is probably unnecessary; nor would it appear to be necessary to make any order as to the mandamus proceedings except as to the costs, but these points may be spoken to, if desired, on the settlement of the minutes. The appellants will have leave to apply, and they will have their costs throughout.\nThe appellants having succeeded in establishing their legal rights, we cannot refrain from expressing a hope that even now with the co-operation so far as necessary or useful of all parties concerned, it may be possible to make other arrangements which will relieve the residents of the street of the very grave detriment and hardship arising from the presence of the school, the existence of which is not disputed. In saying this we have no intention of intimating any doubt that the appellants acted in what they conceived to be their duty in the execution of the important functions entrusted to them by the law, but we hope it is not impossible that, having established their legal rights, they may find it consonant with their duty to make a serious effort to this end.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Day, Ferguson & Walsh.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William Johnston.\n[1] [1923] 54 Ont.

Dubois (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1924: February 15; 1924: May 13.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Mignault and Malouin JJ. and Maclean J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Collision between two vehicles\u2014Accident due to negligence of both' drivers\u2014Joint and several liability\u2014Rule of common fault\u2014Not applicable in absence of fault by the victim\u2014Verdict\u2014Articles 1053, 1054, 1056, 1106 C.C.\u2014Articles 3, 500, 1248 C.C.P. In a case of collision between two vehicles in consequence of independent acts of negligence committed by their respective drivers, both directly contributing to the accident and to the injury suffered by a person having no control over the driver of the vehicle in which he was travelling, both drivers are jointly and severally liable. The Grand Trunk Ry Co. v. McDonald (57 Can. S.C.R. 268) followed. In such circumstances, the rule of common fault (which mitigates the liability of the negligent party owing to the contributing fault of the victim) does not apply; and the injured person is entitled to the full amount of the damages suffered by him, as the negligence of the driver or of any other passenger of the vehicle cannot be imputed to him.\nThe jury assessed the damages at $30,000; but under a misapprehension as to a rule of law applicable to the case (the question of common fault above stated), they awarded only \"fifty per cent of the damages\" to the respondent.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that the Court of King's Bench had authority under the provisions of articles 3 and 1248 C.C.P. to give effect to the conclusion necessarily resulting from the findings of the jury under a proper application of the law; and that court had the right, when affirming the judgment of the trial judge, to award to the respondent the full amount of the damages as found by the jury.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, varying the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nGeoffrion K.C. and F. B\u00e9\u00efque K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and St. Jacques K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014Dr. Gratton, the owner of an automobile car, had invited four guests to accompany him on a drive along the King Edward highway leading from Montreal to the United States boundary line.\nThe said owner was his own chauffeur in said drive and in no way under the control of any of his guests in the conduct thereof.\nDr. Desjardins, the husband of respondent, was one of said guests and took no part in directing the said owner and chauffeur. The respondent (now his widow) did not accompany the party.\nThe said highway is crossed at a very oblique angle by the appellant's railway track. And, by reason of the sur- rounding conditions interrupting the view of those in an auto desiring to see any train or car on the railway, or those in a car travelling along the same, was in fact a dangerous crossing.\nThe said highway carried a very heavy traffic, and thus rendered it doubly dangerous.\nThe owner and chauffeur was proceeding at too high a rate of speed in approaching such a crossing, and when some of his guests who had caught sight of something moving on the railway track (which turned out to be two handcars tied together) and warned him thereof, he, in response thereto, by an error of judgment, increased his speed in the hope of crossing before the cars on the railway track could reach him, and diverted his auto slightly in the opposite direction to increase the distance between him and the incoming cars.\nHis effort was a failure, for the front one of said incoming cars struck the hind wheel of his auto and upset same on the adjacent embankment. That resulted in such serious injuries to the late Dr. Desjardins that he died in consequence thereof.\nHence this action by the respondent widow on behalf of herself and her eight children.\nBy reason of the introduction of numerous irrelevant suggestions set up during the trial, this case has, I respectfully submit, been rendered needlessly confusing. And questions were submitted to the jury, and answers got thereto, which seem to have continued the confusion of thought engendered thereby.\nThe sole issue was or ought to have been confined to the question of whether or not the defendant (now appellant) was guilty of negligence which produced the death of Dr. Desjardins.\nEven if others had contributed thereto, but were not defendants herein, so long as it clearly appeared that neither deceased nor respondent was one of them, the issue was within a very narrow compass.\nThe said two cars tied together were hand-cars, of course small and low, used by the workmen in course of their repairs on appellant's track, for carring them to and from their work, and their tools or other material incidental to the performance of their work in repairing said track.\nIt is alleged in appellant's factum that a power motor used in the first car could not with the power it had in use travel at a greater speed than from eight to ten miles an hour.\nSuch being the case, it would, I submit, if the car properly equipped for such an emergency, as it ought to have been when used to cross such a much travelled highway as that in question herein, have been easily stopped at a safe distance from the automobile.\nIndeed the instructions given the foreman in charge of such cars by his superior officer directed him to stop if necessary. I fear there was a disobedient bravado existent, arising out of a supposed preference the appellant's cars had over highway travellers.\nThe question 6 submitted to the jury and the answers thereto are as follows:\u2014\n6th. Is the said accident due to the common fault of defendant and one or several of the passengers in the automobile in which the said L. N. Desjardins was then travelling? If so, which of them is in fault and in what did the fault of each consist?\nYes. Defendant is in fault in not having a whistle, bell, or some proper device for giving alarm, and also not having on their motor such control which would enable them to stop at short distance before crossings and avoid accidents.\nThe auto was travelling at a rate of speed which prevented them from stopping in due time; consequently, the driver of the auto, Doctor Albert Gratton, was at fault; also Abb\u00e9 Gauthier, Camille Gratton and Joseph Gratton were partly at fault for advising. Unanimous.\nThe latter paragraph as to others I submit does not apply to anything necessary for the determination of this case, but the preceding finding against the appellant is not only amply supported by the evidence but also should dispose of all involved herein save the question of damages (covered by a later finding) if we have any regard to articles 1053 and 1054 of the Quebec Civil Code, which I think contain the relevant law which should govern our decision herein.\nI cannot agree with appellant's counsel that the reference to the defective equipment of the car should be discarded on the assumption that this car, or those cars used for the purpose they were, had any preference to the right-of-way at this crossing. It may be implied from the statutory provision relative to a locomotive and the train it is hauling that such a preference is given to such a train over the rest of the public travel at a crossing, but there is nothing, I submit, to entitle the workman using such a hand-car for the purposes of his work to any such preference.\nWould he have the right, if repairing the railway track where it crosses the highway, to keep on working and disregard the public travel along the highway?\nI cannot find any statutory provision that would justify such preference either for the car carrying the men home, for which purpose it was being used at the time in question, or for such a specimen of obstinacy as I suggest by way of illustrating the absurdity of the preference set up.\nI admit the preference given to trains drawn by locomotives is not as clear and distinct in the Quebec legislation I have looked at, as in the \"Railway Act\" of Canada, but I cannot see how that helps appellant.\nIn other legislation we have had recently to consider the definition of a train and its preferential right was clear and explicit, but certainly did not extend to a hand-car.\nIn my humble opinion the hand-car in question and its driver had no more preference than a truck car has over an ordinary auto when meeting it at a busy street corner in our city.\nIn considering all that sort of legislation and how it is to be reasonably and rationally dealt with, the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Rex v. Broad[1], written by Lord Sumner, and cited to us herein, after my brother Duff had called attention to it, is well worth considering.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The action was brought by the respondent, the widow of L. N. Desjardins, who sued personally as well as in her capacity of tutrix of her eight minor children. The respondent's husband was killed in July, 1921, while driving as a passenger in an automobile owned and driven by Dr. Albert Gratton, of Montreal, with three other friends. The accident occurred at the point at which the appellant's railway crosses the King Edward Highway, about a mile from the village of Napierville, where the automobile was struck by a train of two hand-cars running on the appellant's line, which were propelled by a gasoline motor attached to the leading car. The jury found the appellant company\nin fault in not having a whistle, bell or some proper device for giving the alarm, and also not having their motor under such control as would enable them to stop in a short distance before crossings and thus avoid accidents.\nThey also found that the automobile was\ntravelling at a rate of speed which prevented them from stopping in due time,\nand they attributed this to the fault of the driver and to that of three of the party: l'abb\u00e9 Gauthier, Camille Gratton and Joseph Gratton. Impliedly they quite definitely acquitted the respondent's husband of any fault.\nBefore discussing the question which arises upon the form of the verdict, it is necessary to advert to one or two questions of law raised by the appellant company. First, it is contended that there being no statutory duty imposed upon railway companies in the province of Quebec requiring them to equip vehicles, such as the hand-cars with which we are concerned in this litigation, with means for signalling their approach to frequented highways, they are under no legal obligation to take such precautions; and further that no duty is imposed by the law of Quebec upon the servants of such companies to have such vehicles under proper control on approaching such highways. It is sufficient to say that the law as laid down in numerous authorities is quite incompatible with this contention. In The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[2], it is pointed out by Lord Halsbury, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee, that the statutory right to work a railway does not, by the law of England or the law of Quebec,\nauthorize the thing to be done negligently, or even unnecessarily to cause damage to others.\nWhether there was default in the performance of this duty, not to act negligently or unnecessarily to be the occasion of peril to others, in running these hand-cars without having proper control over them and without any means of giving passengers on the highway warning of their approach, was a question of fact; and I see no reason whatever to disagree with the finding of the jury that in fact there was negligence on part of the servants of the appellant company. Slightly different in form although the same in substance is the argument presented in the factum of the appellant, where it is contended that in the statutory authority given to the appellant company to construct and work their railway is involved the consequence that passengers on the highway when crossing the railway must exclusively bear the risk of injury from passing trains, so long as the railway company observes the explicit statutory requirements as to signals. Rex v. Broad[3] may be referred to as authority (if authority, indeed, could be needed for such a proposition) that nothing short of a legislative enactment, expressed in language unambiguous and precise, could affect the right of persons on the highway to have reasonable care exercised by the appellant company in the use of its line, with a view to the safety of such persons.\nThen it was argued that the negligence of the driver of the automobile was negligence which must be imputed to the respondent's husband. That argument is sufficiently answered by the decision of the House of Lords in The Bernina[4], and by the decision of this court in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. McDonald[5], in which it was held that where an accident arises in consequence of independent acts of negligence committed by two sets of persons, both directly contributing to the accident and to the injury suffered by the plaintiff, each is severally answerable under the law of Quebec to the plaintiff for the damages sustained by him; a principle which is applicable here.\nThe appellant company is therefore responsible to the respondent under article 1056 of the Civil Code for the whole of the loss suffered by her in consequence of her husband's death. But a question which requires notice arises from the form of the verdict. The jury, having found that the accident was in part due to the fault of the servants of the appellant company and in part to the fault of some of those who were travelling in the automobile and having by necessary implication acquitted the respondent's husband of fault, the logical consequence of these findings would be a verdict against the appellant company for the whole amount of the damages suffered by the respondent. The jury, however, having assessed these damages at $30,000 and having, in answer to a question, stated that there was \"common fault\" and that in view of such common fault\nfifty per cent of the damages should be attributed to the defendant,\nproceeded as if the amount awarded the respondent were the sum of $15,000 to distribute that sum among the respondent and her children, awarding to each of the children $1,000, and to the respondent personally $7,000. The explanation of this seems to be clear enough when the form of the questions is considered. Question six is in these words:\n6. Is the said accident due to the common fault of the defendant and one or several of the passengers in the automobile in which the said L. N. Desjardins was then travelling? If so, which of them is in fault, and in what did the fault of each consist?\nQuestion eight in these words:\n8. If you find common fault, what proportion of the damages should be attributed to the defendant?\nIt seems sufficiently plain that the jury, having acquitted the respondent's husband of fault, conceived it to be their duty to divide the damages by ascribing part to the defendant company and part to the persons responsible for the course of the automobile, with the result that only fifty per cent of the damages suffered by the respondent were imputed to the negligence of the appellant company; and I am afraid that some excuse for this course is to be found in the manner in which they were instructed upon the rules of law they were to apply.\nThe Court of King's Bench did not feel embarrassed by the form in which the verdict was given, and upheld the trial judge in giving judgment in favour of the plaintiff for the whole amount of the damages which were by him fixed at $28,000 by an obvious slip. The only alternative was of course to grant a new trial; but in granting a new trial, in the circumstances of this case, the court would obviously be called upon to exercise the authority given by article 500 C.C.P., to direct a new trial as to such issues only as were affected by the misdirection which was the cause of the jury's mistake. Now when the findings are scrutinized, it becomes abundantly clear that those dealing with the decisive issues, the issues as to the appellant company's fault, the victim's fault, and as to the amount of the damages and the proportionate shares of the dependents therein\u2014leave nothing further to submit to the jury. These findings conclude the matters in dispute; and the Court of King's Bench held (Greenshields J. who dissented from the judgment, concurred on this point with the majority) that its authority under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure was comprehensive enough to enable it to give effect to the conclusion necessarily resulting from the findings of the jury, when the answer to the 8th question was disregarded as resting upon a misapprehension as to the legal effect of the other findings.\nI see no reason to disagree with this view. Article 1248 C.C.P. when read with article 3 seems to point to an intention on the part of the legislature that the court should be endowed with rather wide powers enabling it within the limits fixed by the rules of substantive law to prevent the defeat of substantive rights by mere technicalities of procedure; and the present case seems to have afforded a favourable occasion for the exercise of such powers.\nMignault, J. (dissenting).\u2014L'intim\u00e9e, rest\u00e9e veuve avec huit enfants mineurs dont un posthume, poursuit la compagnie appelante qu'elle tient civilement responsable de la mort de son mari, feu L. N. Desjardins, en son vivant chirurgien-dentiste de Montr\u00e9al, et r\u00e9clame, tant pour elle que pour ses enfants mineurs dont elle est la tutrice, la somme de $60,000 comme dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le jour de l'accident, le 28 juillet 1921, Desjardins avait pris place dans une automobile conduite par le docteur Albert Gratton o\u00f9 se trouvaient \u00e9galement l'abb\u00e9 P. E. Gauthier et les nomm\u00e9s Camille Gratton et Joseph Gratton. Il n'y avait aucune relation de commettant \u00e0 pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 entre le docteur Desjardins et les autres occupants de l'automobile. A une traverse \u00e0 niveau sur le chemin de fer de l'appelante, pr\u00e8s de Napierville, l'automobile o\u00f9 Desjardins se trouvait fut frapp\u00e9e par un wagonnet m\u00fb par un moteur \u00e0 gazoline et conduit par des employ\u00e9s de l'appelante sur le chemin de fer de celle-ci, et le docteur Desjardins eut l'\u00e9pine dorsale bris\u00e9e et est mort des suites de ses blessures une couple de semaines plus tard. De l\u00e0 l'action en responsabilit\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a prise contre l'appelante.\nEn principe, lorsque quelqu'un est bless\u00e9 par la faute de deux ou plusieurs personnes, il peut les tenir conjointement et solidairement responsables du pr\u00e9judice qu'il en \u00e9prouve. Il peut donc actionner Tune des personnes en faute pour le tout, et c'est ce que l'intim\u00e9e a fait. Cela est certain dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 le code civil en a une disposition expresse (l'art. 1106). La jurisprudence est au m\u00eame effet en France o\u00f9 le code civil ne contient pas d'article semblable, et je trouve dans une d\u00e9cision de la cour de cassation du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1883, Dalloz, 1883, 1.451, l'\u00e9nonciation de la r\u00e8gle suivante qui ne fait aucun doute dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, m\u00eame sans le qualificatif qui para\u00eet en restreindre la port\u00e9e.\nTous ceux qui par leur coop\u00e9ration commune ont concouru au pr\u00e9judice \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par un tiers, sans qu'il soit possible de d\u00e9terminer la part exacte de chacun d'eux dans ce pr\u00e9judice, doivent \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s solidairement \u00e0 le r\u00e9parer.\nAinsi une collision arrive entre deux voitures par la faute de leurs conducteurs, ceux-ci en sont responsables conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un passager qui n'est pas le commettant de l'un des conducteurs, et partant responsable de sa faute. Cela est conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudence de cette cour: The Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. McDonald[6].\nD'autre part, si dans l'esp\u00e8ce que je suppose la collision entre les deux voitures est caus\u00e9e par la seule faute de l'un des conducteurs, celui-ci (ainsi que son commettant) en est seul responsable, et il n'existe aucun droit d'action contre l'autre conducteur.\nEnfin, dans le cas o\u00f9 les deux conducteurs sont en faute, si le passager d'une des voitures actionne en responsabilit\u00e9 le conducteur de l'autre voiture, la r\u00e8gle de la faute commune; qui mitige la responsabilit\u00e9 quand la victime a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accident, ne s'applique pas, et il importe peu qu'il y ait eu faute de la part du conducteur et des passagers de la voiture o\u00f9 ce passager se trouvait.\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce, l'action de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e uniquement contre l'appelante, et la faute des compagnons du Dr Desjardins, si elle n'\u00e9tait pas la seule cause de l'accident, \u00e9tait indiff\u00e9rente. Il ne pouvait \u00eatre question dans ce cas de la doctrine de la faute commune, si le Dr Desjardins n'\u00e9tait pas lui-m\u00eame en faute, car alors le seul point \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer \u00e9tait de savoir s'il y avait eu faute de la part des employ\u00e9s de l'appelante. En d'autres termes, la question de la faute commune ne se pr\u00e9sente que dans les rapports entre la victime de l'accident et la personne qu'elle en tient responsable.\nJe vais maintenant citer les questions suivantes pos\u00e9es au jury ainsi que ses r\u00e9ponses.\n2. Is the said accident due to the sole fault of the defendant or its employees? If so, in what did such fault consist?\nNo. Unanimous.\n3. Is the said accident due to the sole fault of the late Louis Napol\u00e9on Desjardins? If so, in what did such fault consist?\nNo. Unanimous.\n4. Is the said accident due to the sole fault of one or several of the passengers in the automobile in which the late L. N. Desjardins was then travelling? If so, which of them is in fault and in what did such fault consist?\nNo. Unanimous.\n5. Is the said accident due to the common fault of defendant and the said L. N. Desjardins? If so, in what did the fault of each consist?\nThis question is answered by the answer to question number six. Unanimous.\n(The attention of the jury being called to the fact that the answer is not categorical after deliberation, it is withdrawn and replaced by the following): No. Unanimous.\n6. Is the said accident due to the common fault of defendant and one or several of the passengers in the automobile in which the said L. N. Desjardins was then travelling? If so, which of them is in fault and in what did the fault of each consist?\nYes. Defendant is in fault in not having a whistle, bell, or some proper device for giving alarm, and also not having on their motor such control which would enable them to stop at short distance before crossings and avoid accidents.\nThe auto was travelling at a rate of speed which prevented them from stopping in due time; consequently, the driver of the auto, Doctor Albert Gratton, was at fault; also Abb\u00e9 Gauthier, Camille Gratton and Joseph Gratton were partly at fault for advising. Unanimous.\n7. Has plaintiff personally and in her quality of tutrix to her minor children suffered any damages as a result of the death of the said L. N. Desjardins, and at what sum do you assess the damages?\nYes. Thirty thousand ($30,000). Unanimous.\n8. If you find common fault, what proportion of the damages should be attributed to the defendant?\nFifty per cent. Unanimous. 9. If some damages are granted, how do you divide them between plaintiff and her children?\nThe children, one thousand dollars ($1,000) each; the plaintiff, seven thousand dollars ($7,000). Unanimous.\nLes questions 2, 3, 4 et 5 \u00e9taient pertinentes \u00e0 la contestation li\u00e9e entre les parties. Par contre, on n'aurait pas d\u00fb poser au jury la question 6, car elle demande si l'accident fut caus\u00e9 par la faute commune de la d\u00e9fenderesse et de tiers, et la faute de tiers, coop\u00e9rant avec la faute de la d\u00e9fenderesse, ne pouvait excuser cette derni\u00e8re ni diminuer sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nCette question 6 a \u00e9videmment embrouill\u00e9 le jury. Celui-ci a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les dommages de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la somme de $30,000. Venant alors \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8se de la faute commune que le jury avait \u00e9cart\u00e9e, en tant que le Dr Desjardins \u00e9tait concern\u00e9, la question 8 demande quelle proportion des dommages doit \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse si le jury trouve faute commune, et il r\u00e9pond: cinquante pour cent. Proc\u00e9dant ensuite \u00e0 partager les dommages entre l'intim\u00e9e et ses huit enfants, le jury ne partage entre eux que cinquante pour cent du montant total des dommages, d\u00e9montrant par l\u00e0 que c'\u00e9tait la seule somme qu'il entendait leur accorder.\nOn peut interpr\u00e9ter la r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 la question 8 comme impliquant soit qu'il trouvait faute commune chez Desjardins, et alors il y a contradiction avec ses r\u00e9ponses aux questions 5 et 6, ou comme indiquant que le jury \u00e9tait d'opinion qu'il y avait eu faute commune chez les autres occupants de l'automobile, et j'ai dit que dans ce cas la doctrine de la faute commune ne s'applique pas. Lisant les r\u00e9ponses du jury aux questions 8 et 9 avec les instructions du savant juge, on voit que le jury a pu, malgr\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question 5, envisager la possibilit\u00e9 d'une faute chez Desjardins. Apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 la question 8, le savant juge a donn\u00e9 les instructions suivantes au jury:\nWell now this case has got its difficulties. The common fault I suppose would be either the common fault of Desjardins and the defendant company, or the common fault of the defendant company and say of the other occupants in the car.\nBy the court to counsel: Is that the way you understand it, gentlemen of the bar?\nBy the court: If you find anybody else at fault, if you find the defendant company and the plaintiff at fault that is easy. Let us say the defendant company and Desjardins at fault, I would suggest that your answer to No. 8 would be, and you mention whose common fault it is, that is to say you will mention whose joint fault it was, that is the combination of two faults, both of which were necessary to produce this accident, and without which this accident could not have happened.\nIf you find that there is such a combination at fault, then you will say who are the parties you find are commonly at fault, and what proportion of the damages you attribute to the defendant company.\nIf the damages are granted, you will state how you divide them between the plaintiff and children; the plaintiff has set out a series of names of the children, and if you have already mentioned the full damages, which will be a bulk sum in answer to question 7,\u2014I suppose you will answer that in a block sum, that is all the plaintiff herself is entitled to and all she is entitled to as representing the children.\nThen in answer to question 9, you will detail, if you take the list of the children set out in the declaration, you will say so much for the plaintiff herself, Mrs. Desjardins, and so much for whatever the names of the different children are.\nJe ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de penser qu'\u00e0 tort ou \u00e0 raison le jury ne voulait mettre \u00e0 la charge de la d\u00e9fenderesse que la moiti\u00e9 des dommages. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est que le verdict est \u00e9quivoque.\nMaintenant, pour donner effet \u00e0 ce verdict on pouvait envisager deux alternatives: ou bien accorder \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 ses enfants les cinquante pour cent des dommages, part attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, soit $15,000; ou bien lui donner jugement pour le plein montant des dommages, $30,000. C'est la derni\u00e8re alternative que le savant juge a choisie, mais par une erreur qui ne peut plus \u00eatre corrig\u00e9e, il n'a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e que $28,000.\nEtant donn\u00e9es les r\u00e9ponses du jury, l'autre alternative m'aurait paru pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable, car, pour une raison ou pour une autre, le jury n'a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse que cinquante pour cent des dommages, et en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question 9 le seul montant qu'il accorde \u00e0 la demanderesse et \u00e0 ses enfants, on le voit par le partage qu'il en fait, c'est la somme de $15,000.\nJe ne pourrais certainement pas donner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e plus que le jury ne lui a r\u00e9ellement accord\u00e9, quand m\u00eame je serais convaincu, et je le suis, que c'est par erreur que le jury n'a attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse que la moiti\u00e9 des dommages qu'il a constat\u00e9s. Mais puisque l'erreur du jury a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la forme des questions qu'on lui a pos\u00e9es, et peut-\u00eatre, je le dis avec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, par les explications du savant juge, il me para\u00eetrait plus juste pour la demanderesse d'ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Je ne puis faire davantage, car on ne peut \u00e9videmment condamner l'appelante \u00e0 payer une plus forte proportion des dommages que celle que le jury lui a attribu\u00e9e.\nJ'ajoute qu'\u00e0 mon avis il ne s'agit pas ici d'une question de proc\u00e9dure mais de l'interpr\u00e9tation des r\u00e9ponses du jury. Le juge pr\u00e9sidant le proc\u00e8s aurait pu poser des questions suppl\u00e9mentaires au jury pour \u00e9claircir les r\u00e9ponses qu'il avait donn\u00e9es; il ne l'a pas fait et le verdict ne peut \u00eatre chang\u00e9 sur appel.\nJe maintiendrais donc l'appel et j'ordonnerais un nouveau proc\u00e8s, avec frais devant la cour d'appel et cette cour, les frais du premier proc\u00e8s devant faire partie des frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la cause.\nMalouin J.\u2014Je suis d'opinion de rejeter le pr\u00e9sent appel avec d\u00e9pens pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par le juge Duff.\nMaclean J.\u2014I concur in dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: B\u00e9\u00efque & B\u00e9\u00efque.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St. Jacques, Filion & Houle.\n[1] [1915] A.C. 1110, at p. 1113.\n[2] [1902] A.C. 220.\n[3] [1915] A.C. 1110.\n[4] [1888] 13 A.C.

Statute of 1920, making the re-enactment of section 155 of the Taxation Act retrospective so as to make any person who earned income from mines in the years 1915 and 1917 liable to taxation under its provisions, is ultra vires.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1923] 3 W.W.R. 865) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of the Court of Revision which had confirmed the taxation of the appellant in respect of income derived from the working of mines.\nThe appellant, residing in the United States of America, was operating in 1915 and 1917 a mine in British Columbia and received income therefrom. During the same period, the appellant paid the production or 2 per cent tax on the output of the mine from which he received the income. In 1920 he was assessed on the above-mentioned income received in 1915 and 1917. The appellant appealed to the Court of Revision which confirmed the assessment.\nHamilton K.C. for the appellant.\nDonaghy for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dealing with an appeal from the assessment in 1920 of the appellant in respect of products of a mining property for the years 1915 and 1917.\nThe appellant was, during all the said years, a non-resident, being domiciled in the United States. During the years 1915 and 1917 he was possessed of the mine in question and properly assessed there in respect thereof or its products, and paid the taxes he was then liable for under the Taxation Act of said province.\nIn the last named year he would seem to have sold or given an option of purchase to a company to be operative from the 1st of January, 1918, and thereafter that company operated the mine and was assessed in respect thereof.\nIn April, 1918, an Act was passed by the legislature changing the law as it stood in said years 1915 and 1917, and further in the year 1919, and again in 1920. In the last-named year it is pretended that the legislation then enacted, coupled with what had preceded it in the years 1918 and 1919, had become so effectual as to impose upon the appellant retrospectively income taxes for said years 1915 and 1917, although as the law then stood, he clearly was not so liable.\nI should require more clear and express language used to uphold such a confiscatory proposition under the name of a taxing Act.\nMoreover I gravely doubt the power of the legislature to do so, and confiscate, pro tanto, the property of non-residents who had parted with their property meantime and yet liable for the future income from the purchase price.\nIt would only be in the case of the resident in a foreign country that the pretension of the respondent could become operative, for it is only such that had for the years 1915 and 1917 escaped, by virtue of the law as it then stood.\nI am quite clear that such retrospective legislation is unjust and also, in this case on the existent facts in question herein, ultra vires, even if it were so expressed as to render its construction operative despite the rule applicable to a taxing Act if intra vires.\nThe only power the legislature has is that conferred by section 92, subsection (2) of the British North America Act, 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014\nDirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nCan retrospective legislation such as this ever be held to be imposing direct taxation? I submit not.\nWe have been told that the power of a local legislature over property is such that it can transfer one man's property to another: but even so, it does not enable the local government to take, by way of a penalty called \" taxation,\" the entire property of one of its citizens, much less the property of a foreign citizen, as it would be doing if this tax is to be enforced as against appellant. He is not (we were told in the course of the argument) in possession of the property in question for he had transferred it by an option sale, and if, as probable, he has protected himself against the payment of any taxes by a covenant from his vendees who, if that is to be observed, will have to pay the taxes, surely as against them it would be very indirect taxation.\nAnd if appellant has to pay the taxes, he is paying the taxes of another, and in that sense it would be rather an indirect tax as a penalty for nothing.\nAt every angle from which one can look at such an attempt to recover this assessment, it seems to me a most offensive attempt at violation of the power given by the above quoted power of direct taxation.\nThe agreement between the appellant and the vendees of the property came before our notice in the case of the vendees' appeal, and seems to have been filed in that case, I find as writing this. Perhaps, therefore, had it not been for what occurred in the course of the argument of counsel for the appellant asserting the fact of this transfer being operative from the 1st of January, 1918, and appellant thereafter being non-resident in Canada, I should not have the right to consider it.\nThe cases were both argued at the same sitting before us and by the same counsel in each case. He for the appellant seems to have been the same throughout the course of the several appeals.\nRetrospective taxation for from three to five years seems so intolerable that if possible at all it must be expressed differently from what are the provisions in this case.\nI would therefore allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant is a citizen of the United States, who has never resided in Canada. During the year 1915, as well as in 1917, he was working a mine in British Columbia, and in receipt of an income from it. For these periods the appellant paid the (so-called) production tax of two per cent on the output of the mine. In 1920 he was assessed by the assessor at Kaslo, B.C., in respect of the income received from the mine in the years mentioned. The appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[3] was dismissed, and from that judgment he now appeals to this court. It is not disputed that, at the time when the income, in respect of which the assessment is made, was received, it was not assessable under any law then in force in British Columbia. The assessment was made professedly under authority given by statutes passed in the years 1918 and 1920. The law actually in force in the years 1915 and 1917 is, subject to amendments made in 1913 and 1917 mentioned hereafter, to be found in sec. 155 of c. 222, R.S.B.C., 1911, which in effect provides that\nthere shall be assessed, levied and collected quarterly from every person owning, managing, leasing or working a mine other than a coal mine *** two per cent on the assessed value of all ore *** gained from any lands in the province, and which have been sold or removed from the premises (and) the taxes imposed by this section shall be in substitution for all taxes upon the land *** so long as the said land is not used for other than mining purposes, and shall also be in substitution for all taxes upon the personal property used in the working of the said mines.\nBy sec. 25 of c. 89 of the Statutes of 1918, sec. 155 was repealed and a new section substituted therefor, in the following words:\n155. (1) Subject to subsection (2), every person owning, managing, leasing, or working a mine, other than a coal or gold mine, shall be assessed and taxed on his income from the mine as provided in Part I, or on the output of the mine under this Part, whichever tax shall be the greater in amount. The tax on output shall be assessed, levied, and collected quarterly, and shall consist of two per cent on the assessed value of all ore removed from the premises of the mine. In case the tax on the income proves to be greater in amount, the quarterly payments collected shall be considered to be in part payment of the tax payable on the income earned during the corresponding period.\n(2) In the case of ore producing mines which prove taxable on their output not yielding and realizing on ore a market value of five thousand dollars in any one year, and in the case of all mines (placer or dredging) which prove taxable on their output not producing a gross value of two thousand dollars in any one year, the taxpayer shall, upon a statement verified by him and certified by the assessor of the district, and forwarded to the Minister of Mines, be entitled to:\u2014\n(a) A refund, in the case of ore-producing mines, of one-half of the tax paid; and\n(b) A refund of the whole tax in the case of placer or dredging mines.\n(3) Every person owning, managing, leasing, or working a gold mine, which shall for the purposes of taxation consist of a mine in which the market value of the gold recovered from ore is eighty-five per cent or more of the gross value of the metal content of such ore, shall be assessed and taxed on his income from the mine as provided in Part I: Provided that any mineral tax paid during the year 1917 may be applied to payment of the income tax levied in respect of the income from the mine during the corresponding period. (4) The taxes imposed by subsections (1) and (2) shall be in substitution for all taxes upon the land from which the said ore or placer gold is mined or won, so long as the said land is not used for other than mining purposes, and shall also be in substitution for all taxes upon the personal property used in the working of the said mines.\n(5) In addition to all other taxes imposed by this or any other Act, there shall be assessed, levied, and collected quarterly from every person, owning, managing, leasing, or working a mine in the province, and paid to His Majesty, a tax of thirty-seven and one-half cents per ton of two thousand pounds upon all iron ore removed from the premises of the mine, whether the ore is obtained from mineral claims held under a General Act or under any special Act of the legislature. Nothing in this subsection shall apply in respect of iron ore mined and used in the province as a flux in the smelting of ores or other metals.\nThis enactment, having been passed in the year 1918, would, of course, in itself not affect the appellant in respect of income received before that year, but by sec. 26 of the same statute it was enacted that :\n26. (1) The amendments of said chapter 222, as enacted by section 25 of this Act, shall relate back to and take effect from the first day of January, 1917; and the provisions of the \"Surtax Act, 1917,\" shall apply in respect of all assessments for the year 1917 affected by such amendments.\n(2) Forthwith after this Act comes into force the Provincial Assessor for each assessment district shall determine the several amounts payable for taxes and surtaxes therein in respect of the year 1917 pursuant to this section, giving effect to all amendments in respect of deductions brought into force under the provisions of this Act, and shall cause to be inserted in the assessment rolls of the district a statement showing the amounts so levied against each taxpayer, and shall mail a notice of assessment in such form as the Minister of Finance may prescribe to each taxpayer affected, stating the amount payable by him and the date when the same is due and payable.\nThis last-mentioned section was again amended by sec. 19, c. 89, of the Statutes of 1920, by which ss. 1 of sec. 26 was struck out and the following subsection substituted :\n26. (1) The re-enactment of said section 155 by section 25 of this Act shall relate back and take effect and shall be deemed to have always related back and taken effect in such a manner that every person to whom subsection (1) of said section 155, as so re-enacted, applies shall be liable for taxes thereunder in like manner as if he had been liable and had been lawfully assessed and taxed thereunder on the assessment roll for 1917, revised in 1916, and the assessment roll for 1918, revised in 1917, in respect of income earned during the years 1915 and 1916 respectively, or, in the discretion of the Minister, in respect of income earned during the last fiscal or business year of the taxpayer terminating prior to the thirty-first day of December, 1915 and 1916, respectively; and the provisions of the Surtax Act, 1917, shall apply in respect of all assessments for the year 1917 affected by such amendments. On behalf of the Crown it is contended, and it has been held by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, that the effect of this legislation of the years 1918 and 1920 is to bring within the operation of sec. 155 of c. 222, as re-enacted in 1918 by sec. 25 of c. 89 of the statutes of that year, the above-mentioned income earned by the appellant in the years 1915 and 1917.\nThe fundamental question obviously is whether the conditions, under which a mine owner's income is assessable under sec. 155 as so re-enacted, are conditions which can be affirmed to have been in existence in relation to the income so earned by the appellant in those years; and if that question be answered in the negative the assessment is obviously invalid. On behalf of the appellant, it is contended that this section, in so far as it imposes a tax upon income, has no application to a non-resident. The contention is based upon that part of the section which declares such income to be assessable \" as provided in Part I \" and admittedly by Part I non-residents are not assessable to income tax. As against that it is argued that section 155 deals with a special case, that the operative part of the section in question is quite unrestricted in its terms, save in this respect, that it applies only to income derived from a mine in British Columbia, and that on its true construction all income so earned, whether by residents or non-residents, falls within its purview.\nThe important words of sec. 155 as re-enacted in 1918 are\nshall be assessed and taxed on his income from the mine, as provided in Part I, or on the output of the mine under this part, whichever tax shall be the greater in amount.\nThe income is to be assessed and taxed \" as provided in Part I.\" The tax on the output is the tax under Part IV. Part I provides the machinery for assessment and imposes the liability to taxation, fixing the scale of rates, which are graduated according to the amount of taxable income. By sec. 23, every person\nother than corporations and persons assessed under Part IV\nof the Act, is required, when requested by the assessor, to make a return, upon a form supplied by the assessor, as to property and income; and by sec. 33, provision is made authorizing the assessor, in cases of default in furnishing the return or where he is not satisfied with the return, to make the assessment at such sum as, in the assessor's judgment, ought to be charged under the Act; and there is power given to make a supplementary assessment roll, increasing the value of the property or the income assessed where omissions are subsequently discovered. Admittedly, the reference to Part I manifests an intention that in order to ascertain the income from a mine for the purpose of applying the re-enacted section 155, this machinery shall be available, and that any income from the mine shall, for the purpose of applying the provisions of sec. 155, be treated as a part of the whole taxable income of the person assessed, within the meaning of Part I. That is to say, the assessment referred to in this section is not an assessment under Part IV within the meaning of sec. 23 of the Act.\nIt would appear to be very difficult indeed to harmonize with this view, which appears to me to be incontestable, the proposition that the liability of mine owners to be assessed and taxed in respect of income derived from their mining property is a special liability imposed by section 155 of Part IV. In 1918, when the section was re-enacted in its present form, the resident mine owner was liable to assessment and taxation in respect of such income under Part I. To arrive at the result suggested, it would be necessary to suppose that by the re-enactment of 1918 this liability under Part I is abrogated, and a new liability created, which, in the case of resident mine owners, is, as regards its conditions, its scope, and the pecuniary measure of it, precisely the same as the pre-existing liability.\nThe contention that the words, \" as provided in Part I,\" refer only to machinery and rate, would be very much more forcible if income from mining property were not assessable and taxable already under Part I. Read literally, the words refer to assessment and taxation, \" as provided in Part I,\" which primarily means assessment and taxation as authorized in Part I. The re-enacted section therefore, in my judgment, construed in light of the relevant parts of the Act, is at least fairly capable of a construction according to which no new liability is imposed in respect of income tax; and that, I think, is on the whole the preferable reading.\nThis conclusion is fortified by two considerations of no little weight: The enactment is a taxing statute, and if construed according to the view advanced by the Crown, imposes a new liability to taxation. In conformity with settled principles, the enactment ought not to receive such a construction unless, on the fair reading of it, its language clearly discloses an intention to ereate such a liability. Words, which are equally consistent with the absence of such an intention, are not sufficient. The other consideration arises from the fact that by sec. 26 of the Act of 1918, sec. 155, as re-enacted in that statute, has a retrospective operation. In so far as it affects non-residents, the legislation of 1918 would appear to have had the effect of lightening the burden resting upon them under the law as it in fact was in the year 1917; for by the Act passed in May of that year, the provision of the statute of 1913, by which it was declared that a tax on output was to be in lieu of all taxes in respect of income derived from the mine, was repealed, and after this statute of 1917, the mine owner continued, until the passing of the statute of 1918, to be liable in respect not only of the output tax, but in respect of income tax as well, as he was before the passing of the Act of 1913. As regards non-residents, however, the effect of the legislation of 1918, on the construction proposed by the Crown, was, for the first time, to impose a liability to income tax and to impose it in respect of income which had been received in the preceding year, 1917. It is conceivable, of course, that the legislature, in a statute having apparently for its principal object the lightening of the burden of taxation upon resident mine owners, should, at one and the same time and by the same clause, impose retrospectively a new burden by way of taxation upon non-resident mine owners; but the intention to do so will not be ascribed to the legislature unless manifested by express words or by necessary implication\u2014nisi nominatim et de praeterito tempore cautum sit; and it is no answer to say that the law, to be construed, is plainly retrospective in a certain degree. The rule is that the maxim is applicable whenever we reach the line at which the words of the enactment cease to be plain.\nThat is a necessary and logical corollary of the general proposition, that you ought not to give a larger retrospective \" operation \" to a section, even in an Act which is to some extent intended to be retrospective, than you can plainly see the legislature meant. Reid v. Reid[4].\nIt appears to follow that where an enactment, admittedly retrospective, is expressed in language which leaves the scope of it open to doubt, and according to one construction it imposes retrospectively a new liability, while upon another at least equally admissible, it imposes no such burden, the latter construction is that which ought to be preferred.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the assessment annulled.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The question here is whether the appelant, a non-resident, is liable to taxation on the income he derived from a mine in British Columbia in the years 1915 and 1917. It is common ground that under the legislation in force during these years, he was not subject to the provincial income tax levied on residents of the province, but merely to the two per cent production tax on the ore extracted from his mine, which tax he paid. But the amendments to the Taxation Act adopted in 1918 and 1920 were expressly made retrospective, and the British Columbia Court of Appeal[5] has decided that they apply to a nonresident like the appellant, who paid all taxes due for these years and is now asked to pay a tax said to be retrospectively imposed.\nThe effect of the Taxation Act as it stood in 1915 and 1917 was as I have stated and the non-resident did not pay income tax. In 1919, he was deprived, but not retrospectively, of this privilege to the extent of the income earned by him within the province (c. 79, sect. 3, statutes of 1919). Mines were dealt with in Part V of the Act, and up to 1918 section 155 imposed only the production tax of two per cent, this tax being in substitution for all taxes on the land and on personal property used in the working of the mine, and also, between 1913 and 1917, for all taxes on the income derived from the mine. In 1918, section 155, which is in Part V, was re-enacted by section 25, c. 89, of the statutes of that year, and it was declared that\nevery person owning, managing, leasing, or working a mine, other than a coal or gold mine, shall be assessed and taxed on his income from the mine as provided in Part I, or on the output of the mine under this part, whichever tax shall be the greater in amount.\nThis tax on the output is two per cent, and by the effect of the amendment, in case the tax on the income from the mine is greater in amount than the production tax, the quarterly payments of the latter tax are considered as part payment of the tax payable on the incomes from the mine.\nThis of course would have applied only in the future, had not section 26 of the 1918 statute stated that the amendments of chapter 222 of the Revised Statutes (the Taxation Act), as enacted by section 25, should relate back to and take effect from the 1st of January, 1917. Whether this is the real construction of section 26 remains to be seen.\nThe legislature was apparently not satisfied with this declaration of retroactivity, for in 1920, by chapter 89, section 19, section 26 of the 1918 statute was amended by striking out subsection 1 and substituting therefor the following:\n26. (1) The re-enactment of said section 155 of section 25 of this Act shall relate back and take effect and shall be deemed to have always related back and taken effect in such a manner that every person to whom subsection (1) of said section 155, as so re-enacted, applies shall be liable for taxes thereunder in like manner as if he had been liable and had been lawfully assessed and taxed thereunder on the assessment roll for 1917, revised in 1916, and the assessment roll for 1918, revised in 1917, in respect of income earned during the years 1915 and 1916 respectively, or, in the discretion of the Minister, in respect of income earned during the last fiscal or business year of the taxpayer terminating prior to the thirty-first day of December, 1915 and 1916, respectively; and the provisions of the \"Surtax Act, 1917,\" shall apply in respect of all assessments for the year 1917 affected by such amendments.\nAs a result, section 155 as re-enacted in 1918 must be considered with the provision I have just cited.\nThe crucial point however is whether the appellant is a\nperson to whom subsection 1 of section 155, as so re-enacted, applies.\nThe appellant argues that the statement in the re-enacted section that every person owning, managing, leasing, or working a mine, shall be assessed and taxed on his income from the mine \"as provided in Part I,\" excludes a non-resident who is not subject to income tax under Part I.\nThe respondent, on the other hand, contends that this reference to Part I is tantamount to saying that the income tax imposed upon every person operating a mine shall be calculated and levied in the same way as the tax under Part I, in other words that the machinery for levying and calculating this tax shall be that provided by Part I.\nThis, however, does not appear to be the necessary meaning of the new section 155. It must be remembered that Part I of the Taxation Act imposes (section 4) a tax generally on real and personal property and on income, but before 1919 this did not apply to the income of non-residents. As defined in the Act, \"income\" would certainly comprise any amount derived from a mine. But before the amendments of 1918 and 1920, Part V dealt specifically (as it now deals) with taxation of mines and minerals other than coal and coke. And section 155, which, I have said, is in Part V, imposed a production tax of two per cent on the output of mines which tax was in substitution for taxes on land and personal property used in working the mine, and also, from 1913 to 1917, for income derived from the mine. When this system was changed in 1918 by the re-enactment of section 155, the owner or operator of a mine became subject to a tax on his income from the mine or to a two per cent tax on the output of the mine, whichever tax was greater in amount, and the owner or operator was assessed on his income from the mine \" as provided in Part I.\" The tax on the income or output was in substitution for taxes on the land and for taxes on personal property used in working the mine, but no longer in substitution for taxes on income from the mine. Reading together Parts I and V, we find a tax imposed generally on income from all sources, with special provisions as to the part of the income which is derived from a mine. The import of the words \"as provided in Part I,\" which are also found in subsection 3 of section 155, as re-enacted, appears to be that Part I governs the taxation of income generally, and Part V contains special provisions as to income derived from mines, with the obligation of the operator of the mine to pay either the tax on his income from the mine or the production tax, according as the one or the other is greater in amount.\nThis seems to me a more reasonable reading of these provisions than one which would see in the words \"as provided in Part I\" a mere reference to the machinery sections of Part I. It is a reference to the whole of Part I and not merely to certain of its provisions.\nIt would follow that Part I determines what persons shall pay tax on income, comprising income from mines, and a non-resident would of course be subject, as before, to the production tax, for he would not be assessable generally on his income from whatever source it might be derived, and the production tax would necessarily be the greater in amount.\nThis construction harmonizes Parts I and V, for it would be extraordinary to say the least that a non-resident, exempt generally under section 4, until its amendment in 1919, from taxes on his income, should nevertheless be assessed retroactively on the part of his income which, in the years in question, he had derived from a mine. And the amendment of section 4 in 1919, which is not retrospective, subjects him to pay income tax on income earned by him within the province, which of course would include income from mines, and this would give full play, but only for the future, to the special provisions of the new section 155.\nWere there any doubt as to this construction of the Act, I confess that I would give the preference to a construction which prevents the entirely unjust result which the Crown seeks to obtain in this case.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout and annul the assessment.\nMALOUIN J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed and the assessment annulled for the reasons given by Mr Justice Duff with which I concur.\nMACLEAN J.\u2014The facts have already been stated and I need not repeat them, or enlarge upon them.\nIt is admitted that by virtue of section 4, Part I, of c. 222, R.S.B.C., the appellant was not liable for income tax for the years 1915 and 1917, as the statute stood in these years and up to 1918. Neither was he liable in these years for taxation upon any income derived by him from the mine by virtue of section 155, Part V of the same statute, although the mine itself was subject to an output tax, that is a tax based upon the assessed value of ores recovered from the mine. By sec. 25, c. 89 of the Statutes of 1918, sec. 155 above referred to was repealed and a new section substituted therefor. This substituted section provided that every person owning or working a mine should be assessed and taxed on any income, derived from the mine, as provided in Part I, or upon the output of the mine under Part V, whichever tax should be the greater in amount. The same enactment made this income tax effective as and from Jan. 1,1917. By sec. 19, c. 89 of the Statutes of 1920, the enactment of the new sec. 155 was made to relate back so as to include incomes earned in 1915 and 1917, the years relevant to this appeal.\nOn behalf of the respondent it is claimed that the effect of the legislation enacted in 1918 and 1920 is to bring within the scope of sec. 155 as enacted by sec. 25, c. 89, Statutes of 1918, the income received from the mine by the appellant for the years 1915 and 1917. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia[6] so held. The appellant claims that this section has no application to income derived from a mine in British Columbia by a non-resident.\nSection 155 (1918) is to the effect that income derivable from a mine by any owner is assessable for income tax as provided in Part I. This means that the assessment shall in any event be made and the amount of the tax determined. If the amount of the tax or taxes so determined total more than the tax upon the output from the mine, two per cent of the assessed value of the ore recovered, then the latter shall be applied as payment upon the former. If the income tax is less than the output tax, then the former though assessed is not payable. Under Part I, this income is already taxable as to residents, and it is a little difficult to understand whether or not it was intended that this particular income was subject to further taxation in the contingency mentioned in sec. 155 (1918). However the assessment is clearly to be made under the provisions of Part I, which in explicit terms exempts non-residents from income tax. If the legislature intended to abrogate this specific exempting provision in so far as income from mines was concerned, we should find it expressed in certain and unambiguous language, especially in a statute imposing a tax. As re-enacted, sec. 155 does not reveal any clearly expressed intention of repealing partially sec. 4, Part I, so as to make liable non-residents from taxation upon income received from mines in British Columbia. I think it should be read therefore subject to the last-mentioned provision. I do not think this exemption in favour of non-residents, qualifying as it does the general enactment, can be disregarded in any degree, without legislation clearly disclosing the fact that the legislature so intended, and this has not been done. I think therefore that sec. 4 Part I is fully operative in favour of the appellant. Holding the view I do upon this point it is unnecessary to discuss other points raised by the appellant.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hamilton & Wragge.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Nisbet & Graham.\n[1] [1923] 3 W.W.R. 865.\n[2] [1923] 3 W.W.R. 865.\n[3] [1923] 3 W.W.R. 865.\n[4] [1886] 31 Ch.D. 402 at p. 409.\n[5] [1923] W.W.R. 865.\n[6] [1923] 3 W.W.R. 865.\n",

(1909) sections 6929, 6930, 6931, 6932, 6933.\nWhen a fire insurance company incorporated under a Quebec charter is placed in liquidation, the administration of the company's deposit made under the Quebec Insurance Act with the provincial treasurer for the guarantee of its insured is governed by sections 6930 and 6931 and not by sections 6932 and 6933 R.S.Q. Idington J. dissenting. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's petition.\nThe Strathcona Fire Insurance Company was incorporated by the legislature of the province of Quebec. To comply with the provisions of the Quebec Fire Insurance Act, it lodged with the provincial treasurer a deposit made in debentures of a nominal value of $59,000 to guarantee its insured upon insurance contracts having for object some property in the province (sections 6923 to 6929 R.S.Q. (1909) ). Later on, the company went into liquidation under the Dominion Winding-Up Act and the appellants were appointed joint liquidators. They presented the present petition to the Superior Court, asking that the provincial treasurer, one of the respondents, be ordered to hand this deposit to them for its administration, upon the ground that sections 6930 and 6931 R.S.Q. were applicable to a company in liquidation and that their provisions were not restricted to a company still doing business. The respondents contested the petition, alleging that the provincial treasurer should continue to have the custody and administration of the deposit until all the formalities prescribed by sections 6932 and 6933 R.S.Q. be completed.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and Paul Lacoste K.C. for the appellants.\nA. Perrault K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The Strathcona Fire Insurance Company was incorporated by the Quebec legislature, by 8 Edward VII (1908), c. 122, which Act brought it under the Quebec Insurance Act so far as the provisions of the said Act of incorporation were not inconsistent with said general Act. Before doing any business in Quebec it was required to obtain a license from Quebec and by section X, articles 98 et seq of said Quebec Insurance Act it was bound to make with the Provincial Treasurer a deposit or deposits to meet the claims of Quebec insurers on certain classes of property in Quebec and not beyond.\nThe said company became insolvent about two years ago when it was put in liquidation under the Dominion Winding-up Act, and the respondents were appointed thereunder its liquidators.\nThe said liquidators petitioned to have the respondent, the Treasurer of Quebec, directed to hand over to them the deposits so made with him and amounting to the sum of about $59,000.\nThe said respondent insisted, as I understand and think he was entitled to do, before complying with such a wide demand, that due notice should be given as required by the Act so that the limited number of those creditors entitled to share therein should be thus ascertained and the respective amounts of such claims be duly verified.\nThere should never have been any hesitation about duly recognizing such right, for the Treasurer is a trustee subject to certain limitations and obligations.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the company having become insolvent the Dominion Act supersedes the provisions of the Provincial Act for winding up the company.\nAnd, if I am at liberty to draw inferences from the course of the litigation persisted in relative to the recovery of said fund from the Treasurer, he was well advised in awaiting and insisting upon a more reasonable claim being made before he complied.\nThese moneys are clearly applicable to meeting the claims of the special class of the insured they were designed to protect and that free from any liability to bear any part of the general expenses of liquidation.\nThe only question I have any serious doubt about is what course should be pursued.\nThe Winding-Up Act does not provide for such a case as this. And the provision of the Quebec Act seems to point to a separate liquidation of the fund regardless of the Winding-Up Act which supersedes that, subject to the rights of the respondent to see his cestui que trust protected.\nI agree with the suggestions made by Mr. Justice Guerin at the end of his notes.\nWe are not in a position in this case to give any specific directions.\nWhen appellants have complied with what it was to my mind their clear duty to have done by a delivery of the claims made by those alone entitled to share in the fund in question, then, by a little common sense, harmoniously applied to a particular situation, I have no doubt the difficulties existent can be overcome.\nMeantime I agree with the unanimous conclusion reached below and am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs, none of which should be chargeable by appellant against those entitled to share in said fund.\nThe judgment of Duff, Mignault, Malouin and Maclean JJ. was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014The appellants are the liquidators of the Strathcona Fire Insurance Company, an insurance company incorporated under a Quebec charter, which was placed in liquidation under a winding-up order made on the 24th of April, 1922. The winding-up is under the provisions of the Dominion Winding-Up Act, R.S.C., c. 144.\nThe appellants petitioned the Superior Court for the administration of the company's deposit in the Quebec Treasury Department, the Provincial Treasurer and the Quebec Inspector of Insurance being made respondents.\nOne of the main questions discussed was which set of provisions of the Quebec Insurance Act applies. We are clearly of opinion that the case is governed by articles 6930 and 6931, and not by articles 6932 and 6933 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec.\nWe think, however, that the last paragraph of article 6931, providing for the appointment of a provincial liquidator in the case of a company incorporated by the province, is inoperative where the liquidation takes place under the Dominion Winding-Up Act. There obviously cannot be two separate liquidations of the same company and the liquidation under the Dominion statute, which is anterior in time, excludes any other.\nThe appellants, as representing in some respects the company and in some other respects the creditors and the contributories, appear to us to have a status to invoke the action of the court under article 6930. It should be observed, however, that this can only be done with the approval of the Superior Court (sections 33 and 34 Winding-Up Act), and that court has full control of the proceedings. It is clear that the deposit should be made available for the policyholders thereunto entitled although the liquidation is proceeding under the Dominion Winding-Up Act. In view of the long delay which has elapsed since the winding-up order, we venture to suggest to the parties that they should cordially co-operate to the end that the liquidation of this company and the administration of the deposit may be speedily completed.\nThe learned judge of first instance treated the petition as one presented by the appellants in their personal and not in their official capacity as liquidators; and at least one of the learned judges in the Court of King's Bench (Guerin, J.) makes it plain that he would not have approved of the proceedings. Further, the liquidators do not appear to have obtained the approval of the court under section 34 of the Winding-Up Act. In view of all the circumstances, we will not ourselves make an order for the administration of the deposit, but we will remit the case to the Superior Court so that, with its approval and subject to its direction, the deposit may be administered for the benefit of the policyholders who are entitled to it. We express no opinion as to the person who should be appointed administrator.\nThere will be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kavanagh, Lajoie & Lacoste.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Perrault & Raymond.\n",

(1911) c. 217, ss. 21, 23, 24, 29, 31, 34, 40, 49. Although executors, when applying for ancillary letters patent in British 1924 Columbia, had placed a value on the estate in the province for the purpose of succession duty and, such valuation being accepted by the Crown, had given a bond to secure payment of the duty, they are not bound by such valuation and its acceptance by the Crown; but they have still the right afterwards to present a petition under section 43 of the Succession Duty Act to a judge of the Supreme Court of the province who has jurisdiction to determine what property of the estate is liable to duty and the amount due thereof.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1924] 1 W.W.R. 161) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Morrison J., and dismissing the appellants' petition under section 43 of the Succession Duty Act.\nThe appellants are the executors of one Edward Grunder who had in British Columbia a claim against E. F. Voigt and M. S. Voigt for money lent. In order to institute proceedings against the debtors, who were apparently insolvent, the appellants were obliged to obtain letters of ancillary probate of Grunder's will and to secure this probate some arrangement had to be made as to the succession duties. A long correspondence ensued between the solicitors of the appellants and different departments of the provincial government to whom it was represented that the Voigt claim, the only asset of the deceased in British Columbia, was of very doubtful value. Finally the appellants obtained ancillary letters of probate on filing an affidavit of value under section 21 of the Act, placing the value of the Voigt claim at $16,000 and also a bond, under sections 23 and 24, for the due payment to the Crown of any duty to which the property coming to the hands of the appellants might be found liable. The Voigt claim later on proved to be worthless, as a return of nulla bona was made on an execution against them. The appellants then presented a petition under section 43 of the Succession Duty Act addressed to a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, setting forth all the facts of the case and asking for an order that no succession duties had become payable by them on the estate of the deceased.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nDonaghy for the respondent. IDINGTON J.\u2014The late Edward H. Grunder, domiciled at the time of his death (which took place on or about the 20th day of April, 1920) in the state of Pennsylvania, appointed the appellants herein executors of his last will and testment of which they obtained probate in said state.\nIn the 1915 and 1916 he had joined one Beck, also a resident of Pennsylvania, in lending $5,000 and $14,000 to Emil F. Voigt and Mary Agnes Voigt of the province of British Columbia, and to secure re-payment thereof and interest obtained a lien on some mining claims in that province.\nIn the course of doing so the appellants found it very difficult to satisfy the authorities there, for a long time, as to the nature of the security to be given under the Succession Duties Act.\nThe solicitors acting for said appellants found that it was very doubtful if anything could be realized out of either of the Voigts, or the security given on said mining claims, especially as Emil F. Voigt pretended to have a counterclaim against the testator.\nAll these features of the said indebtedness and alleged security were presented to the officers of the respondent in turn, but without anything satisfactory resulting until Mr. Mayers of the said solicitors' firm wrote the Prime Minister of British Columbia a long letter on the 29th August, 1921, on the subject in which he set forth the facts relative to said indebtedness, as follows:\u2014\nsome years ago, an American citizen called E. H. Grunder, living at Warren in the state of Pennsylvania, lent to a citizen of this province, one E. F. Voigt, the sum of fourteen thousand dollars odd and took from him as security a charge on some thirteen mineral claims. Mr. Grunder has now died and his executors wish to try and recover for his beneficiaries some of the money lent to Mr. Voigt .Mr. Voigt refuses to pay, asserting that he has a counter-elaim exceeding the amount of the loan for moneys expended by him for the use of Mr. Grunder, and it has become necessary to commence an action on behalf of the executors with a view to enforcing the claim of the deceased. You will see, therefore, that there are three matters which have to be determined before it can be ascertained whether the executors will obtain any money at all: in the first place, they must succeed in procuring a judgment in their favour; secondly, they must be able to execute that judgment, either upon Voigt personally, or out of the mineral claims which were given as security. It is not at all certain that the executors will succeed at the trial; it is quite certain\u2014so far as my information goes\u2014that Voigt has no money and is execution-proof, and I do not know at all whether the mineral claims can be sold, although I think it very doubtful.\nIn order to prosecute the action, it is necessary for the executors to take out probate in this province, and it is with regard to the succession duties and probate duties that I am writing to you.\nAs it is impossible now to tell whether the executors will recover any money for the estate at all, it seemed to me and it seems to me that the only reasonable course to pursue with regard to the succession duties and the probate duties is to give a bond to the Crown for the payment of the succession duties upon so much as may eventually be recovered for the estate of the deceased.\nThat was followed by the story he had to relate as to treatment he had met with.\nThat letter the Prime Minister replied to promptly; and in courteous terms, expressing surprise and informing Mr. Mayers that he was taking the matter up with the Minister of Finance, which resulted in a letter being sent by an official in the Treasury Department as follows:\u2014\nVictoria.14th September, 1921.\nMessrs Taylor, Mayers & Co.,\nBarristers, etc.,\n470 Granville St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sirs,\u2014In re Estate E. H. Grunder, Deceased, 499\/21. With reference to your request for a bond to secure probate and succession duties herein, I am to-day in receipt of a memorandum from the Honourable the Minister of Finance, which reads as follows :\n\"In view of the fact that the question of value of the British Columbia property is a question for the court, it might be well for the department to accept a bond payable in twelve months for succession duty in this estate, but the probate duty must be paid in cash.\"\nYours very truly,\nA. C. CAMPBELL.\nThat was followed by the giving of a bond by the appellants and the Canadian Surety Company professing to secure $16,000.\nThe condition of that bond was as follows:\u2014\nThe condition of this obligation is such that if the above named Sidney D. Blackman of Warren, in the state of Pennsylvania, and Hyett Grunder, of the township of Pleasant, in Warren county, in the said state of Pennsylvania, executors of all the property of Edward H. Grunder, late of the township of Pleasant, in the county of Warren aforesaid, deceased, who died on or about the 20th day of April, 1920, do well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the Minister of Finance of the province of British Columbia for the time being, representing His Majesty the King in that behalf, any and all duty to which the property, estate and effects of the said Edward H. Grunder coming into the hands of the said Sidney D. Blackman and Hyatt Grunder may be found liable under the provisions of the \" Succession Duties Act,\" within two years from the date of the death of the said Edward H. Grunder, or such further time' as may be given for payment thereof, under the provisions of the said Act, or such further time as they may be entitled to otherwise by law for payment thereof, then this obligation shall be void and of no effect, otherwise the same to remain in full force and virtue.\nOn receipt of that bond Mr. Campbell wrote the registrar that it had been received and was on file approved by the Minister of Finance and that it would therefore be in order for him to issue consent to letters probate and they were issued accordingly. The appellants proceeded with the action against the Voigts and got judgment but could realize nothing on it.\nThe execution was returned nulla bona. Attempts were made by the executors to sell the mining claims but they were equally fruitless and the lands so held as security were sold for taxes.\nThe appellants then presented a petition addressed to the Honourable the Chief Justice and the Justices of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, setting forth everything, apparently, that had transpired relative to the death of the testator, and his having made said will and named said appellants as executors, and who got anything thereunder, and of what the entire estate consisted, and a most complete history including the correspondence relative to the getting of ancillary letters of probate and the results flowing therefrom, of which my unusually lengthy quotations are but a mere trifling fraction, and all verified by the affidavit of the managing clerk in charge of the entire business in question.\nThat petition was heard by Mr. Justice Morrison and counsel for the respondent appeared in answer thereto, as well as in support of the petition, on the 16th of February, 1923, and on the 9th of March following he gave his judgment reciting the facts of the hearing and affidavits filed before him, and counsel having appeared and the postponement for judgment ends by declaring that no duties have become payable from the petitioners under the above-mentioned Act, meaning, as the style of cause shows, the Succession Duties Act.\nFrom that judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. That court, consisting of five justices, by a bare majority thereof, allowed the appeal and set aside the said judgment of Mr. Justice Morrison.\nThe learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galliher each wrote reasons in support of said judgment so appealed against. Mr. Justice Eberts gave no reasons.\nMr. Justice Martin and Mr. Justice McPhillips each gave written reasons for their dissenting judgments. Each of them took the ground that under section 43 of the Succession Duties Act the judge hearing such a petition was a persona designata and hence no appeal would lie therefrom.\nThere is much to be said in favour of such a view\u2014but, for reasons I am about to assign, that view is not the only one to rest upon in reversing the said appellate judgment.\nSaid section 43 reads as follows:\u2014\nSection 43: A judge of the Supreme Court shall also have jurisdiction, upon motion or petition, to determine what property is liable to duty under this Act, the amount thereof, and the time or times when the same is payable, and may himself or through any reference exercise any of the powers which by sections 29 to 31, both inclusive, of this Act are conferred upon any officer or person.\nThe learned Chief Justice, I most respectfully submit, erred on the basic facts herein in assuming that the amount of duty had been agreed upon.\nHe seems to have overlooked the facts I have set forth above ending in the giving of the bond conditioned expressly to cover the case of a non-agreement, and render the question subject to the result of future developments.\nI fear he was misled by the ground taken in the notice of appeal which states the facts incorrectly, I submit.\nHe also, I respectfully submit, drew an erroneous inference from what was said by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in dealing with the case of the United States Fidelity & Guarantee Co. v. The King[2], where the expression used was:\u2014\nThe powers of s. 43 were not invoked at any material time, if a resort to them was at any time open, as of right, to Quagliotti or the appellants.\nThis, I infer, had arisen in course of the argument before said court by reason of my own reference to section 43 when that case was before us and then, by reason of this court being equally divided, the said company's appeal to this court was dismissed.\nI could not, on the remarkable facts of that case, overlook the omission of Quagliotti failing, for years, to invoke this section if, as pretended, a clear mistake had been made.\nThe view taken by myself and two others of this court, hearing that appeal, was ultimately upheld by the court above.\nThe result of the consideration I then gave to the Succession Duties Act appears in the report of that case[3].\nI certainly came to the conclusion therein that .there were several means given the Crown to protect itself, even after the amount determined by the officers charged with the duties of fixing the amounts, to be considered and finally getting a bond therefor, before issuing the letters of administration or grant of probate. Surely that determination was never based on an agreement to be taken as final.\nI then thought and still think, that there was, despite the assent of the Crown by its officers and the parties applying, nothing to be inferred therefrom as a final binding agreement, but prima facie an amount fixed unless and until the Crown found otherwise and resorted to the means given it to alter such amount, or the representatives of the estate found they had been mistaken and resorted to this section 43, which seems to me enacted for no other purpose. I certainly can find no other use for it.\nAnd clearly on the facts of this case there is ample reason shown of the necessity for such a provision.\nAnd I am at a loss to understand why the respondent representatives persist in refusing the relief.\nI submit that the due sense of right demands it, especially in the case of foreigners far removed from the seat of the facts to be decided.\nCounsel for respondent was confronted before us with the question of whether or not he would, if this court held appellants entitled under said sec. 43 to a hearing under it, desire the opportunity of having it sent back to present further evidence. He promptly declined, in such event of our so holding the chance of further inquiry. As to the question of persona designata, I may point out that the learned judge is given the power to appoint a referee, but no right of appeal is given as is given expressly by section 33 relative to another like inquiry provided by preceding sections.\nI submit that there are several other features of the Act, as well as this instance I cite, which are in .conflict, I most respectfully submit, with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Galliher, that reading the whole Act it appears that the legislature could not have so intended.\nI am afraid the Act was not all drafted by the same hand but amendments were made from time to time as the subject matter of succession duties developed and thus the Act grew by chance.\nI am, from my point of view, not much concerned in maintaining the proposition, and make these remarks to indicate that if, as Mr. Justice Galliher infers, it was never the intention of the legislature, it, perhaps, should make its meaning clear.\nI, for the several foregoing reasons, am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal below, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Morrison be restored.\nDUFF J:\u2014The principal question raised by this appeal is one of not a little difficulty. The crucial point seems to be this: Is the procedure provided under sections 21 to 33 the exclusive procedure for determining the value of property for the purpose of calculating the amount of succession duty payable under the Act by the legal personal representatives before or after grant of probate or letters of administration? Normally, the duty payable is to be determined and paid before any such grant takes place. And even where the registrar is authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to accept a bond in lieu of present payment of duties presently due, the statute contemplates a determination of the amount of the duty, at least provisionally. This amount is ascertained in all cases by the Deputy Minister of Finance upon the basis of the facts disclosed by the affidavits of value and relationship, and a statement of this amount accompanies the consent to the issue of probate or letters of administration which is necessary before the probate or the letters of administration are issued by the registrar.\nHow is this provisional ascertainment to be reviewed? In what circumstances does it become final and conclusive? Disputes may obviously arise, either as to the inventory of property or the value ascribed to the property inventoried in the affidavits; and then, given the amount and value of the property, as to the scale upon which duty is to be calculated. Facts touching relationship and questions of law might quite conceivably come into controversy. Sections 29 et seq. provide a procedure by which the Minister, if dissatisfied with the inventory or with the estimate of value in the affidavits, may have the points in controversy referred to a commissioner, from whose decision there is a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. Proceedings under section 29 cannot be initiated by the representatives of the estate. They are entitled to be heard, however, on the inquiry before the commissioner, and I see nothing in the Act that makes either the inventory or the estimate of value in the affidavits binding upon them or binding upon the commissioner. I am by no means satisfied that on such an inquiry it would not be open to the representatives of the estate to say that property had been included by mistake which did not belong to the estate, or that the valuations were excessive; and if that is so, it must be equally open to the representatives of the estate to appeal from the decision of the commissioner on any such contention advanced by them before him. But if this procedure is not set in motion by the Minister, what is the position? Some means must be available to the representatives of the estate for questioning the determination of the Deputy Minister of Finance as to the amount of the duty. Assuming, for the moment, the estate to be bound as to the enumeration of parcels and as to the values given in the affidavits, there still remains the possibility of dispute as to the sum which, on the given facts, the Crown is entitled to be paid in respect of duty. If a dispute arises, there must be some method by which the estate can invoke the jurisdiction of the courts. Section 44 makes it quite clear that the right to bring an action exists. Is there also a right of petition under section 43? After a good deal of fluctuation of opinion, I have reached the conclusion expressed by Mr. Justice Maclean in his judgment, which I have had an opportunity of considering; after, I may add, giving full weight to the contentions advanced by Mr. Donaghy in his able argument. There is nothing in the earlier provisions expressly excluding such a right. It appears to be quite clear that the Crown, instead of resorting to the procedure under sections 29 et seq., might bring an action; and the terms of section 43 seem to imply that resort might be had to that section as well. That section obviously confers jurisdiction to deal with questions of inventory and valuation. The more reasonable view would appear to be that in such circumstances proceedings under sees. 43 and 44 are likewise open to the representatives of the estate. On the whole, I think the better view is that there are alternative methods of procedure: reference to a commission; action; summary application under section 43. A decision in course of any one of such proceedings would, of course, be conclusive.\nThe learned judge of first instance had, therefore, jurisdiction under section 43. As to the substance of his decision, I can find no evidence of any agreement precluding the appellants from setting up the real facts ; nor have I any doubt that facts were adduced establishing a prima facie case that the debt and the security were both valueless at the time of the testator's death. This prima facie case was unanswered, and was therefore a sufficient basis for the judgment.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Morrison restored. The appellants are entitled to their costs throughout.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Questions as to the construction and effect of the British Columbia Succession Duty Act, chapter 217, R.S.B.C., 1911, have been of not infrequent occurrence, and at least two cases, before this one, have reached this court and eventually the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The problem which the present litigation presents is a rather difficult one. Edward Grander, the deceased, was a citizen of the state of Pennsylvania and resided there at the time of his death. He had in British Columbia a claim against Emil F. Voigt and Mary S. Voigt, to whom, a few years before his death, he had, jointly with one Edward Beck, lent $14,000 and $5,000, taking as security several mineral claims in British Columbia. This claim was disputed by the Voigts, and if it had any value whatever it could only be the value of the mineral claims. But it was very problematical whether anything could be realized out of this security, and eventually it proved to be worthless and the mineral claims were sold for unpaid taxes. The Voigts had no property, and a return of nulla bona was made on an execution against them.\nAfter Grunder's death, the latter's executors, the appellants herein, instituted proceedings in the British Columbia courts against the Voigts who resisted payment. They could go on with their suit only by obtaining letters of ancillary probate of Grunder's will, and to secure this probate some arrangement had to be made as to succession duties. A long correspondence ensued between the solicitors of the appellants and different departments of the provincial government, and it was represented that this, the only asset of the deceased in British Columbia, was of very doubtful value, but in order to carry on the suit and attempt to realize something out of the security it was necessary to obtain probate of the will. Finally the appellants obtained ancillary letters of probate on filing an affidavit of value and relationship under section 21 of the Act, placing the value of the Voigt claim at $16,000, and also a bond, under sections 23 and 24, for $16,000 (by virtue of section 24, the bond should have been only for $1,600, ten per vent of the valuation) for the due payment to His Majesty of any duty to which the property coming to the hands of the appellant might be found liable. I think it was well understood at the time that, although the Voigt claim was valued at $16,000, efforts to collect it might prove unsuccessful, and that it might be ascertained, as in fact it was, that it was worthless.\nThe Act, as I read it, does not make the affidavit of value and relationship and the accompanying inventories conclusive as to the amount or value of the estate. Certainly it is not binding on the Government, which can appoint a commissioner to enquire into and report as to the property:: subject to duty and its value (sec. \"29). There is an appeal to the Court of Appeal from the report of the Commissioner, which is open to \" any person dissatisfied with the report\" (sec. 23), but I cannot find anything in the Act making in terms the commissioner's report conclusive as to any interested party.\nWe next find a provision (sect. 34) giving authority to a judge of the Supreme Court to issue, on the application of the Minister of Finance, a summons directing the executor, administrator, heir or devisee of the property liable for duty to appear and show cause why the duty should not be paid forthwith or on a day to be fixed by the judge. This presupposes that the amount of the duty has been determined, for the section does not direct the judge to ascertain its quantum. There is a somewhat similar provision in section 40, empowering a judge to summon \" on the application of any person interested\" the persons interested in the property subject to the duty to appear before the court and show cause why the duty should not be paid.\nAll the sections above referred to are grouped under the caption \" Procedure to enforce payment of duty.\" Sections 42 and following are preceded by the title \" Additional remedies,\" and among them is section 43 under which Mr. Justice Morrison made the order which the Court of Appeal, on appeal by the Government, set aside. This section reads as follows:\u2014\n43. A judge of the Supreme Court shall also have jurisdiction, upon motion or petition, to determine what property is liable to duty under this Act, the amount thereof, and the time or times when the same is payable, and may himself or through any reference exercise any of the powers which by sections 29 to 31, both inclusive, of this Act are conferred upon any officer or person.\nThe reference to sections 29 to 31 is to the provisions of the Act concerning the appointment of a commissioner. It is not very clear whether it is meant, by this reference, that the judge may appoint a commissioner, as the Government only can do under section 29, or that he may exercise the powers which would be exercisable by the commissioner when appointed by the Government. But it would seem to me that, notwithstanding what i occurred in this case, the learned judge, upon a motion or petition of these appellants, had jurisdiction to determine what property of the Grunder estate was liable to duty under the Act, and the amount thereof. The learned judge, in his formal judgment, there are no reasons for judgment, declared\nthat no duties have become payable from the petitioners under the above-mentioned Act.\nI think the learned judge had jurisdiction to make this declaration which could only be based upon the fact, which is established, that no property in British Columbia had come to the hands of the appellants.\nThe point relied on by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal was that these appellants were bound by their valuation and its acceptance by the Government, and that it was thus conclusively established that property of the value of $16,000 had come to the hands of the appellants. As I have said, there is nothing in the Act declaring that the affidavit of value and relationship and the inventories are conclusive against those filing them. It may be urged that they are an admission by the representatives of the estate of the property and its value which has come to the hands of these representatives, but does that mean that in case of a demonstrated mistake in making this admission, or of sufficient evidence that a claim such as the one in question was really valueless at. the time of the death of the deceased, the representatives of the estate are nevertheless precluded by their affidavit from alleging and proving the contrary? I would greatly hesitate before answering this question in the affirmative. I think, taking the affidavit with the bond which accompanies it, the governing condition is that the estate will pay to His Majesty\nany duty to which the property coming to the hands of the said applicant or applicants may be found liable (sect. 24).\nThis leaves for subsequent determination, a determination such as made in this case, the question of what property came to the hands of the applicant for probate. And section 43 empowers the judge to determine what property is liable to duty under the Act and the amount thereof. Under all the circumstances I am of opinion that there was no agreement between the appellants and the Government to the effect that this claim was worth $16,000, or any amount. And I also think that it was open to the learned judge under section 43 to determine that no duties were payable by the appellants under the Act.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and in the court below and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Morrison.\nMALOTJIN J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Idmgton, with which I concur, I would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge, with costs.\nMACLEAN J.\u2014Edward H. Grunder, a citizen of the United States, died in 1920, and in his will named the appellants as his executors. In his lifetime Grunder, together with one Beck, loaned to one Voigt and his wife, residents of British Columbia, sums of money aggregating $19,000. The executors brought action against Voigt and his wife for the recovery of the said sum of $19,000 and, alternatively to foreclose the interest of the Voigts in certain mineral claims in British Columbia charged with the repayment of this sum of money. In order that the executors might prove their title on the trial, it was necessary that they obtain probate in British Columbia of the last will and testament of the deceased Grunder. The Succession Act requires payment of succession duties or security therefor before letters probate may issue. Thereupon the appellants' solicitor obtained leave to file a bond in lieu of payment of duties, and as required they filed the statutory affidavit and inventory, in which they described the asset in question as a claim against Voigt and his wife secured by an interest in fourteen mineral claims in the Similkameen District of the amount of $16,000.\nThe appellants ultimately recovered judgment against the Voigts, but a writ of execution issued against the goods and chattels of the judgment debtor was returned nulla bona. The mineral areas charged by the Voigts to secure payment of the loan proved valueless and were sold for non payment of taxes, and the appellants were still unable to realize upon the judgment. The appellants then proceeded by petition under s. 43 of the Succession Duty Act, praying for a declaration that no estate of the deceased in British Columbia came into the hands of the appellants and that no duties had become payable. After the hearing of the petition, an order was granted by Morrison, J. that no duties had become payable by the petitioners under the Succession Duty Act. On appeal to the Court of Appeal this order was set aside, and the present appeal is from the decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.\nConsiderable correspondance was carried on between the appellants' solicitor and the respondent prior to the issue of the letters probate and the giving of the bond which perhaps should be referred to here. The first letter was addressed to the Deputy Attorney General, and it was pointed out that one Edward H. Grunder, living in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. had died, and that his executors wished to sue for the recovery of money loaned to a man named D. F. Voigt and his wife upon the security of some mineral claims in British Columbia. In this letter it was pointed out that the ultimate value of the security when foreclosed or sold was uncertain, and in the meanwhile the solicitor asked for leave to file a bond in lieu of the succession duties and also the probate duties. In another letter addressed to the Minister of Finance the appellants' solicitor wrote as follows:\nNow it is quite doubtful whether Voigt has any money and equally doubtful whether the mineral claims have any value and it is therefore very difficult to fix any sum which should be paid for succession duties or probate duties.\nThis letter then proceeds to point out the probable difficulties in the executors recovering judgment, and that the future alone would determine whether they could realize anything out of Voigt's for the mineral claims. At a later date a departmental official wrote the solicitor, that, the Treasury did not wish through a bond to extort payment of duties from assets which possibly did not exist, but the solicitor encountered delays in obtaining a final acceptance of the bond for succession duties.\nHe thereupon took up correspondence with the Prime Minister of British Columbia and in his letter of August 21st, 1921, wrote as follows: As it is impossible now to tell whether the executors will recover any money for the estate at all, it seems to me that the only reasonable course to pursue with regard to the succession duties and the probate duties, is to give a bond to the Crown for the payment of succession duties, upon such money as may eventually be recovered of the estate of the deceased.\nTo this the Prime Minister replied deprecating the unnecessary volume of correspondence on such simple a matter and stated that the only question was whether the Minister of Finance had power to accept the bond in lieu of the payment of succession duties. The Minister of Finance then wrote an official of his department to accept a bond in respect of the succession duties. He said :\nIn view of the fact that the question of value of the British Columbia property is a question for the court, it might be well for the department to accept a bond payable in twelve months for succession duty in this estate.\nA bond was subsequently accepted. The condition of the obligation in the bond was to well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the Minister of Finance of the province of British Columbia, for the time being representing His Majesty the King on that behalf, \"any and all duty\" to which the property, estate and effects of the said Edward H. Grunder, coming into the hands of the said Sydney Blackman and Hyett Grunder \"may be found liable\" under the provisions of the Succession Duties Act, within two years from the date of the death of the said Edward H. Grunder or such further time as being given, etc.\nThe Succession Duty Act contains no provision giving authority to refund where any duty shall have been paid on account of any succession tax, if it is afterwards discovered that such duty was not due, or was paid by mistake, or paid in respect of property which the successor was unable to recover, or where for any other reasons, a refund ought to be made. There is no statutory power to compound the duty payable, upon any terms, where the succession is of such a nature, or so disposed, or circumstanced as not to be fairly ascertainable, nor in case of doubt or dispute as to the valuation is there any direct provision for agreement between the parties, although this of course is implied.\nIn these circumstances the appellants petitioned the court for the declaration referred to, and their contention on this appeal is that the judge in the premises had jurisdiction. Section 43 reads:\nA judge of the Supreme Court shall also have jurisdiction upon motion or petition to determine what property is liable to duty under this Act, the amount thereof and the time or times when the same is payable and may himself or through any reference exercise any of the powers which by sections 29 to 31, both inclusive, of this Act are conferred upon any officer or person.\nThe section is apparently wide enough in terms to cover the case, but the respondent claims it is not available to the appellants, and that the judge was without jurisdiction. If the section is not operative in these proceedings it must be because there was some previous decision binding upon the executors, or because there was an agreement between the parties which is conclusive.\nThere has been no binding decision because section 22 (1) is purely tentative, at least where a bond has been given. This section only authorizes the determining of the amount of succession duty for the purpose of making it possible to have letters of probate issue. The functions of the Deputy Minister of Finance are ministerial entirely, he simply makes a computation on the footing of the affidavit and inventory. The word \" .estimate \" would more appropriately express the latter document then \" inventory\" and in many succession acts that is the term used.\nThere is nothing in the Act which binds the Minister to accept as final, the assessment which the Deputy Minister of Finance made. The Minister only goes so far in the form of consent, form 5 of the Act, as to state that he considers, after a perusal of the affidavits, that there is a property subject to succession duty. He stated in this consent, the amount of succession duty \" due,\" that is \" due \" for the purposes of the next subsection, which shows that the duty must be paid before the probate can be issued. If the Minister is not bound, then the executors should not be bound. The two subsections of section 22 must be read together, and I think it can be fairly said that the effect of them is to make the succession duty assessed by the Deputy Minister of Finance, only tentative.\nIt may be that the executor, having once paid the amount of this tentative assessment, could not obtain a refund, since the only provision for refund is in section 39, which authorizes a refund by the Minister when a refund has been made by legatees, etc. Possibly it did not occur to the draftsman of the statute that there might be a case where ? payment had actually been made by the executor, and ] where it subsequently turned out that there was no estate, and, therefore, no legacies had been paid and consequently there was no legatees from whom a refund could be asked. This state of affairs is apparently a casus omissus, although it might be held that, even in these circumstances, the executor would have the right outside the statute, to apply for refund by petition of right on the ground that the payment was only tentative.\nWhether this is so or not in the case where payment has actually been made, the circumstances are quite different when security is furnished and accepted. It would seem as if the idea might be that the executor in making an actual payment must be sure of his ground and not expect a refund, but that the executor who did not know how an estate would eventually turn out might protect himself by declining to pay and by giving a bond. This bond, it should be noted, is not for the amount which has been determined by the Deputy Minister of Finance, but is in the penal sum of ten per cent of the property subject to duty, and the condition is that the obligor will pay, not the amount determined by the Deputy Minister of Finance, but will pay the amount of duty to which the property coming into his hands may be found liable, under the provisions of the Succession Duty Act.\nIt was urged upon us that there was an agreement between the parties to pay the duty on the footing of an inventory filed. I must say I am unable to discover anything in this case supporting such a view, and I am at a loss to determine why the suggestion is put forward. Every step discloses that there was no agreement such as suggested. Possibly if the executor had paid duty upon the basis of the inventory filed, that would have constituted an agreement that the amount he paid was the amount for which the property was liable, but the agreement in this case is not left to be worked out by implication from the statute, or by a nebulous presumption arising from the equivocal act of the parties, but it is nominated in the bond, and this bond is in the words of section 23 of the statute and of the form of bond prescribed in the schedule. The bond, the only positive agreement in existence in this connection, is to the effect that the amount payable is the amount found to be due, and the correspondence referred to clearly shews that it was intended that the bond should express the accommodation reached between the parties.\nSection 43 is the only section which actually provides for a judicial determination of the amount of duty to which property is liable. It is significant that the word \" liable \" used in this section is only used in one other place, and that is in the provisions of section 23, which prescribes the form of the bond. Section 29 does authorize a judicial decision by a commissioner, but this is not as to the amount of duty for which the property is liable, but is only as to what property is subject to duty. Further than this, section 29 can only be invoked by the Minister as a sort of court of inquiry to test the correctness of the applicant's statement in the affidavit. The applicant cannot under this section take the initiative to avail himself of the good offices of the commissioner.\nIt would be an unthinkable proposition if the applicant as a preliminary to obtaining letters of probate was obliged to search the country over, to ascertain all the debts of the deceased, and in effect guarantee that the amount to be placed opposite the item \" debts \" at the foot of the inventory showed the precise amount of the deceased's liabilities. One of the primary objects of appointing executors or personal representatives is to have some person who may, by appropriate advertisement and other notice, discover in the course of time what the actual liabilities of the deceased are.\nThe effect of the respondent holding the executors liable for the amount of money which would be payable as succession duty on the basis of the necessarily tentative statement which he furnished as to debts would be to directly take from the executor the monies to which the province is not in any way entitled, because property subject to duty is as laid down in sec. 7 (et seq.) the net value of the property, and this net value is what the learned judge has determined upon this proceeding. The only other basis on which the province could possibly claim this money would be on the ground that the applicant having made this statement of assets and liabilities is now estopped from asserting that it was incorrect, but estoppel does not arise unless the person to whom the representation was made believes the representation and actually acts upon it to his detriment. There could be no suggestion here that the Crown which has taken the bond for the payment of the amount for which the property may be found liable has acted to its detriment. It must be remembered that at that time the Deputy Minister of Finance had actually determined the amount of the succession duty and therefore the use of the words \" may be found liable\" indicate clearly that it could not have been the amount which had then actually been determined, but that it was the amount which was to be the subject of some future finding or decision. The proper words to have used if the bond referred to the amount already determined by the Deputy Minister of Finance would have been \"has been found liable.\" As I have already said, sec. 43 contains the only procedure which is open to the applicant to initiate for the purpose of having the amount of this liability determined, and the use of the word \" liable \" in ss. 23 and 43 and also in the bond itself is peculiarly significant.\nIt was pointed out by the respondent's counsel that a determination of the issues involved in the petition were not properly supported inasmuch as only affidavits were used. It was open to the judge, on the application of the respondent, to order the attendance for cross examination of any person making an affidavit.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

(1006) c. 37, s. 2, ss. 25, 34, s. 276; 9-10 Geo. V, c. 68, s. 310.\nA train, drawn by a locomotive with tender attached and moving reversely, so that the tender is foremost, is not a train \"not headed by an engine\" within the purview of section 310 of the Dominion Railway Act as enacted by 9-10 Geo. V, c. 68. Idington and Malouin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe respondent sued the appellant company claiming compensation in respect of the death of his two minor sons, who were struck down and killed on the company's track at a level crossing. The \"train\" of the company consisted of two locomotives, each with its tender attached, moving reversely, i.e., with the tenders leading. The negligence affirmed by the jury's verdict was the failure of the railway company to have a person on the leading tender to warn people about to cross the track of the approach of the train in conformity with section 310 of the Dominion Railway Act.\nTilley K.C. and Foran K.C. for the appellant.\nLaflamme K.C. and Lemieux K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant had a train consisting of a tender at its head and an engine next and a tender and engine behind them, running at a rate of at least ten miles an hour, and possibly fifteen miles or more an hour, across St. Florent street in the city of Hull, where there was a level crossing not adequately protected by gates or otherwise, and no person stationed on that tender heading the train, to warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross, the track at said level crossing.\nThat train struck, at said level crossing, a truck auto driven by one Bertrand (and on which two boys sons of the respondent were riding), when the said driver was attempting to cross the said railway track.\nThe said sons of the respondent were killed thereby and hence this action to recover damages.\nMany grounds therefor were taken by respondent, and amongst them that the appellant had not duly complied with the requirements of section 310, subsection (1) of the Railway Act of 1919, which reads as follows:\u2014\nSection 310 (1): Whenever in any city, town or village any train not headed by an engine is passing over or along a highway at rail level which is not adequately protected by gates or otherwise, the company shall station on that part of the train, which is then foremost, a person who shall warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track of such railway.\nThe jury found in favour of respondent but that Bertrand was also to blame, and hence assessed the damages the respondent was entitled to as against the appellant alone, at $1,500, being for one-half of the total he had suffered.\nAnd that verdict was rested upon the said subsection I have just quoted, in not having a man on the tender which was the head of the train.\nThe appellant appealed, from the learned judge's judgment entered pursuant to said verdict, to the King's Bench, on the appeal side, and that court, consisting of five judges, unanimously upheld said judgment.[2]\nThe language used in said subsection, quoted above, seems to me most clear and explicit, and to have been correctly applied by the learned judges in appeal, and also by the learned trial judge.\nThe statute clearly requires where the train is not headed by an engine that under such circumstances as found existent in this case, the company shall station on that part of the train which is then foremost a person who shall warn persons standing on or crossing or about to cross the track of such railway.\n\"A train\" is defined by subsection 34 of section 2 of said Railway Act, as follows:\nincludes any engine, locomotive or other rolling stock.\nAnd \"rolling stock\" is defined by subsection 25 of said section 2 of said Railway Act, as follows:\u2014\n(25) Rolling stock means and includes any locomotive, engine, motor car, tender, snow-plough, flanger, and every description of car or of railway equipment designed for movement on its wheels, over or upon the rails or tracks of the company;\nYet we are gravely asked by counsel for appellant in face of such express language and definitions to hold that a \"tender\" is only part of an engine although common knowledge, as well as this express language, tells us they are separate.\nAnd a remarkable feature of the contention is that the plain meaning of the words are to be given another meaning because some words used in an old Act, were dropped out, when such changes as made were obviously part of a revision of the entire legislation relative to railways, and intended to make clearer the law and improve it in many respects by eliminating useless verbiage.\nWhen parties are driven to such arguments and no better, it makes it rather hard, I most respectfully submit, to understand why leave to appeal was granted.\nThat evidently was given because of it being urged that the judgment would impose serious loss upon all railways in Canada.\nJust imagine a serious loss arising from being forced to carry the tender in its proper place instead of putting it in the reverse order of things!\nI prefer that interpretation of any statute which will tend to avoid the sacrifice of human life, even if some careless employee is put to a little trouble.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The sole question of substance on this appeal concerns the construction of sec. 310 of the Dominion Railway Act, 9-10 Geo. V, c. 68. The respondent sued the appellant company, claiming compensation under article 1056 of the Civil Code in respect to the death of his two minor sons, who were struck down and killed on the company's railway track at the crossing of St. Florent street, Hull, in August, 1922. The victims of the accident were crossing the track in an auto truck when a \"train,\" so-called, of the company ran into it. The \"train\" consisted of two locomotives, each with its tender attached, moving reversely, i.e., with the tenders leading. The negligence affirmed by the jury's verdict, which is the foundation of the respondent's judgment, was the failure of the company to have a person on the leading tender to warn people about to cross the track of the approach of the train.\nSection 310 is in these words:\u2014\nWhenever in any city, town or village, any train not headed by an engine is passing over or along a highway at rail level which is not adequately protected by gates or otherwise, the company shall station on that part of the train, which is then foremost, a person who shall warn passengers standing on, or crossing, or about to cross any track of such railway.\nBy subsection (2) of section 34 of the statute, \"train\" includes any engine, locomotive or any rolling stock. The word \"train\" is broad enough to comprehend in its ordinary meaning any series of vehicles attached together moving upon a railway track, and prima facie would apply to the two locomotives and tenders with which we are concerned. But the point in controversy turns upon the meaning to be ascribed to the word's \"engine\" and \"train\" in the context in which they are found in this section. Where the engine is moving reversely, so that the leading vehicle is the tender, can it be affirmed within the meaning of that section that the train \"is not headed by an engine,\" and that the tender is a vehicle falling within the description, \"that part of the train which is then foremost\"? The section obviously distinguishes between the engine and the \"train,\" i.e., between the engine and the other vehicles comprising the \"train.\" It does not in terms distinguish between the engine and the tender, and I am inclined to think that in this section, construed without extraneous aid, \"engine\" comprises both locomotive and tender, i.e., the locomotive and what ordinarily is an inseparable adjunct of the locomotive. We are, however, entitled, when confronted with a provision of that kind, which is capable of more than one necessarily exclusive construction, to examine the history of the legislation and to read the enactment to be interpreted by the light of that history.\nSection 310 of the present Railway Act was substituted for sec. 276, c. 37, R.S.C., 1906, which was in these words:\u2014\nWhenever in any city, town or village, any train is passing over or along a highway rail level, and is not headed by an engine moving forward in the ordinary manner, the company shall station on that part of the train, or of the tender, if that is in front, which is then foremost, a person who shall warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track of such railway.\nThe italicized phrases are those which have been omitted in the consolidation now in force. The omission of these phrases affords in my judgment conclusive evidence as to the intention of the legislator. The section as it stood in the Revised Statutes applied in all cases in which the engine leading the train was not\nmoving forward in the ordinary manner.\nThis qualification is struck out. \"Not headed by an engine,\" in the substituted section, is obviously intended to take effect according to its ordinary meaning, i.e., where the leading vehicle is not an engine or part of an engine. The omission of the second phrase indicates very clearly the absence of any intention to distinguish, in the substituted section, between the engine and the tender.\nThe point may, perhaps, be more clearly put in this way. It is quite obvious that in sec. 276 of c. 37 of the Revised Statutes, the distinction was drawn between the vehicles forming \"the train\" and the engine (i.e., the engine as composed of the locomotive and tender) leading the \"train.\" In that section the tender is treated as forming part of the engine, and not as part of the \"train\"; and the word \"engine\" is used as in itself including both locomotive and tender, or applying to any such combination, whether moving reversely or \"forward in the ordinary manner.\" These words are reproduced ipsissimis verbis in the consolidation. The inference seems plain that the intention was by the substituted section to give effect to these words of the existing section according to the construction they bore before the deletion of the italicized phrases.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The sole purpose of this appeal, for which special leave was granted by the Court of King's Bench on the terms that\nno costs would be asked against the respondent,\nis to determine whether a train drawn by a locomotive with tender attached and moving reversely, so that the tender is foremost, is or is not a train \"not headed by an engine\" within the purview of s. 310 of the Dominion Railway Act, 9 & 10 Geo. V, c. 68. I had occasion to consider this question in Grand Trunk Pacific Ry Co. v. Earl[3], and then reached the conclusion that under such circumstances, for the purposes of s. 310, the train should be regarded as headed by an engine.\nIn deference to the contrary view taken in the present case by the Court of King's Bench, I have carefully reconsidered the question in the light of the argument addressed to us. I retain the opinion which I held in Earl's Case (1).\nIn common parlance a locomotive with tender attached is spoken of as an engine. Parliament recognized that fact when it distinguished between the engine and its tender in the corresponding section of the former Railway Act, R.S.C., c. 37, s. 276. Such a case as that now before us would have fallen within the explicit terms of that provision, which applied whenever the train was \"not headed by an engine moving in the ordinary manner\" and prescribed that a person should be stationed on \"the tender if that is in front.\" Parliament has now removed from the section the italicized words. We must attribute to it the intention thereby to effectuate the change in the law which such an alteration in the language fairly imports. Probably because it was thought that the engineer and fireman on an engine at the head of a train (or running alone) would have sufficient means of observing persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross, the railway tracks, and would be able to give sufficient warning of the approaching train whether such engine was\nmoving forward in the ordinary manner\nor moving reversely, Parliament appears to have thought that the requirement that a special person be stationed on the foremost part of the train to give warning should be restricted to the case where the engine is preceded by cars. But, whatever the motive which actuated it, the change made in the legislation would seem to render it clear that the section no longer applies to the case of an engine (including its tender) moving reversely if it be travelling alone or be at the head of a train of cars. Neither of these is the case of a train \"not headed by an engine.\"\nOther derelictions of duty charged against the defendants were impliedly negatived by the jury's finding that their negligence consisted in \"not having man on back of tender.\" Andreas v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[4]. The learned trial judge had charged that this omission would be a breach of s. 310 and would entail liability. It was not suggested that a duty to have a man stationed on the back of the tender existed at common law.\nUnder these circumstances the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\nMignault J.\u2014The two children of the respondent were killed when a motor truck in which they were riding came in collision at a highway crossing in Hull, Que., with two engines of 'the appellant company coupled together and proceeding reversely, that is to say tender first. There were no cars, for the engines were backing in the direction of the Union railway station in Ottawa, where they were to take their trains. Several faults were charged against the appellant, but the only one found by the jury was\nfor not having man on back of tender,\nall other faults being thus negatived.\nThe learned trial judge read to the jury subsection 1 of section 310 of the Railway Act and then directed them as follows:\u2014\nNow, the whole question there is whether these two engines and tender constitute a train. The statutory enactment has been changed from time to time. \"Or of the tender if that is in front\"\u2014those words were used after the word \"train.\" They appear to have been omitted, but in looking at the interpretation clause of what a train means by the Act it includes any engine or any rolling stock by subsection 34 of section 2. I may be wrong in my interpretation of the law and if I am the Court of Appeal will set me right, but I am of opinion, and I so instruct you, that it was a statutory duty of the railway company to conform to the requirements of section 310, subsection 1.\nTaking the finding of the jury in connection with the instructions of the learned judge, it is clear that the fault found was failure to comply with section 310 in not stationing some one on the back of the tender to warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track of the railway. In Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. v. Earl[5], I expressed the opinion that section 310 does not apply to the case of a train headed by an engine moving tender first. Having given my best consideration to the judgments of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench as well as to the arguments of counsel, I see no reason to change my view.\nThe contention of the respondent is that these two engines moving reversely were a \"train\" within the meaning of the Railway Act, and the interpretation clause of the Act is relied on as so defining the word \"train.\" It is obvious however that the context of section 310 must be considered, for it requires the stationing of a look-out man only when the \"train\" is not headed by an engine. There is here a clear distinction between the train and the engine.\nThat this provision does not apply when the train is headed by an engine, although the engine is moving tender first, is shown by comparing section 276 of the former Railway Act (R.S.C., c. 37) with section 310 of the Railway Act of 1919 (9-10 Geo. V, c. 68). I will cite the two provisions in juxtaposition.\nR.S.C., c. 37, sec. 276:\u2014\nWhenever in any city, town or village, any train is passing over or along a highway at rail level, and is not headed by an engine moving forward in the ordinary manner, the company shall station on that part of the train, or of the tender if that is in front, which is then foremost, a person who shall warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track of such railway.\n9-10 Geo. V, c. 68, sec. 310, subsec. 1:\u2014\nWhenever in any city, town or village, any train not headed by an engine is passing over or along a highway at rail level which is not ade- quately protected by gates or otherwise, the company shall station on that part of the train, which is then foremost, a person who shall warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track of such railway.\nIt will be seen at a glance that in re-enacting this provision in 1919, Parliament struck out the words\nmoving forward in the ordinary manner (and) or of the tender if that is in front.\nIts obvious intention was to effect a change in the law as it stood under the old Act, and since the re-enactment it is only when a train not headed by an engine is moving over or along a highway not adequately protected by gates or otherwise, in a city, town or village, that a lookout man must be placed on that part of the train which is then foremost. Here the train, if it can be so called, was headed by an engine and section 310, subsection 1, does not apply.\nThere is no suggestion in this case that it was negligence at common law not to have placed a man on the tender to warn persons crossing the railway. The verdict must stand or fall on the statutory fault found by the jury, to wit, non-compliance with section 310. If the section did not apply, this statutory fault did not exist. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the action dismissed.\nAs to costs, the condition of the special leave to appeal obtained by the appellant from the Court of King's Bench, was that\non the appeal of appellant to the Supreme Court, no costs would be asked against the respondent.\nThe appellant's main interest was to obtain from this court pronouncement on a very important question of railway law, and for that reason its factum does not ask for costs against the respondent. Under these circumstances, I would grant no costs to the appellant either here or in the two courts below.\nMalouin J. (dissenting):\u2014La decision dans la pr\u00e9sente cause depend de l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'article 310 de la loi des chemins de fer du Canada, 9 & 10 Geo. V., c. 68, qui se lit comme suit:\n310 (1). Chaque fois que, dans une cit\u00e9, une ville ou un village, un train n'ayant pas en t\u00eate une locomotive traverse ou longe une voie publique \u00e0 niveau et qui n'est pas suffisamment prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par des barri\u00e8res ou autrement, la compagnie doit avoir sur la partie du train formant ainsi la t\u00eate du convoi, quelqu'un pour avertir les personnes qui se tiendraient sur la voie du chemin de fer, la traverseraient ou seraient sur le point de la traverser.\nLe juge qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s a dit dans son adresse au jury que la d\u00e9fenderesse, pour se conformer \u00e0 cet article de la loi, aurait d\u00fb placer en avant du train une vigie pour pr\u00e9venir de son approche les pi\u00e9tons qui traverseraient la voie, vu qu'il n'y avait pas en t\u00eate du train une locomotive.\nLe train qui a caus\u00e9 l'accident se composait de deux locomotives ayant en t\u00eate un tender.\nLa question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est celle de savoir si le tender fait partie de la locomotive ou s'il est un wagon distinct.\nLa loi d\u00e9signe le tender comme un wagon s\u00e9par\u00e9 et T\u00e9nu-m\u00e8re au nombre des voitures qui composent le \"rolling stock\". Les dictionnaires nous disent que c'est un wagon qui suit la locomotive et qui contient l'eau et le charbon. Il me para\u00eet donc certain que la locomotive et le tender sont deux choses distinctes.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a adopt\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re de voir du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et a confirm\u00e9 le jugement.\nL'appelante devant cette cour pr\u00e9tend que l'appellation locomotive dans l'article 310 du statut comprend la locomotive et le tender et que partant l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de placer une vigie en avant de son train.\nJe ne puis accepter cette mani\u00e8re de voir. Le statut d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que quand un train n'a pas en t\u00eate une locomotive, une vigie doit \u00eatre plac\u00e9e en avant du train pour traverser un chemin public afin d'avertir de son approche les personnes qui le traversent.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir voulu dire ce qu'il exprime et le juge ne peut chercher en dehors du texte de la loi son intention quand le texte est clair et ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucun doute.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

Belanger (Defendant)\nRespondent.\n1924: May 27, June 8.\nPresent:\u2014Idington, Duff, Anglin, Mignault and Malouin JJ\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nPromissory note\u2014Loan\u2014Both made simultaneously\u2014Prescription\u2014Action for less and cross-demand for more than 82,000\u2014Same judgment dealing with both\u2014Jurisdiction.\nThe appellant was creditor and the respondent debtor of an annuity of $300. In May, 1923, the appellant sued the respondent for $150 then due. The latter did not repudiate appellant's claim but pleaded that it was compensated by a loan of $3,000, represented by a promissory note, dated September, 1917; and the respondent also instituted a cross incidental demand for that amount. The appellant, in her answer, admitted the existence of the loan but added that the note was payable at her death only. The trial judge by the same judgment dismissed the appellant's action and maintained the incidental demand.\nHeld that a promissory note given in consideration of a loan of money, even though there be nothing commercial in the transaction, constitutes, if the note and the loan are made simultaneously and in absence of legal proof to the contrary, the contract between the parties, which is subject to the prescription of five years; and therefore the respondent had no existing claim against the appellant.\nHeld also that this court has authority to deal with the judgment in the principal action for an amount of $150 as ancillary to its authority to give effect to a judgment allowing the appeal from the same judgment maintaining the incidental demand.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, approving the judgment of the trial judge which dismissed the appellant's action and maintained the respondent's incidental demand.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nMaurice Rousseau K.C. for the appellant.\nLs.St. Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I agree with the reasons assigned by my brother Mignault J., and the conclusions reached thereby, and therefore that this appeal should be allowed, the claim of the appellant maintained and that of the respondent rejected, with costs throughout. DUFF J.\u2014I concur with the view expressed by my brothers Mignault and Malouin of the decision in Vachon v. Poulin[1], the effect of which appears to be that where a promissory note is given in consideration of a present loan of money, even though there be nothing commercial in the transaction in the relevant sense, then, in absence of legal proof to the contrary, the contract between the parties is that expressed in the promissory note; and that the prescription of five years applies.\nI have some difficulty in understanding how the first paragraph of the defence to the demande reconventionnelle can assist the respondent. If the existence of the promissory note is so inconsistent with the condition to which, according to the pleading, the collateral obligation was subject, as to require the rejection of the condition, I can discover nothing of substance in the way of legal proof in the residuum of the admission to establish the existence of a collateral obligation within the doctrine of Vachon v. Poulin. I also concur in the opinion of Mignault and Malouin, JJ., that authority to deal with the judgment in the principal action is ancillary to the authority to give full effect to a judgment allowing the appeal from the judgment on the incidental demand.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinions of my brothers Mignault and Malouin JJ. and I concur in their conclusions that the demande reconventionnelle has been extinguished by prescription and that it is competent for this court so deciding to rectify the mistake made in the Superior Court in allowing compensation in respect of an ill-founded cross-demand and to award the plaintiff the judgment to which she was admittedly entitled but for such claim of compensation.\nWith my learned brothers, I am of the opinion that where a promissory note is taken for a loan concurrently with the making of it, although the transaction be in nowise commercial, a presumption arises that the entire liability is that evidenced by the note, with the consequence that upon its extinction liability in respect of the loan likewise ceases. But, as indicated in Vachon v. Poulin, that presumption will prevail only if there be no legal proof to the contrary, i.e., no proof that the parties intended that there should be a liability in respect of the loan independent of that upon the note. The respondent relies for such proof upon an admission contained in the appellant's answer to her cross-demand. But she is confronted by a dilemma. If the admission be taken as made, while it might suffice to evidence a liability in respect of the loan independent of that upon the note and subject only to a prescription of thirty years, it would at the same time establish that the demande reconventionnelle was premature and should on that ground be dismissed. If, on the other hand, the portion of the admission which attaches to the loan the condition that it should be repayable only at the death of the borrower and without interest be rejected, as the respondent insists and as has been done in the provincial courts, so that the admission is merely of the making of the loan, it in nowise indicates an intention of the parties that the liability in respect of the loan should be independent of that upon the note given in consideration for it and concurrently with its being made. The presumption of a single liability, to wit, that upon the note, remains unaffected. Whichever way the admission be taken it does not furnish the proof necessary to entitle the respondent to recover upon her demande reconventionnelle.\nMIGNAULT J:\u2014L'appelante est cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re et l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9bitrice d'une rente annuelle et viag\u00e8re de $300. L'intim\u00e9e se pr\u00e9tend cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re de l'appelante en la somme de $3,000, pour un pr\u00eat que lui aurait fait son beau-fr\u00e8re, le nomme Amable Belanger, le 3 septembre 1917. Belanger est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir institu\u00e9 sa veuve, Dame Marie Catellier, comme sa l\u00e9gataire universelle, et cette derni\u00e8re a fait une donation de tous ses biens a l'intim\u00e9e, y comprise cette cr\u00e9ance de $3,000. Ajoutons que le m\u00eame jour qu'Amable B\u00e9langer pr\u00eatait \u00e0 l'appelante cette somme de $3,000, celle-ci lui consentit un billet payable \u00e0 demand\u00e9 pour la somme pr\u00eat\u00e9e. Lors de l'institution des proc\u00e9dures dont il s'agit en cette cause, ce billet \u00e9tait prescrit.\nL'appelante ayant poursuivi l'intim\u00e9e pour lui r\u00e9clamer un semestre de sa rente, soit $150, l'intim\u00e9e lui opposa en compensation cette cr\u00e9ance de $3,000. Et se portant demanderesse reconventionnelle contre l'appelante, l'intim\u00e9e demanda que celle-ci fut condamn\u00e9e a lui payer $2,965, soit la cr\u00e9ance de $3,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats, moins le versement de rente, $150, du a l'appelante.\nL'intim\u00e9e, tant dans sa d\u00e9fense que dans sa demande reconventionnelle, all\u00e8gue le pr\u00eat de $3,000, et ajoute que l'appelante a donn\u00e9, sous forme de promesse d'en rembourser le montant \u00e0 demande, une reconnaissance \u00e9crite de ce pr\u00eat, laquelle reconnaissance et promesse de payer, dit-elle. lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e par endossement et d\u00e9livrance far Dame veuve Amable Belanger. Cette pr\u00e9tendue reconnaissance \u00e9crite n'est autre que le billet \u00e0 demande pr\u00e9sent lors de la d\u00e9fense et de la demande reconventionnelle, mais l'intim\u00e9e a apparemment cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9tourner l'attention de l'appelante et lui dissimuler le vice radical de son titre de cr\u00e9ance en parlant d'un pr\u00eat et d'une reconnaissance \u00e9crite.\nAu lieu d'objecter a l'intim\u00e9e que sa cr\u00e9ance \u00e9tait \u00e9teinte par la prescription de cinq ans, l'appelante a r\u00e9pondu comme suit :\nElle (l'appelante) admet cependant qu'un pr\u00eat de $3,000 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par son beau-fr\u00e8re, Amable Belanger, mais \u00e0 la condition que ce montant ne serait payable qu'a la mort de la dite d\u00e9fenderesse reconventionnelle, sans int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nL'appelante se faisait probablement scrupule de soulever la question de la prescription. D'autre part, elle comptait sans doute que son aveu ne pourrait \u00eatre divise, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui oppose le billet a demande, et invoquant l'article 1243 du code civil, elle dit que la partie contest\u00e9e de l'aveu de l'appelante, savoir sa pr\u00e9tention que le pr\u00eat ne devait \u00eatre rembourse qu'\u00e0 sa mort, est combattue par une preuve contraire, c'est-\u00e0-dire par le billet \u00e0 demande, et elle prend pour son compte l'aveu du pr\u00eat, et rejette, en divisant l'aveu, l'allegation que le pr\u00eat n'\u00e9tait payable qu'au daces de l'appelante. Il n'y eut de part et d'autre aucune preuve de faite en dehors des pi\u00e8ces littorales produites avec les demandes et les d\u00e9fenses.\nA la cour sup\u00e9rieure comme \u00e0 la cour d'appel, le d\u00e9bat a roul\u00e9 sur cette question de la division de l'aveu fait par l'appelante. Dans mon opinion, il n'est pas indispensable de se prononcer sur ce point, bien que je ne puisse voir une contradiction n\u00e9cessaire entre un billet a demande et une entente que le paiement de ce billet ne serait exig\u00e9 qu'a une date ult\u00e9rieure. Mais m\u00eame en supposant que l'aveu puisse \u00eatre divis\u00e9, l'intim\u00e9e, dans mon opinion, ne peut obtenir ses conclusions. Pour rejeter sa d\u00e9fense de compensation et sa demande reconventionnelle, il suffit d'appliquer des r\u00e8gles de droit absolument \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires.\nLe pr\u00eat et le billet \u00e0 demande ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits le m\u00eame jour, 3 septembre 1917, le pr\u00eat \u00e9tant la consid\u00e9ration du billet. Le billet est endosse par Marie Catellier Belanger \u00e0 Tordre de Dame Ald\u00e9a Belanger, l'intim\u00e9e.\nOr en fait de lettres de change et de billets promissoires, l\u2019action se prescrit par cinq ans (art. 2260 C.C.). Dans tous les cas mentionn\u00e9s aux articles 2250, 2260, 2261 et 2262, la cr\u00e9ance est absolument \u00e9teinte, et nulle action ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue apr\u00e8s l'expiration du temps fixe pour la prescription (art. 2267). Cette prescription est une v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance et la loi d\u00e9niant faction, les tribunaux peuvent, et j'ajoute doivent, suppl\u00e9er d'office le moyen r\u00e9sultant de la prescription (art. 2188). Il n'importe donc pas que l'appelant n'ait pas plaide prescription.\nUn cas identique s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans la cause de Vachon v. Poulin[2], ou la cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 qu'un billet promissoire fourni en \u00e9change ou en consid\u00e9ration d'un pr\u00eat d'argent, m\u00eame entre non commer\u00e7ants, constitue, lorsque tout se fait simultan\u00e9ment et en l'absence de preuve l\u00e9gale au contraire, le contrat entre les parties et ce contrat est sujet a la prescription de cinq ans. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'y a pas de preuve contraire, car l'aveu du pr\u00eat n'indique nullement que les parties aient distingue l'obligation du pr\u00eat de celle du billet. Il ne faut pas oublier que l'intim\u00e9e divise l'aveu dont elle rejette la seconde partie quanta la date on paiement du billet serait exig\u00e9. Cela \u00e9tant, l'aveu du pr\u00eat ne constitue pas la preuve contraire dont parle Vachon v. Poulin. Il en serait autrement si l'intim\u00e9e avait accept\u00e9 l'aveu tel que fait; il n'y aurait pas eu prescription, mais sa demande reconventionnelle serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que dans Vachon v. Poulin, la cour d'appel a confirm\u00e9 le jugement unanime de la cour de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le juge-en-chef, Sir L. N. Casault, et par les juges Caron et Andrews, tous magistrats de grande exp\u00e9rience, dont le jugement est tr\u00e8s complet et satisfaisant[3] .\nLa d\u00e9cision dans Vachon v. Poulin[4] a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie par la cour de r\u00e9vision dans Hebert v. Demers (Tellier, Greenshields et Beaudin, JJ[5]. Il est \u00e0 remarquer que dans cette derni\u00e8re cause il y avait deux r\u00e9clamations, et celle fond\u00e9e sur un pr\u00eat accompagne de la signature d'un billet \u00e0 ordre fut rejet\u00e9e pour cause de prescription. Quant \u00e0 l'autre r\u00e9clamation pour un pr\u00eat sans billet, on a divise l'aveu du d\u00e9fendeur.\nLa cour de r\u00e9vision (Cannon, McCorkill et Drouin, JJ.) a \u00e9galement suivi Vachon v. Poulin dans Angers v. Dumas[6].\nOn voit que la d\u00e9cision dans Vachon v. Poulin a fait jurisprudence dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nRevenant maintenant \u00e0 la prescription dont il s'agit ici, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te qu'elle est une v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Les textes que j'ai cites d\u00e9montrent qu'elle \u00e9teint la cr\u00e9ance. Ainsi l'intim\u00e9e, lorsqu'elle a produit sa d\u00e9fense de compensation et qu'elle a institu\u00e9e sa demande reconventionnelle, n'avait plus de cr\u00e9ance. Sa d\u00e9fense et sa demande reconventionnelle tombaient d'elles-m\u00eames.\nMais l'intim\u00e9e, pr\u00e9tendant diviser l'aveu de l'appelante, se base sur l'admission de celle-ci que le pr\u00eat lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nJe suis d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment d'opinion qu'une telle admission ne suffit pas pour faire revivre une cr\u00e9ance \u00e9teinte. Il faudrait une nouvelle obligation ou une promesse non \u00e9quivoque de payer la dette prescrite. Une simple reconnaissance de la dette peut bien interrompre une prescription en cours; elle ne comporte pas, surtout dans les cas vis\u00e9s par l\u2019article 2267, renonciation a la prescription acquise. Dans mon opinion, la renonciation a la prescription acquise doit renfermer les conditions d'une obligation nouvelle: Milliken vs. Booth[7].\nOn peut lire avec profit, sur l'effet absolu des prescriptions courtes comme celle de l'article 2260, le jugement de feu le juge-en-chef Casault dans Fuchs v. Legare[8]. Il r\u00e9sulte de ce que je viens de dire et des d\u00e9cisions que j'ai rapport\u00e9es que lorsqu'un billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 donne en consid\u00e9ration d'un pr\u00eat fait en m\u00eame temps que le billet, la prescription applicable \u00e0 la dette est la prescription qui r\u00e9git le billet, et qu'on ne peut s\u00e9parer la consid\u00e9ration et le billet et admettre quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re une prescription autre que celle qui s'applique au second.\nDans Renaud v. Beauchemin[9], le juge Fortin a exprim\u00e9 (p. 204) l'opinion suivante, \u00e0 laquelle j'adh\u00e8re:\nIl est de r\u00e8gle que lorsque les parties ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 leur convention la forme d'un contrat commercial, ce contrat est r\u00e9gi par les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 tel contrat.\nJ'arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion que l'intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame en divisant l'aveu de l'appelante, ne peut r\u00e9ussir dans sa demande reconventionnelle. Elle aurait mieux fait de demander acte de l'aveu qualifie de l'appelante et conserver sa cr\u00e9ance. Puisqu'elle rejette la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l'aveu, on ne peut \u00e9viter la question de prescription, et le jugement qu'elle a obtenu contre l'appelante ne peut \u00eatre maintenu.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d'avis que l'intim\u00e9e ne pouvait opposer sa cr\u00e9ance \u00e9teinte en compensation du versement de rente r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par l'appelante par sa demande principale.\nOn dit cependant que le jugement sur la demande principale\u2014et il n'y a qu'un seul jugement qui se prononce tant sur la demande principale que sur la demande reconventionnelle\u2014ne peut \u00eatre l'objet d'un appel devant cette cour.\nS'il ne s'agissait que d'une action ou la demande serait pour $150, il est visible que nous n'aurions pas juridiction, et j'ajoute qu'une telle action ne pourrait \u00eatre port\u00e9e par voie d'appel devant la cour du Banc du Roi, juridiction d'appel, de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nCependant dans cette cause la cour sup\u00e9rieure, par un seul jugement, a renvoy\u00e9 la demande principale et a maintenu la demande reconventionnelle. L'appelante a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement \u00e0 la cour du Banc du Roi et cette derni\u00e8re cour, par un jugement rendu sur une motion de l'intim\u00e9e, a refus\u00e9 de rejeter, faute de juridiction, l'appel quant au jugement rendu sur la demande principale de l'appelante. Et le juge Dorion, dans son opinion dissidente, conclut au maintien de la- demande principale et au renvoi de la demande reconventionnelle. Le juge Howard aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'il n'y avait pas droit d'appel du jugement rendu sur la demande principale, mais son opinion apparemment n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9e par ses coll\u00e8gues.\nIl est certain qu'ici la demande principale et la demande reconventionnelle sont tr\u00e8s intimement li\u00e9es, car dans chacune d'elles il s'agit de savoir si l'intim\u00e9e poss\u00e8de une cr\u00e9ance de $3,000 qu'elle puisse opposer en compensation \u00e0 l'appelante et dont elle puisse r\u00e9clamer d'elle le r\u00e9sidu. Il me parait impossible de nous prononcer sur l'exigibilit\u00e9 de la cr\u00e9ance de l'intim\u00e9e sans par la adjuger sur le droit de celle-ci d'opposer cette cr\u00e9ance en compensation \u00e0 l'appelante, la compensation entre deux dettes \u00e9galement liquides et exigibles s'op\u00e9rant de plein droit (art. 1188 C.C.).\nNous avons ainsi devant nous un jugement qui a adjuge sur ces deux questions qui n'en forment r\u00e9ellement qu'une, et il n'y a pas, que je sache, de pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent de cette cour qui s'oppose \u00e0 ce que nous nous prononcions sur le m\u00e9rite de ce jugement sur ces deux points.\nApr\u00e8s y avoir s\u00e9rieusement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, je crois que nous avons juridiction pour trancher tout le d\u00e9bat soulev\u00e9 dans cette cause. Je maintiendrais donc l'appel et j'accorderais les conclusions de l'appelante dans sa demande principale et je rejetterais la demande reconventionnelle de l'intim\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens contre cette derni\u00e8re dans les trois cours.\nJ'ajoute que depuis la pr\u00e9paration de ce jugement, j'ai trouv\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans le sens que j'ai adopte: McIntyre v. Patterson[10].\nMALOUIN J:\u2014Pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par le juge Mignault, je suis d'opinion de maintenir l'appel, d'accorder les conclusions de la demanderesse appelante dans son action principale, de rejeter la demande reconventionnelle de la d\u00e9fenderesse intim\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens dans les trois cours.\nJe suis d'avis que le billet donne en \u00e9change du pr\u00eat de $3,000 constitue un contrat commercial et que ce billet \u00e9tait prescriptible par cinq ans. De fait, il \u00e9tait prescrit \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle la rente de $150 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la demanderesse est devenue exigible. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse au plaidoyer sur l'action principale et dans sa d\u00e9fense a la demande reconventionnelle, la demanderesse dit bien qu'elle a emprunte $3,000, remboursable \u00e0 sa mort; mais cet aveu ne constitue pas une renonciation \u00e0 la prescription du billet. Par cet aveu, la demanderesse a reconnu un pr\u00eat civil payable \u00e0 sa mort; mais elle n'a pas renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la prescription acquise du billet du 3 septembre 1917. La prescription \u00e9teint la cr\u00e9ance; et pour la faire revivre, le d\u00e9biteur doit non-seulement reconnaitre son existence mais promettre de la payer.\n\u00c9tant d'opinion que le billet qui fait la base de la cr\u00e9ance de la d\u00e9fenderesse principale, qui est en m\u00eame temps la demanderesse par reconvention, est prescrit, la question de divisibilit\u00e9 de l'aveu ne se pr\u00e9sente pas.\nLa question de savoir si le pr\u00eat est civil ou commercial est une question de droit, qui ne peut faire l'objet d'un aveu. En cons\u00e9quence, l'aveu de la demanderesse ne peut porter sur la question de savoir si l'emprunt qu'elle a contracte constitue un pr\u00eat civil ou commercial. Il appartient \u00e0 la cour de le d\u00e9cider. Partant, la premi\u00e8re partie de l'aveu de la demanderesse ne peut servir \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse. La seconde partie de l'aveu peut lui \u00eatre utile si elle accepte l'aveu en son entier. Si elle rejette l'aveu, son plaidoyer et sa demande reconventionnelle doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s parce que le pr\u00eat est prescrit. Si elle l'accepte en son entier, son plaidoyer et sa demande reconventionnelle doivent \u00eatre \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9s, mais comme pr\u00e9matur\u00e9s; et, dans ce dernier cas, elle pourra faire valoir sa r\u00e9clamation a la mort de la demanderesse.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appelant: Rousseau, Chouinard & Laflamme.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\n[1] [1898] Q.R. 7 Q.B. 60.\n[2] Q.R. 7 Q.B. 60.\n[3] [1897] Q.R. 12 S.C. 323.\n[4] Q.E. 7 Q.B. 60.\n[5] [1914] Q.R. 47 S.C. 252.\n[6] [1916] Q.R. 50 S.C. 481.\n[7] [1893] Q.R. 3 Q.B. 158.\n[8] [1876] 3 Q.L.R. 11.\n[9] [1908] Q.R. 35 S.C. 193.\n[10] [1923] Q.R. 36 K.B. 499.\n",

(1911) c. 222\u2014(B.C.) 1917, c. 62, ss. 8, 15.\nIn 1917, K. assigned to the appellant company an option to purchase certain mining properties from S. By the assignment, the appellant acquired the immediate right to take possession of the property, to work it, to ship the ore produced and to retain 90 per cent of the proceeds, depositing 10 per cent in the Bank of Montreal to the credit of S. to be applied on the final instalment of the purchase price when paid but to belong to S. in any event. The appellant company was to pay $17,500 upon the execution of the option, the same sum in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and $80,000 in 1921. In 1918, the appellant, being assessed to income tax in respect of the income derived from the mine, claimed as deductions: 1, as to the 10 per cent of the proceeds of the mine paid to S.; 2, as to the instalment of $17,500 paid to K.; 3, as to the costs of plant additions, and 4, for depletion of mine. These deductions were disallowed by the Court of Revision.\nHeld, that (reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal), as to the first claim, the 10 per cent of the proceeds of the mine paid to the credit of S. should have been declared a proper deduction; (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal), as to the second claim, the determination of the assessor made in conformity with the provision of the Taxation Act, treating the payment of $17,500 as part of the purchase price and therefore chargeable against capital rather than against revenue, should not be disturbed; Idington J. contra; as to the third claim, upon the facts, such expenses have been properly treated by the assessor as a capital expenditure; and as to the fourth claim, allowance for depletion of mine is entirely within the discretion of the Minister of Finance for the province (s. 6, ss. 9 of c. 79 of the Statute of 1919.)\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1924] 1 W.W.R. 1017) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of the Court of Revision as to assessment of the appellant company for income tax. The material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nHamilton K.C. for the appellant.\nDonaghy for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal by the said company from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing an appeal from a special Court of Revision held at the city of Kaslo on the 30th of January, and following days, 1923.\nFour grounds of appeal are taken. The appellant had an option to purchase a mine and pending that the right to operate it, and bound itself to pay into the Bank of Montreal ten per cent of the smelter returns to be held for the vendor until the expiration of the option and ultimately to become the vendor's if there was default in accepting the option and paying the prices named.\nBut in the event of the appellant accepting the option it might claim this fund belonging tentatively to the vendor as part of the price and get credit for it.\nThe appellant may never accept the option. Meantime it clearly is a charge upon its earnings and I agree with Chief Justice McDonald in the Court of Appeal[2] in holding that such sums as thus paid, are not part of the taxable income of appellant, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout against the respondent.\nI cannot see how the well known rule of law in regard to the necessity of taxing statutes being so restricted as to render them clear beyond doubt can otherwise be observed than by doing so, making them apply to present realities instead of to speculative chances.\nThe next ground of complaint is as to an item of $17,500 due under and by the terms of another similar agreement for an option but payable as cash direct for the year in question.\nFor the same reason, as the option had not yet been taken up, I think that was a sum which should have been allowed as a deduction from the gross income and, therefore, am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout as against respondent. There is another, or third claim, for expenses in way of erections on the mining premises which probably might have been allowed if shown to be of such an incidental nature as to render it clearly part of the reasonably necessary expense to recover the minerals, but I agree with the said Chief Justice that in the absence of evidence it is not possible to allow such reduction. The fourth claim is for depletion in the value of the mine, but the statute seems to bar any such reduction and, even if it did not, I fail to see how we could arrive at any correct determination or give, in an appeal of this kind, any directions to arrive at any adequate or accurate result.\nI agree with appellant's counsel that in reason it may be a claim founded in justice, but in law, as the Taxation Act stands, nothing can be done unless by the respondent.\nThe adding of these last two grounds has not made any material addition to the costs.\nAnd as there has only been one cause, or course of litigation, in these appeals as if all the said causes of appeal formed one suit, of course there should be only one set of costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014The controversy in this appeal arose in these circumstances: On the 1st January, 1918, one Kent assigned to the appellant company an option to purchase certain mining properties from one Sellon. By the assignment the appellant company acquired the immediate right to take possession of the mining property, to work it, to ship the ore produced and to retain ninety per cent of the proceeds, depositing ten per cent in the Bank of Montreal to the credit of Sellon. In the event of the option being exercised, this share of ten per cent was to be applied in liquidation of the purchase price, but was to belong to Sellon in any event. The appellant also acquired the right to the immediate possession and use of the mining mill at Roseberry. By the terms of the option the appellant company was to pay $17,500 upon the execution of the instrument creating it, and the same sum on a specified date in each of the years 1918, 1919 and 1920, and the residue of the purchase price, $80,000, on the 10th November, 1921. In the year 1918, the appellant company was assessed to income tax in respect of the income derived from this mine. Certain deductions claimed having been disallowed, an appeal taken to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia was dismissed, and from that judgment the appellant now appeals.\nThe first question relates to Sellon's share of the proceeds of the smelter returns for the ore shipped pursuant to the privilege given under the option. I cannot concur with the view of the Court of Appeal as regards this claim. It is quite true that the whole of the smelter returns came into the hands of the appellant company, but as regards ten per cent of them, the company received the money not as its own property, but as the property of Sellon. It was the company's duty to pay that part of the receipts into the bank immediately for Sellon. If anybody was assessable in respect of the sum so paid in, it was Sellon, and not the appellant company. In Forrest v. Traves[3], the full court of British Columbia, having occasion to consider a clause framed in identical terms, held that an equitable charge upon the ore shipped had been created in favour of the mine owner. The decision was reversed upon another point by this court[4], but the majority of this court concurred with the view of the court below as to the effect of the clause.\nAs to the second claim, the appellants' contention is based upon no. 2 of the enumeration of deductions allowed in form 7 as amended by section 15 of c. 62 of the statutes of 1917. The deduction is defined in these words:\nOutgoings or necessary expenses, actually incurred and paid out in the production of the income by the taxpayer, other than expenditures on capital account or reinvestment account or to replace or provide against depreciation.\nIt is necessary, however, to refer also to section 76 as reenacted by section 8 of c. 62 of the statutes of the same year, which provides that none of the deductions set forth by form 7 shall include\nany expenses or charges which ought, in the opinion of the assessor, to be chargeable against the capital of the taxpayer, and not against revenue. I think it is open to question whether or not the determination of the assessor, upon a question arising under this clause, is open to review. At all events, the language of the clause seems sufficiently to indicate an intention that, in so far as the question is a question of fact, the assessor's opinion should be final. If, therefore, the assessor might reasonably take the view that the deduction claimed was a deduction properly chargeable against capital, his determination ought not, in my opinion, to be disturbed. The precise claim is this: The appellant company, in 1918, paid under the terms of the option the $17,500 required to keep the option alive. It is strictly true, no doubt, that the annual payments under the option are expenses necessarily incurred by the appellant company in earning the income it receives from the production of ore; but nevertheless this sum in each instance is in part a sum paid for the right to mine during the succeeding twelve months. If the final payment be made, it is a part of the purchase money paid for the title to the mine in fee; but whether the final payment be or be not made, each successive instalment is capable of being looked at as the purchase price paid by the holder of the option for the absolute right he thereby acquires to take from the mine the ore mined during the succeeding year, which thereupon becomes his own, subject to the equitable charge above-mentioned, as well as for the maintenance of his potential right to its fee which ripens into the actual right upon full performance of the conditions. To regard these payments as purchase price, and therefore as chargeable against capital rather than against revenue, could not, I think, be considered an unreasonable view. On that claim I think the appeal fails.\nThe third and fourth claims also fail, in my opinion; the third because on the facts it seems impossible to affirm that the expenditure has not been properly treated as a capital expenditure; and the fourth on the ground that the statute manifests an intention that such claims should be dealt with by the Minister of Finance.\nThe appeal should be allowed as to the first claim, but otherwise dismissed. The appellant company is entitled to the costs of the appeal. MIGNAULT J.\u2014I am of opinion to allow the appeal with costs to the extent, and for the reasons, stated by my brother Duff.\nMALOUIN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff. I would allow this appeal as to the first claim, but otherwise dismiss it, with costs against the respondent.\nMACLEAN J.\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the written judgment of Duff J. in this appeal, and I agree with the conclusions he has reached.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hamilton & Wragge.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Nisbet & Graham.\n[1] [1924] 1 W.W.R. 1017.\n[2] [1924] 1 W.W.R. 1017.\n[3] [1908] 14 B.C.

Appellant;\nand\nNew Brunswick Railway Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1924: May 19, 20; 1924: June 6.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Mignault and Malouin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE CHANCERY DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK\nLease\u2014Demise of railway\u2014Covenant by lessee\u2014Construction\u2014Payment of taxes.\nIn 1882 The N.B. and Can. Rd. Co. leased its railway to The N.B. Ry. Co. for 999 years and the lessee covenanted, inter alia, to pay \"all taxes that may be lawfully assessed upon the (lessor) and upon the real and personal estate taken under this lease\" and a rental of $35,000 per annum.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (50 N.B. Rep. 376), Idington J. diss., that the covenant as to taxes only applied to those imposed in respect of the property demised and did not oblige the lessee to pay taxes imposed on the lessor under the Dominion Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments.\nAPPEAL by consent from the judgment of the Chancery Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] in favour of the defendant company. The question for decision on this appeal is one of construction of the covenant set out in the head-note contained in a lease by appellant to respondent of the former's railway. The appellant contends that such covenant obliged respondent to pay the income tax imposed on appellant under the Dominion Income War Tax Act, 1917, and Amending Acts. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on a reference from the Chancery Division, held against this contention.\nBaxter K.C. for the appellant. The grammatical construction of the covenant, whether or not you read \"and\" as \"or\" and the terms of the whole lease show that the parties intended the whole rent to come to the lessor without diminution so that the entire sum could be distributed among its shareholders.\nIn construing written instruments the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to unless it would lead to absurdity or some repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument. Maxwell on Statutes (5 ed.), page 4. No such result would follow in this case.\nThe view taken in Hurst v. Hurst[2] is in accord with the appellant's contention; and see Arran v. Crisp[3]; Amfield v. White[4]; Palmer v. Earith[5].\nTilley K.C. and Fred. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondent: A covenant to pay all taxes only applies to future taxation of the kind in existence when the covenant was made. See Woodfall Landlord and Tenant (20 ed.), page 675. Foa Landlord and Tenant (5 ed.), page 184. Shrewsbury v. Shrewsbury[6].\nThe spirit of the Income Tax Act is that the person who receives the income shall pay the tax and that it shall not be passed on to any one else. Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Co. v. Minister of Finance of Newfoundland[7]; North British Ry. Co. v. Scott[8].\nBaxter K.C. for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. and Fred. R. Taylor K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant, being what its name implies, became the owner of certain railroad properties acquired by virtue of its powers given it by the New Brunswick Legislature incorporating it, or later legislation authorizing it to so acquire, and on the 22nd of August, demised same for the term of 999 years to the respondent, a corporation created by virtue of the laws of New Brunswick and of the Dominion of Canada, and the indenture containing said demise is somewhat lengthy.\nThough it thereby bound itself to pay all taxes lawfully assessed upon the lessor, the lessee disputes its liability to repay the taxes imposed upon the appellant by virtue of the Dominion Income War Tax Act, 1917.\nThe whole question of such liability, which is all that is involved herein, must turn upon the interpretation and construction of the third paragraph of said agreement, of which the herein directly pertinent point reads as follows:\u2014\nArticle III\nThe party of the second part, for itself, its successors and assigns, hereby accepts said lease and agrees to take, manage and operate all of the railroads and branches, hereby demised, substantially in the present line, during the term of this lease, at its own expense and for its own benefit, in accordance with the charter of the party of the first part and any amendments thereto and will hold the party of the first part harmless against and from all loss and damage by reason of any act or thing done or omitted to be done or negligence on the part of the party of the second part, its successors or assigns, in the operation, maintenance or use of said railroads and branches and will keep and maintain said railroads, its fences, rolling stock, equipments, depots and other leased property and all renewals and additions thereto in good condition and repair and will make good all loss or damage to any of the leased property, and substantially restore, at the termination of this lease, the same and all parts thereof to the party of the first part, its successors or assigns, in good order and condition, fulfil all duties relating to the maintenance, use or management of the property leased, which may be imposed by law, pay all taxes that may be lawfully assessed upon the party of the first part, and upon the real and personal estate taken under this lease, including all lawful expenses and charges of Railroad Commissioners and such like expenses and pay the interest and rental indebtedness of said party of the first part, as follows:\u2014\nThat is followed by seven distinctly specified liabilities then borne by the appellant, and thereafter to be assumed by the respondent.\nAnd those by the following:\u2014\nAnd the party of the second part for itself, its successors and assigns, further agrees to pay, for each and every year during the continuance of this lease, to the said party of the first part, its successors and assigns, by way of further rental, the annual sum of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000). And for the expense of keeping up the corporate organization of the said party, the further sum of one hundred dollars ($100) annually, all of the aforesaid interest and rental charges being payable, one-half on the first of January, and one-half on the first of July, in each and every year.\nThe court below held that the said income tax for which appellant was assessed under and by virtue of said Income Tax Act for the years 1917 to 1921 inclusive, did not fall within the meaning of said covenant above quoted.\nI submit that having due regard to the entire purview of the said agreement, which evidently was designed to give the appellant an annual annuity of $35,000, clear of all expenses, during the currency of the lease, save and except the expense of maintaining its corporate existence during that period, to cover which there was to be paid the further annual sum of $100 each year, it clearly was the intention of the parties that all such taxes as were lawfully assessed by any duly constituted authority upon the appellant, should be paid by the respondent.\nThe tax seems to have been lawfully assessed for that is not denied.\nThe tax is not imposed upon the shareholders of the appellant but upon the corporation making this lease upon the assurance that the lessee would pay it.\nIt may indeed turn out that the respective shareholders getting parts of said rental may have to meet income taxes in their respective home jurisdictions.\nIt seems to me that it is quite beside the question to argue that Dominion income taxes had not been sought prior to the making of this lease. The power to do so existed. Indeed the first sentence of the indenture indicates that the respondent had owed some of its corporate powers, enabling it to enter into such a contract at all, to the Dominion laws.\nAnd it seems to me that it clearly must have been within the contemplation of the parties that if the Dominion should impose any burden on this railway property the respondent must be prepared to meet it.\nThe period for which the lease was to run is far beyond what has to be considered in many leases for short periods of time.\nWe must therefore extend our range of vision and not take a narrow view of what the parties must have intended. The language used seems to me clear and express and wide enough to cover what appellant claims.\nI may observe that our Dominion was only a few days over fifteen years in existence when this agreement was entered into.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the amounts assessed, with interest from the respective dates when due (but not to includes the penalties incurred by appellant for non-payment), should be directed to be paid by respondent to appellant.\nDuff J.\u2014The clause which has given rise to this litigation, read literally, makes the appellant responsible for taxes assessed upon the real and personal estate passing under the lease, which are also properly assessed against the appellant. The clause, that is to say, gives a right of indemnity in relation to taxes for which the appellant is personally liable with respect to the property passing under the lease. I think this construction should be given effect to, because I think it best harmonizes with the context which appears to exhibit an intention to create a right of indemnity in respect of obligations arising by virtue of the lessor's proprietorship of the reversion in the properties demised.\nThe tax in question is not a tax levied upon the appellant company as proprietor of the reversion or even as a railway company; that is to say, as a corporation having authority to construct and work railways. It is simply an income tax and is payable by the appellant in respect of its income from whatever source it may be derived, on precisely the same conditions as those upon which it is exigible from other income earners. It is therefore, in my opinion, not a tax of the class envisaged by the clause.\nI express no opinion upon the question, which does not arise, whether a tax levied upon the company, in respect of its rent under the lease, would fall within the scope of the indemnity.\nNor do I express an opinion upon the other point upon which counsel for the respondent company relies, namely, that the indemnity is limited in its application to taxes of a character similar to those which, up to the time of the execution of the lease, had been known to be public finance of New Brunswick.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The circumstances under which the question at issue between the parties has arisen and the terms of the document upon the construction of which its solution depends are set out in the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, delivered by Mr. Justice White[9].\nNeither in a grammatical reading of the covenant relied upon, which is found towards the end of the first paragraph of Article III of the lease or agreement between the appellant and the respondent, nor in the tenor of that instrument taken as a whole, do I find any expression or indication of an intention on the part of the lessee to assume the burden of income tax imposed on the lessor in respect of rental to be derived by it from the leased properties. The obligation of the lessee in regard to the rental of $35,000 per annum is to pay that rental to the lessor without deduction. That obligation has been fulfilled. It has also undertaken to satisfy all charges in the nature of taxation levied upon the demised property itself, and possibly, in addition, such as may be imposed upon the lessor qua owner of the property. Beyond that it is, I think, quite impossible to extend the obligation in regard to taxes assumed by the lessee. It has not undertaken, and there is nothing to indicate that it was ever contemplated that it should undertake, to pay any taxes which might be levied upon the $35,000 rental after its receipt by the lessor, or which might be imposed upon the lessor itself by reason, or as a consequence, of such receipt. It is against payment of such taxes that the lessor now seeks indemnification. The covenant relied upon, in my opinion, is not open to a construction which would support that claim.\nThe appeal therefore fails.\nMignault J.\u2014By a lease dated the 22nd of August, 1882, the appellant company demised its line of railway, stations, rolling stock, etc., to the respondent for the period of 999 years from the 1st of July, 1882. The rental was fixed at $35,000 a year, and among other charges the respondent undertook to pay to the appellant $100 annually for the expense of keeping up its corporate organization and also agreed that it would\npay all taxes that may be lawfully assessed upon the party of the first part (the appellant), and upon the real and personal estate taken under this lease.\nUnder the Federal Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amending Acts, the appellant was called upon to pay to the Receiver General of Canada various sums as an income tax imposed on its income comprising the rental it received from the respondent under the lease, and it claims these sums from the respondent, contending that the latter assumed the obligation to pay such a tax by the covenant I have cited. This contention was rejected by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe only question therefore involved in this appeal is one of construction. Assuming that the two members of the phrase I have quoted, and which are separated by a comma, should be read disjunctively, it would be altogether unreasonable to contend that the respondent assumed the obligation to pay any tax that might be lawfully assessed upon the appellant, irrespective of its nature or of the cause of its imposition. Mr. Baxter was asked whether the respondent would be liable for a tax imposed on property purchased by the appellant with the rental it received from the respondent, and refrained from so arguing. It is obvious that the first part of the phrase is subject to some limitation, and when read with the second part its reasonable meaning, and that no doubt which was intended by the parties, is that the respondent assumed liability for taxes imposed upon the appellant in respect of the property demised by the lease. In other words if, after the respondent has acquitted its obligation to pay the annual rental to the appellant, this rental is taxed in the appellant's hands as property belonging to it the respondent is not bound to pay the tax. Whether the appellant retains the rental in money or invests it in the purchase of property, any tax imposed upon the rental or its investment, as property belonging to the appellant, is a tax which the appellant alone must bear.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Malouin J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin and Mr. Justice Mignault. I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons stated by them.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: N. Marks Mills.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Fred. R.

Rep. 435) reversed, Anglin and Malouin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] discharging a rule for a writ of certiorari to quash an assessment on the personal property of the Bank of Nova Scotia at its branch in Woodstock. The question for decision on this appeal and the material facts on which it is based are stated in the above head-note. Tilley K.C. and Fred. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. Branch banks are merely agencies of the banking corporation; Prince v. Oriental Bank Corporation[2]; Bain v. Torrance[3]; and the fact that for certain purposes they may be considered distinct is not inconsistent with this proposition; Clode v. Bayley[4]. Consequently the surplus funds sent abroad by the branch is not an asset at Woodstock.\nThe findings of fact by the assessors are only unimpeachable when they act judicially; Local Government Board v. Arlidge[5] per Lord Moulton at page 150. In this case they fixed an arbitrary sum as the value of personal property at Woodstock.\nTilley K.C. and Fred. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nBaxter K.C. and Hartley K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick dismissing an appeal by way of writ of certiorari from the assessment of the said bank by respondent in respect of its personal estate within said town. The said bank is only one of the branches of the said bank of which the head office is situate elsewhere than in the said town.\nThe agent in charge of said branch, in response to a public notice which rendered it his duty to do so, made a sworn statement of its property at and within the said town.\nThe part thereof relevant to its personal estate is as follows:\u2014\nWhat is the gross value of all the personal estate of the said bank within said town, as held and used in the said town or elsewhere in connection with the business done in the said town?\nAnswer,\u2014\nAs at December 31, 1921, cash on hand \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n$ 14,584 05\nOverdrafts and discounted bills \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n298,183 57\nStamped cheques \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n203 20\nFixtures \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n2,000 00\nTotal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n$314,970 82\nDeposits by public \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n562,909 74\nExcess of liabilities over assets \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n$247,938 92 What is the net amount of the annual income, earnings or profit of the business of the said Bank of Nova Scotia within said town?\nAnswer: Net loss for year 1921, $3,042.36.\nDo you so keep your books of account that you can speak with certainty and accuracy in answering the questions above?\nAnswer: Yes.\nNotwithstanding the delivery thereof to the respondent in due time they assessed the said Branch Bank at Woodstock for the sum of $65,000 for personal estate.\nFrom that the said bank appealed to the respondent and was heard toy them as required by the statute in such case provided.\nUpon that appeal the said agent was duly sworn and testified at length explaining the said statement and how arrived at. I am satisfied from a perusal thereof and all else appearing in the case, that in fact there was no sum for which in law the said branch bank should be assessed for personal property, yet the respondent dismissed said appeal and continued the said assessment for $65,000.\nFrom the said decision the said bank appealed to the town council, which in turn refused any relief.\nHaving exhausted the means of rectification without results in way of relief the bank then applied, as the law of New Brunswick provides, for an appeal by way of a writ of certiorari, to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and that court in turn discharged the rule with costs.\nIt seems a very clear case and arises I infer from a misapprehension of the law and the facts.\nIt seems quite evident that the depositors of money at said branch have to go there for the return of their deposits which are a clear indebtedness of that branch, and more than counterbalance anything in the way of personal property acquired by using said part of deposits at said branch.\nThat being a mere branch it is subject to the orders of the head office and, pursuant thereto, the surplus moneys of said depositors, not needed for the operation of said branch, are sent to other business centres where they can be successfully used.\nThe court below, and other authorities below it, seems to imagine that the town assessors can assess in respect of moneys so sent elsewhere. They cannot do so in law or by any law the local legislature can enact.\nAny one conversant with the subject ought to know that the head office or the other branches using the said moneys are liable to be taxed for income derived therefrom and, beyond a shadow of doubt, usually are, by the cities or towns wherein such moneys are profitably used.\nNeither in law nor in justice can the branch receiving such deposits be taxed for that over which it has no control.\nThe disregard of the evidence herein in question and consequent assumption on the part of the local authorities seems to me surprising after the discussion the subject has had for many years.\nI am clearly of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the said assessment of the said appellant branch of the bank be quashed with costs throughout against the respondent.\nDuff J.\u2014The only question which has given me any concern on this appeal has been the question of the authority of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to review the assessment. I have come to the conclusion that sections 124-125 of the Rates and Taxes Act, 1913, ch. 21, do confer such a power of review in proceedings by certiorari where the assessment has been based upon\u2014to quote the language of s.s. (b) of s. 125\u2014\" a wrong principle in whole or in part.\"\nThat the assessment did proceed upon a wrong principle seems to be conclusively established. It has been assumed throughout and is, I understand, not seriously disputed, that section 2 of 53 Vic., ch. 40, is in force and applies, and therefore that it was the duty of the assessors to\ndeduct from each person's personal property the amount of his or her indebtedness, as the case may be, and assess the balance remaining of said personal property after making such deduction.\nTherefore the amount of the \"indebtedness\" is to be deducted from the value of the personal property assessable under the Act of 1883. Now that means, I have no doubt, an indebtedness which can be localized in Woodstock just as the amount in respect of which the bank is assessable for real and personal estate is determined by the value of the real and personal estate held by the bank in the town or \"in connection with the business done therein.\"\nI agree with the argument presented on behalf of the appellant bank that the effect of Lovitt v. The King[6] is that deposits made at the branch in the ordinary way have a situs in Woodstock because in the ordinary course, so long as the branch is maintained, it is there and there only that payment of these deposits can, as of right, be demanded by the depositor.\nThe argument turned principally upon the question of the amount assessable in respect of personal property. On behalf of the respondent, it is contended that the whole mass of moneys received for deposit must be treated as an asset localized in Woodstock. I am unable to agree with this. These moneys may have been received in legal tender or through the transfer of some form of credit not falling within that class. The amount retained by the bank for the purpose of its business in Woodstock may properly be treated as localized there, but credits transferred elsewhere like gold or Dominion notes so transferred cannot, by any process of reasoning which I can follow, be localized at the branch where they were originally received merely because they were in fact received there. Such moneys and credits have a situs without doubt; but where that situs is is a question of fact, and on the material before the assessors in this case the only possible conclusion was that the situs of such moneys and credits was not in Woodstock.\nIt seems at first sight, no doubt, a plausible contention that the situs of the asset should be considered to be the same as the situs of the liability. It requires little reflection, however, to reveal that the two things have no necessary connection with one another. The liability is not a liability charged upon the moneys deposited; it is an obligation of the bank arising out of a contract of loan. The situs at any given moment of the moneys lent, which may have been transferred to another branch, cannot be governed by the situs of the obligation, which is primarily determined, under the authority of Lovitt's Case (1), by reference to the terms of the contract of deposit.\nNor does the evidence show that the moneys are held in Woodstock \"in connection with\" the business done there. The appeal should be allowed, and there should be a direction under ss. 124-125 of the statute above referred to for the rectification of the roll. The appellants should have their costs throughout.\nAnglin J.\u2014The sole question in this appeal is whether under s. 2 of the N.B. stat., 53 V., c. 40, the Bank of Nova Scotia is entitled to treat the average amount standing on its books to the credit of depositors in Woodstock as a liability deductible for purposes of assessment from the amount of assessable personal estate owned by it and held in the town of Woodstock or in connection with the business done therein (46 V., c. 26, s. 11), without offsetting against, or deducting from, such indebtedness not merely, as it has done, so much of such deposits as is invested in the town or through the medium of the bank's Woodstock branch but also the balance thereof transmitted by it for investment either to the head office or to branches of the bank situate elsewhere.\nThe facts are fully stated by Mr. Justice Crockett in delivering the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[7]. A reasonable inference from the evidence of Mr. Roy L. Daniel, the local bank manager, there quoted, appears to be that, in respect of deposits transmitted by it to other branches, the Woodstock branch receives credit at the Toronto branch of the bank, which for this purpose is treated as the bank's head office, and is entitled to demand from it, or from some other branch of the bank having surplus funds, upon giving credit therefor at Toronto, any sums it may from time to time need in order to repay depositors. Mr. Daniel in his testimony spoke of the deposits of the Woodstock branch so transmitted to other branches, amounting to $349,393.90 at the time of the assessment, as an indebtedness of head office. He did not say to whom such indebtedness was owing, but it must be either to the Woodstock branch, which he said acts as a separate bank in regard to deposits, or to the depositors. If, as his evidence with regard to credits given in Toronto would indicate, the head office should be regarded as indebted to the branch bank for deposits transmitted by it for investment to other branches, then, as Mr. Justice Crockett points out, the credit so given the Woodstock branch should for assessment purposes, if not treated as personal property of the bank in the town of Woodstock or used in connection with its business done in that town, at least be offset against its liability to depositors as a deductible item under s. 2 of 53 V., c. 40. If, on the other hand, the indebtedness in respect to deposits so transmitted should be regarded as that of the head office to depositors, the deductible liability of the Woodstock branch should in that particular be reduced by the amount thereof. From either point of view the bank would appear to be chargeable with a surplus of personal property held by it in the town of Woodstock or in connection with the business done therein to an amount exceeding $100,000.\nThe total assessment for personal property appealed against is $65,600. How that amount was arrived at by the assessors is not very clear and is not now of much moment, the sole ground of appeal being that, if a proper deduction be made in respect of liability to local depositors, the bank's assessment for personal property is excessive\u2014in fact should be nil.\nIf the bank's assessment, made on the same basis as the assessments of individual ratepayers, should have been for a sum in excess of $100,000 in respect of personal property, the only conclusion upon a complaint that the impeached assessment of the $65,600 is, \"special, unequal and improper\" would be that it should be increased. That is not sought. The evidence is that the appellant is assessed on the same footing as other banks having branches in the town. The appeal on the ground of inequality cannot prevail.\nThe provision of the statute of 1856 (19 V., c. 32, s. 47) prohibiting an assessment at an amount greater than that mentioned in the ratepayer's return of property and income when attested as prescribed, if then still in force, was, I think, repealed by section 4 of the Act of 1920 (10 Geo. V, c. 78). It is inconsistent with section 1 of that statute, which requires the assessors to obtain information and to assess to the best of their judgment any person who has failed to make a sworn return of all his property and in come. The conclusiveness of such return is dependent upon its accuracy and completeness. Unless accepted by the assessors it is their duty to assess according to their best judgment and the ratepayer has the opportunity of establishing by appeal the accuracy and completeness of his return if the assessment should be for a greater amount. That the statement of the ratepayer should in every case be accepted by the assessors as conclusive is inconsistent with the directions for assessment and the system of appeal provided for.\nWhile in my opinion, upon the evidence an assessment in respect of personal property for a considerably larger sum would have been justifiable, the bank cannot successfully resist its assessment upon that item for $65,600.\nFor these reasons and those stated by Mr. Justice Crockett I would dismiss this appeal.\nMignault J.\u2014The statutory authority for levying the tax for which the appellant was assessed is to be found in section 11 of the Act, 46 Victoria, chapter 26 (New Brunswick), of 1883, being an Act further to amend the several Acts relating to the town of Woodstock, in the county of Carleton. Section 11 reads as follows:\n11. All joint stock companies or corporations who shall carry on business within the said town, or who shall have an agent, sub-agent or manager within said town, shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant upon any real or personal property owned by any such company or corporation, and upon the income received by them, and the income of any company or corporation, being an insurance company, shall be appraised at twelve and one-half per centum of the premium and moneys received from said company by such manager, agent, or sub-agent; and for the purpose of enabling the assessors to rate such company or corporation with accuracy, the agent, sub-agent or manager thereof, shall, if required in writing by the assessors so to do, according to the form in the schedule to this Act, furnish to them a true and correct statement in writing under oath to be made before a Justice of the Peace, setting forth the whole amount of annual income received for such company or corporation within said town during the year preceding the making up of the assessment, and the amount of the real and personal estate held by or for such company or corporation in said town, or in connection with the business done therein; and in the event of the neglect or refusal on the part of such agent, sub-agent or manager to furnish the required information to the assessors within ten days after such application therefor, the assessors shall rate and assess the said company or corporation according to the best of their judgment, and there shall be no appeal from such rate or assessment; but nothing herein shall be deemed to make such demand of a statement necessary in order to make such assessment. The manager of the branch of the appellant bank at Woodstock furnished to the assessors a statement of its personal property, as of December 31, 1921, from which I take the following figures:\nCash on hand \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$ 14,584 05\nOverdrafts and discounted bills \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n298,183 57\nStamped cheques \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n203 20\nFixtures \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n2,000 00\nTotal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$314,970 82\nDeposits by public \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n562,909 74\nExcess of liabilities over assets \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n$247,938 92\nThe assessors assessed the appellant upon real estate at the value of $5,700, as to which there is no dispute this being the appellant's own valuation. And they assessed the bank upon personal property at the value of $65,600. It is as to the latter assessment that complaint is made.\nNo one could state how the assessors arrived at this sum of $65,600 for personal property. It is not based upon the statement made by the manager of the branch, and the only defence offered is that according to this statement the personal property of the appellant's branch office at Woodstock should have been placed at a higher figure.\nThe recent decision of this court in Royal Bank v. Town of Glace Bay[8], is of no assistance here, except that it may be observed that there a general statute provided an easy means of establishing the amount of the personal property of a branch bank upon consideration of the amount of, its yearly income. Were such a rule applicable in the case of the town of Woodstock there would be no practical difficulty in determining the amount of the personal estate of the branch bank on a statement furnished by it of its income.\nThe statement in question, I think, could be of little or no assistance, except perhaps as to the item of fixtures, under the New Brunswick statute in so far as an assessment of personal property is concerned, for there was in this case no assessment of income. Were it to be used as a basis for assessment I would think, under the authority of The King v. Lovitt[9], that deposits made at the branch bank should be considered as a liability of that branch of the bank. Whether the amount deposited should be also considered as an asset would depend upon the circumstances.\nBut inasmuch as no justification is given for the assessment, at $65,600, of the appellant's personal property, I am forced to the conclusion that this assessment was arbitrarily made, without any consideration of the real value of the personal property of the branch office. This being so it obviously cannot stand.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout and set aside the assessment of the appellant in respect of its personal property.\nMalouin J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.

Kerr for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I can find no good reason for interfering with the judgment appealed from herein and am therefore of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant company carries on a business in Toronto, which includes a restaurant and what is called \u201can ice cream parlour and candy shop\u201d; and in its shop are sold, at retail only, sweets purchased in the ordinary course of business from manufacturers, and others made in the appellant company\u2019s own kitchen, which is the restaurant kitchen, the annual returns from the sale of sweets so made being above five per cent of the total receipts of the business. The question is whether the appellant company is subject to taxation by way of sales tax under section 19BBB of the Special War Revenue Act of 1915. In so far as relevant, the section is as follows:\u2014\n19BBB. (1) In addition to the present duties of customs and excise there shall be imposed, levied and collected an excise tax of one and one-half per cent on sales and deliveries by Canadian manufacturers or producers, and wholesalers or jobbers, and a tax of two and one half per cent on the duty paid value of goods imported, but in respect of sales by manufacturers to retailers or consumers. * * *\nIt is argued that \u201cmanufacturers\u201d in this context does not include manufacturers who sell exclusively to consumers, within which description the appellant company admittedly would be included. It is pointed out that retailers\u2014persons who sell by retail to consumers, who are neither wholesalers (that is to say, who do not sell to retailers) nor manufacturers\u2014do not fall within the incidence of the section. Sales by them are not within the scheme of taxation established. It is argued that such a scheme naturally excludes all sales by persons, whether manufacturers or not, who sell exclusively to consumers; and in support of the contention that the scheme of the Act excludes them, the appellant calls attention to the circumstance that, in case of sales coming within the ambit of the section, the seller is obliged to furnish the purchaser with what is called an \u201cinvoice\u201d; and moreover, that, having regard to the scale of the tax, it would be impossible, in the case of sales of sweets in small quantities to consumers, to collect the exact amount payable; and consequently that, in order to carry out the provisions of the Act, the seller in each case, if the Act applied to such sales, would be obliged to collect a sum greater than the tax.\nWithout denying the force of much of this argument, it does not, in my judgment, carry one to the point at which one is entitled to ascribe to the word \u201cmanufacturer\u201d a less limited meaning than that which it naturally and ordinarily bears. The rule for the construction of a taxing statute is most satisfactorily stated, I think, by Lord Cairns in Partington v. Attorney General[1]:\nI am not at all sure that, in a case of this kind\u2014a fiscal case\u2014form is not amply sufficient; because, as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: if the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible, in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nLord Cairns, of course, does not mean to say that in ascertaining \u201cthe letter of the law,\u201d you can ignore the context in which the words to be construed stand. What is meant is, that you are to give effect to the meaning of the language; you are not to assume:\nany governing purpose in the Act except to take such tax as the statute imposes\nas Lord Halsbury said in Tennant v. Smith[2]. Construed according to this rule the statute, I think, does not admit of the construction proposed by the appellant. In this view it is unnecessary to construe the provisions of the statute of 1922.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant seeks to be declared not liable for sales tax under the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, for the years 1921 and 1922 and to be relieved of penalties imposed upon it for non-compliance with that statute during those two years\u2014as to the earlier year on the ground that it was not a \u201cmanufacturer or producer\u201d within the meaning of section 19BBB (1) of the Special War Revenue Act, 1919, as re-enacted by section 1 of chapter 50 of The Dominion Statutes, 1921, and as to the later year on the ground that no tax is specified in section 19BBB (1) as again re-enacted in 1922 by section 13 of chapter 47 of the statute of that year, as payable on\nsales of goods manufactured for stock for merchants who sell exclusively by retail,\nthe classification within which it claims to fall.\nPrima facie the appellant is \u201ca Canadian manufacturer or producer\u201d of candies who sells them directly to consumers and is therefore liable under section 19BBB (1), as re-enacted in 1921, for an excise tax at the rate of three per cent on such sales. I cannot accede to Mr. Beament\u2019s ingenious argument that the natural meaning of the terms \u201cmanufacturers and producers\u201d is by the context restricted to persons who manufacture or produce for sale to persons who ordinarily purchase for re-sale, such as wholesalers, jobbers or retailers. The Act explicitly covers the case of the manufacturer or producer whose business in whole or in part is to sell directly to consumers, and I find nothing to justify excluding from its application a case so specifically dealt with.\nThe fact that the concluding clause of the proviso to the section, as re-enacted in 1922, appears to have been designed to fit precisely such a case as that of the appellant does not warrant taking out of the operation of section 19BBB (1), as re-enacted in 1921, a case which it appears plainly to include.\nI am also unable to assent to the contention that no tax is specified in section 19BBB (1), as re-enacted in 1922, as applicable to the merchant who sells exclusively to consumers but manufactures goods for stock which he thus disposes of. His sales are in the language of that section \u201csales by a manufacturer or producer to consumers\u201d and the section specifies for such sales an excise tax of four and one half per cent.\nNo other ground of appeal was urged. As both grounds taken fail, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Anglin.\nMALOUIN J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons assigned by the trial judge.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beament & Beament.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Charles W. Kerr.\n[1] L.R. 4 H.L. 100, at page 122.\n[2] [1892] A.C. 154.\n",

It was proved by the respondent that the stairway was, at the time of the accident and had been for a considerable time before, covered with ice and snow to such an extent that it was extremely dangerous for any person to use it. The respondent's wife had used these steps twice daily on six days of the week during that period and it was shown that there was a safer route of approach.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the danger being so obvious that, if actual knowledge of it should not be inferred, notice of its existence must be imputed to the injured person, and there was no duty owing to her in respect of it by the appellant company, and therefore no actionable breach of duty. Indermaur v. Dames (Q.R. 2 C.P. 311) discussed.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench, (Q.R. 36 K.B. 512) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Joseph Demers J., and maintaining the respondent's action in damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nForan K.C. and Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nForan K.C. and Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nForan K.C. and Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. The stairway is not upon the property of the appellant.\nThe evidence clearly established that, at the time of the accident, the stairway was in such an obviously dangerous condition that no one could have used it without being fully aware of the risk of so doing.\nFrom the evidence it is clear that the respondent's wife, from her almost daily use of the stairway, must have been fully cognizant of its dangerous condition; and it was incumbent upon her to use reasonable care for her own safety while upon the property.

Stanley[6]; 19 English Ruling Cases, 60.\nSinclair K.C. and Lemieux K.C. for the respondent. The case turns entirely and exclusively on questions of facts; and the evidence shows that the accident happened on appellant's property and that the latter is liable for the damages resulting therefrom.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondent to recover damages suffered by his wife in passing over a cement stairway, leading up to the appellant's station at Rockliffe, to take its car running into Ottawa, which was in such a condition at the top steps that she slipped and fell and suffered thereby very serious injuries, for which the learned trial judge entered judgment in his favour with damages assessed at $4,607.65, with interest and costs.\nFrom that judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) at Montreal, and that appeal was dismissed with costs. The respondent and his wife lived in Gatineau Point, in Quebec, and, having been domiciled and married there, he was, by the law of Quebec applicable to the circumstances, the party entitled to bring this action.\nNevertheless it is the law of Ontario, in which the accident happened, that must be rested upon to maintain the action.\nMrs. L\u00e9tang served as a charwoman in Ottawa almost daily, and her nearest way to her work was to cross from Gatineau Point to Rockliffe Park, and then ascend the hill on top of which the appellant's railway ran, and alongside of its track was situated the station at which she was accustomed to take the car to Ottawa.\nThe road ascending said hill is rather zig zag in its course, and has, I think it is said, no less than four stairways of which that now in question is the top one adjacent to the station.\nMrs. L\u00e9tang, on the occasion now in question, when she reached that top stair, was carrying no parcel and kept her left hand in touch with a railing on that side, so that it seemed to her, thus protected, and, as it happened, wearing a new pair of rubbers, that she could safely ascend that stairway, as she had done so many times, but, as already stated, when she reached the top step she slipped and fell.\nThere were, the learned trial judge finds, some seven hundred persons, or more, passing daily either up or down same road or stairway. I cannot, under such circumstances, attach any blame to the respondent's wife or see how she was not entitled to assume that the respective owners would do their duty.\nThe appellant denies any ownership or other right of control over said stairway and counsel for it before us seemed to rest chiefly on that objection. If well founded there could be no such action as this maintained.\nI cannot accede to such contention, for the evidence, as I read it and as the learned trial judge finds, clearly demonstrates that at least a number of the steps, nearest the top and on which the accident took place, were on part of the land owned by appellant and had been acquired for the purposes of its railway.\nThe said stairway seems never to have been cleared off, much less sprinkled with ashes or the like in winter, as would be the reasonable duty of appellant as owner. And it seeing the travellers' use thereof I cannot understand how such a situation was tolerated.\nI would gather from a mass of irrelevant evidence, which was allowed, that the stairs lower down were even worse looked after than the one in question, but the appellant was not the owner thereof, and hence that evidence has tended to produce an impression unfavourable to the respondent's case, as giving ground for suspecting that Mrs. L\u00e9tang was a reckless person who passed over a road she never should have entered upon.\nI cannot accept that theory or its foundation as having anything to do with this case.\nLet us confine our attention to the one stairway, and only the top part of that, in the last analysis, for evidently there was nothing to warn one not to ascend it.\nIndeed the appellant was in duty bound to have it fenced off at the true line, and not allow passengers to run into such a trap.\nThe freezing and thawing, at the end of February when this accident happened, produced a rather treacherous condition, such as Mrs. L\u00e9tang describes, and the trial judge finds, and which would not have existed if the appellant as owner had discharged its duty, as required by the law as laid down in the leading case of Indermaur v. Dames[7], and other cases cited by respondent's counsel.\nOf these Norman v. Great Western Ry. Co.[8], is useful as shewing, in the numerous authorities cited, where to find the law and many limitations thereof. Cox v. Coulson[9] for the like reasons.\nLondon, Tilbury & Southend Railway v. Paterson[10], presents an illustration akin to that presented herein. Whenever the principle in question has to be applied a fair measure of common sense has to be used for so many misleading words such as \"trap\" have had their day as if the entire limitations of the operation of the principle invoked, though used only in a metaphorical sense.\nIt is quite clear to me that, if we eliminate some cases wherein undue subtlety has been used, and the possibly exaggerated stories of the conditions existent elsewhere on the roadway or pathway leading up from the ferry, as above set forth, there is a clear case made by respondent.\nI therefore, am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The steps were obviously impracticable in the sense that they could not be used without risk of serious injury. There was another approach open apparently free from danger. In these circumstances, the principle of Indermaur v. Dames[11] is not applicable.\nAnglin J.\u2014No objection was taken in the pleadings and none would appear to have been made at the trial to the plaintiffs status to maintain this action to recover damages for physical injuries sustained by his wife. I am not disposed to entertain such an objection when first taken in appeal.\nThere is some evidence afforded by the plan attached to the deed by which the defendant company acquired their property in Rockliffe from the late Anne Keefer that the portion of the steps on which Madame L\u00e9tang slipped and fell was its property. The learned trial judge regarded that evidence as sufficient to warrant the finding of that fact in the plaintiff's favour. That finding has been affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. Meagre as the proof in support of it undoubtedly is, I am not prepared to say that these courts were both clearly wrong\u2014the one in making the other in affirming it.\nThe plaintiff abundantly proved that when his wife was injured the stairway in question was covered with ice and snow to such an extent that it was extremely dangerous for any person to attempt to use it. Indeed he proved more. Presumably in order to fix the defendant with notice of that state of affairs he established that it had existed for a considerable time before the accident. But Madame L\u00e9tang tells us that she had used these steps twice daily on six days of the week during that period. While she has not admitted her knowledge of the dangerous condition of the steps, neither has she denied such knowledge. The inference that she had it is almost irresistible. The danger was so obvious, according to the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses, that notice of it to any person taking reasonable care for his own safety in using the stairway is beyond question. Anybody ascending it for the first time would almost certainly have perceived, a person who had made daily use of it for many weeks must have been fully aware of, the danger. Another reasonably convenient mode of access was available and known to Madame L\u00e9tang.\nUnder these circumstances what duty did the appellant company owe to Madame L\u00e9tang? There was not a little discussion at bar as to whether she should be regarded as a mere licensee or as an \"invitee\" on the company's premises. I am by no means satisfied that, having regard to their manifestly neglected and dangerous state, the railway company can be treated as having invited intending passengers to approach its embarking platform by means of the steps Madame L\u00e9tang, used. I shall, however, assume her to have been entitled to the full benefit of the position of an \"invitee.\" What were her rights? What duty did the defendant owe her?\nAlthough the action was brought in Quebec, it is of course clear\u2014indeed it is common ground\u2014that these questions must be answered according to the law of Ontario where the accident happened. That law was settled nearly sixty years ago in the leading case of Indermaur v. Dames[12]. The following passage in the judgment of Willes J., speaking for the Court of Common Pleas, has become classic:\nThe class to which the customer belongs includes persons who go not as mere volunteers, or licensees, or guests, or servants, or persons whose employment is such that danger may be considered as bargained for, but who go upon business which concerns the occupier, and upon his invitation, express or implied. And, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on his part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger which he knows or ought to know.\nAs said by Lord Atkinson, referring to the principle of Indermaur v. Dames12, in Cavalier v. Pope[13]:\nOne of the essential facts necessary to bring a case within that principle is that the injured person must not have had knowledge or notice of the existence of the danger through which he has suffered. If he knows of the danger and runs the risk he has no cause of action. The duty of the \"invitor\" to the \"invitee\" is either to have the premises free from any concealed danger in the nature of a trap, or, if such a danger exists and he knows or should have known of it, to give clear and sufficient warning of it. Where the danger is obvious, as the evidence shows it to have been in the case at bar, it does not call for a warning and an essential condition of liability is lacking. As put by Atkin L.J. in Lucy v. Bowden[14]:\nIn such case the true maxim seems to be scienti non fit injuria.\nA person unnecessarily incurring an obvious danger can scarcely be said to be\nusing reasonable care on his own part for his own safety.\nHe might well be regarded as falling within the maxim volenti non fit injuria or as guilty of contributory negligence. Had either of those findings been made in the present case it would have been so abundantly justified that it could not be disturbed. But the true ground on which liability of the appellant must be negatived appears to be that, the danger being so obvious that, if actual knowledge of it should not be inferred, notice of its existence must be imputed to the injured person, there was no duty owing to her in respect of it by the appellant company, and therefore no actionable breach of duty.\nThe law bearing on this aspect of the case was fully discussed and the authorities reviewed by the House of Lords in the recent case of Fairman v. Perpetual Investment Building Society[15]. A case very closely in point is Brackley v. Midland Railway[16]. Indeed, upon the alternative ground on which the English Court of Appeal rested its judgment Brackley's Case (3) is indistinguishable in principle from the case at bar. If, as Lord Atkinson indicates in Cavalier v. Pope[17], the patent and obvious nature of the danger and continued familiarity with the surroundings by the injured person requiring an inference of his knowledged of its existence be fatal to the plaintiff equally with actual proof of such knowledge, the two decisions are indistinguishable in principle.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed and the action dismissed, with costs throughout\u2014if the appellant insists upon having them. Mignault J.\u2014On the evidence, I would not disturb the finding of the learned trial judge, concurred in by the Court of King's Bench, that the stairway where the respondent's wife fell and was injured was on the appellant's property.\nAlthough this action was taken in the province of Quebec, where the appellant has property, the accident happened in the province of Ontario, and the question whether the respondent had established a case of liability under the Ontario law was, before the courts below, a question to be determined on proof of that law. This court, however, takes judicial notice of the laws prevailing in all the provinces; John Morrow Screw and Nut Co. v. Hanken[18]; Logan v. Lee[19]; so it will not be necessary to refer to the expert evidence as to the Ontario law adduced at the trial.\nWhether or not the respondent's wife, when she fell, on the 18th of February, 1921, at about 8.30 a.m., while climbing the stairway, was an invitee or a mere licensee on the appellant's property, she was undoubtedly obliged to exercise reasonable care when passing over it, the more so as during that winter she had been daily crossing this property to reach the appellant's trolley cars and must be held to have been well acquainted with the condition of the stairs. She describes this condition as follows:\nQ. Pouvez-vous me dire comment cette glace \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e sur des marches de l'escalier; quelle sorte de glace est-ce que c'\u00e9tait; \u00e9tait-ce plat ou rond?\n3. C'\u00e9tait de la belle glace; ensuite il y avait comme des monceaux de glace; c'\u00e9tait tout comme raboteux; de la glace bien \u00e9paisse. La glace \u00e9tait ronde; les marches \u00e9taient arrondies par la glace.\nThe respondent's witnesses state that during all that winter the stairway was in a terrible condition, that on account of the slope of the hill water flowed over it and froze, that it was constantly covered with ice, that each step was \"un bourrelet de glace,\" a mound of ice.\nThis condition was of course perfectly visible and must have been known by the respondent's wife who passed over the property at least twice a day, for she lived at Gatineau Point and worked in Ottawa.\nThe plan filed as well as the testimony shew that at that place there is a road called the \"ferry road\" leading from the landing on the Ottawa river to the top of the hill. The respondent's wife knew of this road, for she says: Ils (les gens qui venaient de la Pointe Gatineau et qui allaient \u00e0 Ottawa pour prendre le tramway) ont toujours pass\u00e9 par les escaliers; tout le monde passait l\u00e0; les chevaux passaient dans le chemin.\nThere was therefore no necessity to take the stairway in its dangerous condition to reach the trolley cars. The road furnished an alternative mode of ascent.\nI think the respondent's wife must be held to have had full notice of the risk she assumed in using the stairway instead of the road as a means of reaching the street cars. There was here nothing of the nature of a trap but a very obvious danger which her familiarity with the place possibly led her to disregard, but which was not the less self evident. The accident happened in full daylight. Under the authorities, which are fully referred to in the judgment of my brother Anglin, the plaintiff cannot succeed.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action. The appellant is entitled to costs throughout if it cares to exact them from the respondent.\nMalouin J.\u2014Je partage la mani\u00e8re de voir du juge Anglin dans cette cause; et, pour les raisons qu'il donne, j'infirmerais le jugement dont est appel et je renverrais l'action de la demanderesse avec d\u00e9pens.\nSi cette cause avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en vertu de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion contraire, parce que je crois qu'il y a eu faute commune; mais, comme c'est la loi de l'Ontario que s'applique et que c'est la demanderesse elle-m\u00eame qui s'est charg\u00e9e d'en faire la preuve, il m'est impossible de maintenir son action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

They are also members of an association of a civil character called \"United Montreal Pilots.\"\nThe appellant is sued as a member of this association for the recovery of the sum of $2,400, which, according to respondents, he owes them pursuant to the terms of a contract passed before a notary in 1918. They allege that on the 27th of December, 1918, they entered into an agreement whereby for a period of twenty-five years they agreed to form an association with the view to further their common welfare and to divide their earnings equally among themselves after certain expenses and charges, which are also defined, have been paid.\nThey state that since the first of May, 1921, the appellant has neglected to pay over to the directors of the association, or its treasurer, the fees earned by him as pilotage due, contrary to the terms of the agreement. They also allege that, notwithstanding his default, respondents have offered to the appellant his share of the moneys distributed according to the contract. Appellant does not deny these facts but contends that the contract entered into by respondents and himself is null and void inasmuch as it is contrary to law and to public order and moreover that it is inconsistent with the by-laws of the Department of Marine.\nBond K.C. and L. Beauregard for the appellant. A pilot is a public official; and a contract between the pilots, agreeing to pool their fees to be received as such public officials, is illegal and contrary to public order. La Corporation des Pilots de Qu\u00e9bec v. Paquet[1]; R\u00e9millard v. Trudelle[2]; Powell v. The King[3].\nGeoffrion K.C. and L. Gu\u00e9rin for the respondents. The agreement rests on the principle of liberty of covenants. The pilots had the right to bind themselves and they are bound by the conditions of the contract.\nBond K.C. and L. Beauregard for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. and L. Gu\u00e9rin for the respondents.\nIdington J.\u2014I cannot see that the parties hereto, because of being licensed as pilots, can be held to be such public officers as to bar their right to pool their receipts from fees got for service.\nI should be glad if I could see otherwise for the appellant seems to have been rather improvident in joining.\nIt can easily be rectified if the Government is satisfied, as appellant's counsel contends is the fact, that pooling receipts tends to impair efficiency of the service, and sees fit to shape its regulations so as to prevent its continuance. Meantime I cannot say as matter of law that the system so operates.\nI conclude that in my opinion this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The question is a difficult one, but on the whole I think the agreement in question is not within the principle which withholds from assignments of the salaries of public officers recognition and the assistance of the law.\nHere it is questionable, to say the least, whether the assignors are public officers within the scope of the principle; and, moreover, the object of the agreement is to provide for the whole body of pilots greater pecuniary security. That such an agreement would, in fact be detrimental to the public service seems to me very debatable, and I know of no established legal doctrine which requires me to say that it is.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I would affirm the judgment of the Court of King's Bench for the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Dorion.\nMignault J.\u2014Je ne vois rien de contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public dans la convention entre plusieurs personnes exer\u00e7ant la m\u00eame profession ou la m\u00eame industrie de s'associer et de mettre dans un fonds commun tous leurs gains, lequel fonds sera divis\u00e9 entre tous les membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la proportion convenue entre eux. L'association \"United Montreal Pilots,\" dans laquelle l'appelant a consenti \u00e0 s'enr\u00f4ler, est une association de ce genre qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 librement form\u00e9e pour l'avantage mutuel des associ\u00e9s. Cette association doit durer vingt-cinq ans, et l'appelant, avant l'expiration de ce terme, refuse d'apporter ses gains \u00e0 la mise commune, sous pr\u00e9texte que l'association est ill\u00e9gale et contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public.\nLes soci\u00e9t\u00e9s universelles de tous gains ne sont pas inconnues dans le droit civil, ainsi qu'en fait foi l'article 1858 du code civil. Celui qui y entre librement doit en observer les conditions tant que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dure. Les pilotes qui ont form\u00e9 cette association sont tous des pilotes licenci\u00e9s pour le district de pilotage de Montr\u00e9al, et l'ordre public, mot dont on abuse parfois, n'est nullement troubl\u00e9 par la convention qu'ils ont faite de mettre leurs gains en commun pour leur b\u00e9n\u00e9fice mutuel.\nL'appelant trouve qu'il gagnerait plus d'argent s'il pouvait conserver ses gains, au lieu de se contenter de la part qui lui est attribu\u00e9e par le pacte social. C'est bien possible, mais alors il n'aurait pas d\u00fb s'enr\u00f4ler dans cette association. Tant qu'elle existera et qu'il n'aura pas de raison valable de s'en retirer, il devra respecter la convention qu'il a faite avec ses co-associ\u00e9s. Sa pr\u00e9tention qu'il est une sorte d'officier public et que pour ce motif il ne peut s'associer avec ses confr\u00e8res, est d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de fondement.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Malouin J.\u2014Je suis d'opinion que les pilotes ne sont pas des officiers publics. Je renverrais le pr\u00e9sent appel avec d\u00e9pens pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par la cour du Banc du Roi, juridiction d'appel.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Atwater, Bond & Beauregard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\n[1] [1917] Q.R. 53 S.C. 220, at p. 222; 54 D.L.R. 323.\n[2] [1889] 15 Q.L.R. 328.\n[3] [1905] 9 Ex.

An abandonment preceding such judgment is insufficient to relieve the surety.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J., and dismissing the appellant's action.\nBy his action, the appellant claimed from the respondents the sum of $4,964.34. On the 13th of March, 1919, one Edouard Thibodeau, the late husband of the appellant, sued one J. A. Champoux for $4,232.38 and interest at 6 per cent per annum from the date of the action. That action was accompanied with a writ of capias ad respondendum. The said J. A. Champoux was arrested on that capias on the 13th of March, 1919. On the same day he was released upon the security given under article 913 C.C.P. by the respondents. Judgment was rendered in the case of Edouard Thibodeau vs. J. A. Champoux on the 9th of June, 1920; the capias was maintained and the defendant was condemned to pay to the appellant herein, in her quality of plaintiff by reprise d'instance, the sum of $4,232.38 with interest at 6 per cent from the 13th of March, 1919, and costs. The interest amounted to $354.76 and the costs to $327.20. The total indebtedness of the said J. A. Champoux to the appellant was accordingly $4,964.34. By her action appellant claims from the respondents jointly and severally the said sum of $4,964.34, contending that the amount is due to her by the respondents in virtue of the bail bond inasmuch as the defendant J. A. Champoux did not make an assignment within thirty days from the date of the judgment maintaining the capias, nor at any time thereafter. By his plea respondent Josaphat Duval denied the indebtedness. He acknowledged having signed the bail bond upon which the appellant rests her action, but he stated that this bail bond was illegal and null. The respondent Duval pleaded in particular that he was never made aware of the amount of the appellant's claim against J. A. Champoux, and that, as a result, he never could give a valid consent concerning the said bail bond. Moreover, the respondent Duval invoked the assignment made by J. A. Champoux on the 2nd of March, 1920, subsequent to his arrest, the fact that this assignment was made known to the appellant and the appointment, on the 10th of March, 1920, of a curator who was then proceeding to liquidate the goods and effects assigned by the said J. A. Champoux. The respondent Duval further pleaded that neither the curator nor the appellant had contested, within the legal delays, the right of the said J. A. Champoux to make an assignment of his property, nor the debtor's statement, and that the defendant J. A. Champoux had not, since the judgment of the 9th of June, 1920, acquired any property subject to an assignment. By her answer and the particulars in connection therewith, the appellant denied the validity of the assignment made by the said J. A. Champoux. According to her, this assignment was made at the request of J. A. Champoux's brother, who was holder of a cheque for $250 given to him without any consideration. J. A. Champoux was not a trader. (Article 853 C.C.P.) The appellant stated, moreover, that the said J. A. Champoux had not abandoned all his property, and, in the particulars of her answer to plea, she pointed out divers so-called cases of secretion. Furthermore, the appellant raised the question that by the bail bond the respondent Duval had undertaken to pay the amount of the judgment rendered against the said J. A. Champoux in capital, interest and costs, should the said J. A. Champoux fail to make an assignment of his property within thirty days following the judgment maintaining the capias. According to the appellant's contentions, this obligation was not fulfilled by the abandonment made by the said J. A. Champoux before such judgment; and the reason of this would be that the appellant, in the case of an abandonment made after the judgment maintaining the capias, could invoke, under the provisions of article 930 C.C.P., all the acts of secretion anterior to the capias, whilst in the case of an abandonment made before judgment, the appellant could only rely on the acts of secretion committed in the year preceding the filing of the statement.\nLafleur K.C. and Lamothe K.C. for the appellant.\nSt Jacques K.C. and Duranleau K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal arising out of an action against the respondents upon a bail bond given by them as sureties for one J. A. Champoux, who had been arrested under a writ of capias ad respondendum, and turns upon the interpretation and construction to be given article 913 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action with costs. From that judgment the present appellant appealed to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) and said appeal was heard by five judges of that court and dismissed with costs.\nThey were all, with one exception, agreed upon such decision.\nThe Chief Justice Lafontaine and Mr. Justice Rivard wrote at some length. Mr. Justice Dorion briefly referred to his reasons given in the case of Champoux v. Raymond, and Mr. Justice Howard concurred with Mr. Justice Rivard, and all were agreed in said dismissal.\nMr. Justice Tellier, the dissenting judge, wrote at some length. Their views I have carefully considered, as well as the respective arguments presented at the hearing hereof, and the voluminous factums presented respectively on behalf of appellant, and respondent Duval, and one more briefly presenting the case on behalf of respondent Champoux.\nThe fact that it is a test case of seven arising out of similar writs of capias ad respondendum renders it rather important. And I am, as the result of much reading of evidence and argument, deeply impressed with the fact that, if the statute in question must be construed as the counsel for the appellant contends, a grave injustice will, under the circumstances, be done the respondents, who acting, so far as I can see, in good faith, brought about an abandonment by the debtor, after his arrest, of all his properties as completely as could have been done had he waited the trial of the case and then done so, as is now urged was the only time it could.\nThe appellant insinuates bad faith on the part of one of respondents, but I am inclined to submit that, possibly anticipating the debtor and his sureties would rest content with the view of the law since taken, and thus fall down if another view should ultimately prevail, the appellant kept quiet.\nI agree with the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge and the majority in the Court of King's Bench, and would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The words of article 913 C.C.P., read literally, import an abandonment after the judgment maintaining the capias, and the terms of Art. 930 C.C.P. support very definitely the contention that it is such an abandonment which is contemplated.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Tellier in his dissenting judgment the abandonment made on the 2nd of March, 1920, could not include any property which the assignor. Champoux, might have acquired between that date and the 9th of June, 1920, when judgment maintaining the capias on which he had been arrested was pronounced. It has not been shown that no property had been acquired' by him during that period.\nMoreover, an important right of the creditor, who, as in the present case, has had a capias maintained because of his debtor's secretion of property, is that given him by Art. 930 C.C.P. of contesting any abandonment made by the debtor to satisfy the condition of a bond given for his release pursuant to Art. 913 C.C.P. on the ground that such abandonment does not include property for the secretion of which the capias has been so maintained. The duration of capias proceedings may be prolonged and it may sometimes happen that in respect of an abandonment made during their pendency under Art. 853 (1) C.C.P. the creditor could never exercise his right under Art. 930 C.C.P. That right arises only when judgment maintaining the capias has been pronounced. That judgment may not be rendered within six months of the date on which the curator's advertisement of the abandonment has appeared in the Official Gazette. For default of contestation, the abandonment may in the interval have become absolute under Arts. 886, 887 and 889 C.C.P.\nThe combined operation of the several provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure to which I have alluded seems to make it clear that the provision of Art. 913 C.C.P., that, in order to relieve the sureties from the conditional obligation they are required to assume to answer for the debt in respect of which the capias issued, the debtor must make an abandonment within thirty day's after the rendering of judgment maintaining the capias, was advisedly so made and is not, and was not meant to be, satisfied by an abandonment preceding the rendering of that judgment. The bond given by the respondents explicitly requires an abandonment in the terms prescribed. It was not made. In the particular case now before us no substantial wrong may have resulted. It may be that the debtor had acquired no property in the interval between the abandonment and the judgment: it may be that the abandonment includes all the secreted properties, although this seems scarcely possible in regard to moneys found to have been paid in fraudulent preference; it may be that an omission in either of these particulars would not render an abandonment made within the prescribed thirty day period insufficient quoad the sureties; it may be that the creditor was in a position to exercise the rights conferred by Art. 930 C.C.P. to the fullest extent. Nevertheless the condition prescribed by Art. 913 C.C.P. for the release of the sureties has not been fulfilled according to its terms. In some other case its non-fulfillment might be of real importance. The question before us is not whether in the present instance the creditor has been actually prejudiced. It is simply the proper construction of the bond actually given and of Art. 913 C.C.P. Has the condition upon which the sureties are to be relieved from their obligation to pay the creditor's debt been satisfied? Would an abandonment made after the debtor's arrest under a capias and before the judgment maintaining it always fulfil the condition of the bond prescribed by Art. 913 C.C.P.? In my opinion these questions must be answered adversely to the respondents. The condition of their bond has not been fulfilled and their obligation to pay under it has become absolute.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and judgment entered against the respondents for the amount claimed.\nMignault J.\u2014Les intim\u00e9s se sont port\u00e9s cautions pour le nomm\u00e9 J.

Champoux n'a pas, dans les trente jours de la prononciation de ce jugement, fait cession de ses biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers, et l'appelante demande maintenant que ses cautions, les intim\u00e9s, soient condamn\u00e9es conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 lui payer sa dette en principal, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais, soit $4,964.34, avec contrainte par corps \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement.\nLes intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que le 2 mars 1920, J. A. Champoux a fait cession de ses biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers \u00e0 la demande de J. W. Champoux; que cette cession n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9lais; qu'il n'appert pas que J. A. Champoux ait depuis acquis d'autres biens; et que cette cession de biens \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 toutes fins de droit \u00e0 celle qu'aurait pu faire le dit Champoux dans les trente jours du jugement maintenant le capias.\nL'action de l'appelante fut renvoy\u00e9e par la cour sup\u00e9rieure (Surveyer J.) dont le jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc du Roi, le juge Tellier dissident. De l\u00e0 l'appel \u00e0 cette cour.\nLes motifs suivants du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9sument suffisamment les moyens de droit qu'invoquent les intim\u00e9s devant cette cour:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le but du capias ad respondendum \u00e9tant d'obtenir, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut du paiement de la dette, l'a cession de biens du d\u00e9biteur, ce but se trouve atteint par toute cession de biens, qu'elle soit ant\u00e9rieure ou post\u00e9rieure au jugement d\u00e9clarant le capias bien fond\u00e9;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le terme de trente jours mentionn\u00e9 dans l'article 913 C.P.C. est, comme tout terme, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 en faveur du d\u00e9biteur (art. 1091 C.C.) lequel peut toujours y renoncer; que non seulement il ne r\u00e9sulte pas des circonstances que ce terme ait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu en faveur du cr\u00e9ancier; mais que l'article 926 C.P.C. suppose le contraire puisqu'il dit que le d\u00e9biteur peut, en tout temps, c'est-\u00e0-dire m\u00eame apr\u00e8s les trente jours, faire cession) de ses biens, sauf la responsabilit\u00e9 encourue par les cautions, ce qui serait absurde si toute cession de biens autre que celle faite dans les trente jours du jugement maintenant le capias rendait les cautions irr\u00e9vocablement d\u00e9bitrices du cr\u00e9ancier demandeur;\nJe crois qu'en cette mati\u00e8re il vaut mieux se rattacher strictement aux textes ainsi qu'aux termes m\u00eames du cautionnement fourni par les intim\u00e9s.\nLe code de proc\u00e9dure civile mentionne plusieurs cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur peut, et doit m\u00eame quelquefois, faire cession de ses biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers.\nAinsi le d\u00e9biteur est sous le coup d'un jugement ordonnant la contrainte par corps. Il peut, dans ce cas, obtenir sa lib\u00e9ration, entre autres cas, par la cession de biens (art. 846, parag. 5). Cette cession de biens est r\u00e9gie par les r\u00e8gles contenues dans les articles 854 \u00e0 892 inclusivement (art. 849).\nLe d\u00e9biteur est arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur capias ad respondendum, ou bien il est un commer\u00e7ant qui a cess\u00e9 ses paiement et il est requis de faire cession de ses biens par un cr\u00e9ancier dont la cr\u00e9ance n'est pas garantie pour une somme de $200 ou plus (art. 853).\nDans le cas du d\u00e9biteur arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur capias ad respondendum et contre lequel le capias a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu, ce d\u00e9biteur peut aussi faire cession de ses biens (art. 926), et cette cession de biens \u00e0 la suite d'un capias est r\u00e9gie par les r\u00e8gles contenues dans les articles 854 \u00e0 892 inclusivement (art. 927).\nDans tous les cas, il s'agit de l\u00e0 m\u00eame cession de biens, comme le montre le renvoi aux articles 854 \u00e0 892 inclusivement. Ajoutons que le d\u00e9biteur qui fait cession de ses biens d\u00e9pose au greffe son bilan, c'est-\u00e0-dire une liste de ses biens et de ses cr\u00e9anciers avec le montant de leurs cr\u00e9ances. Ce bilan peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 par ses cr\u00e9anciers ou l'un d'eux, ou par le curateur \u00e0 le cession de biens autoris\u00e9 par les inspecteurs, \u00e0 raison de l'omission frauduleuse de la mention de biens de la valeur de $100, ou de fausses repr\u00e9sentations dans le bilan relativement au nombre de ses cr\u00e9anciers ou \u00e0 la nature ou au montant de leurs cr\u00e9ances, ou de rec\u00e9l\u00e9 par le d\u00e9biteur dans l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant imm\u00e9diatement le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du bilan, ou depuis, de quelque partie de ses biens, dans la vue de frauder ses cr\u00e9anciers (art. 885).\nLe d\u00e9lai pour contester le bilan est de quatre mois \u00e0 compter de l'insertion dans la Gazette Officielle de l'avis de la nomination du curateur (art. 886).\nSi le contestant \u00e9tablit quelqu'une des offenses mentionn\u00e9es en l'article 885, le juge peut condamner le d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 \u00eatre emprisonn\u00e9 pour un terme n'exc\u00e9dant pas un an (art. 888).\nJe cite l'article 889 qui s'explique quant au d\u00e9faut de contestation du bilan et quant au d\u00e9faut de preuve des all\u00e9gations du contestant:\nSi le bilan n'est pas contest\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9lais voulus, ou si la contestation n'est pas prouv\u00e9e dans ces d\u00e9lais, le juge peut ordonner la lib\u00e9ration du d\u00e9biteur, et ce dernier est exempt d'arrestation ou d'emprisonnement \u00e0 raison d'une cause d'action ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la production du bilan, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur capias ou qu'il ne soit d\u00e9tenu et emprisonn\u00e9 pour quelque dette de la nature de celles indiqu\u00e9es dans les articles 833 et 834; et, au cas de cet emprisonnement ou arrestation, il peut obtenir du juge sa mise en libert\u00e9 sur requ\u00eate et preuve suffisante.\nRevenons maintenant au cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9biteur arr\u00eat\u00e9 sous capias a donn\u00e9 le cautionnement requis par l'article 913, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans l'esp\u00e8ce, et demandons-nous si la cession de biens faite par J. A. Champoux, le 2 mars 1920, r\u00e9pond aux exigences du cautionnement fourni par les intim\u00e9s.\nJ'ai dit que dans cette mati\u00e8re il vaut mieux s'en tenir aux textes. Or \u00e0 mes yeux il y a un texte absolument d\u00e9cisif. C'est celui de l'article 926 qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\nSauf la responsabilit\u00e9 encourue par les cautions lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas fait cession de ses biens dans les trente jours du jugement maintenant le capias, le d\u00e9biteur peut en tout temps faire cession de ses biens.\nDonc la responsabilit\u00e9 des cautions est encourue lorsque le d\u00e9biteur n'a pas fait cession de ses biens dans les trente jours du jugement maintenant le capias. Ce sont d'ailleurs les termes m\u00eames du cautionnement. Cela ne veut pas dire qu'apr\u00e8s l'expiration des trente jours le d\u00e9biteur ne peut pas faire cession de ses biens\u2014sauf \u00e0 \u00eatre puni de son recel comme le dit l'article 930\u2014mais cette cession tardive n'emp\u00eache pas que la responsabilit\u00e9 des cautions ne soit encourue par le d\u00e9faut de cession dans les trente jours. L'obligation de la caution est peut-\u00eatre plus rigoureuse que celle du d\u00e9biteur, contrairement \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'article 1933 du code civil, mais c'est la loi qui le veut ainsi, et le l\u00e9gislateur pouvait bien admettre une exception \u00e0 l'article 1933.\nS'il en est ainsi, comment peut-on dire qu'une cession de biens ant\u00e9rieure au maintien du capias, surtout une cession qui n'est pas faite dans la cause o\u00f9 le capias est \u00e9man\u00e9, emp\u00eache que les cautions soient responsables suivant les termes de leur cautionnement?\nOn dit que le d\u00e9biteur ne peut c\u00e9der que ce qu'il poss\u00e8de, que la cession de biens le d\u00e9pouille de la possession de ses biens saisissables (art. 863), que c'est le curateur \u00e0 la cession de biens qui en a d\u00e9sormais possession (art. 870), et que le d\u00e9biteur, s'il est un commer\u00e7ant ayant cess\u00e9 ses paiements, ne peut refuser de faire cession de ses biens lorsqu'il en est requis par un cr\u00e9ancier dont la cr\u00e9ance est de $200 ou plus.\nJ. A. Champoux prend la qualit\u00e9 d'agent d'immeubles et il ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commer\u00e7ant. Il a c\u00e9d\u00e9 ses biens \u00e0 la demande de son fr\u00e8re, J. W. Champoux, Tun des intim\u00e9s, qui pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre cr\u00e9ancier en vertu d'un ch\u00e8que de $250 que le d\u00e9fendeur lui aurait donn\u00e9 quelques jours avant la demande de cession. Tout cela me para\u00eet assez suspect.\nMais ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait cession de ses biens, Champoux pouvait-il faire une nouvelle cession apr\u00e8s le maintien du capias? Il pouvait certainement faire une cession de biens suppl\u00e9mentaire qui aurait compris tout bien qu'il aurait pu acqu\u00e9rir depuis la premi\u00e8re cession, et s'il n'en avait pas acquis, il pouvait faire une d\u00e9claration au greffe qu'il avait c\u00e9d\u00e9 tous ses biens le 2 mars pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et qu'il n'avait plus rien \u00e0 c\u00e9der. L'intention du l\u00e9gislateur quant au d\u00e9biteur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, car le but de ces proc\u00e9dures rigoureuses est de forcer le d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 mettre tous ses biens saisissables sous la main de la justice. Il est loin d'\u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le terme de trente jours est fix\u00e9 en faveur du d\u00e9biteur. Je crois plut\u00f4t qu'il est stipul\u00e9 dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du cr\u00e9ancier poursuivant le capias, et c'est ce qui me para\u00eet r\u00e9sulter des articles que j'ai cit\u00e9s.\nCependant il s'agit ici non du d\u00e9biteur mais des cautions, et l'obligation de celles-ci de conditionnelle qu'elle \u00e9tait d'abord devient absolue lorsque la cession n'est pas faite dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 tant par la loi que par le cautionnement. Dura lex, peut-\u00eatre, sed lex.\nLa question n'est pas absolument nouvelle, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue dans le m\u00eame sens par la cour d'appel dans la cause de Keating v. Burrows[1], o\u00f9 il s'agissait d'une cession de biens faite deux jours avant la pr\u00e9sentation d'une requ\u00eate pour contrainte par corps. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette cession de biens ne suffisait pas pour lib\u00e9rer le d\u00e9biteur de la contrainte.\nOn peut invoquer une autre raison. Le but du capias est de forcer le d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 ne pas quitter les limites des provinces de Qu\u00e9bec et Ontario (l'ancienne province du Canada) et de l'emp\u00eacher de soustraire ses biens aux poursuites de ses cr\u00e9anciers en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et du demandeur en particulier (art. 895). Lorsque le capias est maintenu, on peut faire ordonner au d\u00e9biteur de se remettre entre les mains du sh\u00e9rif, ou en d'autres termes on peut faire prononcer son incarc\u00e9ration pour un temps ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, cette ordonnance n'\u00e9tant ex\u00e9cutoire que trente jours apr\u00e8s sa prononciation (art. 925). Cependant le d\u00e9biteur peut en tout temps, apr\u00e8s le jugement maintenant le capias, faire cession de ses biens mais ses cautions sont responsables s'il ne fait pas cette cession dans les trente jours (art. 926). La cession de biens se fait par la production de la d\u00e9claration et du bilan au greffe de la cour sup\u00e9rieure pour le district o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis le capias (art. 928). Ce bilan peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 \u00e0 raison du recel qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le capias et qui en a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le maintien, \u00e0 moins que les objets rec\u00e9l\u00e9s ne soient compris dans le bilan, et s'il est \u00e9tabli que ces effets n'y ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 compris, le d\u00e9biteur est passible de la peine \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 888 (art. 930). Etant donn\u00e9es ces dispositions claires et pr\u00e9cises, comment peut-on soutenir qu'une cession de biens faite \u00e0 la demande d'un cr\u00e9ancier avant le maintien du capias satisfait aux exigences de la loi, alors surtout que la contestation du bilan ne peut dans ce cas se plaindre d'un recel commis plus d'un an avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du bilan, malgr\u00e9 que ce recel ait pu, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce, donner lieu au capias? Je ne vois qu'une r\u00e9ponse possible, et c'est que les intim\u00e9s ne peuvent se baser sur la cession de biens qu'ils invoquent pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 qu'ils ont encourue. Si cette solution est dure pour eux, elle est certainement voulue par la loi que le l\u00e9gislateur, \u00e0 dessein, a rendue tr\u00e8s rigoureuse.\nIl est peut-\u00eatre temps que les personnes qui se portent cautions dans des proc\u00e9dures de ce genre se rendent bien compte des obligations qu'elles assument.\nIl y a d'autres objections des intim\u00e9s, telles que le d\u00e9faut de mention dans le cautionnement du montant cautionn\u00e9 et le d\u00e9faut de signification aux cautions du jugement maintenant le capias, que je n'ai pas besoin de discuter, car elles sont manifestement mal fond\u00e9es. Les jugements dont on appelle n'en ont pas tenu compte.\nJe suis d'avis de maintenir l'appel avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours et de donner jugement \u00e0 l'appelante pour la somme qu'elle r\u00e9clame, $4,964.34 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat. Malouin J.\u2014Un nomm\u00e9 J. A. Champoux a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur capias \u00e0 la demande du mari de la demanderesse qu'elle repr\u00e9sente par reprise d'instance.\nLe 13 mars 1919, les d\u00e9fendeurs se sont port\u00e9s cautions du dit Champoux, et par leur cautionnement se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 payer aux demandeurs le montant du jugement auquel s'\u00e9l\u00e8veront les frais et les int\u00e9r\u00eats, si dans les trente jours de la prononciation du jugement maintenant le capias le d\u00e9fendeur ne fait pas la cession de ses biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers.\nLe 9 juin 1920, jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure maintenant le capias et condamnant J. A. Champoux \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la demanderesse la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais.\nAnt\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la prononciation du jugement, \u00e0 savoir, le deuxi\u00e8me jour de mars 1920, J. A. Champoux a fait cession de ses biens \u00e0 la demande de son fr\u00e8re et cette cession a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 la connaissance de la demanderesse.\nLa demanderesse, par la pr\u00e9sente action, r\u00e9clame des cautions de J. A. Champoux le capital, les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les frais auxquels ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9, all\u00e9guant que le dit Champoux n'a pas fait cession de ses biens pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses cr\u00e9anciers dans les trente jours de la prononciation du jugement.\nLa question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est celle de savoir si la cession qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par J. A. Champoux le deuxi\u00e8me jour de mars \u00e9tait suffisante pour lib\u00e9rer les cautions ou s'il devait faire une cession suppl\u00e9mentaire des biens qu'il aurait pu acqu\u00e9rir \u00e0 compter de la premi\u00e8re cession, c'est-\u00e0-dire du deuxi\u00e8me jour de mars 1920.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont jug\u00e9 que cette cession \u00e9tait suffisante pour lib\u00e9rer les cautions, le juge Tellier \u00e9tant d'opinion contraire.\nIl est certain que la cession faite le 2 mars 1920 doit b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e0 la demanderesse comme aux autres cr\u00e9anciers; mais il s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 quatre mois entre la date de la cession et la prononciation du jugement, intervalle pendant lequel Champoux a pu acqu\u00e9rir d'autres biens.\nL'article 873 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile \u00e9dicte ce qui suit: Si apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du bilan et avant que le curateur ait rendu un compte d\u00e9finitif, le d\u00e9biteur acquiert d'autres biens, il peut \u00eatre requis par une nouvelle demande d'en faire cession.\nCette demande peut \u00eatre faite par le curateur, du consentement des inspecteurs, ou par un cr\u00e9ancier habile \u00e0 faire une demande de cession.\nNotons que la cession du 2 mars ne comprend pas les biens acquis subs\u00e9quemment et que si le d\u00e9biteur en acquiert il faut lui faire une nouvelle demande de cession pour qu'il les c\u00e8de.\nL'article 873 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile pr\u00e9voit cette possibilit\u00e9 puisqu'il autorise le curateur \u00e0 faire cette demande avec le consentement des inspecteurs.\nLa cession du 2 mars est valide mais incompl\u00e8te \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la demanderesse en ce qu'elle ne comprend pas les biens que Champoux aurait pu acqu\u00e9rir entre la date de la cession et celle du jugement du 9 juin. Le d\u00e9biteur devait donc en faire une nouvelle pour se conformer au cautionnement qu'il a donn\u00e9; n'ayant pas fait une nouvelle cession, il ne s'est pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la condition du cautionnement et les cautions doivent payer.\nAssur\u00e9ment le jugement qui a maintenu le capias a pour effet d'obliger le d\u00e9biteur \u00e0 faire une nouvelle cession, tout comme l'aurait oblig\u00e9 une nouvelle demande faite en vertu de l'article 873 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, ou bien de faire dans les trente jours du jugement une d\u00e9claration qu'il n'a acquis aucuns biens depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son bilan.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs dans leurs plaidoyers all\u00e8guent que Champoux n'a pas acquis de biens apr\u00e8s sa cession; mais ils ne l'ont pas prouv\u00e9. Il est vrai que la demanderesse dans sa r\u00e9ponse au plaidoyer all\u00e8gue aussi ce fait; mais je suis d'opinion que c'\u00e9tait aux d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e0 faire cette preuve parce qu'il leur incombait de d\u00e9montrer qu'une seconde cession n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. N\u00e9anmoins cette preuve, \u00e0 mon avis, n'aurait pas eu pour effet de faire \u00e9chapper les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e0 une condamnation, car d\u00e8s l'instant de l'expiration des trente jours accord\u00e9s pour faire cession, les d\u00e9fendeurs sont devenus irr\u00e9vocablement d\u00e9biteurs de la cr\u00e9ance de la demanderesse.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'opinion que le d\u00e9biteur Champoux aurait d\u00fb faire une nouvelle cession de biens dans les trente jours de la prononciation du jugement du 9 juin 1920 ou une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l'effet qu'il n'avait acquis aucuns biens depuis sa premi\u00e8re cession.\nPour ces raisonns et celles donn\u00e9es par les juges Anglin et Mignault, dans lesquelles je concours, je maintiendrais l'appel et accorderais jugement \u00e0 l'appelante pour la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appelant: Lamothe, Gadbois & Charbonneau.\nSolicitors for the respondent Champoux: St-Jacques, Filion, Houle & Lamothe.\nSolicitors for the respondent Duval: Monty, Durauleau, Ross & Angers.\n[1] Q.R. 8 Q.B. 1.\n",

Chase, [1924] S.C.R. 495\nDate: 1924-06-18\nSamuel Thomas Starr (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHoward B. Chase and Another (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1924: March 21, 4, 25; 1924: June 18.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Mignault and Malouin JJ. (Chief Justice Davies was present at the hearing but died before judgment was given.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nTrade Union\u2014Provisions of constitution\u2014Unlawful purposes\u2014Restraint of trade\u2014Protection of property\u2014Resort to courts\u2014Necessity to plead illegality.\nThe secretary-treasurer of an unregistered trade union was removed from office but declined to hand over to his successor a fund which he held for payment of certain expenses and salaries. In an action on behalf of the union for the amount:\u2014\nHeld, per Duff and Malouin JJ., Idington J. contra and Mignault J. expressing no opinion, that though some of the purposes of the union may be illegal as being in restraint of trade the union is not thereby deprived of its right to hold a beneficial interest in the fund and to invoke the aid of the courts for its protection.\nPer Mignault J. In the absence of a plea raising the defence that the union is an illegal association and the necessary proof to support it such defence should not be considered.\nPer Duff J. Illegality was not pleaded and the claim cannot be rejected on that ground unless it has before it all the matter germane to the question so that it can see that some purposes are illegal in the sense that the law will not aid them and are so interwoven with the others that the legal and illegal parts cannot be separated. But the constitution and rules of the union do not show that any of its purposes are in unreasonable restraint of trade or, if any are, the whole constitution is not thereby affected with illegality.\nOne section of the constitution provides for expulsion of any member who takes the place of a striker.\nHeld, per Duff J. that this cannot be pronounced oppression or unreasonable without hearing such explanations as might have been given if (illegality had been pleaded.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (33 Man. R. 233) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the appellant.\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is a voluntary association not registered under the Trades Union Act of Canada. The appellant Starr was secretary-treasurer of that part of the system which was formerly the Canadian Northern Railway and on being removed from office refused to hand over funds alleged to be in his hands to his successor and this action was brought on behalf of the Brotherhood for the amount.\nThe constitution and rules of the Brotherhood authorize the calling of strikes on the system, the expulsion of members who take the places of strikers and forbid individual members to make agreements directly with their employers. The defence raised on the trial was that the action did not lie as the Brotherhood was an illegal association, some of its purposes being in restraint of trade, and at the trial the action was dismissed on this ground. This defence of illegality was not pleaded and the trial judge ruled that an amendment adding such plea was not necessary. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment pronounced at the trial.\nThe material portions of the constitution of the Brotherhood are set out in the reasons for his judgment given by Mr. Justice Duff and published herewith.\nBonnar K.C. and McArthur for the appellant. Where, as here, on the material before the court illegality is shown the action must fail. North Western Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[3]; Lipton v. Powell[4].\nThe Trade Unions Act of Canada does not apply to unregistered societies (sec. 5). Therefore sec. 32 of that Act does not help the respondent nor do sections 496-7 of the Criminal Code. See Russell v. Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners[5].\nThe purposes of the Brotherhood were in unreasonable restraint of trade. See Hilton v. Eckersley[6]; Horniby v. Close[7]; Rigby v. Connol[8].\nDavid Campbell K.C. and Congdon K.C. for the respondents. Illegality should have been pleaded and evidence given not only as to restraint of trade but that such restraint was unreasonable; Odgers on Pleading (7 ed.) page 220; Connolly v. Consumers Cordage Co.[9]; Northwestern Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[10].\nConspiracies in restraint of trade are not criminal so far as trade unions are concerned. Criminal Code secs. 497-8. Reg. v. Truscott[11]; Reg. v. Tankard[12]; Ogilvie & Co. v. Davie[13].\nAny restraint of trade shown cannot be said to be so unreasonable as to be contrary to public policy. Attorney General for Australia v. Adelaide SS. Co.[14]; Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants v. Osborne[15].\nBonnar K.C. and McArthur for the appellant.\nDavid Campbell K.C. and Congdon K.C. for the respondents.\nIdington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge for dismissing this action, and Mr. Justice Fullerton in the Court of Appeal, I am of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge should not have been disturbed and that this appeal should be allowed with costs and said judgment be restored.\nThe magnitude of the association and the fact that its headquarters are in a foreign country, and the final disposition of any conflict of opinion relative to the conduct of its affairs being subject to the ultimate ruling of the officials there, and thus beyond the jurisdiction of our courts or any legislation in Canada to rectify the operation of such an association, render it necessary that we should be exceedingly cautious in recognizing it herein and furnishing thereby a precedent of which no one can tell the ultimate consequences. Duff J.\u2014The respondents sue on behalf of themselves and the members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers employed in that part of the Canadian National Railways which was formerly known as the Canadian Northern Railway. According to the system of organization of the Brotherhood, the engineers employed on the railway system known as the Canadian Northern Railway were represented by a General Committee of Adjustment elected by the twenty-one divisions comprising in their membership all the members of the Brotherhood employed on that system; and after the absorption of the Canadian Northern Railway in the Canadian National Railways no change was made. The General Committee of Adjustment is elected triennially, one member from each division, who is the chief engineer of his division; and there are a permanent chairman and a secretary-treasurer of the General Committee who receive salaries.\nFor the purpose of paying expenses and indemnifying the members of the General Committee of Adjustment in respect of loss of wages in consequence of attendance on the sessions of the Committee, as well as for the purpose of providing a salary for the General Chairman and the secretary-treasurer, a fund is created by assessing all the members.\nThese assessments are collected regularly by the secretary-treasurer for each division, and by him remitted to the sec'y.-treasurer of the General Committee of Adjustment whose duty it is to hold the fund thus created and to pay it out under instructions of the committee for the purposes for which it was brought into existence. It is also the duty of the secretary-treasurer, on his retirement from office, to hand over all moneys in his hands to his successor. The appellant was removed from office on the 25th May, 1921, but declined to hand over the funds in his possession to his successor, or to account for moneys received by him in his official capacity. The action was brought for an account and for recovery of moneys for which he was alleged to be accountable. The secretary-treasurer is custodian of these funds merely, and the question arises whether the members of the Brotherhood who had contributed this fund are destitute of any remedy by which their interest in it can be protected against the depredations of a defaulting official.\nThe learned trial judge has based his judgment on the circumstances enumerated by him as follows:\u2014\nIn the constitution of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers the following provisions appear:\n1. The Grand International Division, having its head office at Cleveland in the United States, is given exclusive jurisdiction over all subjects pertaining to the Brotherhood, and its decisions are the supreme law of the Brotherhood (sec. 3).\n2. All brothers engaged in a legalized strike (i.e. a strike declared to be legal by the Head Official), and all brothers who lose their positions on account of the interest they take in brotherhood matters, upon satisfactory evidence of such facts being presented to the grand officers, shall receive $40 per month for a period of six months, unless they get employment sooner (sec. 39).\n3. Any member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers who takes the place of any one engaged in a strike recognized as legal by the B. of L.E. shall be expelled when proven guilty and shall forever be ineligible for readmittance to this Brotherhood (sec. 51).\n4. Members are prohibited from signing any contracts with a railway company, or making any verbal agreement without the consent of the General Committee of Adjustment of the system on which they are employed, under penalty of expulsion (p. 77, sec. 33).\n5. Under the so-called Chicago Joint Agreement entered into between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the following provision appears: \"When a strike is called by one organization, the members of the other organization shall not perform any service that was being performed before the strike was called, by the members of the organization who are on strike.\" (p. 97, Art. VII (E) ).\n6. The so-called Ritual (Exhibit 18) sec. 1, contains a lengthy procedure for declaring a strike, after a two-thirds vote of all the members who are employed on the system where trouble exists. The remaining one-third of the men have no power to continue work, if they so desire, but must join in the strike.\"\nThese circumstances, the learned trial judge has held, impart to the Brotherhood the character of an illegal association, with the consequence that all contracts expressed by the rules and all trusts under them are void.\nThe unit of the organization is the division, each of which has its local Committee of Adjustment elected triennially, with its chief engineer, who is chairman and delegate of the division on the General Committee of Adjustment for the system. The duty of the local Committee of Adjustment as defined by section 13 is, to meet when and where the chairman may designate and\nadjust, if possible, with the railway officials of the road or system the grievances of the members of their respective divisions. The local committee is prohibited from dealing with \"any brotherhood business except upon instructions from their divisions,\" and is required to make a written report of all \"cases the division instructs them to handle.\" Differences they are unable to adjust satisfactorily with the officials are to be\nsent by and under the seal of the division to the General Committee of Adjustment for further action.\nBy section 14, it is provided:\nAny Chairman of a General Committee of Adjustment, when called upon by one or more Divisions on his system, shall be empowered in conjunction with the Local Committee to adjust, if possible, all differences that may arise between members and their employers without convening the General Committee of Adjustment,\nand by section 39:\nThe General Committee of Adjustment shall have full power to settle all questions of seniority and rights to runs, or jurisdiction of territory that are presented to them legally, and their decision shall be final unless, on an appeal to the membership, their decision is repealed by a two-thirds vote of the membership on the system.\nThe activities of the Committees of Adjustment, so far as disclosed by the rules, concern rates of pay and conditions of work and the settlement of disputes between engineers and the management, and disputes among the engineers themselves, who are members of the Brotherhood, with respect to seniority and runs.\nThe constitution and rules of the Brotherhood contain nothing in relation to strikes or the support of striking members (with the possible exception of section 51 which I shall consider later) that can with any shew of reason be said to be illegal as being in unreasonable restraint of trade. The resolutions in the so-called ritual to which the learned judge refers were not, as we shall presently see, properly before him. So far as the constitution of the society is properly in evidence it can only be affirmed that the possibility of strikes is contemplated, that conditions are laid down which must be observed before a strike is sanctioned, and that maintenance is provided in such cases from the funds of the society. There is nothing to indicate that any member can be required to strike, or requiring him not to return to work after he has joined a strike. There is nothing to authorize a strike in violation of law or wrongful against an individual, or authorizing the application of the society's funds in support of such a strike; and the rules obviously contemplate the exhaustion of all reasonable efforts for peaceable settlement before a strike is to be resorted to.\nThe fund in question, moreover, is a fund for defraying the costs of maintaining the General Committee of Adjustment, including the expenses and indemnities of members and the salaries of the Chairman and the Secretary-Treasurer. I can see no authority for the diversion of this fund to any other purpose; and the functions of the General Committee of Adjustment, are mainly, if not exclusively, the settlement of disputes of the character indicated above. The General Committee of Adjustment has, so far as appears, no authority in relation to expulsion of members or the investigation of charges leading to expulsion. These are matters for the local divisions, subject to appeal to the Grand Chief Engineer and the Grand International Division.\nCan it be affirmed, then, because of the circumstances enumerated by the learned trial judge as the foundation of his judgment, that the General Committee of Adjustment and the engineers it represents are disentitled by law to hold a sufficient beneficial interest in the fund in question to enable them to call upon the Secretary-Treasurer to deliver the fund to his successor in office?\nThe primary objects of the Brotherhood plainly are to secure satisfactory arrangements for its members in relation to conditions of employment and rates of pay, and to provide means of settling disputes amongst its own members arising out of their service, and, as I have said, there is nothing to indicate that the constitution has in view any means other than lawful means for accomplishing these objects. Illegality was not pleaded, and on the view most favourable to the appellant the court cannot reject the claim on the ground of illegality unless, being sure that it has before it all the facts germane to the question, it can see that some of the purposes of the society are illegal in the sense that the law will not aid them, and that these are so interwoven with the other purposes as to make it impossible to separate the legal from the illegal parts of the constitution. North Western Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[16].\nThe document produced (the Constitution, Statutes and Rules of the Brotherhood) is one which plainly requires interpretation and which in its actual operation is governed by interpretations by the constituted authorities of the society. As Cockburn C.J., said in Farrar v. Close[17]. \"It is the actual working of the society\" that furnishes the decisive test in such matters, and therefore not the written word only, in this assemblage of rules, which has grown together during the sixty years of the society's life, but the interpretation, as well, that has been put upon it by actual practice, may have to be taken into account.\nAs to the first ground upon which the learned judge proceeds, the declaration is a general declaration, and must be construed by reference to the particular provisions of the constitution and regulations. The Grand International Division, representing, as it does, all the divisions comprised in the Brotherhood, has vested in it authority to amend the provisions of the constitution and statutes and rules, by a two-thirds majority vote of the delegates present at a session of the Grand International Division. It exercises also final authority in the matter of appeals in respect of expulsion and grievances of members. The character of the Brotherhood in respect of legality or illegality must, I think, be judged, not by reference to possible amendments, but by reference to the existing constitution and rules of the society.\nParagraph no. 6, as quoted from the learned judge rests upon an inadmissible document, which must be disregarded. The appellant, not having pleaded illegality, was not entitled to adduce evidence of facts solely for the purpose of establishing illegality, and otherwise irrelevant. North Western Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[18]. Paragraph no. 2 has already been dealt with. But it must be observed that the learned judge's interpretation of the word \"legal\" is not based upon evidence.\nIn considering the fourth ground, it must be remembered that the value of such an association must depend very largely upon its capacity to secure satisfactory arrangements in relation to pay and conditions of work, and this in turn must be affected by the capacity of the association to secure strict observance of its undertakings entered into on behalf of its own members collectively. Therefore, special arrangements by individuals behind the backs of the authorized representatives of the society obviously could not be tolerated. Effective action by a voluntary association would hardly be possible if the door were left open to individuals, while enjoying the advantages secured for all members, to obtain secretly special terms for themselves. It is quite clear that \"contract\" and \"agreement\" here are not used in any strict or accurate sense; they refer to special arrangements as to pay or conditions, varying those applicable to engineers generally.\nAs regards the third and fifth grounds, it should be recalled that no applicant is admitted to membership who has taken the place of a striking engineer in a strike recognized as \"legal\" by the Brotherhood. That is a fundamental condition of membership, and the rule referred to gives effect to the principle of it by decreeing expulsion and disqualification when the principle is violated by a member. In the earlier years of their organization, when disputes with railway companies were probably not infrequent, and pursued \u00e0 outrance, it may well have been considered that the safety of the organization demanded the strict observance of this rule; actual experience, one can readily conceive, may have dictated that policy. The relations between the companies and the Brotherhood are, it may be presumed, on a different footing now but new sources of danger may demand the maintenance of the old safeguards, I am not satisfied that I can pronounce this rule to be oppressive or unreasonable, without hearing such explanations as might have been offered had illegality been pleaded. At all events, I can see no reason for holding that it affects with illegality the whole constitution. As to the fifth ground, the stipulation is a term of an agreement with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, and considering the relations between firemen and, engineers is, I think, neither oppressive nor unreasonable. And even if so, it appears to me that nullification of it would not necessarily affect the provisions of the constitution with which we are concerned.\nOn principle, one has some difficulty in concluding that the policy of the law prevents recognition and protection by the courts of the interests in the fund of the General Committee of Adjustment and of the members from whose assessments the fund has been created. The functions of the General Committee of Adjustment being what they are, and the fund being exclusively applicable for the maintenance of the Committee, I do not know why the fact that some of the rules of the Brotherhood constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade, if that be so, should disentitle the engineers concerned to the aid of the court in requiring their custodian to account for the funds placed in his custody. As I have said, primarily the Committee is concerned with obtaining redress of grievances and settling disputes; and a wide distinction between this Brotherhood and other associations whose rules have been discussed in England\u2014such, for example, as the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, with which Russell v. Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners[19]\u2014is that not only does the Brotherhood permit its members to work side by side with engineers who are not members of the society, but the rules of the Brotherhood require the General Committee of Adjustment to take up the grievances of any engineer who presents to them a complaint in writing.\nOn the ground, therefore, that this fund is not applicable to any of the illegal purposes of the Brotherhood, if there be such illegal purposes, the respondents would seem to be entitled to the protection of their property by legal process. But I think their title to such protection may be put on a broader ground. If the Secretary-Treasurer were not a member of the Brotherhood, if he were a depositary whose duties arose from the acceptance of the custody of the fund simply, and not from any provision in the rules of the Brotherhood, the case would seem to be abundantly clear. Is it really less so because the Secretary-Treasurer is a member, a party to the agreements of the constitution, and because his duties are defined in the constitution? As regards this fund, his duty is merely that of a custodian. Is there any real difficulty in holding, either that those parts of the rules which make him the custodian and require him to deal with the fund in his hands according to the orders of the General Committee of Adjustment and to hand it over to his successor are capable of separation from the mass of the rules, so that they are not affected by the nullity attaching to such agreements as may be considered illegal on the ground that they constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade, or that the policy of the law which forbids the enforcements of such agreements is not so wide as to forbid the recognition of the interest of the members of the society in the fund and the protection of that interest by legal process? May one not say that at this point one encounters a paramount policy which has to do with the protection of the owners of property against the defalcations of dishonest custodians? My conclusion is that since the Act of 1869, 32-33 Vict., ch. 61 (even before the Trades Union Act of 1871), such an action as this has been maintainable in England; and consequently that the right to maintain the action was recognized under the law of England, which was introduced into Manitoba in 1870.\nIt is quite true that prior to 1868, as a rule a member of a trade union who misappropriated trade union property could not be made criminally liable; but this was not primarily due to the illegality of the association, but to the common law rule that the misappropriation of common property by a co-owner was not theft. Before this disability was removed, a special procedure for prosecuting for misappropriation was conferred by statute on friendly societies. After the disability had been removed by the Act of 1868, the question was raised whether the illegality of a trade union, in the sense of its purposes being in unlawful restraint of trade, operated to prevent such a prosecution. In Hornby v. Close[20], it was held that the summary proceedings open to friendly societies were not available to a trade union, whose purposes were illegal in the sense mentioned, because, by the terms of the statute, such proceedings were open only to societies formed for purposes \"not illegal\"; and where the rules of the society, as being in restraint of trade, were illegal in the sense of being void, it was held that such purposes could not be described as \"not illegal,\" within the meaning of this condition. The same principle was applied later in Farrar v. Close[21]. Chapter 61 of 32 and 33 Vict. was passed in consequence of these decisions. By that statute it was declared:\u2014 An association of persons having rules, agreements or practices among themselves as to the terms on which they or any of them will or will not consent to employ or to be employed shall not, by reason only that any such rules, agreements, or practices may operate in restraint of trade, or that such association is partly for objects other than the objects mentioned in the Friendly Society Acts, be deemed, for the purposes of the twenty-fourth section of the Friendly Societies Act, 1855, for the punishment of frauds and impositions, to be a society established for a purpose which is illegal, or not to be a Friendly Society within the meaning of the forty-fourth section of the said Act.\nIn The Queen v. Stainer[22], a society not registered as a Friendly Society within the meaning of this enactment initiated a prosecution of a defaulting official; and Cock-burn C.J., with reference to this statute, observed:\u2014\nIt was argued that the 32 and 33 Vic., ch. 81, applies only to registered societies; but even if this were so, it is equally an indication of the intention of the legislature that such societies as the present shall not have a defective title to property.\nPiggott B. said in the report in[23], at p. 489:\u2014\nIt is said that this society cannot hold property because its rules are illegal. Now they are only illegal as being in restraint of trade, and not affecting their right to property. By 32-33 Vic., ch. 61, the legislature has recognized their right to property.\nIn a later case, Reg. v. Registrar of Friendly Societies[24], Lord Blackburn, then Blackburn J., dealing with Hornby v. Close[25], said:\u2014\nIt is a great mistake to affirm that there is any decision that trade unions or societies of that kind are, as it were, outlaws and out of the protection of the courts of law or equity. All that this Court held was that where statutes give certain benefits to friendly societies, societies whose rules were in restraint of trade, and illegal in that sense, could not claim the benefit of the statutes. However, section 3 of the Trades Union Act (1871) seems to put an end to all doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery by enacting that the purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be unlawful, so as to render void or voidable any agreement or trust.\nIn more recent years, similar questions have arisen with regard to associations which, being composed of more than twenty members, were carrying on business in violation of section 4 of the Companies Act of 1862. In The Queen v. Tankard[26] speaking of such an association, the Lord Chief Justice (Lord Coleridge) said, at page 550:\u2014\nThere are a number of persons who join themselves together, not for any criminal purpose, but their joining together is not legalized. It is true they have no legal existence as a company, association or co-partnership, but they are none the less beneficial owners of property. * * * It would be a very strong thing to hold that a society not expressly sanctioned by law, yet not criminal, is incapable of holding any property at all.\nIn Mans v. Thompson[27], a question arose as to the right of the trustees of a society of workmen formed for the purposes of mutual insurance, composed of more than twenty members, against a defaulting treasurer. One of the defences raised was that the society was an illegal society by reason of section 4 of the Companies Act, and consequently that no trust of the funds in the treasurer's hands could be recognized by a court of law. The action was held to be maintainable by the Lord Chief Justice and Darling J. and Sheppard v. Oxenford[28], supports this view.\nThe view of Cockburn C.J. expressed in Reg, v. Stainer[29] apparently was that, the taint of criminality being absent, the members of a trade union, though its purposes were illegal in the sense mentioned, were capable of possessing beneficial ownership in the union funds; that the Act of 1869 afforded conclusive evidence that it was not contrary to the policy of the law that this beneficial ownership should be protected by legal process. The opinion of Blackburn J. goes further. The language above quoted implies that such an association is entitled to resort to civil, as well as criminal remedies for the protection of its property.\nBlackburn J.'s opinion apparently was that the Act of 1871 did not create a new right, but merely removed doubts as to the authority of the Court of Chancery to afford such protection. If I may say so, with the greatest respect, the Act of 1869 seems to give support to the view that thereafter such protection could not be regarded as contrary to the policy of the law, even where the society must, by reason of the character of its rules, be pronounced illegal as having, among its purposes, some which are in unreasonable restraint of trade.\nThe question is of great importance in Canada, because of the peculiar condition of trade union law in this country. The Canadian Act, which is ch. 125 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, has not been adopted by the provinces, and as to many of its provisions there is, to say the least, doubt as to the authority of the Dominion to enact them. Section 32, for example, in providing that the purposes of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful, so as to render void or voidable any agreement or trust, is, prima facie, dealing with the subject of civil rights and property. No doubt the declaration that trade unions, whose purposes are in unlawful restraint of trade, are not, on that ground, to be regarded as criminal conspiracies, coupled with the declarations on the subject contained in the Criminal Code which have been cited to us, establish beyond question, if there ever was a doubt upon the subject, that such a society as the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is not a criminal society. But these declarations do not carry us beyond the point reached by the declaration in the first section of the Act of 1869 above mentioned. If the appellant's contention is sound, it is highly probable that every trade union in Canada is, as regards the security of its funds, largely at the mercy of the officials who have the custody of them.\nThis would indeed be an extraordinary thing. Provincial and Dominion statutes for the past fifteen or twenty years have been directed to the encouragement of what is called \"collective bargaining.\" Associations of employers, as well as associations of employees, must, if \"collective bargaining\" is to be effectual and bargains are to be carried out, have rules giving authority to discipline recalcitrant members; and must have funds; and most trade unions have rules vesting in some body authority to give a final decision upon the question of strike or no strike, a fact which the Industrial Disputes Act, 6-7 Edw. VII, c. 26, sec. 15, explicitly recognizes. It would be singular indeed if the rights of the members of such associations in the funds provided for defraying expenses and salaries of officers, were left with no legal protection except that which arises from the liability to criminal prosecution. My conclusion, for the reasons given, is that the action is maintainable.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mignault J.\u2014There is no question, in my opinion that the appellant is accountable for moneys received by him as secretary-treasurer of the General Committee of Adjustment of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.\nThe ground on which he chiefly relies to escape from this liability is that this Brotherhood is an illegal association or at least an association the objects of which are an undue restraint of trade, and that it, or those acting for it, should be denied the assistance of the court to enforce this liability.\nIn my opinion this question should have been raised by a plea to the action, and if this had been done all circumstances and facts connected with this association and its alleged illegality would have been investigated.\nIt is true that a motion was made to amend the plea in order to set up this ground of defence against the plaintiffs' action. The learned trial judge however did not allow the amendment, but thought that with the material put into the record it was possible to determine the character of this association.\nWith great respect, I do not feel that I should pass on so important a question in the absence of a plea raising it and of a full investigation of the objects and activities of the association. Nor would I at this stage send the case back to the trial court so that this amendment may be made and the matter inquired into. The appellant holds trust funds which he refuses to pay over to the body which employed him and the latter, to obtain the return of these funds, relies on a contract of employment which per se does not appear to be illegal. Without therefore expressing any opinion as to the character of this association, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMalouin J.\u2014For the reasons stated by the Chief Justice of Manitoba, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The valuation roll included in the value of the property assessed the value of a large quantity of machinery. The appellant took an action before the Superior Court under Art. 50 C.C.P. to have the roll declared null and void.\nHeld that the machinery was non-assessable as immovable property under articles 16 (27), 651 and 656 M.C. Idington and Malouin JJ. expressing no opinion.\nHeld also, Idington and Malouin JJ. dissenting, that the appellant had the right to take proceedings before the Superior Court under article 50 C.C.P. in order to have the valuation roll declared null. The appellant having been assessed for property non-assessable, the valuation roll was void ab initio and this case falls within the principle of the decision of the Privy Council in Toronto Railway Company v. City of Toronto ([1904] A.C. 809).\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ. The decision in Shannon Realties Limited v. Ville St. Michel ([1924] A.C. 185) applies only when, the subject matter of the assessment being within the jurisdiction of the assessors, the grounds of complaint are illegality, over-valuation or other causes of injustice in the making of the valuation roll (Arts 430, 662, 664 M.C.) APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Stein J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nBy this last mentioned judgment the municipal valuation roll was declared null and void, because it had not been made up in accordance with the real value of the properties assessed, and because there had been included in the value of the property assessed as taxable, the value of a large quantity of machinery which should have been excluded. The appellants are the owners of a pulpmill located on the Murray River in the parish of St. Etienne de la Malbaie. When this mill was established in 1910, the owners were exempted from certain municipal taxes for a period of years which had not yet expired at the time of the action, and also obtained a commutation of school taxes for a period of ten years, which expired in 1920. The appellants are the successors of the original owners of this pulpmill, and in the fall of 1920 they received accounts for school taxes assessed on a valuation of $575,000 for their pulpmill and $24,000 for other real estate belonging to them. As they never had had any taxes to pay up to that time, they had never given the proceedings of the municipal council or of the school board any attention, but upon receipt of these bills they inquired into the situation and found that a valuation roll had been drawn up during the summer of 1920, and that though the farmers' lands were valued in this roll at from one-third to one-half of their real value, their pulpmill was valued at $5,000 for the land and at $570,000 for the building and machinery. Now they knew that when this mill was built, it had cost only $540,250, as follows: For the buildings $94,600; for the hydraulic development, excavations, dams and so forth, $169,000; and for machinery, $276,650. They were advised that this machinery though attached to the building was not immovable by nature but only by destination, and that the value thereof should not have been included in that of their taxable property. They were also advised that a municipal roll had been drawn up in accordance with the real value of the properties, and that a roll in which they were practically the only ratepayers assessed at their real value, whilst all the others were assessed at less than one-half of their real value, could not be sustained. They immediately brought an action in the Superior Court to have this valuation roll set aside, and they made the School Commissioners parties to this action, as under the Quebec system municipal valuation rolls are used as the basis for the apportioning of school taxes.\nSt. Laurent K.C., for the appellant. The value of the machinery installed in the pulpmill should not have been included in the valuation assessed against the appellant in the roll, as such machinery was not \"immovable property\" within the meaning of Arts. 16 (27), 651 and 656 M.C. Breakey vs Township of Metgermette North[1].\nThe decision in Shannon Realties, Ltd. v. Ville St. Michel[2] does not apply in this case, and the appellant had the right to invoke Art. 50 C.C.P. and ask the Superior Court to annul the valuation roll. C\u00f4t\u00e9 vs Corporation of County of Drummond.\nRochette for the respondent. The appellant did not allege nor prove in this action an interest sufficient in law; as it describes itself as owner, but not as tax payer or elector. The machineries, factories or machine shops are taxable under the Municipal Code; art. 719 old M.C. Commissioners Report, p. xxv, under art. 580; art. 656, M.C.\nThe remedy exercised by the appellant was barred by prescription; art. 430, 433, 662, 664 M.C.\nThe appellant has no action under article 50 C.C.P.\nSt. Laurent K.C., for the appellant.\nRochette for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe action was brought by the appellants to have the valuation roll of the respondent, made in the year 1920, declared null.\nThat roll came into force on the 5th of September, 1920, by its confirmation by the council of respondent on that date.\nThe appellant had failed to appeal to the council although due notice had been given of its having been drawn up by duly qualified assessors and duly deposited by them as required by law.\n(3) [1924] S.C.R. 186. Two months after said three months had elapsed they brought this action, and they pretend to found it upon Art. 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThere is no fraud proven, or even alleged, except by using the word \"illegal\".\nAll that is proven, and that could have been rectified if appellants had taken advantage of the duly provided means therefor, is that the assessors had not assessed on the correct basis of the market value but as many others do in rural municipalities, drew a line at a third of that.\nIf the assessors are to be believed they tried their best to make this apply to everybody, including the appellants.\nThey, if the appellants are to be believed, made the very serious mistake of being led to believe the property now in question was worth a million and a half.\nThat could all have been corrected if appellants had done their duty.\nI think this case falls within our ruling in the case of Town of St. Michel v. Shannon Realties, Limited[3], and upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[4].\nI have long held that when municipalities are created and given the power to assess and produce an assessment roll as the basis of their power to impose a tax rate, and that is accompanied by a specific means of rectification of the roll on the application of those having a right to complain, that unless there has been actual fraud or something done clearly ultra vires, there is no remedy such as invoked herein conceivably intended by any legislature to have been applicable to such a system.\nThe confusion sure to ensue from the setting aside, by any court, of the assessment roll, once it has been finally adopted, and acted upon, seems so repugnant to what we should expect the legislature to have intended, that clear and explicit language is necessary to enable us to attribute to it any such absurdity.\nThe Court of King's Bench has adopted the clear meaning of the judgment expressed by the court above, in the above cited case, and has, in the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Dorion and Mr. Justice Rivard, shewn why it has applied as well to rural municipalities as to towns and cities.\nI cannot see how they can be distinguished if we have due regard to the legal principle involved in each.\nThe little peculiarities in the modes of expression used in the respective enactments governing towns and cities and those dealing with rural municipalities are such that, with due respect, I cannot find worthy of serious attention after reading the reasons assigned in the court appealed from.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with my brother Mignault in thinking that the machinery in question is not assessable as immovable property.\nSince the property is not assessable, I can see no reason why the principle of Toronto Railway Company v. City of Toronto[5] is not applicable.\nThe appeal should be allowed; there should be a declaration in accordance with the view above expressed.\nAnglin J.\u2014Three questions arise in this appeal:\u2014\n1. Have the appellants sufficient interest to maintain the action?\n2. Are the various pieces of machinery in the appellants' mills, valued at $276,650, assessable as immovable property under articles 651 and 656 of the new Municipal Code of Quebec?\n3. If not, are the appellants, who neither appealed from such assessment under article 662 M.C. nor sought to have the valuation roll annulled under article 430 M.C., disentitled to seek redress by action under article 50 C.C.P.?\nWith the learned trial judge and my brother Mignault, for the reasons indicated by the latter, I am of the opinion that the first and second questions should be determined in the appellants' favour.\nIt is on the third point that the Court of King's Bench decided against them on the authority of the recent decision of the Judicial Committee in Shannon Realties, Limited, v. Ville St. Michel[6]. With the utmost respect, I am of the opinion that that decision is not in point and that the failure of the appellants to proceed under either of the articles of the Municipal Code above referred to does not preclude their maintaining an action under Art. 50 C.C.P. I regard the present case as falling within the principle of the decision of the Privy Council in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[7].\nThe ground of the appellants' action is that they have been assessed for property which is non-assessable. If that be so, the assessment in that particular was made without jurisdiction. Now the power conferred on the Municipal Council by Arts. 662 and 664 M.C. is to amend the roll so as to do justice; the power of the Circuit, County, District or Magistrates Court under Art. 430 M.C. is to annul a roll for illegality. An assessment made with jurisdiction over the subject matter and therefore not void ab initio is assumed in both provisions. The council is empowered to amend such an assessment; the function of the curiae designatae is to deal with questions of illegality in the making up of the roll and, upon a case therefor being established, to annul the roll as a whole.\nThe appellants' machinery was non-assessable. In assessing the appellants in respect of it the assessors were dealing with something beyond their jurisdiction. The assessment was therefore a nullity and neither appeal from it nor action to question the roll for illegality in respect of it was necessary. As to the latter, moreover, the inclusion in a roll of a parcel of non-assessable property would seem not to be such an illegality as would warrant its annulment, which under Art. 430 M.C. apparently must be of the entire roll. The inclusion of the non-assessable property is simply ineffectual. Such property, though included in the roll, cannot be made the subject of taxation.\nBut the person so assessed is not without a remedy. He is entitled to have the assessment of non-assessable property declared null and void, with or without, such consequential relief as was granted in the Toronto Railway Case7.\nIn the Shannon Case[8] the subject-matter of the assessment was admittedly within the jurisdiction of the assessors; it was over-valuation that was complained of; that over-valuation was charged to be the result of a systematic disregard of the prescribed principles of assessment. That was held by their Lordships to be matter cognizable under the provisions made for appeals by the Cities and Towns Act, Articles 5706 and 5715 R.S.Q. Accordingly, in their opinion, Art. 50 C.C.P: could not be invoked to obtain, on that ground, the nullification of valuation rolls which covered several years and against which appeals that would have afforded the ratepayer all the relief it was entitled to and were the special remedy designated by the statute had not been taken. Nothing in the Shannon Case[9] interferes in the least with the principle of the decision in the Toronto Railway ease.\nI am of the opinion that Art. 662 M.C.\u2014as was the case with s. 68 of the Ontario Assessment Act dealt with in the Toronto Railway Case[10]\u2014was not intended to provide a remedy for a person against whom an assessment had been made entirely without jurisdiction and in respect of nonassessable property. Article 430 M.C., on the other hand, deals not with particular assessments but with matters of illegality affecting the valuation roll as a whole and requiring its annulment. That is not this case. Except for the inclusion of an assessment on the appellant's machinery the validity of the roll appears to be unassailable. They are not, I think, entitled to have it set aside as a whole. Their right is to have the ultra vires assessment declared null.\nUnder these circumstances Art. 50 C.C.P. appears to afford a convenient and appropriate remedy which, I think, should be accorded. I would therefore, with great respect, allow this appeal to the extent of directing judgment to be entered declaring the assessment of the appellants' machinery null and void both as to the defendant municipality and as to the mis en cause. The appellants are entitled to their costs throughout.\nMignault J.\u2014Les appelants, entre autres griefs d'appel, pr\u00e9tendent que l'intim\u00e9e a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction en \u00e9valuant comme partie de leur moulin \u00e0 pulpe les machines qui s'y trouvent. Ces machines sont d'une valeur tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rable, $276,650, disent les appelants, alors que le moulin lui-m\u00eame vaudrait $94,600 et les travaux hydrauliques $169,000. Le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation donne au tout, les machines comprises, une valeur de $575,000. Les appelants avaient un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 attaquer ce r\u00f4le, car bien qu'ils eussent une exemption de taxes municipales, ils payaient les cotisations scolaires qui sont bas\u00e9es sur le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation. Et pour que le jugement \u00e0 intervenir f\u00fbt opposable aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles de la paroisse, ces derniers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9s comme mis-en-cause. L'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fenderesse, la corporation de la paroisse de Saint-Etienne de La Malbaie.\nPour d\u00e9terminer si les machines dans le moulin \u00e0 pulpe pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es avec ce moulin, il faut interpr\u00e9ter le sous-paragraphe 27 de l'article 16 et l'article 656 du code municipal. Ces dispositions se lisent comme suit:\u2014\nArt. 16 (27). Les mots \"biens-fonds\" ou \"terrains\" ou \"immeubles\" d\u00e9signent toute terre ou toute partie de terre poss\u00e9d\u00e9e ou occup\u00e9e, dans une municipalit\u00e9, par une seule personne ou plusieurs personnes conjointes et comprennent les b\u00e2timents et les am\u00e9liorations qui s'y trouvent.\nArt. 656. La valeur r\u00e9elle des biens-fonds imposables comprend la valeur du terrain, et la valeur des constructions, ainsi que celle de toutes les am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, sauf ce qui est prescrit par l'article 657.\nLe renvoi que ce dernier article fait \u00e0 l'article 657 est sans int\u00e9r\u00eat dans cette cause.\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu'elle pouvait tenir compte des machines en \u00e9valuant ce moulin \u00e0 pulpe. Elle soutient que ces machines sont comprises dans le sens du mot \"b\u00e2timents\" ou \"constructions\", et qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement ce sont des \"am\u00e9liorations\" et imposables comme telles en vertu des articles que j'ai cit\u00e9s.\nOn para\u00eet admettre que les machines en question sont des immeubles par destination. Cependant, bien qu'il s'agisse d'une taxe immobili\u00e8re, tout ce qui est immeuble n'est pas par l\u00e0 m\u00eame et n\u00e9cessairement imposable en vertu du code municipal, ainsi que nous l'avons jug\u00e9 dans Breakey v. Metgermette Nord[11].\nEt l'immeuble par destination, \u00e9tant, par d\u00e9finition, un objet mobilier par sa nature qui est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme immobilier \u00e0 titre d'accessoire d'un immeuble auquel il se rattache, diff\u00e8re de l'immeuble par nature en ce que son immobilisation est purement juridique et fictive, et non pas mat\u00e9rielle et r\u00e9elle (Planiol, tome 1er, n\u00b0 2210). On ne peut jamais dire qu'il fait partie du b\u00e2timent ou construction o\u00f9 il se trouve, car alors il serait un immeuble par sa nature.\nPour cette raison, je ne comprendrais pas les machines immobilis\u00e9es par destination dans la signification du mot \"b\u00e2timent\" ou \"construction*.\nMais peut-on dire que ces machines soient des \"am\u00e9liorations\" au sens des dispositions que j'ai cit\u00e9es?\nOn trouve souvent le mot \"am\u00e9liorations\" dans le langage du droit civil. Les auteurs du Nouveau Denisart (vo. Am\u00e9liorations, parag. 1er) les d\u00e9finissent comme suit:\u2014\nOn nomme am\u00e9liorations les d\u00e9penses qui augmentent, pour ainsi dire \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, la valeur et le prix du fonds sur lequel elles sont faites. On dit qu'on a am\u00e9lior\u00e9 un h\u00e9ritage, quand on y a b\u00e2ti une maison, plant\u00e9 des bois, qu'on y a fait faire une fuye, un moulin, un \u00e9tang, etc., parce que toutes ces augmentations rendent r\u00e9ellement l'h\u00e9ritage plus pr\u00e9cieux.\nIls distinguent les am\u00e9liorations des impenses, en disant que celles-ci sont des d\u00e9penses soit n\u00e9cessaires et utiles, soit voluptuaires, tandis que les am\u00e9liorations ne s'entendent que des d\u00e9penses qui donnent plus de valeur et de prix \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritage.\nOn rencontre aussi le mot \"am\u00e9liorations\" aux articles 417, 418 et 419 du code civil, qui diff\u00e8rent de l'article 555 du code fran\u00e7ais, lequel \u00e9vite de se servir de l'expression \"am\u00e9liorations\". Pour cette raison, j'ai pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 remonter \u00e0 l'ancien droit pour une d\u00e9finition de ce terme. Les articles 417, 418 et 419 distinguent selon que les am\u00e9liorations sont n\u00e9cessaires ou non, ce qui semble indiquer, quant aux am\u00e9liorations n\u00e9cessaires, qu'il s'agit surtout de r\u00e9parations. Je crois que les am\u00e9liorations dont il est question en ces articles ne sont autre chose que des constructions ou des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 des constructions, car on y parle de la possibilit\u00e9 de les enlever sans d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer le sol. On peut aussi consid\u00e9rer qu'un terrain a \u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9lior\u00e9 par les travaux qu'on y a faits, mais cette extension du mot \"am\u00e9lioration\" ne nous aiderait pas ici. Il est clair qu'on ne regarderait pas comme une am\u00e9lioration au sens de ces dispositions, l'ameublement d'une maison, et il me para\u00eet tr\u00e8s douteux qu'on y comprenne des machines install\u00e9es dans une usine, surtout si ces machines peuvent s'en enlever.\nCependant il s'agit ici du code municipal et non du code civil, et \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard il sera utile de rapporter le texte de l'article 719 de l'ancien code que l'article 656 a remplac\u00e9. Cet article disait:\u2014 719. La valeur r\u00e9elle des biens-fonds imposables comprend la valeur des constructions, usines ou machineries (dans le texte anglais \"factories or machine shops\") qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es, et celle de toutes les am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites.\nL'article 719 distinguait les \"usines et machineries\" des \"am\u00e9liorations\". Et de fait, il para\u00eet au rapport des commissaires qui ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le nouveau code municipal[12] que ces commissaires avaient propos\u00e9 un article, portant le num\u00e9ro 580 du projet du nouveau code, qui se lisait comme suit:\u2014\nLa valeur r\u00e9elle des biens-fonds imposables comprend, outre la valeur du terrain, la valeur des constructions, usines ou machineries qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds et des machineries, et celle de toutes les am\u00e9liorations qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites * * *\nLes appelants nous disent que l'association des manufacturiers canadiens fit des repr\u00e9sentations \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature \u00e0 rencontre de cette r\u00e9daction de l'article, all\u00e9guant que les propri\u00e9taires de moulins et usines dans les municipalit\u00e9s rurales tiraient peu de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des travaux faits par les autorit\u00e9s municipales, et qu'alors on ne devait pas imposer les machines install\u00e9es dans ces moulins et usines, mais seulement les \u00e9difices qui les contiennent. On ajoute que la l\u00e9gislature a fait droit \u00e0 ces repr\u00e9sentations et a substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 580 du projet l'article 656 du nouveau code, qui remplace l'article 719 de l'ancien, montrant que dans sa pens\u00e9e on ne doit pas tenir compte de la valeur des machines en \u00e9valuant, pour les fins du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation, les moulins et usines o\u00f9 ces machines sont install\u00e9es.\nQuoi qu'il en soit de la valeur juridique de cet argument, \u2014et je ne veux pas en faire la base de mon jugement\u2014il reste acquis que la l\u00e9gislature, en r\u00e9digeant le nouvel article 656, a omis les mots \"usines ou machineries qui y sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es\", dans le texte anglais \"factories or machine shops erected thereon\", qui se trouvaient dans l'ancien article 719.\nA l'ancien article, outre les usines ou machineries, on mentionnait les am\u00e9liorations, ce qui indiquait que ces am\u00e9liorations ne comprenaient pas les usines et machineries, mais s'entendaient d'am\u00e9liorations proprement dites, c'est-\u00e0-dire, je crois, rappelant la d\u00e9finition du Nouveau D\u00e9nisart, des d\u00e9penses qui avaient augment\u00e9 la valeur et le prix du fonds. Le nouvel article retranche les mots \"usines ou machineries\" et conserve le mot \"am\u00e9liorations\", mais je ne crois pas qu'on puisse donner \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re expression dans le nouvel article une signification plus \u00e9tendue qu'elle n'avait dans l'ancien article, surtout en tenant compte du fait que les mots \"usines ou machineries\" ont \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9s dans la nouvelle r\u00e9daction.\nLe mot \"am\u00e9liorations\" dans l'article 656 ne comprend donc pas les machines install\u00e9es dans un moulin, m\u00eame en reconnaissant \u00e0 ces machines la qualit\u00e9 d'immeubles par destination, et il s'ensuit que l'intim\u00e9e ne pouvait les inclure dans son \u00e9valuation du moulin \u00e0 pulpe pour les fins du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation.\nTelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la conclusion du premier juge. En adoptant moi-m\u00eame cette conclusion, je n'ai pas \u00e0 me mettre en contradiction avec la cour d'appel, qui ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9e sur cette question, car elle \u00e9tait d'avis que la r\u00e8gle adopt\u00e9e par le conseil priv\u00e9 dans Shannon Realties, Ltd., v. Ville de Saint-Michel[13] s'appliquait dans l'esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, comme en comprenant les machines dans l'\u00e9valuation du moulin \u00e0 pulpe l'intim\u00e9e a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction, la d\u00e9cision dans Shannon Realties13 ne r\u00e9git pas le cas qui nous occupe. Le d\u00e9faut ou l'exc\u00e8s de juridiction entra\u00eene nullit\u00e9 absolue et celui qui en souffre a toujours le recours de l'article 50 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nJe n'ai pas besoin de me prononcer sur les autres griefs d'appel des appelants.\nJe maintiendrais donc l'appel et j'annulerais le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation de l'intim\u00e9e, mais seulement en tant qu'il \u00e9value le moulin \u00e0 pulpe des appelants \u00e0 la somme de $575,000, laissant subsister le r\u00f4le quant \u00e0 ses autres parties, le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre l'intim\u00e9e dans toutes les cours.\nMalouin J. (dissenting).\u2014Je suis d'opinion que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Shannon Realties, Ltd. v. La Ville de Saint-Michel13, s'applique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause et que les demandeurs n'ont pas le recours de l'action directe de l'article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile pour faire annuler le r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse, vu qu'ils ont laiss\u00e9 passer les d\u00e9lais accord\u00e9s par le Code Municipal pour l'attaquer devant la cour de circuit.\nA mon avis, cette d\u00e9cision s'applique aussi bien aux corporations r\u00e9gies par le Code Municipal qu'\u00e0 celles qui le sont par les dispositions de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes. La r\u00e9serve de l'article 433, parag. 2, du Code Municipal, n'affecte en rien le principe pos\u00e9 dans la cause de Shannon Realties, Ltd. v. La Ville de Saint-Michel. Cet article dit que ce recours sp\u00e9cial n'exclut pas l'action directe \"dans le cas o\u00f9 elle peut avoir lieu\". Or, le conseil priv\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ce recours n'existe pas en vertu de l'article 50 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile.\nPour ces raisons et celles donn\u00e9es par les juges Dorion et Rivard dans la Cour du Banc du Roi, juridiction d'appel, je renverrais le pr\u00e9sent appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St-Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lapointe & Rochette.\n[1] [1920] 61 Can.

V, c. 41, section 1024 Cr. C.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a conviction where only questions of fact are involved, since the announcement of any dissent in the court of appeal is in such a case prohibited (s. 1013 (5) Cr. C. as enacted by 13-14 Geo. V. c. 41). An appeal lies to this court under 1024 Cr. C. read with s. 1013 Cr. C. only where a dissenting opinion has been expressed by a member of the court of appeal, upon a question which that court deems a question of law and pursuant to its direction. Mignault J. dubitante. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, criminal side, whereby the conviction of the appellant upon an indictment for murder was sustained.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nF. J. Laverty K.C. and O. Gagnon for the appellant.\nC. Lanctot K.C. and R. L. Colder K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Neweombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The appellant was convicted of murder on his trial before the Court of King's Bench (Criminal side) at Montreal. He appealed to the court of appeal (which by the definition clause of the criminal code is, in the province of Quebec, the Court of King's Bench, appeal side), under s. 1013 of the criminal code as enacted by c. 41 of 1923, upon grounds which include the submission\nthat the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.\nBefore the hearing the court of appeal, upon the appellant's application, ordered that the evidence of the appellant, and of one Morel, should be received for the purposes of the appeal, and the testimony of these two witnesses was accordingly taken under the direction of the court and incorporated in the record upon which the appeal was heard. The court, having heard the case thus submitted, affirmed the conviction, but the Chief Justice and Guerin J. pronounced dissenting judgments, holding in effect that in view of the new evidence the proof was unsatisfactory, and that it could not be affirmed that the jury would have convicted the prisoner if the new evidence had been before them at the trial.\nThereupon the court, by its formal judgment, upon the narrative that the appeal had been heard\non grounds involving questions of fact alone,\nordered that the appeal should be dismissed, and that the conviction should be in all respects confirmed. From this judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, the prisoner appealed to this court, relying upon s. 1024 of the criminal code. The objection was suggested by the court that neither this section nor any other provision of the criminal code authorizes an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in cases like the one under consideration where the appeal is concerned only with weight of evidence, and counsel were heard upon the point both for the prisoner and for the Crown.\nWhen the new provisions regulating appeals from convictions upon indictment were introduced by c. 41 of 1923, the sections of the criminal code from 1012 to 1023, inclusive, were repealed and new provisions were substituted for these, leaving unrepealed, however, s. 1024 which provides for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the question which now arises requires the interpretation of that section, having regard to the changes introduced by the substituted clauses. The appeal under s. 1024 extends only to convictions which have been affirmed under s. 1013. The text of subsection. 1 of section 1024, in so far as material, is as follows:\n1024. Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the court of appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction.\nSection 1013 as enacted by the criminal code (1906) provided that:\n1013. An appeal from the verdict or judgment of any court or judge having jurisdiction in criminal cases, or of a magistrate proceeding under section seven hundred and seventy-seven, on the trial of any person for an indictable offence, shall lie upon the application of such person if convicted, to the court of appeal in the cases hereinafter provided for, and in no others.\n2. Whenever the judges of the court of appeal are unanimous in deciding an appeal brought before the said court their decision shall be final.\n3. If any of the judges dissent from the opinion of the majority, an appeal shall lie from such decision to the Supreme Court of Canada as hereinafter provided.\nFollowed ss. 1014, 1015 and 1016 providing for the statement and reservation of questions of law to be reviewed upon the appeal.\nThe section substituted for s. 1013 in 1923 is substantially different; it reads as follows: 1013. (1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal to the court of appeal against his conviction,\u2014\n(a) on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone; and\n(b) with leave of the court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that it is a fit case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and\n(c) with leave of the court of appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be a sufficient ground of appeal.\n(2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave of a judge of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.\n(3) No proceeding in error shall be taken in any criminal case, and the powers and practice now existing in the court of criminal appeal for any province, in respect of motions for or the granting of new trials of persons convicted on indictment are hereby abolished.\n(4) The determination of any question before the court of appeal shall be according to the opinion of the majority of the members of that court hearing the case.\n(5) Unless the court of appeal directs to the contrary in cases where, in the opinion of that court, the question is a question of law on which it would be convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the court, the judgment of the court shall be pronounced by the president of the court or such other member of the court hearing the case as the president of the court directs, and no judgment with respect to the determination of any question shall be separately pronounced by any other member of the court.\nIt will be observed that subsections 2 and 3 of the original section 1013 providing for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, in oases in which any of the judges of the court of appeal dissent, have been omitted, and that provision is made by subsection 5 of the substituted section that the judgment of the court shall be pronounced by the president or such judge as the president directs, and that no judgment with respect to the determination of any question shall be separately pronounced by any other member of the court, unless the court of appeal direct to the contrary in cases where in the opinion of the court the question is a question of law on which it would be convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by members of the court. Consequently, upon any appeal upon a question of fact there can be no dissent expressed nor separate judgment pronounced by any member of the court, and, if the appeal be upon a question of law, it is only when the court of appeal so directs that dissenting members of the court may pronounce their dissent. Considering the requirements of this subsection it seems plain that the learned Chief Justice and Guerin J. should not have pronounced their dissenting judgments upon the question of fact, which is the only question involved in the case; and, if these dissenting judgments be excluded from the record, as in my view they must be, having regard to the peremptory provision of the statute, there is apparent in the case neither dissent nor lack of unanimity to form the basis of the jurisdiction conferred upon the Supreme Court of Canada by section 1024. The interpretation of the latter section has frequently been considered by this court and it is established by a long and practically uniform course of decision, which has become firmly embedded in the practice of the court, that the only questions open to consideration upon appeals under that provision are the points of difference between the dissenting judge or judges and the majority of the court of appeal. Among other cases in which this interpretation has been expressed or applied may be mentioned: McIntosh v. The Queen[1]; Gilbert v. The King[2]; Mulvihill v. The King[3]; Kelly v. The King[4]; R\u00e9mittord v. The King[5]. Therefore, in the absence of expressed dissent, there is no ground of appeal to be argued and, consequently, no appeal.\nObviously this court cannot acquire jurisdiction by a learned judge of the court of appeal pronouncing a dissent which the statute forbids to be pronounced.\nWhen section 1024 was enacted and until the criminal code amendments of 1923, there was no appeal to this court except upon questions of law. It is true that it was provided by section 1021 that:\n1021. After the conviction of any person for any indictable offence the court before which the trial takes place may, either during the sitting or afterwards, give leave to the person convicted to apply to the court of appeal for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence.\n2. The court of appeal may, upon hearing such motion, direct a new trial if it thinks fit.\nBut this section was self-contained and by its own force enabled any person convicted of an indictable offence by leave of the trial court to move the court of appeal for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence; no authority for such a motion was derived from section 1013; the motion was not an appeal taken under section 1013, and therefore a judgment refusing the application was not appealable to this court under section 1024.\nOne would not expect to find the jurisdiction of this court, which in relation to criminal appeals was wisely limited to questions of law, enlarged to admit of appeals upon questions of fact, involving moreover the consideration of evidence taken in the court of appeal, unless by an apt change of the language which conferred the jurisdiction to entertain appeals upon questions of law. The judicial interpretation of section 1024 had been reported and was established and well known when chapter 41 of 1923 was enacted, and if it had been the intention of Parliament to extend the right of appeal to questions of fact, it is to be supposed that that intention, effecting an addition to the jurisdiction of the court in such an important particular, would have been clearly expressed. On the contrary while section 1024, the only section remaining which confers jurisdiction, stands unchanged, subsections 2 and 3 of section 1013 do not survive, but in the place of them is found subsection 5 which forbids the expression of dissent except upon questions of law and when considered convenient by the court of appeal.\nI entertain no doubt that the plain operation and effect of subsection 5 is, not only to maintain the restriction of the right of appeal conferred by section 1024 to questions of law, but also to regulate the cases in which upon questions of law lack of unanimity may be expressed so as to embrace only those cases in which the court of appeal considers it in the interest of justice that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the court.\nWhen it is considered that the questions which may be heard upon the appeal are only those upon which there was a difference of opinion in the court below, and that there is no means by which this court may consistently with the statute be informed of the dissent or the grounds of the dissent upon which its limited jurisdiction depends, except with relation to questions of law, it follows logically enough that there can be no appeal except upon questions of law. Indeed, section 1024 will articulate with section 1013 of 1923 only upon the assumption that the dissent upon which the right of appeal is conditioned is that for the publication of which provision is made and which is not prohibited by subsection 5 of section 1013. In effect, therefore, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada only by leave of the court of appeal, and that leave is given only with relation to questions of law, and in the statutory manner by the decision of the court, when it is not unanimous, to authorize the pronouncing of separate judgments.\nThe present appeal does not raise any question of law, and this is not a case in which the absence of unanimity on the part of the members of the court of appeal in affirming the conviction could, except by breach of the statutory injunction be disclosed by the judgment of the court of appeal; neither is it a case in which any judgment could be pronounced by a member of that court, other than the president or such other member of the court hearing the case as was directed by the president to pronounce the judgment of the court.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be quashed.\nMr. Justice Idington (concurring).\u2014I agree entirely with the conclusion herein reached by my brother Newcombe and in the main with the reasoning by which he arrives at such conclusion.\nMignault J. (dubitante).\u2014While not entering a formal dissent from the judgment quashing this appeal for want of jurisdiction, I have been unable to free my mind from serious doubts as to its correctness, if I may say so with every possible deference.\nI quite agree that subparagraphs 4 and 5 of section 1013 of the criminal code, as enacted by 13-14 Geo. V (1923), ch. 41, contemplate but one judgment on behalf of the court of appeal when the appeal from a conviction is, in the opinion of that court, on a question of fact. Even when the question is one of law, there must also be but one judgment, unless the court of appeal directs to the contrary. Does this prevent the minority judges\u2014for subsection 4 provides that the majority shall determine any question before the court\u2014from having their dissent entered upon the formal judgment, as was done here and is always done in Quebec, without any pronouncement by them of a separate judgment? Parliament has not so declared, unless perhaps it may be said to have done so inferentially, and without a plain expression of its will I would hesitate to conclude that so radical a change has been made.\nOur jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of the court of appeal in criminal matters is governed by sections 1024 and 1024a of the criminal code, which were not modified by the legislation of 1923, but Parliament no doubt considered that these sections would fit in, if I may use the expression, with the new provisions allowing appeals from conviction on indictments, Subject to the provisions of section 1024a, our jurisdiction is taken away when the court of appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction. How can the unanimity of the court of appeal be ascertained unless it be by its judgment, or by a statement made in the reasons for judgment handed down by the member of the court who is instructed to pronounce its judgment? And when, as here, the judgment on its face states that two of the learned judges dissented therefrom, can it be said that the court of appeal was unanimous in affirming the conviction? It does not appear to be an insuperable objection that our jurisdiction is limited to the points of difference between the judges of the appellate court, for an unrestricted dissent is a dissent on the whole case.\nOn the true meaning of these provisions depends the question whether Parliament really intended to allow appeals to this court when the appeal involves only a question of fact. But the new section 1013, when construed with the section 1024, raises such an important question of construction that I have thought it my duty to state my doubt as to the decision denying to the appellant the right to appeal to this court. It is, of course, clear that I express no opinion on the merits of his appeal.\nAppeal quashed.\n[1] [1894] 23 S.C.R. 180.\n[2] [1907] 38 S.C.R. 284.\n[3] [1914] 49 S.C.R. 587.\n[4] [19.16] 54 S.C.R. 220\n[5] [1921] 62 S.C.R. 21.\n",

The grain was received by the latter from these parties who acquired it from the purchasers of the land upon which it was grown. The appellant founded his claim upon the right conferred upon him as the vendor of the land to a one-half share of all the crop taken from the said land by his purchasers. He relies upon the provisions of \"The Crop Payments Act,\" R.S.S. 1920, c. 126, s. 3. It was held by the courts below that the appellant could not in the circumstances of this case claim the benefit of that section which did not apply where, under the agreement, the share of the crop to be delivered to the vendor is to be, or may be, applied toward the payment of things other than the price of the land itself. It was also held that no valid seizure of the crop had been made by the appellant.\nOn the appeal by the plaintiff to the Supreme Court of Canada, the court, after hearing counsel for both parties, reserved judgment, and, at a subsequent date, dismissed the appeal with costs, Idington J. dissenting.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nF.

(1922) c. 171, to determine the amount of loss, the decision of a majority of the arbitrators is binding. Mignault J. dissenting.\nIn this case the appellate court while deciding that the majority of the arbitrators could render a valid award allowed an amendment of the statement of defence to the effect that the arbitrators had considered the replacement value and not the real value of the insured buildings and sent back the case for trial upon this issue.\nHeld, per Mignault J., that such a judgment was a final judgment within the meaning of s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act as amended by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 32.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (20 Alta. L.R. 114) affirmed, Mignault J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Ives J. who affirmed an order of Clarry M.C. refusing the respondent's motion for judgment on the ground that the amount of loss, which it was necessary should be fixed by arbitration, had not been so fixed inasmuch as the award set up by the plaintiff was made by but two of three arbitrators and was consequently invalid as an award.\nThe appellant insurance companies issued policies of insurance against loss or damage by fire for a total amount of $5,000 on a building owned by respondent. The building and contents were totally destroyed by fire. Each of the policies was subject to the statutory conditions of The Alberta Insurance Act. The respondent claiming that differ- ences had arisen between himself and the appellants as to the value of the property insured and the amount of the loss, these questions were referred to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of statutory condition no. 22. The respondent and the appellants each appointed an arbitrator, and the two so appointed selected a third arbitrator. The three arbitrators were unable to agree, and an award was made by two of them only. Immediately after the award was made, the present action was commenced by the respondent for the recovery of the amounts awarded against the several appellants. The appellants allege that the arbitrators have not made any award and claim that the document signed by the two arbitrators is not an award of the arbitrators, as it was made and signed by two arbitrators only, and not by three arbitrators as required by statutory condition 22, and by the Arbitration Act of the province of Alberta. The appellant then applied to the Master in Chambers for an order striking out these and certain other paragraphs of the defence relating to the arbitration and award. The Master in Chambers dismissed the application. An appeal was then taken by the respondent to a judge in chambers, and the appeal was heard by the Honourable Mr. Justice Ives, by whom it was dismissed. The respondent then appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The appeal was allowed, and the paragraphs of the defence struck out.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellants.\nBennett K.C. for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Stuart and Mr. Justice Beck, with which I fully agree, I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI cannot imagine that all the members of the legislature were entirely ignorant of the numerous decisions prior to the enactment now in question and now relied upon herein by the appellants, and intended, when imposing the legislative condition, now in question herein, upon every fire insurance contract that it might be nullified at the will of either party by appointing a partizan arbitrator who was ready to refuse to sign the award agreed upon.\nI would rather attribute to the legislature some knowledge of the existent law and that it intended to enact some thing useful as this enactment evidently would be if upheld as it has been by the Appellate Division.\nHence I concur in the reasons that court has given.\nTo say that it might have been made more clear is no answer if the language used is capable of the construction so given it, as I hold it is.\nNor is it any answer to suggest that the insured and insurers might have entered into an entirely different contract, distinctly discarding all legislation on the subject of fire insurance.\nThe respondent's counsel relied somewhat upon the Interpretation Act in the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1922, citing s. 29 of c. 1 thereof, which reads as follows:\u2014\n29. Whenever by any Act anything is required to be done by more than two persons a majority of them may do it.\nI think that certainly supports the contention of respondent and removes all doubt, for the condition in question is, by the very terms of the Insurance Act, part thereof when the Insurance Act is adopted as the basis of the policy in question herein.\nSection 9 of the said Interpretation Act supports also that way of interpreting and applying said Act.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal for the foregoing reasons should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The question is one of difficulty, and I am unable to say that I am entirely satisfied with the conclusion at which I have arrived. It is, however, the same in effect as the view taken by the Appellate Division in Alberta; and on the whole I think the considerations in favour of it ought to preponderate over those which can be adduced in opposition to it.\nIt has been laid down more than once, and it was expressly held by Mathew J., in United Kingdom Mutual Steamship Assur. Assc. v. Houston[2], that where, in an instrument inter partes, persons are named to do an act of private concern only, they all must concur in doing the act if it is to be validly done; and that this principle applies where by agreement the parties have provided for the determination of disputes between them by three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each of the parties, and the third to be selected in same other way, where it is quite clear that the third person so selected is an arbitrator, and not an umpire. Now it is argued, and there is a great deal of force in the argument, that the Alberta Insurance Act, c. 171, R.S.A., 1922, in laying down (ss. 69 et seq.) that certain conditions, usually called \"statutory\" conditions, set forth in schedule \"C\" of the Act are a part of every contract of fire insurance, unless otherwise provided for, in the form and manner prescribed by the statute, is merely annexing to the contract certain contractual stipulations which must take effect and must be construed and interpreted as stipulations inter partes; although, admittedly, subject to the right of variation reserved by the statute, these contractual conditions are imposed ab extra by the law, and only indirectly come into operation through the consent of the parties. The rule, therefore, above referred to, governing arbitration in matters of private concern and provided for by private documents taking effect inter partes only, it is argued, is the rule which must be applied in ascertaining the construction and effect of condition 22.\nAs against this it is said, to quote the language of an eminent judge, Mr. Justice Lawrence, in Withnell v. Gartham[3]:\nIn general, it would be the understanding of a plain man that, where a body of persons is to do an act, a majority of that body would bind the rest;\nand that to construe the condition in conformity with the rule would probably have the effect of defeating the intention of the legislature, whose interpretation of its own language is probably best to be gathered from the provision of the Interpretation Act, expressed in these words:\nWhere by any act anything is required to be done by more than two persons, the majority of them do it. (R.S.A., 1922, c. 1, s. 29).\nI am disposed to think that, strictly, this clause of the Interpretation Act does not apply. While I agree with the view of Boyd C., to which he gave effect in his decision in Re Harding[4], that a thing prescribed by statute as a condition of the acquisition of a right given by statute may very well be a thing \"required to be done,\" within the meaning of the Interpretation Act, I think it requires some straining of the language to bring the provision of condition 22 within the description \"anything required to be done\" by \"an Act of the legislature.\"\nThis, however, by no means concludes the matter. The rule of construction, upon which Matthew J. acted, is not an absolutely rigorous rule in the sense that only an express provision to the contrary can vary it. It is not a rule which has had the effect of imparting to the language of such a clause a generally recognized meaning in the sense of the rule; it is not a rule of interpretation which has become recognized in common speech. It is strictly a rule of law which gives way when inconsistent with the intention of the author of the instrument as gathered from the language or from the nature of the subject matter or from the circumstances in which the power is to be put into execution. In Grindley v. Barker[5], Buller J., said:\nOne thing is clear from this authority\n(referring to Withnell v. Gartham)[6],\nthat a deed which speaks in general terms, giving a power to a certain number of persons, does not necessarily import that all these persons shall concur;\nand he adds:\nThe case, therefore, is open to the argument of inconvenience;\nand in that case one distinction was recognized as well settled, which is expressed in these words by Eyre C.J., at p. 236:\ni think it is now pretty well established that where a number of persons are entrusted with powers * * * in some respects of a general nature, and all of them are regularly assembled, the majority will conclude the minority, and their act will be the act of the whole.\nThe opinions of Lord Cairns and Lord Selborne in relation to the arbitration between Ontario and Quebec under sec. 142 of the British North America Act illustrate the application of the principle[7].\nThe provision of the Interpretation Act above quoted seems to treat the principle as applicable in all cases where arbitration machinery is set up by statute, and I think this may fairly be considered a recognition that such would be the interpretation of such statutory provisions by Mr. Justice Lawrence's \"plain man.\"\nWhile it is quite true that in form the statutory conditions of the Insurance Act are contractual stipulations, and while I agree that as a rule they must be construed and given effect to as stipulations inter partes, it is nevertheless also true, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Beck in the court below, that the parties are not entirely free as to variations, such variations taking effect only to the extent to which the court considers them reasonable; and as regards the insured, upon whom the statutory conditions are binding unless effectively varied (The Citizens Ins. Co. of Canada v. Parsons[8], one cannot fairly ascribe to the legislature ignorance of the fact that as a rule, when the conditions do take effect as against him, they take effect quite independently of any choice exercised in fact on his part, and by force by the statute.\nThe fact that the legislature has dealt with the subject of insurance contracts in this way seems in itself to imply that such contracts are affected with a public interest, and the fact that the condition in question derives its existence from this legislative intervention seems to afford some substantial ground for bringing into play the principle laid down by Eyre C.J. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent objects to our jurisdiction to hear this appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment.\nThe action claims indemnity under several fire insurance policies alleging that as required by the conditions of each policy an arbitration had taken place and that the majority of the arbitrators had awarded him the amount claimed. The defence is that the three arbitrators not having agreed on the award the decision relied on by the respondent is not binding on the appellants.\nThe respondent moved before the master for leave to enter judgment against the appellants for the amount of his claim, but his motion was dismissed on the ground that the award was void because all the arbitrators had not joined in it.\nThis decision was affirmed on appeal by Mr. Justice Ives from whose judgment the respondent appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. The appellants had also moved for leave to amend their state- merits of defence by alleging, as a further ground of nullity of the award, that the majority of the arbitrators had granted the respondent the replacement instead of the real value of his buildings.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division reversed the judgment of Mr. Justice Ives and set aside the master's order. It also allowed the amendment.\nThe effect of this latter judgment is that the award is held to be validly rendered, although all the arbitrators did not join therein, but the appellants are allowed to amend their defence so that the case goes back for trial. Under these circumstances, the respondent contends that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment from which an appeal lies to this court.\n\" Final judgment\" is defined by s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act, as amended by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 32, as meaning\nany judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding.\nI think the judgment which holds that the award could be rendered by two of the arbitrators, without the concurrence of the third, determines a substantive right of the respondent within the meaning of this section, and is therefore a final judgment appealable to this court. The objection of the respondent fails.\nComing now to the merits, the question to be determined is whether, under the conditions of the policies, the so-called award rendered by two of the arbitrators without the concurrence of the third is conclusive and binding on the parties.\nCondition 22 of the policies, which is one of the statutory conditions under the Alberta Insurance law, is as follows:\nIf any difference arises as to the value of the property insured, the property saved, or the amount of the loss, such value and amount and the proportion thereof (if any) to be paid by the company, shall, whether the right to recover on the policy is disputed or not, and independently of all other questions, be submitted to the arbitration of some person to be chosen by both parties, or if they cannot agree on one person, then to two persons, one to be chosen by the party insured and the other by the company, and a third to be appointed by the persons so chosen, or in their failing to agree, then by a judge of the district court of the district in which the loss has happened; and such reference shall be subject to the provisions of \"The Arbitration Act,\" and the award shall, if the company is in other respects liable, be conclusive as to the amount of the loss and the proportion to be paid by the company; where the full amount of the claim is awarded the costs shall follow the event, and in other cases all questions of costs shall be in the discretion of the arbitrators.\nThere is no provision here for a majority award. The reference to The Arbitration Act (R.S.A., c. 98) is of no help, for the condition does not provide for the appointment of an umpire, and the provisions of schedule A which would allow the naming of an umpire do not apply because the reference is not to two arbitrators, but to one, and if the parties cannot agree on one person, then to two persons, one chosen by the assured and the other by the company and a third appointed by the two, or if they fail to agree, by a judge of the district court. This is a submission to three arbitrators, and not to two arbitrators and an umpire. It follows that no award can be rendered unless all the arbitrators join therein. (See cases cited in Russell on Arbitrations, 10th ed. pp. 408, 409).\nI may add that in the report of their Lordships of the Privy Council on the reference to them of certain questions arising under The Irish Free State Agreement Act, 1922, better known as The Irish Boundary Commission Case, which I find in the London Times of August 2nd, 1924, p. 15, their Lordships say:\nAlthough in private arbitrations unanimity is necessary, it is otherwise when the matter to be determined is of public concern.\nThis is undoubtedly a private arbitration resulting from a contract of a private nature; and, in the absence of any clause giving to the majority of the arbitrators the power to make an award, no decision of the arbitrators is binding on the parties unless all the arbitrators join therein.\nThe argument that this is a statutory condition or that it is a contract which the statute makes for the parties does not appear to be conclusive. The parties can vary any of the statutory conditions by agreement and if they do not do so effect must be given to these conditions as in an ordinary contract. I could not therefore say that condition 22 is practically, as Mr. Justice Stuart suggests, a legislative enactment. Nor do I think that s. 29 of the Alberta Interpretation Act relied on by the respondent can be appealed to in order to read into the condition a provision for a majority award.\nThis does not mean that the respondent has no remedy. He can ask the court to determine the value of the de- stroyed property, the submission to arbitration having proved abortive. I may perhaps be permitted to cite here what Lord Shaw of Dumfermline, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said in Cameron v. Cuddy[9]:\nWhen an arbitration for any reason becomes abortive, it is the duty of a court of law, in working out a contract of which such an arbitration is part of the practical machinery, to supply the defect which has occurred. It is the privilege of a Court in such circumstances and it is its duty to come to the assistance of parties by the removal of the impasse and the extrication of their rights. This rule is in truth founded upon the soundest principle, it is practical in its character, and it furnishes by an appeal to a court of justice the means of working out and of preventing the defeat of bargains between parties. It is unnecessary to cite authority on the subject, but the judgment of Lord Watson in Hamlyn & Co. v. Talisker Distillery [10] might be referred to.\nIt would seem very desirable that the legislature should amend statutory condition 22 so as to provide for a majority award. In the province of Quebec, the arbitration condition refers to the code of civil procedure which permits a majority of the arbitrators to make an award. (Article 1441). There is no reason why the condition should not be made to operate in the same manner elsewhere.\nOn the ground therefore that the so-called award is invalid, I would, with respect, allow the appeal with costs here and in the appellate court and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The case must go back for trial and, the submission to arbitration having proved abortive, the trial court will determine the value of the property insured and the amount of the loss.\nMACLEAN J.\u2014Upon the conclusion of the argument I was strongly of the view that the appeal should prevail. However, upon a further and careful review of the reasons for judgment rendered in the Appellate Division, and after a careful consideration of the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Duff which I have had the privilege of reading, I have reached the conclusion, though not quite free from doubt, that the judgment of the court below should be sustained. I adopt the line of reasoning to be found in the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff, and cannot usefully add thereto.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1923] 20 Alta.

V, c. 24.\nThe appellant was owner of a building used as a warehouse and had let through its manager A. a contract to H. for repairing the water spouts of the roof, including the erecting and demolition of the necessary scaffolding. The work being nearly done, A. notified directly some employees of H. then on the premises that the windows must be closed for the protection of the stores against a possible fall in temperature during some coming holidays. Although forbidden to do so except by the orders of their immediate employer, the employees of H. started to remove the scaffolding in order to fulfil the request of A. who had no knowledge of the above prohibition. The respondent while entering the building on business with the commission was injured through the fall of a plank and sued the appellant to recover damages.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the appellant was not liable.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014Under the circumstances of this case the employees of H., in dismantling the scaffolding, did not pass under the temporary control of the appellant and the latter did not become their patron momentan\u00e9.

The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGeoffrion K.C. and De Serves K.C. for the appellant\nHolden K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondent against the appellant for damages suffered by reason of the negligence and improper conduct of the appellant's manager, and others employed by it in and about the building in Montreal wherein its business at said branch was being carried on, resulting in a plank falling upon the respondent.\nThe building needed some repairs for which the appellant let the contract to a firm, Hickey & Aubut, who sub-let the needed work of erecting the scaffolding necessary to enable the repairs to be done to a carpenter who was to do also the work of tearing it down, when the repairs were finished.\nAubut forbade any one to take it down without his instructions and never gave an order or assent thereto.\nNotwithstanding all that, the appellant's managers induced, by their and others of appellant's employees' instructions, one Simard, a tinsmith working there, to take it down because the appellant's manager and his assistants wanted to shut out the cool air lest it should injure the liquor inside during some coming holidays.\nSimard had no more right to do so than any one on the street requested by said manager, or others of appellant's employees, to do so.\nSuch improper conduct on the part of said manager, and others for whom appellant is responsible, it seems to have been surmised, may have been traceable to Aubut who was made a party defendant along with the appellant.\nThe respondent as a messenger in the service of an express company had occasion to go into the building to receive something in way of packages addressed by the appellant to customers, and pursued his errand there quite properly, and yet no one took the precaution to warn him against the possible danger of entering under such circumstances. A plank fell down on him from said scaffold as the result of Simard doing above part of what the said manager had requested.\nThe case was tried before Acting Chief Justice Martin with a jury.\nThere were a number of questions submitted to the jury who found in answer to the second question as follows:\nThe answer to No. 2 is: We find the Quebec Liquor Commission at fault and solely responsible because of taking temporary control of the employees of Hickey & Aubut, and ordering them to close the windows necessitating the removal of some scaffolding, due to which the accident occurred and by reason of the negligence of the defendant, Quebec Liquor Commission, in handling the plank that caused the damage. Unanimous.\nAnd to my mind there was ample evidence for such finding. Aubut was found in no way to blame. The jury rendered a verdict in favour of the respondent and assessed his damages at $8,121.25, for which the learned trial judge entered judgment.\nFrom that the appellant appealed to the Court of King's Bench at Montreal.\nThat court unanimously, and I think quite correctly, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nFrom that judgment this appeal is brought.\nThree grounds are taken in the appellant's factum for holding that the appellant is not responsible, and are stated as follows:\u2014\n1. Because the accident occurred by the fault of a workman in the employ of the contractor to whom the appellant had entrusted certain works of repair and in the course of this work.\n2. Because the workman who committed the fault never ceased to be under the control of his employer, the defendant Aubut, and to act for him and, particularly at the moment of the accident, he was not acting for the appellant and had not passed under its control.\n3. No fact was proven establishing a contractual relation of such a nature that this workman could be held to have passed from the control of his employer to that of the appellant.\nI respectfully submit that as the said workman, or assistants, had never been entrusted by the contractor with regard to the building or removing said scaffold, and never got the slightest right from any one excepting appellant's taking control by its manager and employees and unwarrantably directing its removal, these contentions are entirely without foundation in law or fact.\nThe appellant's agents pretended that in order to avoid injury to its goods it was deemed by them to be necessary to have that done, the doing of which resulted in the accident in question, and took the necessary control without the necessary precaution.\nIt is possible that a proprietor as, for example, in case of fire, may be driven to such an exercise of authority to protect his property, but he cannot shift the incidental risks attendant thereon on to others.\nThe said factum proceeds to suggest some other things quite true, and some not so apparent, and indirectly thus to shelter the appellant from liability by reason of acting for the Crown.\nI cannot see any pleading of the appellant setting up such a defence in law upon such facts as in question, and submit such a defence is not now open to it.\nMoreover the appellant is incorporated by \"The Alcoholic Liquor Act\" for the express purpose of carrying on the business of buying and selling liquor and reaping a profit therefrom and doing all such things as are found necessary for the success of said business.\nSection 12 of said Act of incorporation provides as follows:\u2014\n12. No member of the Commission may be prosecuted for doing or omitting to do any act in the performance of his duties as prescribed by this Act, unless by the Provincial Government.\nThe Commission itself may be prosecuted only with the consent of the Attorney General.\nI submit that whilst the first part of this section protects and is intended to protect from litigation those carrying on the business of the corporate respondent, the second part is given as substitute therefor and subject to only one condition, the consent of the Attorney-General.\nThat consent is indorsed on the declaration and signed by his assistant, Mr. Lanctot, whose authority to do so has not been questioned.\nThis form of procedure is clearly designed for the purpose of avoiding the circuitous necessities, adopted by many English Acts to give effect to the English Petition of Right in its manifold applications and needs of giving relief, has so long given rise to.\nThe Parliament of the Dominion with the like object in view constituted the Exchequer Court of Canada to try such like cases. And in the course of its administration that court has decided many cases which came to this court by way of appeal.\nThe jurisprudence that has arisen as the result thereof has not been uniformly consistent, or such as always to meet with my concurrence.\nI might be permitted to refer to the authorities I cited in my dissenting judgment in the case of Ryder v. The King[2], and especially the quotation from the judgment of the late Chief Justice Strong, in the case of the City of Quebec v. The Queen[3].\nI submit that the view of said Chief Justice that\nthe Act (there in question) was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which a remedy for such liability might be administered\nmay well be taken of the said section 12, especially when read in light of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case he cites of The Attorney-General of the Straits Settlement v. Wemyss[4].\nThen we have the decision of this court in the case of The King v. Desrosiers[5], unanimously holding that the law of Quebec where an accident happened on the Intercolonial Railway in that province, must be allowed full effect and govern the rights of the parties though the Intercolonial was a corporate company created by the Parliament of Canada and managed by those appointed by its Government, and the Exchequer Court had tried the case under petition of right provisions of the Act creating said court.\nThe judgment of the learned Chief Justice which was assented to by the then other members of the court, expressly held that all there in question had been decided in the case of The King v. Armstrong[6].\nOne of the points so treated was the fact that a tort was the basis of the action.\nThe mere suggestion in Ryder v. The King (6), and many other cases previously, that tort was the basis in fact on which the action founded seemed fatal by reason of the maxim that \"The King can do wrong\". I submit that the judgment in said case has been decisively overruled by these later decisions.\nThe very early case of Lane v. Cotton[7], holding that the Postmaster-General could not be held responsible for the torts of those under him, is the basis of the doctrine so long maintained. And that was followed in the late case of Bainbridge v. The Postmaster-General[8], although he had long before and meantime been created as such a corporation.\nThe modern commercial development of many branches of business carried on under the supervision of some Minister of State tended to impair the general recognition of the doctrine.\nAs already pointed out the Dominion Parliament passed an Act to remedy such a state of the law and that found its latest judicial interpretation in the cases I have just cited.\nThe article 1011 of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure is much more comprehensive in regard to the liability of the Provincial Government than the said Dominion Act in expressly creating a liability, and though that article is followed by provisions indicating, as matter of procedure, that a formal petition should be first presented for leave, yet, by the jurisprudence of that province, unless objection is taken, the ordinary procedure as between private individuals cannot be objected to after trial and judgment.\nThat question of procedure is all, I submit, substituted by said section 12 of the Alcoholic Act quoted above.\nAnd the whole basis of this appeal resolves itself, so far as procedure is or can be relied upon, into one with which this court has uniformly refused to interfere, and such appeals have accordingly been dismissed.\nAnd in the case of Graham et al v. His Majesty's Commissioners of Public Works and Building[9], where, on the facts stated, it appeared that the respondents were (as here in question the appellant is) shewn to have been incorporated, it was held on appeal that the doctrine could not be longer observed as it had been. The action arose out of a contract between the parties plaintiffs and respondent, to build a post-office, and plaintiffs proceeded with the work, and whilst it was in progress Dora defendant respondent wrongfully determining and Moon repudiating it was sued for damages that was pretty close to this in its facts and principle, yet damages were held recoverable despite the talk about torts.\nIn that as in all other cases I have seen, if my memory serves me, the objection was taken by way of pleading or motion before trial.\nI have not discovered a case where the defendant failed to move or plead the objection before the trial was finished, and yet had the temerity of appellant herein to remain silent until coming to this court.\nThe factum does not even state it in the three grounds taken, but merely incidentally in the course of the argument therein, though its counsel enlarged it somewhat in their argument before us yet failed to cite any Quebec case, or elsewhere, justifying the consideration of the point stated for the first time by said argument in the factum.\nI cannot maintain such an appeal or entertain the contention.\nThen subsidiarily as it is put in factum and argument, appellant complains of the damages allowed being excessive.\nI can see no ground for departing herein from our usual practice of refusing to review the assessment of damages.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014 Moore was a driver in the employ of the Canadian National Express Company, and on the afternoon of the 12th of April, 1922, he droire his wagon to the premises of the appellants to collect some parcels. He backed his wagon up to the delivery platform, and entered the prem\u00adises, and after receiving his parcels, carried an armful across this platform to the rear of his wagon. As he was stooping down to place them in the wagon, he was struck by a heavy plank dropped from the top of the building, where work\u00admen were employed in dismantling some scaffolding. His back was broken by the blow, he was totally incapacitated for over a year, and suffers a very serious permanent disablement. The appellants were tenants of the premises .\nIn the month preceding the accident, March, 1922, the appellants' manager, Archambault, had let a contract to Hickey & Aubut for repairing the water spouts on the roof, including the erection and demolition of the necessary Duff J. scaffolding. The contractors entrusted this latter part of the work to a sub-contractor, Ryan. On the 12th of April, \u2014 the day of the accident, the work on the Commissioners street side of the building had been finished. As that day was Wednesday of Holy Week, and the warehouse would be closed from the ensuing Good Friday to Easter Monday, it was considered desirable that the scaffolding should be removed so that the windows, through which the joists of the scaffolding passed, might be closed, for the protection of L. the stores against a possible fall in temperature. Without going into details, it is sufficient to say that there was evi\u00addence warranting the jury in concluding that with Archambault's authority the roofers employed by Hickey & Aubut in executing the repairs were informed that the windows must be closed, and that it was quite well understood by all parties that this necessarily involved taking down the scaffolding. These workmen, the roofers, had nothing to do with the scaffolding, and indeed had been specifically in\u00adstructed not to interfere with it Ryan, the sub-contractor having assumed all responsibility, both for its erection and its removal. Archambault having given orders direct to workmen in the employ of his contractor without communicating with the contractor, the jury, I think, in the circum\u00adstances, might properly find that these workmen, as they were directed to do something which by the orders of their immediate employer they were not permitted to do, would naturally assume that the orders were given by Archambault under his own responsibility: indeed, I think the proper inference' is that that is precisely the view upon which they acted. In such circumstances the jury were entitled to find, as they did, that there was such an interference in the execution of the contract by Archambault as to make him and his principals responsible for the consequences; in other words, to constitute the negligent workmen te servants of the Commission for the time being was on this ground that the case proceeded at the trial. I think the case, in this aspect of it, was rightly left to the jury by Martin J., and that, subject to a question of law to be discussed, the verdict is sufficiently supported by the evidence.\nBut there is another ground upon which subject to the question of law I think it would have been improper for the Court of King's Bench to set aside the judgment of the trial judge. The operation of dismantling the scaffolding was one obviously attended with risk to wayfarers in the street below, and particularly to persons entering and leaving the premises of the Liquor Commission at its delivery platform. This fact is undisputed; indeed, it is in evidence that nearly an hour before Moore was injured, one of the employees of the Commission warned an automobile driver in the same employ to remove his automobile to the other side of the street. There is also evidence, uncontradicted, that another employee of the Commission sent a similar warning to another automobile driver. On the facts in evidence it seems undeniable that the risk, though real and patent of those aware of what was going on, was not necessarily perceptible by persons entering of leaving the premises of the Liquor Commission at the delivery platform without warning In these circumstances, the duty of the Liquor Commission to warn persons who might be at the delivery platform on business with them, impliedly by their invitation, would seem to be a self-evident one. I should be sorry indeed to think that the scope of Art. 1053 C. C. could be so restricted as to exclude the responsibility of occupiers of business premises for failure to give warning of traps known by them to exist, exposing persons invited by them to enter the premises for the purposes of their business to injury in consequence thereof.\nThe Roman law recognized the responsibility of occupiers of property in respect of the condition of the property or acts done on the property constituting a public danger; wild animals kept near a public thoroughfare; beams placed in such a position as to endanger the travellers on a public way; things thrown from the premises, even by strangers. The absolute responsibility enforced in the actio de dejectis et effusis is not recognized in the modern law, but the common law recognizes the responsibility of the occupant for a highway or persons on the frequented part of a neighbour's dangerous condition exposing the travellers on an adjoining highway or person of the frequented part of a neighbour\u2019s property to unreasonable risks, such as an unfenced excavation in close proximity to the line of the street or the line of the neighbour's property, as well as responsibility generally for works executed by an independent contractor when of such a character as in themselves to expose the public to risk of injury. It not in every case that a person who creates a dangerous situation is at the common law responsible for injuries which ensue; as a rule trepassers take the risk of the situation as it is, but persons invited by the occupier in the ordinary course of business are entitled to assume that they will not encounter perils not apparent to persons exercising such care as in the circumstances would be reasonable; and the actual ignorance of the occupier is immaterial if he or his servants ought to have known of the danger. I am not suggesting that these rules of the common law should be regarded as furnishing the principle for the determination of a controversy governed by the law of Quebec, but the existence of such rules is certainly not a ground for assuming that the principle of them finds no analogy in the law of Quebec. In the present case, not only was the dangerous situation created at the request of the appellants, and for their profit; not only was it known to the appellants' servants; it was a situation imperiling the public, as well as persons invited by the Commission to their premises to do business with them. I have the greatest difficulty in assuming that Art. 1053 C. C. does not contemplate as an act of negligence involving fault an invitation to customers by a shopkeeper who is aware that on entering his shop they will, if not warned, be exposed to serious risk of grave injury, without a suspicion of the existence of it, and who presents this invitation without any warning as to the existence of the risk. I cannot but think that to state the proposition is sufficient.\nThe responsibility of a contractor not in exclusive occupation of the premises where he is executing his contract for a dangerous situation amounting to a trap, created by his employees, his responsibility, that is to say, to strangers visiting the premises on business, was recognized in The W. J. McGuire Co. v. Bridger[10]. One finds it difficult to distinguish between the position of the author of the trap and the responsibility of the author of the invitation, who is the occupant of the premises and knows of the trap and gives no warning of it. I have seen no express decision to Duff J. this effect in the Quebec courts, but, as a great judge once\nsaid,\nthe plainer a proposition, the harder it often is to find judicial authority for it;\nand the principle seems to be recognized by La Cour de Cassation in D. 1879-1-254.\nResponsibility on this principle is not a responsibility for the act of the workman who carelessly dropped the plank. It does not rest upon McCarthy's act or default. It rests upon the default of the Commission and the Commission\u2019s servants in their neglect to give warning; and would arise although the fall of the plank had been a mere accident involving no legal responsibility on the part of the workman or his immediate employers.\nIt is quite true that the jury was not asked to pass upon the negligence of the appellants under this head. On the facts in evidence, however, the respondent's claim, when presented in this way, cannot be said to have been met by any serious defence. The existence of the facts constituting the elements of responsibility is really not disputed, and I assume that the Commission would not desire in such a case as this to have a new trial with the vain object of investi\u00adgating the obvious. In any case, assuming a legal responsi\u00adbility of the Commission for the faults of its servants, the action could not be properly dismissed, in view of the evidence to which I have referred.\nBut a much more serious question is raised by the appel\u00adlants now for the first time, and that is, whether the Commission is answerable in an action for a delict committed by its servants. That question may be conveniently considered in two ways: First, is the Liquor Commission, in the rele\u00advant sense, an organ of the Quebec Government? And, secondly, does the statute by which the Commission is con\u00adstituted (11 Geo. V, c. 24), manifest a legislative intention that the commission shall be responsible for such delicts? That the Commission is an instrumentality of government is clear from the circumstances that the members of the Commission are appointed by the Governor in Council and are removable at pleasure (s. 6); that all property in the possession of or under the control of the Commission is expressly declared to be the property of the Crown; and that all moneys received by the Commission at the discretion of the Provincial Treasurer are remissible to him, and, on receipt by him, become part of the consolidated funds of the province (s. 18) ; that the Commission is accountable to the Treasurer in the manner and at the times indicated by the latter (s. 19). The Commission, moreover, exercises authority respecting the sale of liquor in the province, and infractions of the law dealing with that subject are\u2022 prosecuted in the name of the Commission or of the municipality where the infraction occurred. By s. 13, the employees of the Commission are declared to be public officers, and they are required to take the oath of public service as such.\nThe broad principle, of course, is that the liability of a body created by statute must be determined by the true interpretation of the statute. It is desirable, perhaps, to advert first of all to a discussion of the subject in The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v. Gibbs[11]. Mr. Justice Blackburn, delivering the opinion of the judges in that case, proceeded upon the principle stated by him in these words (p. 107) :\nIt is well observed by Mr. Justice Mellor in Coe v. Wise[12], of cor\u00adporations like the present, formed for trading and other profitable pur\u00adposes, that though such corporations may act without reward to them\u00adselves, yet in their very nature they are substitutions on a large scale for individual enterprise. And we think that in the absence of anything in the statutes (which create such corporations) showing a contrary intention in the legislature, the true rule of construction is, that the legislature intended that the liability of corporations thus substituted for individuals should, to the extent of their corporate funds, be co-extensive with that imposed by the general law on the owners of similar works.\nAn exception is recognized, however, in the judgment of Mr. Justice Blackburn, as well as in the speeches of the Lords in the case of public officers who are servants of the Government; that is to say, officers fulfilling a public duty, appointed directly by the Crown and acting as officers of the Crown. Such a public officer is not responsible for the acts of inferior servants or officials merely because the superior officer has the right of the selection and appointment, as well as the right of removal at pleasure. Canterbury v. The Attorney-General[13]. It is now recognized also that there is nothing to prevent the Crown being served by a corporation, and nothing to prevent such a corporation claiming the same immunity as an individual. Bainbridge v. The Postmaster General[14], and Roper v. The Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings[15].\nMuch can certainly be said in favour of the view that by s. 9 of the Act there is implied authority to incur con\u00adtractual responsibility in the ordinary way and, consequently, liability to suit for the enforcement of contracts entered into. But it does not follow that there is responsibilicts for delicts. Roper v. The Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings[16] at p. 52.\nA judgment against the Commission, if it is to be effective, must be satisfied out of Crown funds; funds, that is to say, which are explicitly declared by the statute to be the funds of the Crown and which are under the control of the Provincial Treasurer. Responsibility of the Commission must, moreover, arise, if it arise at all, from the act of an employee who by the statute is explicitly declared to be a public servant. The responsibility, then, if it exists, is a responsibility of the Commission in its official capacity as manager of a branch of the Government business, and is a responsibility for a wrong committed by a subordinate public official. Such is not a class of cases contemplated by the judgment of Blackburn, J., or by the speeches of the Lords in The Mersey Docks Case[17].To affirm the responsibility of the Commission is in effect to affirm the responsibility of the Crown for a tort. Not only does the statute fail to disclose any expression of an intention that the Commission shall be subject to such a principle of responsibility, but the explicit affirmations as to the pro\u00adperty in possession of the Commission being the property of the Crown, as to the accountability of the Commission to the Provincial Treasurer and the Provincial Treasurer's control over its funds, and especially the explicit declaration as to the status of the employees of the Commission as public officers, would appear to indicate with not much moo uncertainty an intention to the contrary.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed and the action dismissed, but without costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent), a servant of the Canadian National Express Company, sues to recover dam\u00adages for injuries sustained by him while calling for parcels at the appellant's warehouse through the fall of a plank in the course of removing a scaffolding erected in front of the building upon which it was having some repairs done by the firm of Hickey & Aubut. The plank fell through the negligence of one Simard, an employee of Hickey & Aubut, and the appellant has been held liable solely on the ground that it had taken temporary control of the workmen of Hickey & Aubut engaged on the building by ordering them to close certain windows, which necessitated removal of the scaffolding. With profound respect I am of the opinion that there was no evidence to warrant this finding of assumption of control.\nHickey & Aubut were independent contractors. It was a part of their contractual undertaking with the appellant to remove the scaffolding in question. The time for such removal had arrived. The defendant was entirely within its rights in insisting on the closing of the windows in its building and on having the scaffolding removed to permit of that being done. The only direetion given by its officers was that the windows must be closed. There is nothing to indicate that in communicating that direction to the work\u00admen of Hickey & Aubut who were on the premises the offi\u00adcers of the appellant were doing more than merely intimating to the representatives of that firm that it was called upon to carry out its contractual obligation. There is nothing to warrant an inference that they dealt with Hickey & Aubut's employees in anywise as persons over whom they had, or professed, or intended to exercise, any control. It was fully competent for those employees to decline to do anything towards removing the scaffolding until and unless instructed by their employers. That they understood that they were addressed as employees of, and representing, Hickey & Aubut, and not as persons asked to do something for and on behalf of the appellant commission, is indicated by the telephone communication they had with McGovern, Hickey & Aubut's superintendent, and by his abortive attempt to communicate with the sub-con\u00adtractor Ryan, to whom Hickey & Aubut had entrusted the work of erecting and removing the scaffolding. The proper inference from the evidence, in my opinion, is that when Simard and his companions proceeded to remove the scaffolding the acted not as persons under the control of the defendant, but as employees of Hickey & Aubut doing what the latter were bound by their contract to do or have done and presumably because they conceived that they were acting in their employers interest and that the urgency of the circumstances justified their disregarding the instructions not to do anything in connection with the scaffolding. It is trite law that, although a workman may act in direct contravention of his master's orders, the latter is not neces\u00adsarily relieved from responsibility for the consequence of his acts if done in the course of his employment. Moreover, it does not at all follow that if Hickey & Aubut were not liable, the appellant must be so. Under the circumstances Simard alone may be answerable for his negligent act. But, in any event, I can discover nothing in the record to support the finding that Simard and his associates, who were on the building as employees of Hickey & Aubut, in handling the scaffolding passed under the control of the appellant so that it became their patron momentan\u00e9.\nOther possible bases of liability were suggested in argu\u00adment and may be sufficiently covered by facts alleged in the declaration. But they were not submitted to the jury and the plaintiff has not secured a finding upon them.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, must be allowed and the action against the appellant dismissed\u2014 with costs throughout, if insisted upon.\nMIGNAULT J.-- Bien qu'en principe on ne soit responsable que de sa propre faute, dans quelques cas la loi vent que l'on r\u00e9ponde de la faute d'autrui, et c'est par sa volont\u00e9 expresse que les maitres et commettants sont responsables du dommage cause par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s (art. 1054 C.C.). Cette responsabilit\u00e9 a pour motif d'abord le choix du pr\u00e9pose et ensuite et surtout l'autorit\u00e9 et le droit de surveillance que le maitre a sur lui. D'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, elle p\u00e8se sur le patron, mais si un tiers prend momentan\u00e9ment la direction du pr\u00e9pose, soit en vertu d'une entente avec le patron, soit par sa propre ing\u00e9rence dans la conduite d'une entreprise, il devient responsable de la faute du pr\u00e9pose tout comme s'il en \u00e9tait le patron. C'est la distinction entre le patron habituel et le patron momentan\u00e9 qui souvent permet au patron habituel d'\u00e9chapper \u00e0 toute responsabilit\u00e9, comme dans la cause de The Central Vermont Railway Company v. Bain[18]. Voy. aussi Sirey, 1923-1-115, et la note.\nL'appelante, The Quebec Liquor Commission, avait lou\u00e9 pour les fins de son commerce un immeuble ayant front sur la rue des Commissaires et sur la rue Saint-Paul en la cite de Montreal. Elle voulait faire faire certaines r\u00e9parations a la toiture de cet immeuble; et, ayant demands des soumissions pour les travaux, elle accepta celle du nomme Aubut, entrepreneur plombier et ferblantier, faisant affaires sous la raison de Hickey et Aubut, lequel s'engagea \u00e0 faire les travaux pour la somme de $450. La soumission disait:\nIn order to carry out this work, it will be necessary to erect scaffold\u00ading which is included in this tender.\nAubut s'arrangea avec un autre entrepreneur, le nomme Ryan, pour la confection des \u00e9chafaudages sur paiement de $120, ce qui comprenait, dit Ryan, leur d\u00e9molition, mais ce sous-contrat ne parait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 a la connaissance de l'appelante. Ryan posa l'\u00e9chafaudage sur le cote de la rue des Commissaires et it devait l'enlever de la quand les travaux y seraient termin\u00e9s pour l'installer sur le cote de la rue Saint-Paul.\nLes travaux se faisaient au mois d'avril 1922, dans la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant P\u00e2ques, et la partie des travaux sur le front de la rue des Commissaires se trouvait termin\u00e9e le 12 avril, le mercredi de la semaine sainte. Comme l\u2019\u00e9difice, qui n\u2019\u00e9tais pas chauff\u00e9, devait \u00eatre ferm\u00e9 le vendredi-saint et le lundi de P\u00e2ques, les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante, pour pr\u00e9venir tout dommage \u00e0 leur vins par le froid, demand\u00e8rent aux ouvriers d\u2019Aubut de fermer les fen\u00eatre, pour cela, vu que les poutres sur lesquelles l'\u00e9chafaudage s'appuyait entraient dans l'\u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur par les fen\u00eatres, il fallait que l'\u00e9chafaudage f\u00fbt d\u00e9moli, et les ouvriers d'Aubut y proc\u00e9d\u00e8rent. Pendant la d\u00e9molition, l'un des ouvriers laissa, tomber une planche qui blessa gri\u00e8vement l'intime, et celui-ci a poursuivi la Commission appelante ainsi qu'Aubut, les tenant conjointement et solidairement responsables des dommages qu'il avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9s.\nPar sa d\u00e9claration, l'intim\u00e9 fait reposer la responsabilit\u00e9 d'Aubut sur le fait qu'il \u00e9tait le patron de l'ouvrier n\u00e9gligent et celle de la Commission des liqueurs sur le motif qu'elle \u00e9tait, dit-il, propri\u00e9taire de l'\u00e9difice et que la planche\/ qui le frappa \u00e9tait sous sa garde. Au proc\u00e8s, cependant, cela est \u00e9vident par les instructions du juge au jury, c'est la responsabilit\u00e9 du patron pour la faute de son propose que l'intime a invoqu\u00e9e, et c'est comme patron momentan\u00e9 que le jury a r\u00e9pondu que l'appelante \u00e9tait responsable de l'accident, alors qu'il a d\u00e9charg\u00e9 le le patron habituel, Aubut de toute responsabilit\u00e9.\nJe vais citer textuellement la r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question qui demandait si l'accident \u00e9tait du a la faute de l'un ou de l'autre des d\u00e9fendeurs ou de tous les deux. Le jury r\u00e9pond:\nThe answer to no. 2 is: we find the Quebec Liquor Commission at fault and solely responsible because of taking temporary control of the employees of Hickey & Aubut and ordering them to close the windows necessitating the removal of some scaffolding due to which the accident occurred and by reason of the negligence of the defendant Quebec Liquor Commission in handling the plank that caused the damage. Unanimous.\nIl n'y a aucune preuve de n\u00e9gligence de la part de la Commission ni de ses employ\u00e9s et elle ne peut \u00eatre tenue responsable de l'accident que si elle s'est constitu\u00e9e le patron momentan\u00e9 des ouvriers d'Aubut selon la doctrine expos\u00e9e plus haut.\nTout ce qui est prouv\u00e9 contre l'appelante, c'est qu'elle a demand\u00e9, avec insistance m\u00eame, que les fen\u00eatres fussent ferm\u00e9es, ce qui, il est vrai, n\u00e9cessitait l'enl\u00e8vement des poutres qu'on avait plac\u00e9es dans les fen\u00eatres; elle n'a pas pris la direction des travaux de d\u00e9molition, et n'avait aucun droit de donner des ordres aux ouvriers quant \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Du reste, nous avons vu qu'Aubut avait assum\u00e9, dans son contrat avec l\u2019appelante, l\u2019obligation de construire l\u2019\u00e9chafaudage. Quand l'ouvrage \u00e9tait termin\u00e9, et il l\u2019\u00e9tait sur la rue des Commissaires, l'appelante pouvait exiger qu'Aubut enlev\u00e2t cet \u00e9chafaudage, et elle n'avait pas d'affaire a Ryan dont le sous-contrat ne lui avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9. Dans les relations entre l'appelante et Aubut, l\u2019enl\u00e8vement des \u00e9chafaudages \u00e9tait l\u2019obligation contractuelle de ce dernier, et l\u2019appelante n'aurait pas engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 en l'exigeant des ouvriers qui repr\u00e9sentaient l'entrepreneur.\nD'autre part, Aubut \u00e9tant un entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant, et l'appelante n'ayant pas la direction des travaux, celle-ci n'est pas responsable de la faute d'Aubut ou de ses ouvriers (Carpentier et du Saint, R\u00e9pertoire, Vo. Responsabilit\u00e9 civile, n\u00b0 593 et suiv.) On objecte qu'Aubut avait d\u00e9fendu a ses hommes de toucher \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chafaudage, mais il n'est pas en preuve que cette d\u00e9fense Mt a la connaissance de l\u2019appelante, et on ne peut dire, comme l'un des honorables juges de la cour d'appel parait l'avoir cru, que l'appelante ait induit les ouvriers \u00e0 manquer \u00e0 leur devoir envers leur patron.\nPosant donc la question comme elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s, je ne vois rien dans la preuve qui put justifier le jury a dire que l'appelante s'est constitu\u00e9e le patron momentan\u00e9 des ouvriers d'Aubut, ou qu'elle en a pris la direction et le contr\u00f4le. C'est comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l'entrepreneur que ces ouvriers ont d\u00e9moli l\u2019\u00e9chafaudage, et Aubut ne pouvait opposer a l\u2019intime la d\u00e9fense qu'il avait faite \u00e0 ses ouvriers d'y toucher. Cette cause ne ressemble en rien \u00e0 la cause de The Central Vermont Railway Company v. Bain[19], o\u00f9 par une convention expresse entre deux compagnies de chemins de fer les employ\u00e9s de Tune des compagnies deve\u00adnaient sujets aux ordres de l'autre des qu'ils entraient sur la ligne de celle-ci. C'est cette circonstance que le tiers acquiert le droit de donner des ordres au pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 d'un Ari patron, et qu'il a, lors de l\u2019accident, une autorit\u00e9 exclusive.\n[1] [1924] Q.R. 36 K.B. 494.\n[2] [1905] 36 Can.

The authority to expunge \"any entry made without sufficient cause\" means without sufficient cause at the time of registration.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court ([1923] Ex. C.R. 65) reversed, Idington and Malouin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] ordering that the entry of \"Aspirin\" as a trade-mark be removed from the registry.\nIn 1899 the Bayer Company of Germany registered in Canada the word \"Aspirin\" as a trade-mark to be applied to pharmaceutical preparations, and in 1913 assigned all its Canadian trade-marks to the Bayer Company of New York which assignment was registered in Canada in 1819 and the New York company shortly after assigned the trade-mark \"Aspirin\" and the goodwill and business connected therewith to the appellant Bayer Co., Ltd., of Canada.\nThe respondent applied to the Exchequer Court to have this trade-mark expunged from the registry and the court so ordered. The main question to be decided on the appeal from the judgment was whether or not the trademark, having been valid when registered, could afterwards be expunged because it had lost its distinctive character and become incapable of registration then.\nNesbitt K.C. and Christopher Robinson K.C. for the appellant. Aspirin is a distinctive word as describing the compound manufactured by the appellant and after the long period of user all presumptions will favour its validity; moreover if there is doubt the appellant should have the benefit of it, the onus being on respondent to prove that it should not have been registered. See Wellcome v. Thompson[2] at pages 749, 750, 757; In re Cheese-borough's Trade-Mark \"Vaseline\"[3] at page 8.\nIf \"Aspirin\" was distinctive when registered it cannot be expunged if it ceases to be so. See remarks of Parker J. in In re Gramophone Company's Application[4] at page 436. Chipman K.C. and Smart for the respondent. Aspirin was always used as the name of the article, not the product. See Linoleum Mfg. Co. v. Nairn[5].\nThe appellant's product is merely a form of acetyl salicylic acid which has been patented by name in the United States. The patent having expired aspirin as describing the patented article has become publici juris. Linoleum Case5. And the same holds where the article is itself publici juris; Leonard & Ellis Trade-Mark v. Wells[6]. And see Philippart v. Wm. Whiteley, Ltd.[7].\nNesbitt K.C. and Christopher Robinson K.C. for the appellant.\nChipman K.C. and Smart for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Audette of the Exchequer Court of Canada whereby that court directed that the specific trademark registered on the 28th April, A.D. 1899, by Farbenfabriken vormals Friedrich Bayer and Company of Elberfeld, Kingdom of Prussia, Empire of Germany, in the Department of Agriculture, now the Department of Trade and Commerce, in Register No. 29, Folio 6889, consisting of the word \"Aspirin\" as applied to the sale of pharmaceutical preparations, should be expunged.\nOn the hearing of this appeal the argument was allowed to extend beyond the usual limits and indeed gave us every opportunity the evidence affords of understanding the basis of the respective contentions on each side.\nI have given the case, since then, much serious consideration, and have come to the conclusion that for the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI am not disposed to write a treatise on the several subjects presented for consideration, but may be permitted to add to the foregoing a few remarks.\nIt would have been much more satisfactory to me had proof been adduced that one Bayer, in Germany, had invented \"Aspirin,\" or its mode of production, and then coined this word \"Aspirin\" (as we have been told was the case) to represent it by way of a registered trademark, and if, as is likely, a patent was got in Germany for the invention, and has probably expired, and all that had been proven, such facts would, in all probability, have ended this long-drawn-out story by the application of the law both here and in England as well as in the United States.\nBy reason of want thereof I do not attach quite as much importance as the learned trial judge does in his reasons so far as founded upon a United States patent brought into this case, and the legal consequences flowing from its expiration.\nIn many indirect ways, however, that story is very important as showing how others of that early period thought it for their interest to register the word \"Aspirin\" in Washington, as a trade-mark.\nHow did he who registered the trade-mark now in question herein allow such a thing to be done?\nWhy did he not, by a little energy, get the counterpart of the one in question herein registered in Washington, and thereby forestall the Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Company of New York, who deposited theirs in the Washington office on the 3rd of April, 1899, though only registered on the 2nd of May, 1899.\nMeantime the trade mark \"Aspirin\" was on its way from the German Farbenfabriken Company to be registered in Canada, and got so, on the 28th of April, 1899, as above stated.\nShortly before, on the 1st August, 1898, one Felix Hoffman of Elberfield, Germany, the home town of the said company which registered the trade-mark in question herein and where it manufactured \"Aspirin,\" was pushing his way to get a patent from the United States for the manufacture of \"Acetyl salicylic acid,\" and got it on the 27th February, 1900, and assigned it to the said Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Company of New York.\nWhat is the true inside meaning of all these movements?\nWas the registration now in question herein but a part of a scheme of the German company to get control of the entire American market, including Canada?\nOn his examination for discovery Frederick Weiss, the president of the appellant company, testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. What is the nature of the business of the company?\u2014A. The manufacture and sale of Bayer Tablets of Aspirin.\nQ. Is that their only business?\u2014A. They are acting as agents for the Winthrop Chemical Company of New York. Q. That is the only manufacturing business you carry on?\u2014A. Yes, that is the only manufacturing business we carry on.\nQ. You have a plant?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Where is that?\u2014A. Windsor, Ontario.\nQ. How long have you had that plant?\u2014A. Well, you mean how long have we owned the property?\nQ. How long have you operated the plant?\u2014A. Since the beginning of the company.\nQ. Did the company succeed to the business of any other firm or corporation?\u2014A. No; it was organized.\nMr. Osier: That is rather ambiguous.\nQ. Did they succeed to the active manufacturing or selling business of any other company?\u2014A. No.\n******\nQ. What line of business were you in previous to that?\u2014A. I was employed by the Sterling Products Inc.\nQ. Dealing with a different line of goods?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And in a different market?\u2014A. In the United States.\nQ. Who are the other officers of the Canadian Company at the present time?\u2014A. Mr. William A. Sloan, he is just a director, Mr. B. W. Tobin, he is a director of the company, and he also acts as salesman for the Bayer Company Limited.\nQ. Any others?\u2014A. Just the three directors.\nQ. What shareholders besides the directors, are in the Bayer Company Ltd.?\u2014A. Just the qualifying shareholders in Canada.\nQ. Who owns the stock?\u2014A. The Bayer Company Inc., of New York.\nQ. During the last two years you have been carrying on an advertising campaign in Canada with reference to the Bayer Aspirin, have you not?\u2014A. The company has.\nQ. The representations contained in the advertisement are the representations which the Bayer Company are making to the public at the present time, and during that campaign?\u2014A. I do not see anything there as being different from the representations made.\n******\nQ. That leaflet, Exhibit 3, contains the phrase: \"Only tablets with the Bayer Cross are Aspirin\u2014no other\"\u2014has that always been on?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Since when?\u2014A. Ever since we started using the circular.\nQ. That was at the beginning of the company two and one-half years ago?\u2014A. Well, I would not say positively that we have been using them that long\u2014we have been using them for quite a while.\nQ. Has that phrase: \"If it is not Bayer, it is not Aspirin\" always been on since you have been president of the company?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Has this further phrase: \"'Get genuine Bayer tablets of Aspirin in a Bayer package, plainly marked with a Bayer Cross because the Bayer Cross is your only way of knowing you are getting genuine Aspirin prescribed by physicians for over 19 years, and proved safe by millions,\" been on this circular since your connection with the company?\u2014A. Since the circular was used.\nQ. I observe at the bottom of the circular it refers to the product as Monoasceticacidester of Salicylic acid\u2014can you tell me whether that product is the product described in United States patent 644074 to Felix Hoffman of February 27, 1900\u2014copy of which I shew you? (Exhibit 4).\u2014 A. I am not a chemist, but it is my understanding that it is identical with the Bayer Manufacture.\nQ. Who is your chemist?\u2014A. The chemist of the Sterling Products Limited.\nQ. Not of the Canadian company?\u2014A. We have no chemist.\nQ. Who supervises the manufacture in Canada?\u2014A. Of what?\nQ. Of Bayer's Aspirin?\u2014A. Tablets?\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. It is manufactured under the druggist or\u2014the registered 3 man is B. W. Tobin.\nExhibit No. 8.\u2014Copy of United States Patent (Hoffman) No. 644077, being said Exhibit No. 4 on examination of Mr. Weiss.\nQ. That is the patent which described the process under which Bayer Tablets of Aspirin are made?\nMr. Osier: The Aspirin; not Bayer Tablets. The tablets are the tablet form of the Salicylic Acid which is called Aspirin when manufactured by the Bayer Company as we like to put it.\u2014A. We do not say Bayer Aspirin\u2014we say Bayer Tablets.\nAnd the suspicion is not only strengthened by this evidence as to the identity of the goods patented by Hoffman with those for which protection is now being sought by the use in an advertising campaign of what is practically an amended edition of the registration now in question, which to me seems bordering on fraud.\nIs the appellant to be permitted to manufacture in Canada such goods as advertised and pass them off as if manufactured by those who got the registration in the first place?\nNor does the story end there, for later on he testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. Is all your product which you sell in Canada, manufactured in Canada?\nMr. Osier: You mean everything they sell?\nMr. Smart: No; all the Bayer Tablets of Aspirin.\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. None of it is purchased from any other firm?\u2014A. No.\nThen let us come to the actual wording of the claim for registration and what was done by the claimant thereof and see what, if anything, done thereunder, and goodwill, if any, is assignable.\nIn specifying, its claim is written thus:\u2014\nThe Farbenfabriken vormals Freidrich Bayer and Company * * * hereby furnishes a duplicate copy of a specific trade-mark to be applied to the sale of pharmaceutical preparations in accordance with sections 4 and 9 of the \"Trade-Mark and Design Act,\" which mark belongs to the Farbenfabriken vormals Friedrich Bayer & Company, by reason of said company having been the first to make use of the same.\nThe said specific trade-mark consists of the arbitrary word \"Aspirin.\" This has been generally arranged as shewn in the accompanying facsimile, in which it appears in plain block letters arranged on a horizontal line; but other forms or type may be employed, or the word may be differently arranged or coloured.\nThe manufacturing, if any, was supposed to have been carried on in Germany but it is to be observed that it does not say, as the terms of section 5 of the Act seem to imply it should, in what way applicable\nto the manufactured product or article of any description manufactured, produced, compounded, packed or offered for sale by him, etc.\nAnd when we come to consider the assignment by said company to the Bayer Company Inc. of New York on the 12th day of June, 1913, we find appended thereto a list of articles with numbers and dates of which \"Aspirin, No. 6889, dated April 28, 1899,\" appears the fourth in said list.\nThis seems to me to indicate that the parties concerned do not seem to have understood the meaning of the trademark in question as covering all pharmaceutical preparations, as it professes to do. And moreover, that it in truth may have been intended to cover only the goods known as \"Aspirin\" at the time.\nIf the latter, then it would seem void ab initio as an attempt to forestall all others then dealing in aspirin and hence void.\nIf it was intended to cover only \"aspirin\" of its own manufacture, it should have been so designated as section 5 of the Act seems to contemplate and provide, and hence is not protected by the Act.\nI make these observations as worthy of consideration, in passing on to the story of the alleged goodwill.\nThe German company pretending to register something, never carried on business in Canada, either as manufacturers of Aspirin or selling it there.\nI asked appellant's counsel and they could only refer to the following evidence of Hargreaves, a witness, who testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ. Have you ever at any time met that acetyl salicylic referred to under any other term than the chemical name?\u2014A. Well, yes. We handled aspirin and recognized it was the same composition, the same chemical.\nQ. And where did you get your aspirin?\u2014A. We got it first, to the best of my recollection, through John Taylor & Co. At that time they were the Canadian agents for the Bayer people.\nHis Lordship: For the Bayer people?\u2014A. For the Bayer people\u2014that would be prior to 1905 first. The only goodwill, if any, that the German company could have to assign was derived from and founded upon orders sent it direct from Canada and filled by it with goods manufactured by it in Germany.\nCan anything therein be a foundation for helping the appellant to acquire the trade-mark of said German company, and use it for goods not manufactured by it, but by appellant in Canada, of same kind as made by virtue of the Hoffman patent, and common to all the world?\nI take it that there must be a goodwill passed to render an assignment of a trade-mark valid.\nSection 15 of the Act is pointed to as of so general a character as to entitle the transfer of that which covers nothing\u2014but the decisions cited to us clearly decide otherwise. A collection of those, and many others, appears on page 9 of Sebastian, 5th ed.\nAnything done as herein by way of ordering from the German company some of its make of aspirin, would not, I submit, constitute, even if acted on then, such a goodwill in it as to lay a foundation for the assignment of 12th June, 1913, under which alone appellant can claim.\nIndeed the privilege would exist in common with all others in the appellant to enable it to make such orders without such assignments.\nThat is not what it wants, but to terrorize others from doing likewise and, by virtue thereof, palm off upon the Canadian public its own aspirin manufactured in Canada.\nI submit the continuation of a trade-mark for such a purpose is not within the scope of the Act, and seems to me such an improper use of it as to alone justify the expunging of the trade-mark as directed by the judgment complained of.\nThe appellant seems to desire to register its own mark, as I understand it has done, and cover it up by the trademark of another. Surely that involves a clear abandonment of the original claimant.\nI am only making the foregoing several suggestions as result of my consideration of a curious case lest some of them may not have been presented at the same angle in the reasons of the learned trial judge, adopted as above.\nDuff J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Audette J., in proceedings commenced by the respondent, the American Druggists' Syndicate, Limited, 'by a petition praying for an order expunging from the register of trademarks the trade-mark \"Aspirin,\" of which the appellant, the Bayer Company, Limited, is the registered owner. This trade-mark was registered on the 28th April, 1899, as a specific trade-mark on the application of Farbenfabriken vorm. Fried. Bayer & Co., which may be referred to as the Bayer Company of Germany, under which the applicant asked for the registration of a specific trade-mark, consisting of the arbitrary word \"Aspirin,\" to be applied to the sale of pharmaceutical preparations. The Bayer Company was engaged in a large way in the business of manufacturing dyes and chemicals at Elberfeld and Leverkusen, in Germany. It and its successors entitled to the Canadian trade-mark have used the mark almost entirely in connection with a preparation made and sold by many others, a chemical compound of which the name is acetyl salicylic acid. On the 12th June, 1913, the Bayer Company of Germany assigned its Canadian trade-marks and the goodwill and business in connection therewith to the Bayer Company, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of New York, the trade-marks so assigned including the trade-mark \"Aspirin.\" In October, 1914, an application was made for the registration of this assignment, but the assignment was not then registered, and by arrangement was retained by the Department of Agriculture for action after the termination of the war. On the 12th December, 1918, the Alien Property Custodian of the United States sold all the issued capital stock of the Bayer Company, Inc., to the Sterling Products, Inc., an American corporation. On the 26th March, 1919, the assignment from the Bayer Company, Inc., was registered in the Canadian Trade-Mark office. In May, 1919, the appellant, the Bayer Company, Limited, was incorporated as a Dominion company, and the whole of the issued capital stock of the company is owned by the Bayer Company, Inc. On the 30th May, 1919, the Bayer Company, Inc., assigned to the appellant the Canadian trade-mark \"Aspirin\" and all the goodwill and business in connection therewith; and on the 31st May, 1919, this assignment was recorded in the Canadian register. In the United Kingdom the Bayer Company of Germany obtained, on the 22nd October, 1899, registration of the word \"Aspirin\" as a trade-mark. In the United States, the Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld, a company incorporated in the State of New York, applied on the 3rd April, 1899, and obtained on the 2nd May, 1899, the registration of the word \"Aspirin\" as a trade-mark under the provisions of the United States Trade-Mark Act. On the 1st August, 1898, Felix Hoffman applied in the United States for a patent for acetyl salicylic acid of which he had invented, as he stated in his specification, a new and a useful improvement. This patent was issued on the 22nd February, 1900, to the Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld of New York, to which Hoffman had previously assigned his rights.\nAcetyl salicylic acid does not appear to have been manufactured in a commercial way until the year 1899. Early in that year the commercial manufacture of the product appears to have begun, the Bayer Company of Germany being one of the earliest of the manufacturers. The article first appeared in Canada in the form of a powder or crystals; later it was sold in the form of compressed tablets; and in recent years its use in the latter form has far exceeded its use in the form of a powder. For many years it was used either as powder or in tablet form in dispensing medical prescriptions, but after the appearance of the article in tablet form a trade which is described by the witness as \"over the counter trade\" began; the customers, that is to say, began to prescribe for themselves and to buy from the druggist without a physician's prescription. The evidence shows that various words have been coined and used as trade names to distinguish a particular manufacture of acetyl salicylic acid; Burroughs Wellcome Co., for example, using the word \"Empirin,\" having formerly used the word \"Xaxa\"; Charles E. Frosst & Co., the word \"Acetophen;\" the National Drug Company, \"Seetosal\"; Henry Wampole & Co., \"Ceteloyd.\"\nIn 1915, the Board of Trade cancelled the registration of the trade-mark \"Aspirin\" in the United Kingdom as from the 22nd December, 1914, under the provisions of special war legislation; and on the 27th February, 1917, Hoffman's patent expired. Thereafter the word \"Aspirin\" came to be used freely by English and American manufacturers as designating acetyl salicylic acid. On the 8th March, 1919, the registration in the United States of the trade-mark \"Aspirin\" was cancelled by the United States Commissioner. After the termination of the war, upon the registration in 1919 of the assignment to the appellant, the appellant began to advertise extensively the sale of acetyl salicylic acid on the Canadian market under the trade name \"Aspirin\" and to assert its rights to the exclusive use of that name as a trade name.\nAudette J. gave judgment in favour of the respondents, expunging the trade-mark. He identified the German Bayer Company, the predecessor of the appellant, with the American company, who became proprietors of the Hoffmann patent, and took the view that from its origin the word \"Aspirin\" had by the Bayers been applied to designate the product protected by the Hoffman patent. The trade, he said, and the public, as a consequence of the issue of the patent, treated the word \"Aspirin\" as a word descriptive of acetyl salicylic acid, a word which he thought had become a common English word. In his view, this was the state of facts at the time of the application of the appellant's predecessors in Canada; and consequently the word \"Aspirin\" was incapable of being registered as a trademark. \"No man can get a monopoly of the English language,\" he says.\nHe also held that the case came within the principle that the word, having been applied by the owner of a patent to designate the product protected by the patent, and the name having thus become descriptive of the thing, everybody in Canada and the United States and elsewhere became entitled in point of law, upon the expiration of the patent, to employ the word to designate the substance. Further, the learned trial judge took the view that the evidence sufficiently established an intention on part of the appellant to abandon \"Aspirin\" as a trade-mark.\nThe Trade-Marks Act provides for a register of trademarks. Sec. 5 describes \"trade-mark\" for the purposes of the Act, and is in these words:\u2014\n5. All marks, names, labels, brands, packages, or other business devices, which are adopted for use by any person in his trade, business, occupation or calling, for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, product or article of any description manufactured, produced, compounded, packed or offered for sale by him, applied in any manner whatever either to such manufacture, product or article, or to any package, parcel, case, box or other vessel or receptacle of any description whatsoever containing the same, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be considered and known as trademarks.\nThe applicant for registration must declare that the trademark\nwas not in use to his knowledge by any other person than himself\nat the time of his adoption of it. By sec. 11, the Minister may refuse to register a trade-mark on certain specified grounds, the only material ones being, first, if ho is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of such trade-mark; and secondly, if the so-called trade-mark does not contain the essentials necessary to constitute a \"trade-mark properly speaking.\" By sec. 13, the applicant, on complying with the provisions of the Act, may\nhave such trade-mark registered for his own exclusive use.\nBy the same section it is provided that upon registration the\nproprietor shall have the exclusive right to use the trade-mark to designate articles manufactured or sold by him.\nBy sec. 17, a specific trade-mark, when registered, is to endure for the term of twenty-five years, but is renewable from time to time for the like term. By sec. 19, a right of action is given to the proprietor against any person who \"uses the registered trade-mark of such proprietor\" or who sells any article bearing the trade-mark; and by sec. 20 it is provided that nobody shall institute any proceedings to prevent the infringement of any trade-mark unless such trade-mark is registered in pursuance of the Act. It is sufficiently clear that a trade-mark, in order to be registrable under the Act, must be something which the applicant is entitled to adopt as distinguishing the articles to which it is applied as his own; and it was not disputed on argument that the trial judge was entirely right in assuming that words merely descriptive at the time of the application could not properly be registered as a trade-mark. Adoption by the applicant for the purpose of distinguishing his goods is the ruling condition. There must, moreover, be adoption for use as a distinguishing mark implying a present bona fide intention to use the mark for such purposes; and indeed the affidavit in the form prescribed by the rules could hardly be made by an applicant who has not, in however limited a degree, actually made use of the mark in respect of which the application is made. If the learned trial judge has correctly appreciated the effect of the evidence adduced in holding that the respondents have established that the word \"Aspirin\" at the time of the application had been given to the world by the applicant as exclusively descriptive of the article and that at that date the word was in fact a word in common use as such, then he was indubitably right in his conclusion that the entry ought to be expunged as having been made without sufficient cause.\nIn considering this question it is not a little important to remember that the onus is upon the respondents. Many decisions might be cited in support of this, but it will be sufficient to mention two: Cheeseboro's Case[8]; Wellcome v. Thomson[9]. It is for the respondents to establish to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact that for the reasons relied upon the trade-mark was registered \"without sufficient cause\"; that is to say, it is for the respondents to show that \"Aspirin\" had not been adopted as a distinctive name in the relevant sense, but was a descriptive name in current use designating the compound to which the appellants seek to apply it as a trade name. If, as Stirling L.J., says in the case last cited,\nany doubt exists, the doubt must be resolved in favour of the trade-mark.\nThe respondents have not, I think, acquitted themselves of this onus.\nThe evidence bearing directly on the state of affairs in 1899 is, as might be expected, very meagre, but there is a mass of evidence derived from the practice of the trade from 1900 or 1902 to 1915, and from medical and pharmaceutical literature published during that period, and from this evidence I draw the conclusion that during that period, to the medical profession, to the wholesale dealers and to manufacturers, \"Aspirin\" was known as a trade name for acetyl salicylic acid, and a trade name owned by the Bayers. There is a good deal of ground, no doubt, for the contention that during the later part of the same period \"Aspirin\" in a loose way was often used as designating the product itself; but nevertheless I think the evidence does establish the proposition that during this period, among the classes of persons I have mentioned, \"Aspirin\" was always known to be, and was recognized as, the trade name of the Bayers.\nImportant evidence is given by wholesale dealers to the effect that Bayers' product, and Bayers' product only, was sold by them under the name of \"Aspirin,\" down to the time when, during the war, the stock of Bayers' product became exhausted. In their price lists, acetyl salicylic acid was listed at one price and \"Aspirin\" at another price, the price of \"Aspirin\" being very much greater, some of the witnesses say four or five times as great, as the price of acetyl salicylic acid. The evidence of Mr. Grant, the Canadian manager of Parke, Davis & Company, and of Mr. Lang, the Canadian manager of Burroughs Wellcome, should be mentioned specially. Parke, Davis & Company did not manufacture acetyl salicylic acid in Canada. They acquired the compound from various sources and compressed it into tablets for the retail trade. It was first bought under the name of \"Aspirin\" in 1906 from the Bayer Company of Germany, and in 1908 acetyl salicylic acid was bought under that name. Down to 1916, when the stock of the Bayer product became exhausted, they listed in their price lists \"Aspirin\" and acetyl salicylic acid. Since then they have listed only acetyl salicylic acid. Mr. Grant says that \"Aspirin\" was recognized as the trade name of the Bayers and scrupulously respected as such. Out of 45,000,000 tablets compressed by them for the Canadian market, only 6,000,000 have been composed of the Bayer product. These have been listed and sold as \"Aspirin,\" the remainder being listed and sold as acetyl salicylic acid, at a much lower price. Mr. Lang says that Burroughs Wellcome Co. from 1906 have listed and sold in Canada tabloid aspirin. These tablets were made exclusively from the Bayer product of acetyl salicylic acid. They sold acetyl salicylic acid during the same period in tabloid form under their own trade name, \"Xaxa.\" Since 1915 they have struck Aspirin from their price list, and replaced it by their own manufacture of acetyl salicylic acid, under a trade name of their own, \"Empirin.\" Other witnesses are quite explicit in the same sense. These witnesses agree that the distinction was well recognized in the trade, as indeed it could hardly fail to be, having regard to the difference in price.\nThe respondents rely chiefly upon the evidence of retail dealers, some of whom say that aspirin and acetyl salicylic acid were used convertibly; that they were accustomed to order acetyl salicylic acid from the wholesalers and get it under the name \"Aspirin \"; that when aspirin was prescribed, acetyl salicylic acid was used to fill the prescription. They also say that in the \"over the counter trade,\" from about 1908 onwards, customers did not distinguish between aspirin and other products. This, however, must be observed, the evidence given by the wholesale dealers referred to shows that when aspirin was ordered from them, aspirin and aspirin only was supplied except in the few cases where it was plain that what was really wanted was acetyl salicylic acid, and not necessarily aspirin. With hardly an exception, the wholesale dealers who gave evidence say that they did not sell acetyl salicylic acid, other than the Bayer product, under the name of aspirin. Moreover, all of the retail dealers but one purchased from Parke, Davis & Co., and had Parke, Davis & Co's. price lists, and must have known that aspirin was sold at a much higher price than other manufactures of acetyl salicylic acid. The practice of the other large dealers was similar. It is highly improbable, if, indeed, it is at all credible, that a dealer to whom the distinction between aspirin and acetyl salicylic acid was of no importance would knowingly order aspirin and pay the higher price for it, or that the distinction was not perfectly well understood by the retail dealers, as well as the wholesale dealers. Moreover, the price lists filed show in nearly 'half of them aspirin distinguished from acetyl salicylic acid, with widely differing prices. In the others, aspirin alone is given, but at prices which, when compared with the others, suggest, in a large number of these, that it is the Bayer product which is indicated. As to prescriptions, a majority of prescription druggists undoubtedly do say that they used the product of any manufacturer to fill a prescription. About one-third of them, however, declare that they used the Bayer product so long as it was available. Most of the retailers say that their first knowledge of acetyl salicylic acid was of the Bayer product, which they received in one-ounce packages of powder, marked \"Bayer & Co.,\" and \"Aspirin.\" Many of these witnesses say that very shortly afterwards, almost simultaneously, they acquired a knowledge of other manufactures of acetyl salicylic acid, while the remainder, with two or three exceptions, say that they acquired that knowledge from two to three years afterwards. There is another observation which must be made with regard to the evidence of these witnesses: It is quite plain that a marked change took place after the commencement of the war, and especially after the cancellation of the British trade-mark and the expiry of the Hoffman patent. From that time on, in England and the United States, as well as in Canada, the free use of the word \"Aspirin\" no doubt greatly expanded; in Canada the German company was still the registered owner of the trade-mark and could not, of course, maintain during the war an action for infringement; and all the witnesses were speaking under impressions derived from the experiences of the preceding-five to eight years. Allowance must be made for this; indeed, all the evidence of these witnesses must be read in light of it. Even then it should be observed that one of the respondents' witnesses, Henry Willis, who has been in business for twenty-two years in Quebec and is one of the Board of Commissioners of the Pharmaceutical Society, says that every druggist knows that \"Aspirin\" is only a trade name or coined name, applied to acetyl salicylic acid. The conclusion which I draw from the evidence given from the practice of the wholesale dealers, the book of publications and the price lists, is, as I have stated above, that \"Aspirin\" was understood to be a distinctive name for the Bayer product; that other producers recognized it as such, and adopted their own distinctive names; that, generally, the distinction must have been known to the medical profession. In the early years, that is to say before 1908, it must also, I think, have been recognized by the retail dealers. Although there is some disagreement, there is a preponderance of evidence by such dealers pointing to the year 1900 as marking the beginning of the period when acetyl salicylic acid began to be widely known to the trade in Canada. As I have said, these witnesses usually say that it was through the Bayer product, and under the name \"Aspirin,\" that acetyl salicylic acid was first brought to their attention.\nAs already observed, the onus is upon the appellants to establish their contention that at the date of registration, in the year 1899, \"Aspirin.\" was a term descriptive of the compound acetyl salicylic acid, and as such, incapable of being registered as a trade-mark. The general recognition of the name as the trade name of the Bayers by the classes of persons specially interested in the subject over a considerable period of years beginning soon after registration, coupled with the lapse of time, greatly augments the weight of the presumption which the respondents must overcome.\nThere is some evidence that acetyl salicylic acid was imported from Switzerland under the name \"Aspirin,\" but the source of production is not identified, and the evidence as to date is very vague and unreliable. Two witnesses mentioned the year 1898 as the year of their first acquaintance with the Word \"Aspirin\" as designating a.s.a. The testimony of these witnesses is most unsatisfactory, and there is not a scrap of documentary or other evidence to support their recollection. The only label of the earlier years which is connected with a European product other than Bayers' is one of the year 1904, a label for the product of a Swiss firm in B\u00e2sle; and on it the word \"Aspirin\" does not appear. Generally it may be said, as to the evidence by retail witnesses who speak of sales of acetyl salicylic acid, other than the Bayer product, under the name \"Aspirin,\" that besides the difficulty of drawing anything like a confident conclusion as to dates, there was the circumstance that few of the witnesses saw the drug so labelled in the original package, and the original source of supply is consequently left in doubt. The evidence is altogether too vague and unsatisfactory to form the basis of a judicial decision that the respondents have established the use of the name as a descriptive name prior to registration in 1899 or have established that the appellants' predecessors were not the first to adopt and use \"Aspirin\" as a trade name.\nIn deciding that, at the time of the application the name \"Aspirin\" was descriptive of the thing in such a way as to exclude distinctiveness in the pertinent sense, the learned judge bases his view mainly upon the Hoffman patent. The fact that the patent having been granted in the year in which application for the Canadian trademark was made, appears to the learned judge to be conclusive against the appellants in two ways: First, as establishing conclusively the fact that the name \"Aspirin\" was at the date of the application descriptive of the drug in such a way as to exclude distinctiveness; and secondly, as bringing into operation a supposed rule of law that in such circumstances the appellant is in point of law precluded from asserting proprietorship of the name.\nNeither in the application for the Hoffman patent nor in the specification is there any reference to the word \"Aspirin.\" The patent is a patent for acetyl salicylic acid. Even in the United States, the territory in which the patent ran, I do not think it would have been theoretically impossible for the patentee to assert and maintain his right to the exclusive use of \"Aspirin\" as a trade name. The practical difficulty, of course, might have been insuperable, but if they could have succeeded in controlling the use of the word \"Aspirin\" and the signification attached to it by the public generally in such a way that, while signifying acetyl salicylic acid, it at the same time connoted the fact that it was made by the patentee\u2014in other words, if he had succeeded in controlling the use of the word in such a way that in the minds of people seeing the word, it denoted acetyl salicylic acid, made by them\u2014I do not know why, at the expiration of the patent, he should not be still entitled to say that this word was his word. Parker J., said in Burberry v. Cording & Co.[10]\nI do not agree with the argument that a word cannot be at the same time both descriptive and distinctive.\nIf \"Aspirin\" had been the only word which could be used for the purpose of denoting the patented article, the respondents' contention might have been well-nigh unanswerable. But here we are confronted by a very different state of facts. Both in the application and in the specification, the name given to the patented compound is \"acetyl salicylic acid,\" and the word \"Aspirin\" nowhere appears. During the currency of the patent, as already observed, \"acetyl salicylic acid\" was constantly used as descriptive of the article. In the British Pharmacopoeia, for example, aspirin is not mentioned. In the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (1911), aspirin is only mentioned as one of a number of trade names; and where, as here, the patent runs in a limited territory, and that a foreign territory, while the article is an article known the world over by a designation other than the alleged trade name, the argument relied on seems to have little cogency.\nIn the Vaseline Case[11] which apparently did not attract the attention of the learned trial judge at all, there was a patent in the United States, and during the life of it the patented product was produced in England, not only by the owner of the patent, who sold it under the name of \"Vaseline,\" which he had given to it in his American patent, but by others, and it was sold under different names; and it was held that the name was not incapable of being owned as a trade name. By Cozens Hardy L.J., as well as by the other Lords Justices, the question whether or not \"Vaseline\" had become the name of the article in such a way as to exclude the possibility of using it distinctively as the product of the manufacturer, and whether the manufacturer, by attaching it to the patented article in his specification, had precluded himself from claiming a title to it as a trade name, were treated as questions of fact. Whether on the facts that case was rightly or wrongly decided is of very little importance here. It is conclusive against the contention that, by virtue of the fact alone that the appellant's predecessors had patented the article in the United States, the appellant is precluded from claiming the exclusive right to use the word here as a distinctive name.\nI turn now to the important question of the authority of the Exchequer Court under section 42 of the Trade-Marks Act, which is as follows:\n42. The Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the register of trade-marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the court thinks fit; or the court may refuse the application.\n2. In either case, the court may make such order with respect to the costs of the proceedings as the court thinks fit. 3. The court may in any proceedings under this section, decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide for the rectification of any such register.\nThe authority to expunge entries in the register arises from this section, and from this section alone; and in order to bring a case within the section it must, it would appear, rest upon the allegation that the entry sought to be expunged is an \"entry made without sufficient cause.\" On behalf of the appellants it is contended that the jurisdiction arises only when it appears that the entry was one which, on the facts existing at the time it was made, can be held to have been made without sufficient cause. On behalf of the respondents it is contended, and the learned trial judge has held, that although a trade-mark has been properly registered if, after the registration, a state of facts comes into existence and it can truly be said that, on that state of facts, the trade-mark is one which ought not to be on the register, then there is jurisdiction to expunge it under this section. The learned trial judge relies upon some observations of Lindley M.R., in a case of In re Batt & Co.[12]. In that case Romer J., before whom the application came in the first instance, found as a fact that the trademark in dispute had been placed upon the register by a person who had in fact no intention to use it as a trade-mark at all; and on the principle that it is a condition of the right to register a trade-mark that there should be a user in fact or a bona fide intention to use the trade-mark as such, he held that the trade-mark had not been properly registered, and that the entry ought therefore to be expunged. This was decided upon the authority of Edwards v. Dennis[13]. In the Court of Appeal Romer J's. findings on the facts were affirmed and his judgment was upheld on the principle just mentioned. The Master of the Rolls, however, speaking for the court, dealing with sec. 90 of the English Act of 1883, which corresponds in all pertinent respects with sec. 42 of the Canadian Act, said that the court was not disposed to put a narrow construction on the expression, \"entry made without sufficient cause in the register,\" nor to read it as if the word \"made\" were the all-important word, and as if the words, \"made without sufficient cause,\" were, \"made without sufficient cause at the time of registration,\" so as to be confined to that precise time. He added:\nIf any entry is at that time on the register without sufficient cause, however it got there, it ought, in our opinion, to be treated as covered by the words of the section. The continuance there can answer no legitimate purpose; its existence is purely baneful to trade, and in our opinion in the case supposed, the court has power to expunge or vary it.\nThis is, of course, a very weighty opinion, and it was unquestionably one of the grounds of the decision, but there was an appeal to the House of Lords, and on that appeal, while the judgment was affirmed upon the ground on which the judgment of Romer J., was based, it is a fair conclusion I think, from the language of Lord Halsbury, that their lordships were by no means convinced that the principle laid down in the passage cited above from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was one which ought to have the assent of their lordships. The learned trial judge is evidently under a misapprehension as to what occurred in the House of Lords, because he states or implies that the passage in the judgment of the Master of the Rolls which I have epitomized was approved by the Lord Chancellor and the Law Lords.\nIn England, by the Trade-Marks Act of 1905, specific authority was given to the court on the application of any aggrieved person to remove a registered trade-mark from the register on the ground that it was registered by the proprietor or his predecessor without any bona fide intention to use it, and there is in fact no bona fide use of it in the goods in respect to which it has been registered, or on the ground that there has been no bona fide use of any such connection within five years immediately preceding the application. And there is general authority to remove any entry wrongfully remaining on the register. This legislation, it will be observed, (in a limited degree only) applies the principle laid down by Lindley M.R., in the passage quoted above. But I have been unable to discover any satisfactory evidence that the views expressed by the Master of the Rolls in Batt's Case[14] have been accepted as enunciating a rule which can be derived from a proper interpretation of the statute law as it stood under the Act of 1883. In the fifth edition of Kerly on Trade-Marks it is stated, at p. 344, that no order was made, it is believed, under the earlier Acts, for the removal of a trade-mark originally rightly registered,\nand there appears to be a concurrence of rather weighty opinion that on an application under the Act of 1883 to remove a mark from the register, the question whether the mark was entitled to registration must be decided as at the date when registration was effected. Sebastian on Trade-Marks, p. 634; Wood v. Lambert[15]; Barlow & Jones v. Johnson & Co.[16]; In re Appolinaris Co.[17]; In re Bovril T.M.[18]; In re Burroughs Wellcome Co.[19]. Whatever be the rule in other cases, particularly in cases of non-user\u2014 that is to say, where there has not been any user or where there has been no user in connection with the goods in respect of which the mark is registered\u2014it seems clear that loss of distinctiveness because of the trade-mark becoming descriptive after registration, by reason of causes arising in the ordinary course of trade, is not a ground for rectifying the register under sec. 42.\nThere are some observations of Lord Parker, then Mr. Justice Parker, which may properly be read in this connection: First, I refer to his judgment in Philippart v. Whiteley[20]:\nUnder the principles of law applicable to trade-marks before any legislation on the subject, no mark was protected unless at the time of the alleged infringement it was being used for the purpose of distinguishing, and did distinguish, the goods of the owner from the goods of other people. By reason of the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of taking a mark off the register when once it has been properly put on under the Acts, it became possible for a trader to cease using his registered mark for its legitimate purpose as a trade-mark without losing the benefit of his registration. Indeed, if he could identify his mark in the public mind with the article sold, it was to his advantage so to do, for he could thus, by preventing the sale of the article under the name by which it was known to the public, obtain a practical monopoly. I am inclined to think that the Act of 1905 has in part provided a remedy for this indirect result of trade-mark legislation. For by virtue of the definition clause a registrable mark must, at the date of the application for registration, if not used at any rate be intended to be used for the purpose for which alone, prior to the Acts, the courts would have given a mark protection; and on the principle of In re Batt & Co's. Trade-Marks[21], the intention of the application for registration may be gathered from his subsequent conduct; and again it may be that s. 37 will be construed as enabling the courts to remove a mark which has ceased to be used, or has never been used, for the legitimate purposes of a trade-mark.\nThen, in The Gramophone Company's application[22] there is this passage:\u2014\nNone of the trade-marks Acts have provided machinery for taking a mark off the register if once it has been properly put on, and it is quite unnecessary in an action for infringement of a registered mark to prove that such mark still remains distinctive of the goods of the registered proprietor. It may, therefore, be to the interest of the registered proprietor of a word mark that the word should lose its distinctiveness so far as the public are concerned and become the popular name for the article. He thus obtains a practical and perpetual monopoly of the article itself, other manufacturers being precluded by the mark on the register from selling their goods under the name by which they are commonly known. To induce the public to adopt a catching word as the name of the article to which it is applied, especially if the article be comparatively new, it is only necessary to advertise the article on a sufficiently large scale under that name, and this can be done by any rich corporation. Such a procedure would, or might, have been fatal to any remedy based upon common law rights, but does not affect the value of a registered mark the distinctiveness of which is assumed and need never be proved. Indeed, no evidence to prove that a registered mark was no longer distinctive would be in any way relevant. The old action for infringement of a common law trade-mark was based only on the duty of the court to prevent fraud and deceit, and the loss of distinctiveness was, therefore, fatal to its success. It is, however, one thing to put a word mark on the register and then proceed to induce the public to use it as the name of the article to which it is applied, and quite another thing to adopt a word already used to denote a particular article, and then proceed to identify it among the trade with the goods of a particular manufacturer, relying on such identification as a reason for registration.\nAnd again, on p. 437, he observes that a registered trademark cannot be taken off the register,\nthough it has ceased to be used for the legitimate purpose of a trade-mark and has become merely the name of an article.\nIn Burberry v. J. C. Cording Co.[23], Lord Parker (then Parker J.) reverts to the subject in these words:\u2014\nWith the example before them of a foreigner who, by the judicious choosing of a likely word, the word \"vaseline,\" by registering it under the Trade-Marks Act, and by subsequently advertising and using it as the name of the preparation from petroleum to which it was applied, has secured a practical monopoly in that preparation in the United Kingdom, it is not unlikely that the ingenuity of manufacturers or traders should be devoted to devising a similar mode of procedure in the case of their own goods, for a monopoly thus obtained may be more valuable than any patent. It is well to remember, however, that apart from registration under the Acts, this mode of procedure may have its own disadvantages. Apart from those Acts, it is dangerous for a trader to allow the word he chooses to become the popular name of the article to which it is applied, and it is dangerous to choose a descriptive word. If the word is descriptive or becomes the name of the article, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove that it is distinctive of his own goods or that there will be any deception in its use by others, and apart from the Trade-Marks Acts, the right of any one to the exclusive use of a word is always limited by the possibilities of its use by others without any risk of deception.\nMy conclusion is that Batt's Case[24] has not been considered an authority for the proposition for which it is cited, and having regard to what occurred in the House of Lords, I think we are not strictly bound by it. Hack v. The London and Provident Building Society[25].\nOn behalf of the respondent it is suggested that the rights of the respondent are not limited by the language of sec. 42. Sec. 23 of the Exchequer Court Act is invoked. It is argued that the effect of this section is to give an unlimited discretion to the court to correct the register. The section itself does not profess to deal with substantive law; it is an enactment conferring jurisdiction; and the rule by which the court is to be guided in exercising its jurisdiction is, in cases such as that now before us, to be found in sec. 42 of the Trade-Marks Act. The proceeding is a statutory proceeding, and the right of the respondent is a special statutory right, and the conditions of the right must be sought in the terms of the enactment out of which it arises.\nWhat I have said has an important bearing upon the only remaining contention I think it necessary to discuss, that, namely, the respondent was entitled to succeed on the ground that the registered trade-mark had been abandoned; first, because for many years, to the knowledge, and inferentially with the acquiescence of the appellant's predecessors, the name \"Aspirin\" had been used by the druggists and the public as descriptive of the drug acetyl salicylic acid without any connotation connecting it with the proprietors of the trade-mark as producers or sellers; secondly, because of various dealings with the trade-mark since 1913 and public advertising by the respondents since 1919, and because of the action of the respondents in obtaining certain trade-marks in the year 1920.\nWith respect to all these contentions there is, I think, the insuperable objection that sec. 42 of the Trade-Marks Act confers no authority to give effect to them in a proceeding for expunging an entry in the register. I will not repeat what I have already said, but it is proper to observe that Bowden Wire Co. v. Bowden Drake Co.[26], a decision upon which the respondents largely rely, appears to have proceeded upon the authority given by sec. 35 of the Act of 1905; an authority which, as already mentioned, is much more comprehensive than that under sec. 42. In the Court of Appeal[27] Lord Sumner (then Hamilton L.J.) emphasizes the 'circumstance that the application is an application under sec. 35, a circumstance which is also mentioned in the argument of Sir Alfred Cripps, at p. 586.\nThe first argument advanced by the respondents in support of their theory of abandonment is, I think, completely answered by what I have already said. The observations of Parker J., in the cases above cited, are sufficient to refute any suggestion that the fact that the name \"Aspirin\" became in the minds of the general public descriptive is in itself satisfactory evidence of an intention to abandon the trade-mark. And these observations, moreover, establish, in my opinion, that in the existing state of law the facts relied upon cannot constitute a proper ground for expunging the trade-mark from the register.\nAs to the second contention, it has already been observed that the assignment from the German company to the New York company was only registered in 1919. During the whole of the period of the war the German company was the registered proprietor of the trade-mark and, as mentioned above, obviously during that period could not have maintained an action for infringement. In point of fact, therefore, there would appear to be, to put it at the lowest, a great deal of difficulty in inferring from the free use of \"Aspirin,\" which no doubt did occur during that period as a name descriptive of acetyl salicylic acid, any intention on the part of the proprietors of the trade-mark to abandon their rights. The learned trial judge observes upon the fact that during this time the proprietor was an American company which refused to furnish aspirin; but in the absence of some evidence as to the real owners of the business of this company that circumstance can be regarded as of very little significance; and it is to be noted in this connection that, as above mentioned, in December, 1918, the Alien Property Custodian of the United States sold the shares of the New York company. Having regard to the order on the subject of industrial property made pursuant to the Treaty of Peace in 1920, the respondents cannot, I think, gain any advantage from the occurrences during the period of the war relied upon by the learned trial judge.\nThen it is argued that the assignment to the New York company in 1913, and again the assignment to the Canadian company in 1920, had the effect of separating the ownership of the trade-mark from the ownership of the goodwill which, on the principle of Bowden's Case[28], gives, it is said, a right to require the cancellation of the trade-mark. I have already mentioned that this case proceeded on the authority given by sec. 35 of the Act of 1905. Then the principle of Bowden's Case28 is, that under that section the registered proprietor of a trademark who, representing to the public by registering the mark and retaining it on the register, that the goods bearing the mark are goods manufactured and sold by him, and who does nevertheless enter into an arrangement by which he precludes himself from using the mark to distinguish his own goods, while authorizing another to use it for distinguishing his manufacture, is thereby wrongfully misusing the rights conferred upon him by the Act, and his trade-mark may be expunged as one which is wrongfully remaining on the register. In the House of Lords the principle is affirmed. The gist of the offence was, as Lord Loreburn says:\u2014\nIt is enough that they, the registered proprietors, enabled or allowed people who were not registered for it to use the trade-mark on a substantial scale for their make of a description of goods dealt with habitually in the same class of business.\nThe speeches of the Law Lords are to the same effect. I think there is no evidence to support a conclusion that any such offence has been committed by the appellants or their predecessors. It is entirely consistent with any evidence in the record that the New York Company and the German company were under a common control at the time of the assignment in 1913. There is no evidence that in the commercial sense there was any separation of the proprietorship of the trade-mark from the ownership of the business, including the goodwill of the business. The sale of the shares of the New York company by 'the Alien Property Custodian cannot, I think, affect the matter. The whole of the business and assets of the New York company, including its goodwill and trade-marks, came under the 'control of the purchaser of the shares. There is nothing to show that production was not carried on in New York. Nor, again, can we on the evidence attach any importance to the assignment in 1920 to the Canadian company. The shares of the Canadian company were owned by the New York company. There was common control of the New York company and the Canadian company, and again, in substance, no such severance as that struck at by the decision in Bowden's Case[29] and the cases which preceded it.\nAs to the conduct of the appellants in 1919 and 1920, which establishes, in the opinion of the learned trial judge, an intention to abandon their rights, his view can best be gathered from one or two paragraphs of his judgment, which I quote:\u2014\nLooking into this literature and advertising campaign of the objecting party, the new Canadian company, one is primarily struck with the total absence of the word \"Aspirin\" appearing by itself. Numerous samples of such advertising have been produced as Exhibit No. 19, and from the perusal of this very literature is found an admission of the general existence of the drug \"Aspirin\" as distinct from the \"Aspirin\" that is being sold by the objecting party.\nTaken at random, one finds one sample stating: \"There is only one genuine 'Aspirin' \"\u2014and that genuine Aspirin has Bayer cross and that indeed is accompanied by a label showing a round tablet with the word BAYER written perpendicularly and horizontally within the circle. There can only be one meaning resulting from such language, and that is there exists some other \"Aspirin\" besides the one sold by us with our trademark of the Bayer cross, and that these advertisements claim that the \"Aspirin\" manufactured and sold by Bayer is better and preferable, from their own standpoint, from the other \"Aspirin\" on the market, manufactured or sold by anybody else.\nAnd these samples which are numerous and varied but all to the same effect, are in the aggregate a distinct and definite manifestation of the real and intentional abandonment of the use of the word \"Aspirin\" alone and by itself, as registered, and further, a declaration or notice to the public that in future they intend to use the word as the name of the drug but with their own name attached thereto to show it has been manufactured by them.\nThis intention is further manifested in a tangible and open manner by, I may say, the objecting party in 1919. Indeed, on the 8th August, 1919, the Bayer Co., Inc., of New York, registered two new trade-marks: one registered in Register No, 105, folio 24895 (Exhibit No. 96), and the other in the same register but under folio No. 24896 (Exhibit No. 95). These trade-marks also registered by the Bayer Co. of New York in August, 1919, were respectively assigned to the present objecting party, the Bayer Co. Ltd., of the city of Toronto, on the 15th May, 1920.\nThe trade-mark registered under folio No. 24895 is a specific trademark to be applied to the sale of synthetic coal-tar remedies, chemicals, medicines and pharmaceutical preparations of every kind and description, and which consists of the word \"BAYER.\"\nThe other trade-mark under folio No. 24896 is also a specific trademark to be applied to the sale of synthetic coal-tar remedies, chemicals, medicines and pharmaceutical preparations of every kind and description, and which consists of a conjunction of letters in the form of a cross having four arms of equal length, the said letters being \"BAYER,\" arranged horizontally and vertically at right angles in the form of a cross, the letter \"Y\" forming the centre of such cross.\nIt is quite significant, indeed, that these two trade-marks should be taken and registered with respect to synthetic coal-tar remedies. Aspirin is a coal-tar drug.\nThese two new trade-marks can readily be applied to coal-tar drugs, and ever since 1919, by reference to Exhibit No. 19, it will be seen that they were used with the word \"Aspirin.\" The only deduction and inference to be drawn from the fact of getting these two new trade-marks and using them ever since 1919, as shown by Exhibit No. 19, in union and with the trade-mark for the word \"Aspirin\" alone, in 1899, is a clear manifestation of the intention of the objecting party (presumably acknowledging it has no right to) not to use the word \"Aspirin\" by itself, but to associate it, as it has done, with both trade-marks taken out in 1919 and assigned to it in 1920. The label with the combined words of \"Bayer\" and \"Aspirin\" never appeared on the Canadian market until 1919.\nFirst, as to the advertising, I find myself unable to accept the view that the public announcements that the only \"genuine Aspirin\" is Aspirin sold, under a given label, manifest a \"real and intentional abandonment\" of the appellant's right in the word \"Aspirin\" as registered. If \"Aspirin\" denotes and distinguishes acetyl salicylic acid made by the registered proprietors, which is the claim involved in the maintenance of the name on the Trade-Mark Register, then the assertion that their manufacture of acetyl salicylic acid is the only genuine Aspirin is strictly and literally true. The assertion is only one way of affirming their claim to the exclusive use of the word in connection with acetyl salicylic acid. If, on the other hand, the appellant has no such rights, and if the word \"Aspirin\" has acquired droit de cite as descriptive of the product as a chemical compound or article of commerce, then the assertion that its make is the only genuine aspirin is only a rather discreditable and futile puff, if not patently untruthful.\nAs to the trade-marks, I cannot agree that in applying for and obtaining registration of other trade-marks for coal-tar products the appellant was necessarily disclosing an intention to abandon their rights in relation to \"Aspirin\"; nor do I think that their conduct in so doing in the circumstances is a satisfactory foundation for inferring the existence of such an intention.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the petition dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The situation graphically depicted by Parker J. (afterwards Lord Parker of Waddington) in the Gramophone Case[30], would aptly describe that which, according to the evidence, exists to-day with respect to the drug \"aspirin.\" The only difference\u2014but of course it is a vital one\u2014is that in the Gramophone Case30 this situation preceded the application for registration of the trademark, whereas in this case it is subsequent thereto, so that the problem now under consideration is the converse of that dealt with in the Gramophone Case30. It is shewn that since a.s.a. was put on the market, while the wholesale and probably also the retail trade has associated the word \"aspirin\" with the manufacture of the owners of the trademark, the public\u2014by which I mean those who purchase from retail druggists in what has been described as an \"over the counter trade\"\u2014looks on \"aspirin\" as the name of a popular drug, without any reference to a particular manufacturer. Such a situation, which, in the Gramophone Case30 was fatal to the application for registration, as a trademark, of the word \"gramophone,\" is not, the appellant contends, for it was subsequent to registration, a sufficient cause to have the registration of its trade-mark \"aspirin\" expunged from the register.\nThe appellant's proposition is that the question as to the distinctiveness of its trade-mark should be formulated as follows: Was the word \"aspirin\" distinctive of the manufacture of the registrant at the date of registration? It may be observed that the distinctiveness of a registered trademark is assumed in the sense that the onus of proving that it was not, when registered, a distinctive trade-mark, is upon any person questioning its validity. So here the onus is on the respondent, the petitioner, of shewing that the word \"aspirin\" was not distinctive at the date of registration. That date, in my opinion, is the only one to be considered in such an inquiry, and the situation which subsequently developed, and the fact that now the trade-mark may have lost its distinctiveness in the eyes of the public, are not reasons for deciding that the registration, when made, was not a proper registration.\nBearing this in mind, we find that, at the date of registration, the drug itself, \"acetyl salicylic acid,\" which will be more conveniently referred to as \"a.s.a.,\" was a comparatively newly discovered drug, and the German manufacturers coined the fancy word \"aspirin\" to distinguish their manufacture. When this word was registered in Canada, it was not in connection with \"a.s.a.\" or any particular drug, but it was a specific trade-mark to be applied to the sale of pharmaceutical preparations. The feature of specific as opposed to general trade-marks is, I understand, peculiar to the Canadian trade-mark Act, and under such a registration the word \"aspirin\" could have been used in connection with the sale of pharmaceutical preparations of various kinds. But from the first it appears to have been exclusively applied to the drug \"a.s.a.\" And there is a preponderance of evidence that with the trade, particularly the wholesale trade, \"aspirin\" was understood as meaning the \"a.s.a.\" manufactured by the Bayer company. The two terms \"acetyl salicylic acid\" and \"aspirin\" co-existed and were employed for the same drug, and what is rather significant from the point of view of distinctiveness is that the Bayer product was sold under the name of \"aspirin,\" at from two to three times the price of \"a.s.a.\" There was obviously something in the name, as the uninformed public found to its cost.\nI do not think therefore that the respondent has made out a case of improper registration. On the issue of abandonment, its evidence seems much stronger; but its misfortune is that section 42 of the Canadian Act, unlike section 35 of the English Act of 1905, does not provide for the removal from the register of marks which, although entitled to registration when the trademark was obtained, can be said to be \"wrongly remaining on the register.\" I am not dealing here with defences to an action for infringement, but with an application for the removal of the trade-mark from the register. And whatever effect, if any, abandonment and non-user may have as against an action for infringement, a point on which it is unnecessary to express an opinion, I do not find that section 42 has provided for the removal from the register of a trademark, properly registered, by reason of subsequent abandonment or non-user.\nThe respondents rely on the dictum of Lindley M.R., in the Batt Case[31], that if an entry is at any time on the register without sufficient cause, however it got there, it ought to be treated as covered by the words of the section. It was not, however, necessary in that case to place this construction on section 90 of the English Act of 1883, similar to our section 42, for the trial judge had found that there was no bona fide intention to use the mark at the time the registration was effected, and when the case went to the House of Lords[32], the dictum in question was not mentioned, although the decision was affirmed on the facts. I have been unable to read this meaning into section 42 of the Canadian Act.\nAll this shews that a practically perpetual monopoly is secured to the owner of a trade-mark validly registered although in the eyes of the public it has come to signify the thing itself and not the manufacturer. The appellant company has no exclusive right to the use of the word \"aspirin\" in Great Britain and the United States, but this judgment will give it in 'Canada a monopoly of the sale of \"a.s.a.\" when sold under the name of \"aspirin.\" In that way a registered trade-mark, which has become descriptive by reason of dealings with the public or an advertising campaign, is more valuable than a patent the life of which is limited. Such a situation could well be considered by Parliament. On the whole I think the appeal should be allowed and the petition dismissed. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nMalouin J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Audette in the Exchequer Court.\nMaclean J.\u2014These proceedings were commenced by the respondent as petitioner, under the provisions of sec. 42 of the Trade-Marks and Designs Act to expunge from the register the word \"Aspirin\" registered as a specific trademark by the appellant's predecessors in title in April, 1899. The history of the title of this registered mark has already been stated and I need not repeat it, and it appears as well in the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThe respondent's principal contention is that this trademark was originally made without sufficient cause, and alternatively that if the mark ever had any validity, it has since ceased to be a trade-mark and should now be expunged. The appellant submits that it is a valid and subsisting trade-mark, and particularly urges as the important consideration, the question whether or not at the time of registration the word \"Aspirin\" was properly registered, and if so the appellant submits it cannot now be removed from the register even if it has since become to denote to the public the name of a chemical compound, and not to distinguish the article itself as manufactured by the proprietor of the registered trade-mark. This I think reveals the substantial issue, although other and perhaps quite important points have been put before us.\nThe case is not without its difficulties both as to the law and the facts, and the latter are before us in confusing abundance. I confess that at first I was much impressed by the conclusions of the trial judge, and the submissions of the respondent's counsel, but a later review of the authorities and the evidence, leads me to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed.\nThe substantial issue for determination in my opinion is, whether the word \"Aspirin\" at the time of registration in Canada as a trade-mark, was also adopted as the name of the patented chemical compound, acetyl salicylic acid, or descriptive of it; or whether it was a mark proposed to be used in connection with certain goods, for the purpose of distinguishing the goods of the proprietor of such mark, and further, if this registered mark has subsequently ceased to be used for the legitimate purposes of a trade-mark, and has owing to one cause or another become known to the trade or the public as the name of the article itself, may it now be expunged from the register.\nUnder our Trade-Marks and Designs Act a specific trademark, when registered, shall endure for the term of twenty-five years, but may be renewed by the proprietor for further twenty-five year periods. The Minister in whose department is administered the Trade-Marks and Designs Act may refuse registration if he is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of such trade-mark, or if it resembles a trade-mark already issued, or if it is calculated to deceive or mislead the public, or if the mark does not contain the essentials necessary to constitute a trade-mark properly speaking. Then section 42 which authorizes proceedings for the rectification of the register is as follows:\u2014\n42. The Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the register of trade-marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any such register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the court thinks fit; or the court may refuse the application.\n3. The court may in any proceedings under this section, decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide for the rectification of any such register. 54-55 V., c. 35, s. 1.\nThere are no other provisions in this statute providing for rectification of the register. It is contended that this section provides no machinery for expunging or varying any trade-mark except one registered originally without sufficient cause, and that the validity of a trade-mark is to be determined as and of the date of registration.\nThe statute which concerns us here is an old one; sec. 42, having been enacted in 1891, did not I think anticipate the trend of trade-mark uses and practices of recent years, and the influence of modern advertising in converting, perhaps, a word, being a proper trade-mark when registered and distinguishing merely the goods of the proprietor from the goods of another, into a word denoting to the public mind the name of the article itself. No provision seems to have been made for removing a mark from the register when gradually or suddenly, by lawful business processes and influences, it has grown to become the popular name of the article, and would have been refused registration had the application for registration been made when the word had taken in its later significance.\nThere can be but one moment when an entry is made; it is not by any legal fiction, or in fact, a continuing process. It appears to me that \"entry\" and \"without cause\" must be read to mean a ministerial act synchronising with an existing set of facts in law or in fact fatal to the validity of a trade-mark, and not severed by time from the genesis of that set of facts. If the \"cause\" putting the trade-mark without the spirit of the statute develops subsequent to the \"entry,\" the \"entry\" would have no relation to the \"cause,\" and one could hardly say it was an entry made without cause, but rather a registration which possibly on the grounds of public policy should be removed, but for which at the present time the statutes makes no provision. I think the phrase \"entry made without cause\" was intended when enacted to bear the construction I give it.\nUnder the English Trade-Marks Act of 1883, the Court of Appeal expressed the view that an order could be made to remove from the register a trade-mark even although the original registration was proper. In the Batt Trade-Mark Case[33], Lindley M.R., delivering the judgment of the court and referring to the words \"entry made without sufficient cause\" said:\u2014\nIf any entry is at any time on the register without sufficient cause, however it got there, it ought in our opinion to be treated as covered by the words of the section.\nThe motion was to remove from the register a trade-mark not registered by the proprietor with a bona fide intention of using it, and it was found that the proprietor never had any intention to use the mark. As pointed out in the judgment, in the view taken by the court of the facts, the decision of the point was not necessary to the decision of the case. The judgment was affirmed in the House of Lords but no decision was given on this point. I do not consider this a decision binding upon that point, nor was it so regarded in England. It is perhaps significant that since then there has been express legislation providing for the removal from the registry of trade-marks registered without bona fide intention to use, or where there is not a bona fide user of the same, and up to that time no order had ever been made for the removal of a mark originally rightly registered. In the Batt Trade-Mark Case[34] the defendant would seem to have been registering trademarks to cover contingent needs, and at the time of entry had no bona fide intention of user. Possibly, in such case, a portion of the evidence to establish that absence of bona fide intention of user at the time of entry, would be properly extracted from the subsequent course of action of the defendant and not limited to his intentions at the time of registration.\nA great number of English decisions were submitted to us by both sides in support of their several positions. Having in mind the then existing English statutes upon trade-marks it appears to me, after a perusal of such authorities, that throughout them all is to be found the assertion of the principle, that the validity of a registered trade-mark is to be determined as and of the date of registration. Any taint of impropriety as a registerable mark then attaching adheres, and may always be invoked, in any proceedings to expunge. From such judicial authorities it is also to be inferred that if a mark was at the time of registration a proper one, and within the terms of the statute, it cannot be expunged without express legislative authority, even if in the course of time it takes on that quality which, if existent at the time of registration, would make it an improper entry. The uniformity of decisions in this direction is very marked. In fact our attention has not been directed to any decision in the English courts expressly deciding to the contrary.\nThis view of the law is, I think, expressed with great clarity and force by Parker J. in the Gramaphone Case34. Here the court was considering an application to register as a trade-mark the word \"Gramaphone.\" It was admitted on behalf of the applicant that the word had some direct reference to the character or quality of the goods in respect of which it was proposed to be registered. The name \"Gramaphone\" had been given to a patented talking machine in 1882 to distinguish it from phonographs or graphophones which operated a cylinder record, as opposed to disc records operated by the gramaphone. Parker J. concluded from the evidence that the word \"gramaphone\" had direct reference to the character of the goods, and while at the Start the word was used to denote a particular sort of article, and the word while still retaining its original signification had become so popularized owing to wide advertising by the manufacturing company that it came to denote the article, and' that the applicant used the word as the name of the article and not to distinguish the article when made by it from the same article made by others. He refused the application to register on the ground that the name by which an article is popularly known ought not to be admitted to registration as a trade-mark for that article. In other words he held that the word was not at that date, the date of the application, a proper trade-mark for registration. It is however the discussion by Parker J. of the case where a registered trade-mark is later adopted by the public as the name of the article which is of interest. He said:\u2014\nIt may be asked, and was in effect asked at the trial, why such words as, for example, \"pianola\" or \"vaseline\" should be on the register as trade-marks if \"gramaphone\" were refused registration. The answer is not far to seek. None of the Trade-Mark Acts have provided machinery for taking a mark off the register if once it has been properly put on, and it is quite unnecessary in an action for infringement of a registered mark to prove that such mark still remains distinctive of the goods of the registered proprietor. It may, therefore, be to the interest of the registered proprietor of a word mark that the word should lose its distinctiveness so far as the public are concerned and become the popular name for the article. He thus obtains a practical and perpetual monopoly in the article itself, other manufacturers being precluded by the mark on the register from selling their goods under the name by which they are commonly known. To induce the public to adopt a catching word as the name of the article to which it is applied, especially if the article be comparatively new, it is only necessary to advertise the article on a sufficiently large scale under that name, and this can be done by any rich corporation.\nIt is, however, one thing to put a word mark on the register and then proceed to induce the public to use it as the name of the article to which it is applied, and quite another thing to adopt a word already used to denote an article, and then proceed to identify it among the trade with the goods of a particular manufacturer, relying on such identification as a reason for registration. For the purpose of putting a mark on the register distinctiveness is the all-important point, and in my opinion, if a word which has once been the name of an article ought ever to be registered as a trade-mark for that article, it can only be when the word has lost, or practically lost, its original meaning\nThat a registered mark cannot be taken off the register, even though it has ceased to be used for the legitimate purpose of a trade-mark and has become merely the name of an article, is, I think, no reason for allowing one trader to register and secure a monopoly in what is already the name of an article although every trader in the kingdom might for one reason or another have already recognized or been willing to recognize such monopoly.\nThis appears to me incontrovertible and conclusive reasoning, and is entirely applicable to the ease now before us, having in mind our statute. Upon the findings of fact made by Parker J. clearly the word was not a proper one for registration. In similar circumstances under our statute the Minister would have been justified in refusing registration. It is one thing, as that learned judge said, to put a word mark on the register and induce the public to adopt it as the name of the article, but it is another to adopt a word already used to denote a particular article, and then proceed to identify it among the trade with the goods of a particular manufacturer, relying on such identification as a reason for registration. In other words this decision is to the effect that \"Gramaphone\" might have been a registerable word mark if at the time of application for registration it was not the name of and did not denote the article itself.\nIn re Woodward's Trade-Marks[35] was decided in 1915. Here one part of the proceedings was to expunge the trademark \"Gripe Water.\" Eve J. found that the word mark had become in one sense public property, and for some years had been used as descriptive of the article, and said that if the present time was the moment of time at which he was to decide if the mark was distinctive of the goods, he could see substantial reasons for removing the registration. He held, however, that the moment was the moment of registration, and that it had not been shewn that the trade-mark at that time was mot distinctive.\nThe Linoleum Case[36] is much relied on by the respondent. In reality it decided exactly what was decided in the Gramaphone Case[37]. Here a new substance having been invented the name of Linoleum was admittedly given to it by the patentee, and it never had any other name. The plaintiff, in this case, also used a trademark containing the word linoleum and the action was to restrain the use of that word as applied to floor-cloth, the patent having expired. The court held that the plaintiff having invented a new subject matter, used merely the name Linoleum as distinguishing that subject matter, but did not use the word to distinguish the subject matter as made by them, from the same subject matter as made by other persons. I construe this case to decide that when the trade-mark was registered it was not properly made at the time, because it was not a distinctive mark, but was the admittedly adopted name of the article itself and therefore not properly registerable. The same principle was laid down in the later case of Redaway v. Barnham[38], by Lord Hershell, who said:\u2014\nWhere a patentee attaches a particular name to the production he patents, that name becomes common property as the name of the patented article. It possesses indeed no other name. That name would be applied to it by all persons desiring to purchase the article. It is not descriptive of the production of a particular manufacturer but of the article itself by whomsoever it is manufactured.\nIt is always a question of fact what falls within the principle decided in these cases. If, clearly, an invented name is the name of an article, it cannot properly be registered as a trade-mark, but that fact must be established. This would not appear to be in conflict with the principle laid down by Parker J. in the Gramaphone Case[39] above referred to.\nThat the view expressed by Parker J. in the Gramaphone Case39 represented the accepted jurisprudence in England, on the point of the statute there providing no machinery for expunging a mark which was orginally a proper registration, is to be inferred from enabling legislation enacted in 1919. The Trade-Marks Act, 1919, provides that where in the case of an article or substance manufactured under any patent in force, a word trademark registered is the name or only practical name of the article or substance so manufactured, all rights to the exclusive use of such trade-mark shall cease upon the expiration or determination of the patent, and thereafter such word shall not be deemed a distinctive mark and may foe removed by the court from the register, on the application of any person aggrieved. By another provision of the same statute the only practical name or description of any single chemical element, or single chemical compound as distinguished from a mixture, is prohibited from registration, subject to certain provisions.\nThe American authorities cited by the respondent are not I think helpful. A part of the appeal case is the finding of an officer of the United States Patent Office upon an application of the United Drug Company to cancel in that country the registration of the word \"Aspirin\" as a trade-mark, which application was granted in 1918. The United States trade-Mark Act (1905) provides that if it appears that\nthe registrant was not entitled to the use of the mark at the date of his application for registration thereof, or that the mark is not used by the registrant, or that it has been abandoned,\nthe commissioner of patents may cancel the registration. The words \"used by the registrant\" have been construed by the United States courts and by the United States Patent Office to mean \"used as a trade-mark\" and the official known as the Examiner of Interference's found that it was not so used upon the evidence submitted. The distinction between the United States Patent Act and our own statute on the same subject is, of course obvious, and altogether the findings of the United States Patent Office in this application are not of assistance here.\nIn the Bovril Case[40] the action was to expunge the word \"Bovril\" from the register. The trade-mark was registered on November 2, 1886, and the question was whether the word \"-Bovril.\" was at that date a distinctive \"fancy word not in common use.\" It was admitted that the word was new and was one that had never been heard of before. The plaintiff contended the word was a highly descriptive word, the defendant contending that the real question was whether the word was descriptive at the date of registration. In rendering judgment Lindley J. said:\u2014 I think it is eminently and purely a question of fact. Now I ask myself this: Supposing that a jury were asked to say whether on November 2, 1886 Bovril was a fancy word not in common use, and supposing they said upon a direction from the judge, which I think it would be the duty of the judge to give, that if they were of the opinion that it really intelligibly described the thing sold it would not do, could they with that direction reasonably say it was not a fancy word not in common use? I do not think they could.\nThat really expresses my own way of looking at the substantial point in this appeal. The question is one of fact. I do not think the evidence supports the contention that the word \"Aspirin\" at the date of registration was descriptive of Acetyl Salicylic Acid, and to the trade or the public denoted that article, and by that name. If in this respect the situation has since changed in so far as the public is concerned, it did not I think substantially occur until some years after the registration. At least the respondent has failed to show, in my opinion, that at the time of registration the mark was not distinctive. If at that time the registrant secured by statute a right to a proper trade-mark the statute and not the courts should deprive him of it.\nIn the view I take of the law I need only inquire if, at the time of registration, the word \"Aspirin\" was a proper and valid trade-mark. In my opinion the respondent has failed to prove that at the time of registration the word was not a proper and valid trade-mark. It is not necessary for me to quote from the evidence. In the first place Acetyl Salicylic Acid was the name given to the patented article, and before the patent a chemical compound by that name was not unknown to the chemist. The patent was limited only to the United States, and the article was manufactured in other countries during the life time of the patent in the United States, and sold to the public under various word marks, or names, and is so being sold to-day in Canada and elsewhere. For many years after the registration of aspirin, to manufacturing chemists, wholesale druggists, chemists and physicians, there was a chemical compound known as Acetyl Salicylic Acid, and aspirin was known to them as the Bayer production of that compound. The evidence supports this conclusion, and it would be difficult to imagine such not being the fact. The same section of the public, in Canada, would no doubt to-day, identify aspirin as the Bayer production of acetyl salicylic acid and, to that extent at least, the word aspirin does not denote the name of the article. It was through the sale of acetyl salicylic acid in tablet form under the name of \"Aspirin\" first by manufacturing chemists and later by the Bayer Company itself, that the public began to purchase direct from retail druggists, instead of through the physician's prescription. Owing to this fact, possibly another section of the public, consumers of aspirin, gradually came to identify that word as the name of the article. But all this has occurred in recent years. Much advertising has brought this about and produced the strange situation, if the respondents' contention be sound, that the more successful the manufacturer of a product, identified by some registered word mark, is in inducing the public to consume his product, the nearer he approaches the end of the user of his trade-mark even though originally it was a proper entry. The implications from such a state of the law are considerable and serious, and even with statutory authority existing to expunge trade-marks in such a condition of facts, one can readily perceive the difficulties in justly resolving the many complex issues which might arise. However, I am not obliged to decide whether the word aspirin now denotes to any section of the public the name of an article, but if that were in point of fact my conclusion I do not see how the mark could be expunged, or its exclusive use by its proprietors in any way limited, because there is no authority for so doing in the statute. It is unlikely the omission was accidental, but rather that Parliament did not anticipate, when the enactment was made, the effect of much advertising upon a portion of the public.\nIt is contended also that this trade-mark has been lost by non-user and abandonment and the period referred to is 1913 to 1919. Mere disuse does not amount to abandonment, and abandonment is a question of intention. If a proprietor of a trade-mark ceases to have an intention of dealing in the goods for which the mark is registered, that would establish abandonment so far as such goods were concerned. I think one may safely conclude that no such intention of abandonment has been established in evidence, on the part of the appellant or its predecessors. The fact is that during the war it was not possible for the owners of the mark to manufacture or sell the product but that is not evidence of intention of abandonment. The war period must be disregarded altogether in an inquiry as to whether or not there was intention of abandonment. That there was an intention of abandonment is not proven, nor can it be inferred from the evidence, and I think it is quite an improbable assumption. Then, abandonment is also claimed by the respondent on account of the dealings between the predecessors of the appellant and the tablet makers, in which the manufacturing chemists were permitted to manufacture the crystals into tablets, with the trademark in question placed thereon. The purpose of a trademark is to indicate that the goods are of the make of the proprietor of the mark, and the tablets were in reality but a manipulation of the form only of the goods purchased from the proprietor of the mark. It appears to me that, in this case, it was quite in harmony with the real purposes of the mark to permit its use upon the tablets made by the manufacturing chemists, and in the absence of an agreement to the contrary I think the tablet manufacturers would have the right of user of the mark. There would be an implied licence for so doing. Any one using the owners' mark on the owners' goods would hardly be infringing nor would it in any respect be deception. The wholesaler or retailer of goods purchased from the maker might, I think, safely print labels which are the trade-marks of the maker of the goods, if for cause they had to be replaced.\nThe only other point to which I shall refer is the advertising in 1919 and 1920, and the registration of the word Bayer as a mark to be applied to pharmaceutical preparations, which it is claimed is indicative of an intention of abandonment. In respect of the laudatory advertising from which we are asked to infer abandonment, it is to be observed that the war had a destructive effect for one reason or another upon the appellant's position in the market. The inference I draw from this advertising is that the appellant was determined, even at a considerable cost, to regain its lost ground, and the advertising negatives the inference of abandonment. In the circumstances I do not think we are called upon to examine microscopically this advertising in order to discover an intention of abandonment. Conceivably the adoption of a new mark might be evidence of abandonment of an old mark. It is not clear to me that because an owner of a word mark adopts a second mark that he has waived his rights under the other. The nature of the user of each or both would have to be known before any judicial determination could be made upon the matter, and therefore I do not think there is sufficient evidence before us to conclude that from adoption of the new mark we are to infer an abandonment of the mark \"Aspirin.\"\nWith great respect therefore I think the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osier, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] [1923] Ex.

Rep. 452) affirmed. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge[2] and dismissing the appellants' action for damages for alleged infringement of a trade-mark.\nThe appellants manufacture a polish and mop which they distinguish by a combination of a letter and word, \"O'Cedar,\" for which they have a trade-mark. The respondents, before the institution of the action, were manufacturing and selling similar articles under the name of \"Cedar,\" and since the commencement of the action, under the name of \"Cedarbrite.\" The appellants claim that this is an infringement of their trade-mark.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellants.\nR. M. Macdonald for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The appellants' action is against the respondents who carry on business under the firm name of Dust Control Company, the latter company being also a defendant. The appellants claim to be the owners of the trade-mark \"O'Cedar\" registered both in Canada and the United States as applied to the sale of furniture polish, polish mops and dusters. They allege that the respondents have infringed their trade-mark by the use of the word \"Cedar\" as applied to the same products, and that since the commencement of the action they have also infringed it by using in the same connection the word \"Cedarbrite.\" They further pretend that the respondents are fraudulently passing-off their goods as and for the appellants', by employing the same words on similar articles and similar packages. They ask for an injunction, the destruction of the respondents' polishes, mops and oils, and claim damages or, in the alternative, an account of profits.\nThe defence denies the passing-off and alleges that the appellants' so-called trade-mark is invalid, being a descriptive and not an arbitrary or fanciful name, and consequently not registrable as a trade-mark. The learned trial judge found against the appellants on the issue of passing-off and also came to the conclusion that the name \"O'Cedar\" was descriptive of a quality of the appellants' goods and did not constitute a valid trademark. The appellants' action was dismissed and the judgment was unanimously affirmed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. The appellants now seek the reversal of these two judgments.\nOn the issue of fraudulent passing-off, while at first sight the similarity of the name used by the respondents to the trade name of the appellants may seem to furnish some foundation for the suggestion that the respondents are seeking to pass off their goods for those of the appellants, the evidence appears to support the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the appellants have failed to make out a sufficient case. The respondents' witnesses all say that there has been no confusion between the goods of the respondents and those of the appellants. Certainly no fraudulent intention has been brought home to the respondents, and there is only one instance where a purchaser asking for \"O'Cedar\" polish was given \"Cedar\" polish, and this was the act of an independent dealer who does not appear to have been in any way connected with the respondents.\nBefore this court, the argument centred chiefly on the question whether \"O'Cedar,\" as applied to polishes and mops, is a valid trade-mark and is infringed by the use of the words \"Cedar\" or \"Cedarbrite\" in connection with the same description of goods.\nThe evidence is that the Channell Chemical Company, a Chicago corporation, first used the word \"O'Cedar\" in connection with a polish manufactured by it in 1907. It registered the word in 1912 in the United States and in 1913 in Canada, as a specific trade-mark. Channell Limited is an Ontario company and by an assignment in 1915 obtained the right to use the trade-mark in Canada. There is no doubt that the appellants have spent considerable sums of money in advertising their goods under the name \"O'Cedar.\" The respondents do not appear to have carried on business outside of British Columbia, and their operations in that province are not on a considerable scale. Both the appellants and the respondents scent their polishes and their mops with the oil produced from the cedar leaf, the proportion of this oil to the mineral oil composing the polish being one per cent, of the mixture. The inference that the name of \"O'Cedar\" or \"Cedar\" was suggested by the odour of oil of cedar does not seem an unfair one, for this scent was featured by both parties in selling their goods, and the respondents also recommended it as being a repellent for insects.\nIn 1913 one Trail, then the husband of the respondent Madeline Rombough, began manufacturing a polish under the name of \"oil of joy,\" and subsequently described it as \"Cedar polish.\" Trail is now dead and, as this action was taken in September, 1922, there is no evidence available as to his motive which the appellants suggest was to avail himself of the reputation they had secured for their goods by their extensive advertising. Madeline Rombough, the widow, took over the business under her husband's will and disposed of it to a concern which failed to fulfil its obligations, so that the business, carried on under the style of \"Dust Control Company\" came back to her. She married the respondent, Marshall Anson Rombough, who as her manager carries on the business for her.\nIt appears by the testimony of one James O. R. Newman, a dealer during a number of years in janitors' supplies and requisites, that prior to 1917 other manufacturers made polishes or similar goods under the name of \"Cedar,\" such as \"Imperial cedar polish,\" and that he himself sold a product he called \"Cederolia spray,\" one of the ingredients used being oil of cedar. His testimony shows that this oil, which is not useful as a polish, was employed on account of its peculiar odour, and probably as a preservative against insects. And for this reason the word \"cedar\" may have been a convenient name to designate polishes having this odour as well as mops saturated, as are the mops of the parties, with oil of cedar.\nWe think it is clear that the word \"cedar,\" being a word in common use, could, notwithstanding the registration of the trade-mark \"O'Cedar,\" be employed for the sale of goods of which the oil of cedar was a component part. It would be in this connection a word descriptive of a quality or of the character of the goods. It does not appear necessary to refer to many authorities in support of this proposition. They are quoted in abundance in the judgments under appeal. That a word in common use as the name of a thing cannot be appropriated as a trade-mark is shown by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Standard Ideal Co. v. Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co.[3]. As was said in that case, a common English word having reference to the character and quality of the goods cannot be an apt or an appropriate instrument for distinguishing the goods of one trader from those of another. And the mere prefixing of the letter \"O\" to such a word as cedar certainly does not make it so distinctive that registration gives to the appellants the right to complain of the use of it by another manufacturer to describe a polish whereof oil of cedar is one of the ingredients.\nMr. Henderson argued that the word \"cedar\" used in the trade-mark in question had acquired a secondary meaning as signifying the appellants' goods. We have carefully read the evidence and can find nothing in support of this contention. No doubt the trade knew that the appellants were manufacturing a polish under the name \"O'Cedar,\" as they were aware that other manufacturers were using the word \"cedar,\" but there is nothing here to indicate that the latter word as used had become in any way distinctive of the appellants' goods.\nWe can see no sufficient reason to disturb the judgment under appeal and would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this action was properly dismissed by the learned trial judge for reasons assigned by him; and that the appeal therefrom by the appellants was properly dismissed, unanimously, by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia for the respective reasons assigned by the several judges giving written reasons therefor.\nI, therefore, think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

(1911), c. 203, s. 64.\nThe right to damages for breach of a contract made in a foreign country and to be executed there is governed by the lex loci contractus and not by the lex fori.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (34 B.C. Rep. 19) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge[2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe action was brought by the respondent against the appellants for damages for breach of contract to purchase hops. The main point in issue is that of the measure of damages. The contract was made in California and was to be performed there. If the damages are to be measured by the laws of California, then the measure of damages is that which had been proven by the legal gentleman called to give evidence of that law and is that applied by the trial judge. But it was argued on behalf of the appellant that the action having been brought in British Columbia, the measure of damages should be ascertained by the law of British Columbia and that the rule to be applied is that contained in s. 64 of the \"Sale of Goods Act,\" c. 203, R.S.B.C. 1911. The questions at issue are: if the right to damages for breach of a contract is a substantive right, the lex loci contractus must be applied; if it is a question of procedure, the lex fori must be followed.\nLafleur K.C. and Carson for the appellants.\nE. P. Davis K.C. and R. L. Reid K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This is in part an attempt to set aside findings of fact pronounced by the trial judge and concurred in without dissent by the Court of Appeal. There were two actions, which were tried together, for the enforcement against the appellants of contracts for the purchase of hops from the respondents. Hops tendered by the respondents in execution of their respective contracts were in large part rejected as not answering in point of quality the descriptions of the contracts.\nWhether the quality of the hops tendered conformed to the contract standard or did not was the question of fact with the determination of which the trial judge was charged, and his view necessarily turned in large measure upon the weight to be attached to the oral testimony of the witnesses examined at the trial. The learned trial judge explicitly declared that in deciding against the appellants he was, at least in part, influenced by the favourable impression he had received as regards the candour of the witnesses called by the respondent and the general weight of their testimony, while commenting, as he no doubt esteemed it his duty to do, rather unfavourably upon some of the testimony adduced by the appellants.\nIn these circumstances, the appellants must fail unless they can make it appear that the judgments below are characterized by some aberration from principle or affected by some error at once radical and demonstrable in the appreciation of the evidence adduced or in the method by which the consideration of it has been approached. It is sufficient to say in a word that no such error has been established.\nThe only question requiring discussion is the question raised by the appellant's contention that, as to the measure of damages, the rights of the plaintiff are governed by the law of British Columbia, and not by the law of California. There is not and, in view of the evidence there could not be, any serious controversy, either as to the law of California or as to its application to the facts. The expert witnesses are in agreement upon the point that, by virtue of the rules laid down in the California code, the plaintiffs acquired, under each of the contracts we are concerned with, a lien upon the subject matter of the sale as soon as it was identified, for a sum equivalent to the purchase price; that, accessory to this lien, there is given by the same provisions a power of sale by auction on default of payment; and that, if a sum equal to the amount of the purchase money is not realized from the sale, the vendor also becomes entitled to require from the purchaser payment of the difference between the amount so realized and the sum due to the vendor under the contract of sale. The vendor is entitled to bid at the sale. And again there could be no dispute, in view of what occurred at the trial, that each of the sales by the plaintiff was a sale valid in California; or that under the law and in the courts of that state the plaintiff if entitled to recover at all would be entitled to the amounts which have been awarded by the judgments appealed from.\nBut damages are not exigible, the appellants argue, under the terms of the contract itself, but under a new obligation, which, with its accessory right of action, springs from the breach of contract; and this right, being strictly remedial in its nature, must on principle, it is said, be derived from and ruled by the lex fori and not the proper law of the contract.\nThere is singularly little express authority in English law upon the broad question whether in an action on a foreign contract\u2014that is, a contract made abroad, and to be executed abroad\u2014the right to unliquidated damages for breach of it is a right determined and measured by English law or by the appropriate foreign law; although, as we shall presently see, judicial dicta, the opinions of textwriters and the analogy of decided cases, all appear to point to a conclusion in a sense opposed to the contention of the appellants.\nIn principle, it is difficult to discover a solid ground for refusing to classify the right to damages for breach of contract with other rights arising under the proper law of the contract, and recognizable and enforceable as such.\nWhere rights are acquired under the laws of foreign states (said Turner L.J., in Hooper v. Gumm)[3], the law of this country recognizes and gives effect to those rights, unless it is contrary to the law and policy of this country to do so. The exception embraces a very wide field, and among other things excludes procedure, because the policy of the English law recognizes no vested rights in procedure, and a party invoking the jurisdiction of the courts must take procedure as he finds it. The concept of procedure, too, is, in this connection, a comprehensive one, including process and evidence, methods of execution, rules of limitation affecting the remedy and the course of the court with regard to the kind of relief that can be granted to a suitor. But it does not, of course, extend to substantive rights; and here questions as to substantive rights include all questions as to the \"nature and extent of the obligation\" under the foreign contract. Fergusson v. Fyffe[4] per Cottenham L.C.\nIt is most important to observe that it is not the foreign agreement to which effect is given by English law but, as the language of the accurate judge, whose judgment is quoted, suggests, it is the civil or legal right generated by the contract. The right of action, as Willes J., said in Phillips v. Eyre[5], is a \"creature\" of the law by which the contract is governed. Applying the principle to the circumstances of the case before us, the lien given to the vendor, and the accessory right of sale, are obviously substantive rights given by the law of California to the vendor as such; in his capacity, that is to say, as seller under a contract of sale. And the right to recover the difference between the contract price and the moneys realized on the sale would seem to be not less so. The provisions of the code could, no doubt, be varied or entirely eliminated by express stipulation; and it seems plain enough, therefore, that indirectly, at all events, they take effect by consent of the parties. But, however that may be, the vendor's rights under these provisions accrue to him by reason of the contract, and may without impropriety be described as rights implied by law as terms of the contract. Attorney General of Victoria v. Ettershank[6]. On principle, since it is the right created by the contract, and not the agreement itself which is enforced, there would appear to be no pertinent distinction between rights arising under terms thus implied by law and rights arising by force of the general law from express stipulations inter partes formally embodied in the record of the agreement.\nOur attention has not been called to any Canadian decision or English decision inconsistent with this conclusion, and, so far as can be ascertained, there appears to be no such authority. The relevant decisions are nearly all concerned with bills of exchange and, as regards these, the effect of the decisions prior to the Bills of Exchange Act appears to be that, by the law of England, interest by way of damages will be given according to the law of the place where the party charged has contracted to pay the bill; that is to say, according to the proper law of his contract. Cooper v. Earl of Waldegrave[7]; Allen v. Kemble[8]; Gibbs v. Fremont[9]; In re Commercial Bank of South Australia[10]; The Queen v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[11]; Fergusson v. Fyffe[12].\nAs a rule the place of payment under each of the contracts embodied in the bill will be the place where the contracting party has become a party to the bill; and this accounts for the fact that the rule is sometimes stated as if the governing law, as regards interest, were the lex loci contractus; as, for example, in Gibbs v. Fremont[13] at page 484 and In re Commercial Bank of South Australia[14] at pages 525-6.\nIn the United States divergent views have been held, and the decisions are not in agreement upon the question whether, in such cases, it is the law of the place where the contract is made or of the place where the money is to be paid which determines the liability and the measure of it in respect of interest. But in one state only, Massachusetts, is the rule followed that the lex fori governs. The overwhelming preponderance of authority in the United States in both the federal and the state courts is against that view: Gilpins v. Consequa[15]; Mills v. Dow[16]; Dyke v. Erie Ry. Co.[17]; Philadelphia Loan Co. v. Towner[18].\nThe same rule prevails in actions upon foreign judgments. The principle upon which such judgments are enforced by the English courts, as stated by Blackburn J. delivering the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench in Godard v. Gray[19]; and in Schibsby v. Westenholz[20],\u2014 following the judgments of Parke B., in Russell v. Smyth[21], and Williams v. Jones[22]\u2014is that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction gives rise to a legal obligation to pay the judgment debt; and in an action upon such a judgment in an English court interest, if by the law of the judgment itself it carries interest, is treated as an integral part of the judgment debt, and the rate is accordingly calculated in conformity with the requirements of that law, whatever that rate may be. If no interest is given by the foreign law, none can be recovered in an action on the judgment in an English court unless, of course, interest, being specified in the judgment, is, by the terms of the judgment itself, part of the judgment debt. Arnott v. Redfern[23]; Douglas v. Forrest[24]; Hawksford v. Giffard[25]. In the case last mentioned, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that, in an action in Jersey upon a judgment recovered in the Queen's Bench Division in England, the plaintiff was entitled to recover interest at the English statutory rate of four per cent upon the judgment debt from the date of the judgment and not at the Jersey rate of five per cent.\nThat contractual stipulations as to the measure of damages embodied in the agreement itself are governed as to validity and effect by the proper law of the contract, seems to follow as a corollary from the principle that the cause of action rests upon the rights given by that law; and this is the sense of the decision of the Privy Council in Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co. v. Shand[26]. The conclusion to which these decisions and dicta point has been formally adopted in the opinions of text-writers of repute; Story, sec. 307; Wharton, secs. 427 and 513; Westlake, sec. 225; Dicey, sec. 646.\nAn argument was advanced by the appellant, based upon the decisions touching the enforceability of causes of action arising from torts committed abroad, which both deserves and requires notice.\nAuthority can be cited, of the greatest weight, for the proposition that the right of action in respect of a foreign tort is ultimately based upon the obligation ex delicto attaching by the law of the locus commissi to the wrongful act; Willes J., speaking for the Exchequer Chamber in Phillips v. Eyre[27], and Holmes J., speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of The Titanic (Oceanic Steam Navigation Company v. Mellor)[28]. The policy of the English law does not permit the plaintiff to recover in an action upon a tort committed abroad, unless the wrongful act, if done in England, would have been actionable by the law of that country. It was held in Machado v. Fontes[29], that an action will lie in England in respect of an act committed abroad, if the act is wrongful by the law of England and not justifiable by the law of the country where it is committed, although, by the law of the foreign country, the wrongdoer is not subject to liability enforceable in civil proceedings. It is argued that the decision in Machado v. Fontes[30] necessarily proceeds upon the hypothesis that the right to recover damages, as well as the measure of damages, is, by English law, matter for the lex fori.\nThere is authority, both unmistakable in effect, and of a high order, for the proposition that the measure of damages in an action for reparation in respect of a tort in a foreign country is not matter of procedure, but matter of the substance of liability; per Turner L.J., Cope v. Doherty[31]; and per Wood V.C. in the same case[32]; but it is not necessary, for the purposes of the present appeal, to consider the decision in Machado v. Fontes[33]. The doc- trine of that case, according to which the law of England gives a right of action in respect of a foreign tort for damages, when no such right is given by the foreign law, is not necessarily incompatible with the rule which appears to prevail without material qualification as regards contracts, that where rights are given by foreign law, these rights are recognized and enforced by the law of England, except in those cases in which the policy of the law of England forbids it.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Dickie & De Beck.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Reid, Wallbridge, Douglas & Gibson.\n[1] 34 B.C.

Lee, [1924] S.C.R. 612\nDate: 1924-11-19\nDavid Lew (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nWing Lee (Defendant) Respondent.\n1924: October 14, 15; 1924: November 9\nPresent: Anglin, C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nAction\u2014Malicious prosecution\u2014Jury awarding greater damages than claimed\u2014Trial judge reducing amount\u2014Judgment reversed by appellate court\u2014Appeal to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Death of plaintiff\u2014Revivor of appeal by representative\u2014New trial\u2014Order conditional.\nThe appellant sued the respondent for malicious prosecution claiming $490 as special damages and $5,000 as general damages. At the trial, the jury rendered a verdict awarding the appellant $490 as special damages and $10,000 as general damages. The appellant did not ask to amend his claim, but, through his counsel, requested that his recovery be restricted to the amount demanded in his statement of claim. Thereupon, without consent of the respondent, the trial judge entered judgment for $490 special damages and $5,000 general damages. The Court of Appeal set aside this judgment and ordered a new trial. The appellant appealed to this court and obtained stay of proceedings on giving security for costs. Before his appeal came on for hearing, the appellant died. His personal representative moved to be allowed to enter a suggestion of death in order to continue the prosecution of the appeal. The respondent contested the application upon the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona.\nHeld, that the application should be granted. The personal cause of action of the appellant for tort was merged in the judgment of the trial court; and although that judgment had been vacated on appeal, the effect of the merger was not entirely gone. The \"cause of action\" preferred in this appeal is not the injuria plus damnum which the appellant originally asserted in the action, but his right to have restored the judgment of which he complains that he has been wrongly deprived and that \"cause of action\" survives to and is enforceable by his personal representative.\nHeld also that the judgment of the trial judge for $490 for special damages should be restored. As to general damages, the court may require the defendant, as a condition of affirming the order for a new trial, to undertake not to raise the objection that the original cause of action was extinguished by the plaintiff's death. Should that undertaking be refused, the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial court restored in toto.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (33 B.C. Rep. 271) varied.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge with a jury and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nE. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nSir Chs. H. Tupper K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014In this action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff claimed $490 as special damages and $5,000 general damages. At the trial the jury rendered a verdict in his favour awarding the $490 special damages claimed and $10,000 general damages. The plaintiff did not ask to amend his claim, but, through his counsel, requested that his recovery be restricted to the amount demanded in his statement of claim. Thereupon, without consent of the defendant, the learned trial judge entered judgment for $490 special damages and for $5,000 general damages.\nOn appeal by the defendant the Court of Appeal of British Columbia (Macdonald C.J., Martin and Galliher JJ.A.) set aside this judgment, Mr. Justice Martin dissenting, and directed a new trial.\nThe plaintiff appealed to this court asking the restoration of the judgment of the trial court. He obtained the usual stay of proceedings on giving security for costs. Before his appeal came on for hearing, however, he was murdered.\nInstead of entering a suggestion of death as provided for by Supreme Court rule No. 50, whereupon the respondent might have moved under rule 51 to set such suggestion aside, the appellant moved before a judge in chambers to be allowed to enter the suggestion. The judge applied to directed that the motion should be brought before the court when the appeal should be reached on the docket on which it had been inscribed and the court accordingly heard the motion. It may, we think, conveniently be dealt with as if the respondent were moving under rule 51 to set aside a suggestion entered under rule 50.\nThe maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona is no doubt applicable to an action for malicious prosecution and, so far as we are aware, there is no legislation in force in British Columbia restricting its application before verdict. A cause of action for malicious prosecution is not one which survives. But by order XVII, rule 1, of the rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (which embodies s. 139 of the Imperial statutes 15-16 Vict., c. 76; 17 Car. 2, c. 8, s. 1), it is provided that\nwhether the cause of action survives or not, there shall be no abatement by reason of the death of either party between the verdict or finding of the issues of fact and the judgment, but judgment may in such case be entered notwithstanding the death.\nA fortiori the right of enforcing a judgment obtained before a plaintiff's death will survive to his personal representative; so too the right of defending such a judgment if subsequently attacked. Had the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court there could have been no doubt either as to the right of the defendant to prosecute an appeal to this court, notwithstanding the plaintiff's death, or as to the right of the personal representative of the latter to uphold the judgment if attacked. The purely personal cause of action for the tort had become merged in the judgment and the issue on such an appeal would be the legality and validity of that judgment and of the further judgment affirming it. (Cox's Administrator vs. Whitfield[2]. But it is urged that where, as here, the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial and the judgment founded on it had been set aside and vacated on appeal, the effect of the merger was gone and the plaintiff had been remitted to his original cause of action\u2014and that died with him. No doubt if he had acquiesced in the judgment of the Court of Appeal that would have been his position. His personal representative could not prosecute the new trial ordered; that would be a proceeding on the original cause of action which had died with the plaintiff.\nWhere, however, there has not been such acquiescence but, on the contrary, an appeal to this court has been launched in due course to have the vacated verdict and judgment restored, the \"cause of action\" preferred in such an appeal is not the injuria plus damnum which the plaintiff originally asserted in the action, but his right to have restored the judgment of which he complains that he has been wrongly deprived, and that \" cause of action \" in our opinion, survives to and is enforceable by his personal representative. Although the converse case of the death of a sole plaintiff respondent is covered by the authority of Stace v. Griffith[3], we have found no English or Canadian decision dealing with the point now before us. White v. Parker[4] is not in point. It was directly involved, however, in the case of Ellis v. Brooks[5]. The right of the personal representative of a plaintiff, who had died after a judgment had been rendered in her favour based on a \" cause of action \" for tort, to prosecute an appeal to have that judgment restored by a second appellate court on the ground that it had been erroneously set aside by the first appellate court, was there upheld. The reasoning of the court in that case commends itself to us. In the case of Coughlin vs. District of Columbia, before the Supreme Court of the United States[6], the syllabus in part reads as follows:\u2014\n3. When a judgment for the plaintiff in a personal action was erroneously set aside, and a subsequent final judgment against him is brought up by writ of error, pending which he dies, this court will affirm the first judgment nunc pro tunc. The practice of the House of Lords appears to be to require revivor of the cause in the court below before entertaining a petition for revivor of an appeal abated by the death of a party whose interests are not fully represented by other parties to the appeal. Denison and Scott's House of Lords' Appeal Practice, 95, 199; Macqueen's House of Lords' Practice, pp. 241 et seq. The modern practice in the Privy Council is similar. Beckwith, Privy Council Practice (1912), 305. Our rules 50 and 51 do not contemplate such a procedure. They provide for the matter of revivor being dealt with here.\nAn appeal to this court is not a step in the cause (Supreme Court Act, s. 73), as is usually the case with appeals to a provincial appellate court. Grasett v. Carter[7]. Entertaining the view that the issue before this court is not that determined by the verdict at the trial, but rather is whether sufficient grounds existed for setting aside that verdict and the judgment based upon it; that if that judgment should be restored it will operate as if it had never been set aside and proprio vigore as of its original date; and that the appellant's \" cause of action \" before this court is in substance and reality the alleged error that intervened in the Court of Appeal and induced that tribunal to vacate a judgment which he maintains had been rightly entered by the trial court, we are of the opinion that that \" cause of action \" is not subject to the operation of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona. In the judgment obtained from the trial court the plaintiff had an asset. The defendant thereby became bound to pay him $5,490 and costs. Deprived of that asset by the Court of Appeal the plaintiff by his appeal to this court sought to recover it. The right to prosecute that appeal survives to his personal representative. See note to Wheatley vs. Lane[8]. A suggestion of the appellant's death may, therefore, rightly be entered under rule 50 and when so entered will not be set aside under rule 51.\nSubject to the disposition of the motion just dealt with the merits of the appeal were argued. In directing judgment for the plaintiff the learned trial judge said that the amount of it ($5,490)\nis much greater than would have been rendered by a judge trying the case without a jury.\nIn the Court of Appeal the learned Chief Justice said:\u2014\nThe jury, I think, showed a decided bias against the defendant; their verdict was for $10,000 damages, whereas the plaintiff claimed but $5,000.\nMartin J.A. thought \"the reduced amount not unreasonable\"; Galliher J.A. said:\u2014\nI have no hesitation in saying that the verdict brought in by the jury as to the amount of damages is wholly unwarranted by the evidence and shows on its face bias and prejudice *** The very unreasonableness of the amount awarded by the jury answers itself, and I think it is a proper case for a new trial.\nAlthough, with the exception of Mr. Justice Galliher, none of them says so explicitly, it would seem that all of the judges below regarded the verdict of $10,000 for general damages as excessive\u2014so grossly excessive that it showed that the jury had been misled by prejudice or passion and that it therefore could not be maintained. No other ground for setting it aside is suggested. After a study of the record we are of the opinion that as to the general damages that view is correct. Indeed $5,000 would seem a large recovery having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and especially to the intervention and advice of Mr. Arthur Leighton, which, however open to criticism, it must not be forgotten was that of a solicitor of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and of Alfred G. King who was a provincial land surveyor.\nWhile of the opinion that had the verdict been sustainable for the sum for which it was rendered it would have been within the power of the learned trial judge to accept the plaintiff's renunciation of the excess over the amount of his claim and to enter judgment for the latter sum, we are equally satisfied that the verdict being bad because it was grossly excessive he had not that power. The doctrine of Watt v. Watt[9], and Bray v. Ford[10], is, we think, conclusive on this point. The defendant had a statutory right to have the general damages again assessed by a jury, R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 58, s. 53; O. 36, r. 2. The case, therefore, does not fall within order LVIII, rule 5a.\nBut the award of $490 for special damages is severable from that for $10,000 special damages. The allowance of $490 is not open to attack for excess. Other grounds upon which the defendant sought to impeach the verdict cannot prevail. There was evidence on which a jury might well find the other elements in the cause of action in favour of the plaintiff.\nThere is, therefore, no reason why, upon the proper suggestion being entered under our rule 50, the verdict finding the defendant liable and awarding $490 as special damages should not be restored and with it the judgment for the plaintiff for that amount and for the costs of the action down to and inclusive of the judgment of the trial court. Barber & Co. v. Deutsche Bank[11].\nMoreover, under all the circumstances disclosed in the record, it seems eminently proper that the granting of a new trial for a re-assessment of the general damages should be subject to terms which will preclude the defendant escaping, by reason of the plaintiff's death, liability for whatever amount a jury might properly award. Direct authority for what we propose to do is somewhat meagre. But it is well established that in granting a new trial the court exercises a judicial discretion and may impose terms as to any matter within its jurisdiction. (Watt v. Watt[12], per Lord Davey.) Notwithstanding the absence from the British Columbia statutes and rules of provisions corresponding to the English rules 6 and 7 of order XXXIX, the Court of Appeal of that province is, in our opinion, clothed with a like discretion. So far as we are aware doubt has never been thrown on the view expressed by the Court of Exchequer in Griffith v. Williams[13] (a case of breach of promise of marriage where the plaintiff had died after a rule nisi for a new trial had been obtained but before argument), that a court of appeal may, in order to prevent a defeat of justice, make its order for a new trial conditional upon the defendant undertaking not to raise the objection that the cause of action was extinguished by the plaintiff's death and may direct that the verdict at such new trial be entered as of the date of that set aside. On the contrary that decision seems to have had the assent of Lord Tenterden C.J. in Palmer v. Cohen[14]. Garrow B. in the Griffith Case also referred to a precedent for such a conditional order in an earlier case in the Court of King's Bench in which he had been of counsel.\nIf the plaintiff's death had occurred while this action was pending in the Court of Appeal there can be little doubt that that court would have assented to an application for the imposition of terms similar to those indicated in the Griffiths Case[15]. We are by s. 51 of the Supreme Court Act empowered to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal should have given. In the exercise of the jurisdiction thus conferred we deem it proper, in varying the judgment of the Court of Appeal by restoring the judgment of the trial court for special damages and costs as above indicated, and limiting the new trial which it directs to a re-assessment of the general damages, to impose on the defendant, as a condition of maintaining the order for a new trial to that extent, that he shall give the undertaking above indicated. If this alternative is accepted by written election filed with the registrar within one month there will be no costs to either party of the appeals to this court and the Court of Appeal. But should such election not be made, upon the proper suggestion being entered under rule 50, the appeal will be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nThe direction for the entry of the formal judgment of the court was in these terms:\n\"Revivor of appeal allowed.\n\"On a proper suggestion being entered under rule 50 the appeal will be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, unless the defendant shall elect, by writing to be filed with the registrar within one month, for a new trial limited to a re-assessment of the general damages claimed and subject to the condition that no exception based on the death of the plaintiff will be taken to such new trial proceeding and that judgment may thereafter be entered for the amount awarded on such new trial as of the date; of the verdict in part set aside. Should the defendant so elect for such new trial, upon entry of the aforesaid suggestion the judgment of the Court of Appeal will be varied accordingly and the judgment of the learned trial judge will be restored for the sum of $490 special damages and costs of action down to and inclusive of the judgment at the trial court and there will be no costs to either party of the appeals to this court and to the Court of Appeal.\"\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

(1922), c. 52, s. 24 (d).\u2014Appeal against assessment\u2014Right of further appeal. A building was owned by a religious order incorporated by Act of Parliament whose members were priests of the Greek Ruthenian Church Rite. It was used and occupied as a seminary for the education of missionary priests, no charge being made for their education and maintenance, and at one end thereof on the first floor was a chapel where the parish mass was usually celebrated daily except on Sundays when it was held in a church of the order on the opposite side of the road.\nPer Idington, Duff and Newcombe JJ.\u2014The building could not be deemed to be one \"used for church purposes\" within the meaning of s. 24 (d) of \"The School Assessment Act, R.S.A. (1922), c. 52 and was not exempt from taxation. Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Rinfret JJ. contra.\nHeld, also, that, although the appellant had already submitted its assessment to the Court of Revision, as provided for by the School Assessment Act of Alberta and had further appealed from that decision to the District Court, it had still the right to institute the present action, as the question involved concerns the jurisdiction to assess. Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto ([1904] A.C. 809) followed. Idington J. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (20 Alta. L.R. 338) affirmed, the court being equally divided.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing appellant's claim for a declaration that a certain building and the land on which it stands is exempt from taxation and for an injunction restraining its being sold or forfeited for arrears of taxes.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the appellant. The building in question is used for church purposes and not used for any-other purpose for hire or reward. The word \"church\" has two meanings: (1) It may be employed in a material sense to indicate an edifice of ecclesiastical character. (2) It may be employed in a spiritual sense, as in the phrases: \"the Church of God,\" \"the Presbyterian Church,\" and so on. Obviously, it is in the latter sense that the word is employed in the statute in question. The word \"purposes\" being in the plural makes this certain. By no ingenuity can the sentences be made intelligible if the word \"church\" means an edifice. The sentence must undergo complete metamorphosis if it is to mean \"any building used for divine worship\"; and the plural \"purposes\" must be cut down to a single \"purpose.\" The phrase \"for church purposes\" is the precise equivalent of for the purposes of a church, just as for \"national purposes\" is equivalent to for the purposes of a nation.\nC. C. McCaul K.C. for the respondent. The object and the purpose of the seminary is first to give a general education, secondly, to train and develop instruments to effectuate the purpose and objects of the church. And the building of the appellant is not intended for public worship. ANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Rinfret.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant is a corporation created by the Dominion Parliament and possessed of 14 78 acres, part of the northeast quarter of section 19, township 53, range 16, west of the 4th meridian, in the province of Alberta, whereon is erected a building in which to carry on a seminary.\nThe respondent is, as its name implies, a corporate school district in Alberta which comprises, amongst many other parcels of land, that above referred to organized under the School Act of said province to levy rates for the maintenance of its school.\nThat Act provides for the appointment of an assessor to make an assessment roll for the purposes of such levy. Section 24 of said Assessment Act provides as follows:\u2014\n24. (1) All property real and personal in any village or consolidated district not herein declared exempt from taxation shall be subject to assessment and taxation for school purposes.\nThe second subsection of said section 24 provides as follows:\u2014\n(2) The property exempt from taxation under the provisions of this Act shall be * * *\nand then proceeds to define by subsections many properties so exempted.\nBy subsection (d) it provides as follows:\u2014\n(d) any building used for church purposes, and not used for any other purpose for hire or reward, and the lot or lots whereon it stands, not exceeding one-half acre, except such part as may have any other building thereon.\nThe appellant was assessed for its said land for the year 1923, and, deeming its assessment too high, gave the following notice of appeal from said assessment:\u2014\nTo the Secretary-Treasurer of School District, No. 1603:\nSir,\u2014I hereby appeal against Assessment No. 4052422 on the following grounds: That the said assessment is too high.\nRev. N. Kryanowsky, appellant,\nP.O. Mundare,\n17th day of April, 1923.\nTo the Secretary-Treasurer of School District No. 1603:\nSir,\u2014I hereby appeal against Assessment No. 3132348 on the following grounds: That the said assessment is too high.\nRev. N. Kryanowsky, appellant,\nP.O. Mundare,\n17th day of April, 1923. By admissions made at the trial said Rev. Father Kryanowsky was admitted to be the duly authorized agent of appellant, and was so during the said year 1923, when notice of assessment was given the plaintiff (now appellant); and further:\u2014\nThat notice of assessment was given to the plaintiff; It appealed to the Court of Revision;\nThat a Court of Revision was duly held and reduced the assessment of the building in question from $35,000 to the final assessment;\nThat the plaintiff appealed to the judge of the District Court in accordance with the Act in that regard who dismissed the same;\nThat the grounds for the appeal to the judge of the District Court as in the said notice of appeal set out, were as follows:\n\"That the property consisting of the Ruthenian Seminary and the land upon which the same is situated is under the school assessment ordinance exempt from taxation, in that the said building is used or to be used for church purposes and not used for any other purpose for hire or reward.\"\nThat the judgment of the judge aforesaid is as ollows:\u2014\n\"The appellant asks for exemption from school tax on a building and one-half acre, under section 24, subsection \"D\" School Assessment Act, chapter 52, R.S.A.\n\"The main purpose of the buildings I understood from the evidence was for the education of young men for the priesthood, for which no charge is made. There is a public chapel for children to learn the catechism and for public services. There is no letting for hire. There was no evidence as to how often public service was held in the chapel and I would consider from the fact that there was a church just across the road that the chapel would not be used very often for public church services. The section says that 'any building used for church purposes, and not used for any other purpose, for hire or reward, etc.' shall be exempt.\n\"As I understand the evidence, the building was erected and is used as a theological college. As such it is not exempt under the Act. The fact that it was a chapel for holding religious services would not bring it under the exemption. While the public on certain occasions might use the chapel, I do not think that this could be construed to exempt the whole building as being used for church purposes.\n\"While I recognize the fact that education of the candidates for the priesthood is essential for the proper carrying out of the work of any church, yet if the Act had intended such to be exempt such would have been specially mentioned.\n\"I would dismiss the appeal.\"\nThis seems to me to conclude this case as against the appellant.\nThere was thus brought before the Court of Revision not only the merits of the assessment as made, but also, in course of the appeal to the district judge, due consideration was had of the right to exemption as now claimed herein, and the decision above quoted duly reached as provided for by the said School Assessment Act. Section 38 thereof expressly provides for such a proceeding before the district judge. Subsection 11 of said section 38 declares as follows:\u2014\nThe decision and judgment of the judge shall be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon.\nI am, with great respect, of the opinion on the foregoing facts that the said judgment was as expressed in said subsection 11 final and conclusive in law and should have been so held by the learned trial judge and those in the Appellate Division.\nWhen the case of the Toronto Railway Company v. The City of Toronto[2], cited by Mr. Justice Hyndman, and the relevant facts are closely examined and the law bearing upon this case is also closely examined, and due comparison made, it will be seen that the said decision does not interfere with giving due effect to the said subsection 11 and thereby disposing of this appeal.\nThe pretension set up herein that the property in question was exempt from assessment, is to my mind so entirely without foundation in law, that I do not feel disposed to follow up the opinion I have just expressed as to the effect of said subsection 11, with prolonged argument in support thereof.\nI prefer, having so expressed my opinion on said subsection 11, going direct to the question chiefly discussed in the reasons assigned in the court below in support of appellant's pretension.\nI submit that the interpretation given by such an educated man as I assume the Reverend Father Kryanowsky to be, when he gave the said notices of appeal on the ground of the assessment being too high, was the correct interpretation.\nIt does not seem ever to have occurred to him that the legislature of Alberta could imagine such a ground of exemption as that of a seminary, much less of a purely theological seminary for the selection and training and education of priests of any church. Such a conception I rather imagine to have been the product of some legal mind, fertile in resources when driven by desperate necessities. The suggestion is a straining of the language used. An exemption from taxation should never be carried further than what is beyond doubt the clearly expressed intention of the legislature and so restricted it is impossible, I submit with great respect, correctly, to turn a very common ground of exemption in favour of buildings used for churches into what is contended for by appellant.\nThe counsel for appellant could not point to any such exemption as put forward herein ever having taken place in favour of any other religious denomination in Alberta.\nIn default of any such precedent I can see no justification for supposing that the Alberta legislature could have any such intention.\nI am, therefore, for the foregoing reasons of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Rinfret.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The confusion in this case arises because of the equivocal meaning of the word \"church\"; it is necessary to interpret the word as found in the School Assessment Act of Alberta, R.S.A. 1922, c. 52, s. 24, which is the beginning of a group of sections relating to assessment and taxation for school purposes in village and consolidated districts. Section 24 provides that all property real and personal in any village or consolidated district not declared exempt from taxation shall be subject to assessment and taxation for school purposes; then follows an enumeration of property which is declared exempt, including\nany building used for church purposes and not used for any other purpose for hire or reward, and the lot or lots whereon it stands, not exceeding one-half acre, except such part as may have any other building thereon.\nIt will be observed that the exemption includes only a building and the land whereon it stands, not exceeding one-half acre, if used for church purposes; the words are certainly not inapt to describe a building used as a place of ministration of divine service, or as a church in the sense of a meeting house for public worship; moreover the area of land which goes with the building, limited to one-half acre, is not unlike that which would be required for a church site and a churchyard in a locality populous enough to be a village or consolidated district. The question is whether these \"church purposes\" are so comprehensive as to embrace those of a theological college or seminary.\nThe exemptions provided by a preceding group of sections, which relate to rural districts or portions thereof situated in a non-collecting municipal district or in the extra municipal area, are naturally somewhat more generous to the churches so far as 'concerns the extent of land. The church exemption in these localities is thus defined by s. 6:\u2014\nThe land to the extent of three acres held by or for the use of any church on which there is a building used for church purposes.\nIt will be perceived that the exemption is here somewhat differently expressed, and that the word \"church\" which appears twice in one line has different meanings; in the first place, the body which uses; in the second place, to qualify or describe the use of a building which is requisite for its exemption, while in s. 24 the term is used only in the latter sense; but, for the rural as well as for the village districts, the land exempted is of small area, such as would be required for the churchyard, having regard to the locality.\nThe plaintiff order was incorporated in Canada by c. 152 of 1908, \"An Act to incorporate the Ruthenian Catholic Mission of the Order of St. Basil the Great in Canada.\" The Act proceeds upon the preamble that the Reverend Fathers, who are named as the corporators, are members of the Order of St. Basil the Great, an order of religious in communion with the See of Rome, that they are the only members of the Order in Canada and have for several years been engaged in pursuing the objects of their Order in the establishing and carrying on of parishes or missions, and the erection and conduct of churches, schools, colleges, orphanages and hospitals, in the provinces of Manitoba,. Saskatchewan and Alberta; the objects of the corporation are declared to be:\u2014\nthe maintenance and carrying on of parishes or missions, the erection, maintenance and conduct of churches, cemeteries, schools, colleges, orphanages and hospitals in any of the provinces of Canada, and the advancement in other ways of education and religion, charity and benevolence.\nThe Superior of the Order for Canada testifies that the members of the Order are priests of the Greek Ruthenian Catholic Church, that he resides at the village of Mundare, where the Order has a ministry, a convent and a church, and where the Mission is the proprietor of 14 78 acres of land upon which it has built a seminary. This building was begun in 1922 and finished in August 1923 at a cost of nearly $30,000. The building is 120 ft. long by 40 ft. in width, having a basement and two floors above, and it is used as a place for the training and education of those who are to become missionary priests of the Order. It contains dormitories, school room and one large room used as a chapel where mass is said. The building was opened for use in September, 1923, and at the time of trial there were only a few boys or young men in attendance, but the building is designed for the accommodation and use of thirty or forty students. There is a church belonging to and used by the Mission on the opposite side of the street where the Sunday services are held.\nIt is argued that because it is necessary that young men should be trained for the ministry or priesthood, and because the seminary is a building used if or this purpose, therefore it is used for church purposes, and is consequently exempt from taxation. In order to justify this contention it is necessary to interpret the word \"church\" as connoting not, or not only, in its primary sense, the Lord's house, but a church in the sense of an organized body of christians possessing the same or similar symbols of doctrine and forms of worship, united as a christian denomination, and \"purposes\" as including any purpose which the competent authority of the church may formulate and adopt. If the word be intended to convey that meaning it may be observed that there is no proof in the case that it is a purpose of the Roman Catholic Church to maintain or to use the seminary for any purpose, although it is well established that the purpose of the appellant Order in the construction and use of the seminary is the training and education of young men to become priests of the Order. I do not think, however, with the utmost respect for the opinion of my learned brothers from whom I am sorry to differ, that education, even for the priesthood, is within the natural, common and ordinary meaning of the expression \"church purposes\" in the use and context in which it here finds itself. The purposes designed and adopted by a body of christians organized as a church in the execution of the general policy of the organization or society might obviously include purposes very remote from those intended by s. 24; for example it might be a purpose of a church organization to establish and maintain an orphanage, or a hospital, or a house of refuge. These and other worthy or benevolent projects, if made part of the general policy of a church, may appropriately be described as church purposes in one sense; but I think a definition which would admit these to the benefit of the exemption would be giving a broader effect to the language than can be reasonably found to have been intended by the legislature.\nThe words are of popular meaning and should be taken in their popular sense. The Board of Works for the Wandsworth District v. United Telephone Company[3]. Plainly what the legislature intended to exempt was a building in an Alberta village, standing on half an acre of land, used for church purposes, and the inquiry suggests itself as to whether an assessor for a village or consolidated district would regard buildings occupied by colleges for the teaching of Divinity, such as for example, Knox, Wycliffe, or Pine Hill, as within the description, or as used for church purposes. The exemption as already said is concerned with a building and a small area of land, such as is usually appurtenant to a meeting house; in my judgment the sort of building which is intended to be exempt is a building used for the purposes for which a church is used, and therefore I do not doubt that the assessor when determining whether a building should be assessed or exempt would naturally have regard to the use for which a church edifice is designed and to which it is commonly put; he would ascertain the purposes for which the building is used, and the determining fact would be whether or not the ascertained use of the building is that which is peculiar to a church or meeting house; a place set apart and devoted to public worship. The building, of course, may not have the appearance or architectural qualities of a church, though if these indications be present they might not improbably be accepted by the assessor as indicative of the apparent use of the building, but it is only a building, satisfying the definition 3 in other respects, which is used as a church edifice is used, according to the common and popular understanding of the nature of such use, that is within the meaning of the exempting clause.\nMoreover, there is a principle which finds expression in a recent judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it is incumbent upon those who claim to be exempt from a tax which is generally imposed clearly to establish their immunity. In City of Montreal v. College Sainte Marie [4] my learned brother Duff J. sitting as a member of the Board and pronouncing its judgment, said:\u2014\nTheir Lordships are not disposed to differ from the view pressed upon them that an agreement in order to receive effect under the statute must be very clearly made out; such an agreement, if effective, establishes a privilege in respect of taxation, and the principle is not only well settled, but rests upon obvious considerations, that those who advance a claim to special treatment in such matters must show that the privilege invoked has unquestionably been created.\nThat the interpretation upon which the appellant relies is at best of a dubious and questionable character is shown by the fact that the learned Chief Justice, who tried the case, and three of the learned Judges of the Appellate Division have interpreted the exemption as not including the seminary, while the other two learned Judges of the Appellate Division have come to the opposite conclusion.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nRINFRET J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the construction to be put on the words \"church purposes.\"\nIt comes in this way:\nSection 24 of an Act respecting assessment and taxation for school purposes, being chapter 52 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1922, provides as follows:\u2014\n24. (1) All property real and personal in any village or consolidated district not herein declared exempt from taxation shall be subject to assessment and taxation for school purposes.\n(2) The property exempt from taxation under the provisions of this Act shall be,\u2014\n(d) Any building used for church purposes, and not used for any other purpose for hire or reward, and the lot or lots whereon it stands, not exceeding one-half acre, except such part as may have any other building thereon. The appellant is the registered owner of a certain building standing on a portion of the northeast quarter of section 19, township 53, range 16, west of the fourth meridian, which is within the public school district of the respondent established under the \"School Act,\" c. 51 of the Consolidated Statutes of Alberta, 1922. This school district has assessed this building and lands for the year 1923 and has demanded taxes from the appellant in respect thereof. On the ground that they are used for church purposes and not for any other purpose for hire or reward, the appellant now claims a declaratory judgment that the said building and the said lands to the extent of one-half an acre are exempt from assessment and taxation by the respondent as well for the year 1923 as for the future, so long as they are used for the purposes aforesaid. It also prays for an injunction restraining the defendant, its servants and agents from selling or forfeiting or in any other way interfering with the said building and the said lands to the extent aforesaid for arrears of taxes or otherwise howsoever and from assessing the said building and lands in future so long as they are used for the purpose aforesaid.\nThe facts are undisputed. The building in question contains a chapel, class rooms, dormitories, kitchens, etc. The chapel is used exclusively for divine worship. The building is used solely as a seminary for the education and training of young men for the priesthood. After a year's novitiate or probation, they become members of the Order, are educated for the priesthood, and, after ordination, serve as priests in the parishes and missions in charge of the Order. The building is used for no other purpose. It is not used for any purpose for hire or reward. The students are maintained or educated entirely free of any charge and the building is kept up by free-will offerings and contributions.\nAppellant does not make the contention that its building is entitled to exemption under the Act by reason of the fact that it contains a chapel and that therefore the exemption must be extended to the whole building. Its submission is that the building itself, in view of the use to which it is exclusively put, comes under the purview of the statutory exemption. In order to reach the proper conclusion, the intention of the legislature of Alberta must be looked for as disclosed by the language of the statute.\nIt is true that a statutory exemption must be strictly construed; but, as was pointed out in St. Paul's Church v. City of Concord[5],\nwhile the rule serves to express a principle governing the court in this jurisdiction when passing upon the question of the intention of the legislature in tax-exemption statutes, it is not so narrow and rigid in its application as to defeat the lawmakers' intention ascertained from all the competent evidence. Though called a rule, for convenience of expression, it is merely evidence to be weighed; and its weight depends upon its reasonableness, and not alone upon its verbal applicability. In other words, it is the duty of the court to ascertain and carry out the intention of the legislature; and that fact (sic) is to be found, not by mechanical or formal application of words and phrases, but by the exercise of reason and judgment. If the literal significance of statutory language as applied to the facts of a particular case, mates the meaning absurd, strange, or inexplicable, it cannot be adopted as the only test of the legislative purpose, without either imputing to the legislature a senseless design, or judicially evading the duty of ascertaining the intent. If the so-called \"rule of strict construction,\" as applied to statutes exempting certain property from taxation, is so strictly applied as to render the exempting language so narrow and restricted as to defeat the apparent legislative purpose, it is clear that too much sacredness is attached to a mere rule and that it should be either abrogated or applied with more liberality and reason.\nThe only safe rule in construing statutes and, in fact, the great fundamental principle is that\nthe grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to unless that would lead to absurdity, or some repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument; in which case, the grammatical, and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that absurdity,. repugnancy, or inconsistency, but no further. (Maxwell On Statutes, 5th ed. p. 4).\nThis was also the language of Lord Parmoor in Rex v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.[6]; and we are reminded of it by Lord MacNaughton in Vacher & Sons v. London Society of Compositors[7], where he says, at p. 118, that, in the absence of a preamble, one should depart from the ordinary and common sense of the words in an enactment only where it would lead to some absurdity or it is inconsistent with some other clause in the body of the enactment. This leads us to consider the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used by the legislature of Alberta, and it may be convenient to examine them separately.\nThere is no doubt that the word \"church\" was originally used as a name for a house of worship; but, as pointed out in Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. II, p. 355, paragraph 688:\u2014\nThe change from a narrower to a wider meaning of the word \"ecclesiastical\" has been accompanied by a similar change in the meaning of the word \"church\" when used of a religious body, and the very wide signification given in ordinary legal parlance to that word when so used makes it advisable to base any propositions as to the relations between the state and a church on a careful definition of what that word when so used connotes. Although the words \"church\" and \"denomination\" are sometimes used in juxtaposition in a manner which appears to imply that a \"church\" is to be distinguished from a \"denomination,\" there is no legal definition of the word \"denomination\" which would enable any useful inference to be drawn from this implication, and the word \"church\" is in fact used of any ecclesiastical organism which is complete within itself and separate from other churches.\nAnd Fitzgibbon L.J., in McLaughlin v. Campbell[8], says:\u2014\n\"Church\" has two different meanings: it may mean the aggregate of the individual members of the \"church\"; or it may mean the quasi-corporate institution which carries on the religious work of the denomination whose name it bears (e.g. the \"Church of Rome\" or the \"Church of Ireland\").\nAs for the word \"purpose,\" it has been defined:\u2014\nAn object to be kept in view or subserved in operation or course of action; end proposed; aim. (Century Dictionary). The object for which anything is done or for which it exists; the result or effect intended, or sought; end, aim. (Murray's New Dictionary, vol. VII).\nIt would follow therefore that the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words \"church\" and \"purposes\" when joined together is the objects for which , the religious body exists, the result intended or sought by such body; its ends or aims.\nApplying now this meaning to the use which is made by appellant of the building for which it seeks exemption from taxation, it is to be noticed that the appellant was incorporated under the name of \"The Ruthenian Catholic Mission of the Order of St. Basil the Great in Canada\" by the Dominion Parliament in 1908, chapter 152 of the statute 7-8 Edward VII. It is stated in the preamble of that statute that the incorporators have represented that they are members of the Order of St. Basil the Great, an order of religious in communion with the See of Rome;\nand, since incorporation ensued, it follows that this representation was found to be true by Parliament. The appellant is therefore an order forming part of an\necclesiastical organism which is complete within itself\nand which is one of the great religious organizations of the world. Its primary and predominant object, as given in section 4 of its incorporating statute, is\nthe maintenance and carrying on of parishes and missions (and also) the advancement in other ways of * * * religion.\nThe words \"the advancement of religion\" do not call for any special explanation. The alternative use of the expressions \"parishes\" and \"missions\" is well known in Alberta, as can be seen by reference to The Purdy & Henderson Company, Ltd., v. The Corporation of the Parish of St. Patrick[9], and Leonard v. Corporation of the Parish of St. Patrick[10]. A man carrying on a mission, or a missionary, is one sent to propagate religion and to administer its rites and sacraments.\nThe evidence is that the building now in question is a seminary for the education of young men for the priesthood and that the object of teaching the priests is\nfor the purpose of carrying on the work of their religion.\nThe students come there with that sole object in view, that is to be trained in order to become instruments to effectuate the purpose and object of the church.\nPreaching the Gospel is one of the commands of Jesus to his Apostles:\u2014\nGo ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and behold I am with you always even unto the end of the world (St. Matthew, xxviii, 19-20).\nIn obeying this command the priests of the Order of St. Basil the Great in Canada are carrying on their missionary work for the advancement of religion; and it is with that object in view that they are trained in the religious establishment for which they now seek exemption from taxation.\nMoreover they are also educated in the seminary in question for the purpose of being ordained priests and as such of celebrating (in the words of Lord Birkenhead), the central sacrament in a creed which commands the assent of many millions of our Christian fellow-countrymen (Bourne v. Keane)[11],\nAs Mr. Justice Beck justly remarks:\u2014\nIt is practically the universal practice of Catholic priests to say mass every day and for priests in charge of a parish to say it in a church or chapel open to the entire congregation and to which a considerable number of the congregation daily resort for the purpose of assisting at Mass \u2014to use the fuller expression used by Catholics: \"The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass \"\u2014a service of worship\u2014no preaching\u2014no singing.\"\nThe appellants here would certainly accept, as correctly characterizing the holy sacrifice of the mass, the following exposition made by Lord Birkenhead:\u2014\n* * * the sacrament of the mass was, and is, a sacrifice propitiatory of the whole church, both living and dead. The celebration of mass, according to Roman Catholic doctrine, is by no means a benefit entirely confined to the soul or souls of the persons for whom it is directly designed; it benefits (such is the conception) the whole of the living community as well as the dead (Bourne v. Keane) 11, at page 833.\nNow that sacrament\nis fundamental in the belief of Roman Catholics, and without which the church and the altar would alike be useless (Lord Birkenhead, loc. cit., at p. 861).\nIt is\na sacred and sacramental rite, which is an essential and integral part of a service of great solemnity in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church (Lord Parmoor in Bourne v. Keane11 ) at page 917.\nThe solemnization of this sacred and sacramental rite cannot take place without the priest, who is the essential minister exclusively authorized to celebrate mass. For that end, the Catholic church needs ordained priests, and it is for that purpose also that, in the building in question, young Catholics of Ukrainian nationality are being trained\nto become priests of the Greek Ruthenian rite in order that they may serve their fellow Catholics of that rite.\nThis institution's existence therefore is exclusively and solely for the essential purposes of their church, which\nprima facie imports the operative institution which ministers religion and gives spiritual edification to its members. McLaughlin v. Campbell[12],\nIt would not be representing the true character of such a seminary to class it among mere educational establishments and to say that as such it cannot claim exemption under the Act, because only the buildings and grounds of public and separate schools which are under the man- agement of the Department of Education shall be exempt. The schools contemplated by the Act have for their object the education of students for their own individual and personal ends and benefit, whilst the students in the seminary in question are trained exclusively with the view of promoting the ends and aims of their religion, quite independently of any resulting benefit to themselves; and it is this distinction which takes the seminary out of the category of schools and classifies it as an establishment maintained for church purposes.\nIn the case of The People v. Muldoon[13], to which reference is made by Stuart J. in the Appellate Division, it is pointed out that\nexemption from taxation rests on a general public benefit and that in the case of property used for religious purposes a compensation is afforded for the exemption which is not a mere gift to religion, but for a public purpose.\nIn that particular case it was proven that the nuns engaged in\nprayer and meditation, practices of penance and contemplation, but that they had \"no relation near or remote to the public\" and were\" completely separated and secluded from the world and not in any manner connected with public worship, or public religious observances.\nFor that reason, it was held that their property should not be exempt. But the distinction upon which the judgment rested in that case would, I think, apply here in favour of the appellant.\nReverting therefore to the purposes for which the building in question is used by the appellant, it would appear that they are entirely covered by the words \"church purposes,\" as expressed in the statute, and even that that is grammatically the meaning which these words convey.\nNow the legislature of Alberta must be held to have intended what the words it has used mean, as there is no reason here to depart from their ordinary and common sense, since they lead to no absurdity and are not inconsistent with any clause in the body of the enactment. It is only by so construing the statute that effect will be given to the full meaning of the words \"church purposes.\" I therefore come to the conclusion that by using the word \"church\" the legislature intended to refer to the whole body of the religious institution, and not to a mere physical structure or building used, exclusively as a place of public worship.\nOne cannot escape the impression that if the legislature of Alberta had intended to use this word in such a narrow sense and to confine the exemption to a place of public worship, it would have said so in plain words. That impression is strengthened by the use in the charter of the City of Edmonton (1913, c. 23, s. 320 (4) ) of the phrase\nany building used as a place of worship.\nOther legislatures throughout Canada have used similar expressions in corresponding statutes.\nBritish Columbia, Revised Statutes of 1911, vol. 3, p. 2778:\u2014\nevery place of public worship with the site thereof.\nRevised Statutes of Manitoba, 1913, c. 134, s. 4 (p):\u2014\nbuildings commonly called churches erected and used for the regular stated places of worship of any religious denomination and the lands in connection therewith not exceeding two acres in extent.\nR.S.O. 195, s. 5 (2):\u2014\nevery place of public worship.\nR.S. Quebec, art. 5729:\u2014\nproperty held and occupied for public worship, presbyteries, parsonages and cemeteries.\nR.S.N.S. (1923), c. 86, s. 4:\u2014\nevery church and place of worship, the land used in connection therewith and every churchyard and burial ground.\nOn the other hand, the Saskatchewan statutes use the same language as is used in Alberta (R.S.S., c. 112, s. 5), and we may also refer to the terms of the R.S. Quebec, art. 2897:\u2014\nNo religious, charitable or educational institution or corporation shall be assessed under this title on the property occupied by them for the object for which they were instituted.\nThe comparisons just made will tend to show that the legislatures to restrict the exemption to the physical structure or building used for religious worship, have used the words \"place of worship\"; and one is led to the conclusion that by the broader expression \"any building used for church purposes,\" the legislature of Alberta had in view more than the buildings used merely as churches (in the narrow sense), and must have intended to include all that such wider expression covers. Before concluding, reference ought to be made to an objection which was taken by the respondent, although I not pressed very forcibly that the assessability of the property in question is \"res judicata\" because the appellant had already submitted its assessment to the Court of Revision, as provided for by the School Assessment Act of Alberta, and further had appealed from the decision of the Court of Revision to the District Court of Edmonton, where its appeal was dismissed.\nThis objection has been overruled in the courts below; and it should be sufficient to state here that the question involved being one with regard to the jurisdiction to assess, it is concluded adversely to the contention of the respondent by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Toronto Railway Company v. City of Toronto[14].\nIn that case the action was for a declaration that the appellants' cars were personal property and, as such, were not liable for $8,775 sought to be levied as taxes thereon by respondents. The latter relied on a plea of res judicata. On an appeal from the assessment the cars had been determined by the Court of Appeal to be real estate, and that decision had not been appealed from. The law of Ontario applicable to the point submitted to the Judicial Committee was then contained in the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1897. There is no substantial difference between that law and the statute of Alberta which applies in the present case, as a comparison between the relevant sections will show.\nBy section 62 of c. 224, R.S.O. (1897), a revision court of three persons was constituted and their jurisdiction was defined by section 68 as follows:\u2014\n68. At the times or time appointed, the court shall meet and try all complaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed upon or omitted from the roll, or assessed at too high or too low a sum.\n71. (1) Any person complaining of an error or omission in regard to himself, as having been wrongfully inserted in or omitted from the roll, or as having been undercharged or overcharged by the assessor in the roll, may personally, or by his agent give notice in writing to the clerk of the municipality (or assessment commissioner, if any there be), that he considers himself aggrieved for any or all of the causes aforesaid, and shall give a name and address where notices can be served by the clerk as hereinafter provided. 72. The roll, as finally passed by the court, and certified by the clerk as passed, shall, except in so far as the same may be further amended on appeal to the judge of the County Court, be valid, and bind all parties concerned, notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll, or any defect, error or misstatement in the notice required by section 51 of this Act, or the omission to deliver or transmit such notice.\n75. (1). An appeal to the County Judge shall lie, not only against a decision of the Court of Revision on an appeal to said court, but also against the omission, neglect or refusal of said court to hear or decide an appeal.\n82. The decision and judgment of the judge or acting judge shall be \"final and conclusive in every case adjudicated, and the clerk of the municipality shall amend the rolls accordingly.\nSimilar provisions, with a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, are to be found in section 84 of the Ontario Act when the assessment was to an amount aggregating $20,000.\nIn Alberta the Board, by sections 33 (1) and 37 (1) of c. 52 of the Revised Statutes of 1922, is constituted \"as a court of revision to hear all appeals and complaints.\"\n35. (1). Any person complaining of an error or omission in that his name has been wrongfully inserted in or omitted from the roll, or in that he has been overcharged by the assessor in the roll may personally or by his agent give notice in writing to the secretary that he considers himself aggrieved for any of the causes aforesaid.\n37. (3). The roll as finally passed by the court and certified by the secretary as passed shall, except in so far as the same may be further amended on appeal to a District Court, be valid and bind all parties concerned notwithstanding any defect Or error committed in or with regard to such roll, or any defect or error or misstatement in the notices required by any of the four next preceding sections, or the omission to deliver or transmit such notices.\n38 (1). If any person is dissatisfied with the decision of the court of revision he may appeal therefore to the District Court.\n38 (11). The decision and judgment of the judge shall be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon.\nIn the Toronto Railway Company Case[15], the appellants had appealed to the Court of Revision against the assessment on the ground, amongst others, that the property was not liable to assessment as real property. The Court of Revision dismissed the appeal and its decision was affirmed by the County Court Judge and subsequently by the Court of Appeal. Lord Davey, in delivering the judgments of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee (1), at p. 815 said:\u2014 It appears to their Lordships that the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision and of the courts exercising the statutory jurisdiction of appeal from the Court of Revision is confined to the question whether the assessment was too high or too low, and those courts had no jurisdiction to determine the question whether the assessment commissioner had exceeded his powers in assessing property which was not by law assessable. In other words, where the assessment was ab initio a nullity they had no jurisdiction to confirm it or give it validity. The order of the Court of Appeal of June 28, 1902, was not, therefore, the decision of a court having competent jurisdiction to decide the question in issue in this action, and it cannot be pleaded as an estoppel.\nIt may be stated that this decision was in accordance with the opinion already expressed in this court in the case of City of London v. Watt & Sons[16], where the Chief Justice said, at p. 302:\u2014\nI agree with the Court of Appeal in holding that the 65th section of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. 193) does not make the roll, as finally passed by the Court of Revision, conclusive as regards question of jurisdiction. If there is no power conferred by the statute to make the assessment it must be wholly illegal and void ab initio and confirmation by the Court of Revision cannot validate it.\nIn the City of London v. Watt & Sons16, the court construed the revised statutes of Ontario of 1887, where the relevant provisions were similar to those of the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1897.\nI have therefore reached the conclusion that the views of Mr. Justice Beck and Mr. Justice Hyndman, in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, were right and, with deference, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that judgment should be entered declaring that the building in question and the one-half acre of land upon which it stands are exempt from taxation under the Act respecting assessment and taxation for school purposes (R.S.A., c. 52).\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1924] 20 Alta.

In January, 1923, the city respondent at the occasion of a winter carnival converted a portion of a street into a coasting slide for bobsleighs. At the head of the slide the city placed one of its employees in charge with instructions to see to the starting of sleighs and to collect the tolls prescribed for the use of the slide. The city had also there other men employed generally in connection with the slide. The appellants, Dr. Dixon and his wife, went down the slide in a bobsleigh until they reached a curve on the roadway where the city had constructed an embankment and then a rut caused the sleigh to upset, its occupants falling off and rinding themselves sprawling on the slide. The appellants then attempted to go off the path of the slide by crossing the embankment, but the footing being found practically impassable on account of soft snow several feet in depth, they crossed the slide again in order to go out on the other side. Just then another sleigh coming down upset with its occupants in front of the appellants further up. It was followed at a short interval by a third sleigh which, while apparently, trying to avoid the second overturned sleigh, came into contact with Mrs. Dixon, who sustained serious injuries. The appellants brought action against the city respondent to recover damages.\nHeld, that the city was responsible not only for the preparation of the slide but also, having assumed its control, it was its duty to see that no sleigh would be started from the top until the slide was clear; and that the city was negligent in not having a signal man stationed at a convenient point of observation to give notice or warning to the starter of any obstruction on the part of the slide which the starter could not see on account of the curve of the roadway.\nThe city of Edmonton, by s. 221 of its charter (Alta. [1913], c. 23), is authorized to \"make by-laws and regulations for the peace, order, good government and welfare of the city of Edmonton.\"\nHeld that the city had authority under that section to pass a by-law in order to operate the slide; and, as the question of ultra vires had for the first time been raised before this court, it must be assumed that such a by-law had been passed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellants' action. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.'\nC. C. McCaul K.C. for the appellants.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The plaintiffs, husband and wife, brought this action against the defendant corporation, the city of Edmonton, to recover damages sustained by reason of injuries to the wife. It is alleged by the pleadings on behalf of the plaintiffs that the accident causing these injuries was due to the defendant's negligence; on the part of the defendant negligence is denied, and it is alleged in effect that the accident was due to the plaintiffs' negligence. Upon these issues the parties proceeded to trial and the learned trial judge found for the plaintiffs, assessing the damages at $1,200 for the husband and $6,000 for the wife. Upon the appeal the Appellate Division, composed of five judges, with two dissents, set aside the judgment of the trial judge and dismissed the plaintiffs' action.\nIt appears that in January, 1923, there was a winter carnival held at the city of Edmonton by decision and under the direction of the city authorities, and as one of the features of this carnival the city temporarily converted portions of 107th street and the roadway leading to 96th avenue into a coasting slide for bobsleighs. From where 107th street intersects 98th avenue going southerly on the first named street and by the roadway to 96th avenue, there is a natural declivity steep enough to afford an attractive slide, and this course in its ordinary condition had on occasions, albeit illegally, been used by the young people for coasting. From the point where 107th street or the prolongation of it, after crossing 97th Ave., turns in a southwesterly direction it passes through the park or grounds of the provincial government where the public buildings are situated, and the city obtained permission from the government temporarily to convert and to use this portion of the street for the purposes of the slide. Then the city authorities closed the street and roadway for general traffic between 98th avenue and the point of intersection of 96th avenue and 106th street where the slide terminated, and, in order to improve the sliding, constructed an embankment of snow on the westerly side where the roadway turns to the eastward, passing through the government grounds to 96th avenue, thus raising the level on the westerly side so as to compensate for the curve and to prevent the sleighs when reaching and traversing the curve from going off at a tangent, as they would otherwise be liable to do, and moreover they caused the surface to be iced at bare patches or where it was thought desirable to improve it. The roadway for its entire width was thus prepared for the sliding, and the area of the intersection of 107th street and 98th avenue became the head of the slide and the place of gathering for the adventurers in the sport. Here the city stationed Godfrey Morris, one of its employees, and placed him in charge, with instructions to see to the starting of sleighs and to collect the tolls prescribed for the use of the slide. The city also had three other men employed in connection, with the slide; the manager of the carnival says:\nThere was no actual place for them to be, they were to be spread over the slide at different points; * * * they were working on the slide.\nMoreover, at the head of the slide the city also provided sleighs and steersmen for the use of persons in attendance who did not bring their own sleighs, or were not skilled in the sport.\nThe plaintiffs, Dr. Dixon and his wife, who resided in the immediate vicinity of the starting place, attended there on the evening of 24th January, with others, to slide with a boy named Gallinger, 14 years of age, a friend of the plaintiffs' son, who was in attendance with his own bobsleigh, and who apparently had acquired considerable experience in the management of it; his skill or capacity as a driver is not in question. Dr. Dixon paid the requisite toll of 25 cents to the man in charge, known in the case as the starter, and he, with his companions, his wife and Gallinger steering, were by the starter despatched in their turn. They proceeded down the slide until they reached the government grounds where they took the curve to the eastward which has been described. They were going on the westerly or right hand side upon the upper part of the slope of the embankment, and at this point the sleigh was unfortunately caught in a rut, causing it to upset or to tilt over to the left to such a degree that the occupants fell off and found themselves sprawling on the slide. Nobody was hurt, they got up and realized immediately that they must quit the slide. The boy pulled his sleigh out of the rut and proceeded to cross with it to the east side, but the plaintiffs made an attempt to go off by crossing the embankment on the west side, nearer to which the upset had occurred. The footing was, however, found to be such that the lady, although a strong, active woman, could not comfortably or conveniently cross the embankment, which at the apex was composed of soft or lumpy snow several feet in depth and very difficult to cross, or for a matron of middle age practically impassable. Then, having proceeded up the slide in a northerly direction for a few steps looking for an opening or a convenient or possible place of exit to the left, and the lady having informed her husband that it was impossible for her to negotiate the embankment, they turned to the right crossing the slide which was very slippery in a northeasterly direction with a view to going out on the east side. At this time another sleigh with several occupants which was coming down the slide upset in front of them further up. It was followed at a short interval by a third sleigh, in charge of one of the city's employees, which, pursuing the usual course of the sliding on the upper side of the curve, and apparently being disturbed in its course by the upset of the second sleigh which had taken place between it and the plaintiffs who were making the crossing, swung to the left to avoid the overturned sleigh and its occupants and, having passed these, came into contact with Mrs. Dixon who had by this time reached a point two or three feet from the easterly limit of the slide which she was about to quit. It would appear that very little time could have elapsed between the upset of the plaintiffs and the passing of the third sleigh which caused the injury, because it is in proof that Gallinger who had disengaged his sleigh from the rut which had caused the upset proceeded immediately to the eastward, and that Dr. Dixon, who had assisted his wife in the crossing, was at the moment of the impact engaged in assisting Gallinger to lift his sleigh off the slide, and therefore that the plaintiffs must have arrived at the place very little later than the boy Gallinger who, so far as is known, had made all due haste to cross. When Mrs. Dixon was struck by the oncoming sleigh she sustained very serious injuries which will presently be described.\nIt is clear that the defendant corporation was responsible not only for the preparation, opening and working of the slide, but also that it assumed the control and direction of the sliding and established and collected tolls to be taken from the passengers.\nNo doubt sliding is, as observed by the learned judges in the Appellate Division, a somewhat dangerous amusement, and of course those who engage in it must assume the risks that are incidental to and inseparable from the sport. Accidents are liable to occur on the best constructed and regulated slides; the coasters take the risk of these; but it is the duty of those who construct and operate a slide, and assume the charge and regulation of it, to see that prudent and reasonable measures are taken for the prevention of accidents which may be avoided by proper regulation, and prevent the exposure of the participants in the sport to unnecessary and unexpected perils. Moreover, the operator as well as the user of the slide must be charged with knowledge of the incidents and dangers of the sport, and therefore is presumed to know that sleighs are liable to upset; consequently when midway of the slide a participant meets with this mischance he should at least be entitled to assume that he will not be overrun by an employee of the operator despatched by the operator's manager before he has time and opportunity, in the exercise of reasonable judgment and due expedition, to extricate himself from the unfortunate situation in which he is placed by common misadventure of the sport. On the Edmonton slide upsets were not uncommon, especially at the curve, and in the short space of time during which these plaintiffs were using the slide two sleighs parted with their occupants in this locality. It is maintained on behalf of the plaintiffs that in these circumstances it was negligence on the part of the city to permit a sleigh to start from the top until the slide was clear. It is said that in so far as the starter could see the course, he ought to have seen that it was clear, and that, for the lower part of the course which he could not see, a signal man should have been stationed at a convenient point of observation to give notice or warning to the starter of any obstruction or of the absence of N any obstruction which might interfere with the safety of the coasters. The learned trial judge found in effect that the city was negligent in this particular and that this negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. In my judgment his finding ought not to have been disturbed. I would apply the law as stated by Blackburn J., pronouncing the opinion of the judges, in the well known case of The Mersey Docks v. Gibbs[1], where he says:\u2014\nIn the absence of something to shew a contrary intention, the legislature intends that the body, the creature of the statute, shall have the same duties, and that its funds shall be rendered subject to the same liabilities as the general law would impose on a private person doing the same things.\nWhen the defendant corporation closed the public highway and converted it to the extraordinary purpose of a place of dangerous amusement for the residents of the city and the patrons of the fair, and assumed the charge and direction of the sport for which the street and roadway had been adapted, they should have exercised their powers in a manner not inconsistent with the general safety, and it was by failure in this that the accident happened. It is not suggested that the corporation enjoyed any legislative immunity.\nThere is evidence that the city determined to put a man in charge at the top for several purposes, namely, to see to the collection of the prescribed tolls, to see that each sleigh was in charge of a person competent to manage it, and to regulate the despatch of the sleighs so that there should be no competition or conflict for place, and so that a reasonable time might elapse between each descent and the following one. The precise time usually occupied in going down is not proved. Doubtless it might vary somewhat in different cases, but at most it would be very short. According to the plan produced the slide was about 450 yards in length, and one of the defendant's witnesses estimates the speed at fifteen to twenty miles. There is no certain evidence as to the time which was in practice required to intervene between the departure of one sleigh and that of the next. Godfrey Morris did not testify; it was said that he had gone north. McClung, a witness for the defence, who was employed by the city to run one of the bobsleighs, and who, was in charge of the sleigh which collided with Mrs. Dixon, says:\nWhen sleighs were lined up and people waiting I believe they went down about a minute apart.\nThis is the only testimony by which any attempt was made to fix the length of the interval of safety; and admittedly there was no system whereby, when a start was to be made, the starter could be informed of the condition of the slide beyond that part of it which he himself could see, or that he paid any regard to the possibility of sliders being in difficulties there. He was thus acting without the necessary knowledge for the discharge of his duties in a matter that directly affected the safety of those whom he started upon the slide. I have no doubt that this was negligent operation for which a private person operating the slide would have been liable and for which the city was answerable, in the event of an accident in which passengers upset upon the slide were run over by those following before the former had had reasonable time or opportunity to get out of the way.\nIn the Appellate Division, Stuart J. was not satisfied that the plaintiffs made sufficient haste to leave the slide, and Hyndman J. considered that the accident was due entirely to the lack of prudence and care on the part of the plaintiffs in not quitting the slide as soon as they should have done. I was at first disposed to think that the defence of contributory negligence might prevail, upon the view that the plaintiffs after the occurrence of the first accident had placed themselves in a position of safety from the down-coming sleighs by ascending to a portion of the westerly embankment which was not traversed by them; that they deliberately abandoned this position of safety in pursuance of a hazardous resolve to cross to the opposite side for their own convenience, when they should have found their way out by way of the embankment and not have attempted to cross the slide; the testimony of Mrs. Dixon as quoted in the judgment of Hyndman J, gives some support to that view of the facts; but, upon a careful review of the whole evidence, I am convinced that the plaintiffs were not dilatory in their efforts to leave the slide, and moreover that the proof is utterly unconvincing to show that they had been able to find any place of safety. Also I think they pursued the course which might reasonably have been foreseen when they attempted, first to escape the dangerous position in which they were by the shorter way, and then, finding this impracticable, to cross to the eastward which was the alternative and really the method of exit which was advisable and prudent in the circumstances. One would think that at the trial the absence of any practicable exit to the westward was common ground. When Dr. Dixon was brought to this point in cross examination and had stated that they tried to go straight towards the west, defendant's counsel rejoins:\u2014\nThen you found you could not get out that way. (Answer): We could not get out that way,\nand there is no further inquiry as to the project of crossing to the westward. In like manner when Mrs. Dixon was cross-examined, upon reference to the attempt to go to the westward, defendant's counsel says:\u2014\nAnd you found you couldn't? (Answer): We found we couldn't and went to the north. (Question): On account of the embankment? (Answer): Yes.\nThese are the only references in the cross-examination of the two plaintiffs to the attempt to cross to the westward, and it was not in any manner suggested to either of them that the westerly embankment formed a safe, convenient or possible way of leaving the slide; nor, as is now contended, that they had actually ascended the embankment to a place where they were not in danger from the coasters, and that the subsequent accident which occurred was due to an imprudent and unnecessary attempt to return and cross the slide. What was suggested at the trial was not that the plaintiffs should not have crossed the slide but that they should have crossed in a direct line rather than obliquely to the northeast; they explained that by reference to the condition of the slide, which was very icy at this place, and it is noteworthy that the boy, Gallinger, who was acting independently of the plaintiffs, went in the same direction in order to leave the slide with his sleigh. It must be remembered that these people were using a slide which they knew was regulated by city authority; that they had been started by an employee of the city, and that they were entitled reasonably to assume that the dispositions made by the city for the safety of the coasters would not fail to provide for the holding up of those at the top until the way was clear, and particularly until the curve, which was productive of accidents, was found to be free for the passage of the next party who were disposed to venture. Therefore, I do not think that the plaintiffs acted unreasonably or imprudently, or unnecessarily exposed themselves to danger in their efforts to extricate themselves, and in my judgment the defence of contributory negligence fails.\nStuart J., at the conclusion of his judgment, suggested a doubt as to whether the city council had power to close the streets, or as the learned judge aptly expressed it,\nto turn a street into an amusement park and to operate it and charge fees therefor,\nand he said it was only because the point was not referred to that he did not expressly conclude on this ground that the corporation was not liable. This defence was not pleaded, neither was it raised in the argument before the Appellate Division, but it now finds place in the respondent's factum, where the point is taken that under the charter of the city of Edmonton, c. 23 of 1913 of Alberta, the city had no authority to operate the slide. It will be observed, however, that by s. 221 of this statute, the council is authorized to\nmake by-laws and regulations for the peace, order, good government and welfare of the city of Edmonton,\nand I think this court must assume in considering the point, which is taken for the first time on behalf of the city in its factum, that the city did pass any by-law which was requisite in the execution of the powers so conferred for the establishment, preparation and working of the slide. City of Victoria v. Patterson[2]. The city not having pleaded nor suggested the defence of ultra vires, it was not incumbent upon the plaintiffs to produce or prove the by-laws; for the purposes of the trial the authority of the city was taken us admitted, or as not disputed, and it is therefore now too late to raise the point, unless it be that the general powers of the city to make by-laws do not extend to the making of a by-law which would have authorized the works in question.\nThese words \"for the peace, order, good government and welfare,\" in the creation of colonial Governments, have been held\napt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to;\nRiel v. Reg.[3]; and in their use describe the powers of a municipal corporation, it is impossible to give them a meaning which would deny to the council the power to authorize the holding of a winter carnival or the establishment, maintenance and operation of a coasting slide as one of its attractions, incidents or features.\nThere remains the question of the amount of the damages which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. The learned judge at the trial expressed his finding of damages as follows:\u2014\nThere will be judgment for the plaintiff, husband, in the sum of $1,200, made up by the out-of-pocket expenses, which may be termed those of medical necessity, $835, and loss of his wife's services and consortium, $365. As to the damages to be awarded to Mrs. Dixon, it is always an exceedingly difficult thing to arrive at compensation in money for personal injuries. One must discard and exclude sympathy, which is a difficult thing to do, and one must endeavour to value a broken hip or a broken leg, and the results that have been shown in evidence here. On the other hand these things actually and in fact cannot be compensated for; one can just do the best they can, that is all.\nI think that on the ground of compensation to her, the fairest sum I can arrive at is the sum of $6,000.\nUpon the appeal Walsh J. in the minority, with whom Clarke J. concurred, considered that damages had been awarded to Mrs. Dixon upon a scale too generous. The learned judge says:\nHer actual physical injuries have, with one exception, all healed satisfactorily. That one exception is what the doctors think is an obstruction of the circulation of the blood. In addition, she suffers from traumatic neurosis. Her doctors' prognosis is that these two conditions will clear up and disappear in from two to three years from the date of the accident. The award to her is only for her pain and suffering and the inconvenience resulting to her from her injuries. All of the expenses are included in the amount awarded her husband. I think $4,000 a fair and reasonable assessment of her damages. Mrs. Dixon, before her unfortunate accident, was a healthy, active woman. She has three children aged respectively ten, twelve and fourteen years; her age is not directly stated in the evidence; she suffered double fracture of the left leg below the knee, severe contusion of the head, rendering her unconscious, profound nervous shock, and other injuries the nature and consequences of which had not at the time of the trial been precisely ascertained. She gives her testimony very intelligently and clearly; she was hurt on 24th January, and the trial took place upwards of nine months later. She had apparently not suffered from lack of surgical and medical treatment; but while she had made a good recovery with respect to her fractured leg, in that there had been a good reunion of the bones and the fractures were thought to have healed satisfactorily, she describes her condition as follows:\u2014\nQ. Is the leg strong; are you able to use it the same as you could before?\nA. The broken part, where the bones were broken has set all right.\nQ. What about the use of the left leg?\nA. I haven't the use of it because of the swelling and the pain in it.\nQ. Because of the pain?\nA. Yes, the swelling and the pain.\nQ. And where do you find that pain most intense?\nA. Between my knee and hip.\nQ. Up the thigh; up the left thigh?\nA. Yes, that is the greatest amount.\nQ. And in the hip?\nA. Not in the joint.\nQ. Not in the joint?\nA. No, if I am on my foot on any account at all it swells badly in my ankle and in the leg, but that is not intense.\nQ. How does that affect you when you walk; how do you get along when you try to walk?\nA. Well, I do not get along very well.\nQ. Well, just tell me how; why, what happens, if anything?\nA. My leg gets numb and feels helpless, numb, dead; it is sort of something there, I do not quite know, I can't wield it, or just what I can do with it; helpless; I can't stand on it. Last night I fell with rather a bad fall because I forgot for an instant and put too much weight on it, and over I went.\nQ. Are there any other times you find inconvenience from that thigh or leg?\nA. If I lay on it a while and sleep it cramps so terribly. I can't turn myself in bed. I have to get the doctor or my \"girl, when the doctor was away in Chicago I had to get my girl to help me turn in bed. It cramps so badly when I lie on this side; then when I lie on the other side it is this arm and this thumb; I can't lie on my back because of the pain there and I can't lie on my head because it is a physical impossibility, and so there I am. Q. Were you a good sleeper before the accident; did you sleep well?\nA. Perfect; all I had to do was to go to bed and go to sleep.\nQ. How has that been affected one way or the other since the accident?\nA. That I can't sleep; I sleep maybe one or two hours or three hours; about three hours is the most sleep that I get in a night; no matter what time I retire it usually gets on to be one, two, three, four, five o'clock before I go to sleep.\nShe is unable or afraid to go out without an attendant. The doctors suggest a severe injury to the tissues of the thigh, but express uncertainty as to the precise nature of the trouble, although no doubt it resulted from the accident. While Dr. Conn thinks\nit would be at least two or three years before she is going to begin to come back,\nhe adds that he doubts if she will be as well as she was before the accident. Medical testimony was introduced for the defence, based upon one examination just before the trial, which expresses a more hopeful view of Mrs. Dixon's condition and chances for speedy and permanent recovery; but upon the whole case her complete restoration to her former good health and activities is to my mind subject to very grave doubt, and I am not disposed to reduce the estimate of her damages to which the learned trial judge gave effect; I do not perceive that he misdirected himself, or that he proceeded upon any erroneous principle, and I do not think it can be said that the damages found are unreasonable or so excessive as to justify interference with the findings. No question is raised as to the amount of the recovery to which Dr. Dixon is entitled.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division, and the findings and judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This action arises out of an action which took place in the respondent city which undertook, as part of a winter carnival, to organize a bob-sleigh slide on ground partly consisting of part of a highway belonging to the city, and partly over adjacent ground belonging to the Alberta Government.\nThe respondent barred ordinary travel over said part of its highway to be used for the occasion and obtained the consent of the Government to use that part of the ground owned by it for the said purpose on the said occasion. The said parties had bob-sleighs to hire or lend (with drivers) to those who had none; and others who had their own bob-sleighs were invited, upon payment of a fee, to use the said slide.\nThe appellants (who are husband and wife) had their own bob-sleigh and a friend as driver and they paid the fee required.\nThe man in charge of the operation was called the starter and seems to have been allowed to do as he pleased in regard to the time of starting one set of bob-sleighs after another, about one minute apart.\nFor the first six or seven hundred feet from the starting point of the slide, which was prepared by being frozen over so as to render it very slippery, it may have been possible to pass in safety, but beyond that distance, or less, there was a curve at such an angle as to make it highly probable that in steering round and through it an upset would occur.\nIt was impossible for any one at the starting point to see what happened in rounding that curve and yet no precautions of any kind were taken to protect those invited to use, and using, the said slide, in case of being upset at said curve or beyond that point.\nIt seems almost incredible that such reckless negligence on the part of those in charge could have been tolerated; for the probability of there being upsets at such a point was very great.\nSomeone, I admit, should have been stationed at such curve to warn the starter by some means against letting others start unless and until those happening to be upset had got clear of any danger of being run over, and also to direct those upset how to get out of the way as quickly as possible.\nThe starting began, we are told, after eight o'clock on the night of the 24th of January, 1923, when there could be no light except lamp light at certain points to help those engaged in the sport to see their way into or out of trouble.\nThe appellants upset just at said curve and tried to get off at a point near them to the west side of the slide, but found that had been banked up with loads of snow and ice to a height of from three to four feet. They found it impossible to get out on that side for there was no opening of any sort, or path.\nThey turned back, therefore, and tried to get out on the east side and, owing to the slippery condition of the slide, had to climb as it were obliquely towards the east side.\nMeantime another party had upset, and that led to the third party, the starter had let go, steering slightly towards the east side to avoid these upsets.\nThe result was that said third bob-sleigh struck the female appellant and threw her up in the air and thus inflicted most serious injuries, including breaking the bones of her leg, and rendering it necessary for her to be taken in an ambulance to the hospital.\nThe learned trial judge found the respondent guilty of negligence and responsible for the damages the appellant had suffered.\nThe respondent, on appeal to the Court of Appeal for Alberta, succeeded in convincing three of the five judges hearing the appeal that respondent, was not liable.\nHence this appeal.\nI am, with great respect, quite unable to agree with said majority, and indeed cannot understand why in so clear a case of negligence such reckless management should, in this reckless age, be tolerated or at all countenanced.\nThere was, I respectfully submit, no proper ground for interfering with the findings of fact by the learned trial judge, if we are to accord to the verdict of a trial judge that weight it must be given according to settled jurisprudence on the point, though perhaps easier to overrule than that of a jury.\n\" There was a point started by Mr. Justice Stuart as to the responsibility of a municipal corporation for entering upon such an enterprise, which, if it had been pleaded, might have created some legal difficulties.\nIn my opinion there are two complete answers to that: In the first place, not having been pleaded, it cannot be raised here for the first time. But even if it had been pleaded, I cannot understand how a municipal corporation can create such a nuisance without being liable for its consequences.\nNor can I say off-hand, without evidence of all the facts which probably would have been developed if the plead- ing had called therefor, that it was not within the public welfare powers assigned to respondent, to have, in the spirit of modern municipal management, undertaken such an enterprise as the respondent's council apparently did.\nI would, for the foregoing reasons, allow this appeal with costs here and in the court below, and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAs to the measure of damages, we have refused for at least twenty years or more to entertain any such grounds of appeal and, unless much more excessive than indicated herein, we have refused to interfere, holding that those on the spot are much more competent than we are to determine such a question.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] L.R. 1 H.L. 93, at p, 110.\n[2] [1899] A.C. 615, at pp. 619, 624.\n[3] [1895] 10 App. Cas. 675, at p. 678.\n",

Sask., 1922, c. 13.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (18 Sask. L.R. 280) affirmed, Idington J. dubitante.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] allowing an appeal by the town of Humboldt from an order of Embury J. giving leave to appeal against an order of the Local Government Board made under the provisions of The Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nBastedo for the appellant. The Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan has jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the order of the Local Government Board.\nThe Local Government Board had no jurisdiction to; make the order complained of.\nSections 26 and 27 of the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act are ultra vires of the Legislature of Saskatchewan.\nBlackwood K.C. for the Attorney General for Saskatchewan. The question of the vires of section 26 of The Special Powers Act does not arise at this stage, because even assuming that by wholly removing orders of the Local Government Board from review by the courts the legislature has exceeded its jurisdiction, nevertheless the provisions of section 26 of The Special Powers Act are separable, and it was clearly within the competence of the legislature to enact the opening words thereof, namely: \"Every order of the Board or of the Master of Titles shall be final and without appeal.\" In re Muir[2]; Re The Initiative and Referendum Act[3]; Clement's Canadian Constitution, 3rd ed., pp. 490 and 491; CYC vol. 26, p. 571. Therefore, in view of the opening words of section 26 of The Special Powers Act, the statutory right of appeal given by section 50 of The Local Government Board Act cannot be read into the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922. It is under section 50 of The Local Government Board Act that the existing proceedings have been taken by the appellant, and by virtue of which section alone and not otherwise, it has based its right of appeal, which clearly it is not entitled to do.\nBlair for the respondent, the town of Humboldt.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by Bastedo for the appellant.\nBlair for the respondent.\nNewcombe J.\u2014Upon this appeal the Grand Council of the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends, the appellant, submits that an order of the Local Government Board of Saskatchewan of 28th December, 1923, was made by the board in excess of its powers, and seeks to have the order reviewed and declared inoperative or set aside.\nThe Local Government Board was constituted by c. 41 of 1913 of the province, and subsequently by c. 11 of 1916, \"An Act to grant special powers to the Local Government Board,\" additional powers were conferred upon the board. The Act of 1913 was repealed and reproduced with amendments by c. 8 of 1917, and, when the public statutes of Saskatchewan were consolidated in 1920, the two statutes relating to the constitution and powers of the Local Government Board, namely, c. 8 of 1917 and c. 11 of 1916, the latter conferring the special powers, were brought into c. 23 of the revision in separate parts I and II, under the title of \"An Act respecting the Local Government Board.\" By c. 13 of 1922, Part II of c. 23 of the Revised Statutes was repealed and separately re-enacted with amendments under the title of \"The Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922.\"\nBy the Local Government Board Act, as it appears in c. 23 of the Revised Statutes, \"local authority\" is defined to mean\nthe council of a city, town, village or rural municipality, the board of trustees of a school district and the directors of a rural telephone company;\nprovision is made for the appointment of a Local Government Board by the Governor-in-Council, and the Board is empowered to inquire into the merits of any application of a local authority for permission to raise money by way of debenture or upon the security of stock, and to grant or refuse such permission; to manage the sinking fund of any local authority which desires to entrust the same to the board for management; to supervise the expenditure of moneys borrowed by a local authority under the Act; to obtain from any local authority at any time a statement of its affairs; to revise the assessment of certain rural municipalities; to administer the Sale of Shares Act; to hear assessment appeals; to grant permission for extension of time for the repaying of indebtedness incurred by the municipalities for municipal public works as provided by the Municipal Debentures Repayment Act, and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to the board by statutory authority. The special powers conferred by the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922, extend to the retirement of outstanding debentures and accounts in exchange for new debentures; the fixing of terms and conditions upon which the exchange shall be made; the rebating or funding of arrears of interest or the variation of the rate of interest payable on any debt of the municipality; the consolidation of existing debentures; and other comprehensive powers intended to enable the board to control municipal finance and to modify or affect by its orders the rights of the municipal debenture holders.\nIt was in pursuance or intended execution of the powers conferred by the last mentioned Act that the Local Government Board made the order of 28th December, 1923, with reference to the outstanding debentures of the respondent municipality of Humboldt. This order proceeded upon recital of a petition complaining that debenture coupons of the town of Humboldt had become due and payable which upon presentation had not been paid, and requesting the board to make inquiry into the affairs of the town and to take such steps as it might deem adequate and expedient for the proper and satisfactory adjustment of the town's finances in accordance with the powers conferred by the Special Powers Act. There were directions that the holders of the debentures, debenture coupons or accounts of the town, maturing before 1st January, 1924, should deposit them with the Union Bank of Canada and receive certificates to be issued by the bank in lieu thereof; that the Union Bank, with which the town was to open a debenture trust account, should thereout pay the principal of these debentures, coupons and accounts without interest; that the payments of principal should be considered in satisfaction of both principal and interest, and that all payments made by the town as interest subsequent to 1st January, 1919, should be considered as having been made on account of principal and should be credited as such; moreover, that as to debentures and coupons maturing after 1st January, 1924, the interest should be at the rate of 2 per cent. The order thus professed to reduce or otherwise to modify or affect the rights of the debenture holders, and the appellant, being a holder of a number of these debentures, and being dissatisfied with the order, sought to appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan. The appellant accordingly applied to Embury J., one of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench, for leave to appeal, and upon the hearing of the application it was objected by the respondents, the Local Government Board and the town of Humboldt, that no appeal lies from any order of the Local Government Board under the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922, and that consequently there was no jurisdiction to grant leave in the case. The learned judge considered, however, that inasmuch as by s. 50 of the Local Government Board Act, R.S.S. 1920, c. 23, an appeal is given from the board to the Court of Appeal upon a question of jurisdiction, and as that provision was in his view incorporated in the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922, the objection should be overruled, and he therefore granted leave to appeal.\nThe appellant asserted its appeal in pursuance of the leave so granted, and the respondents, the Local Government Board and the town of Humboldt, also appealed to the Court of Appeal from the order of Embury J. Before the hearing of these appeals the appellant, the Grand Council of the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends, gave notice to the Attorney General of Saskatchewan that, upon the hearing of the appeal of the Local Government Board and the town of Humboldt, the Grand Council would bring into question the constitutional validity of ss. 26 and 27 of the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922, upon which, as will be hereinafter shown, was thought to depend the absence of the right of appeal invoked by the Grand Council of the order; similar notice was given to the Attorney General in the appeal of the Grand Council from the order of the Local Government Board.\nThe two appeals came on for hearing at the same time and the learned Chief Justice pronounced the judgment of the Court of Appeal allowing the appeal of the town of Humboldt upon the ground that the statute gave no right of appeal from the order of the Local Government Board of 28th December, 1923, and he held, moreover, that the appeal of the Grand Council from the said order should be dismissed. Thus both appeals were disposed of unfavourably to the Grand Council of the order which now appeals to this court upon the whole case by leave of the Court of Appeal, and upon this appeal not only are the parties represented but the Attorney General of Saskatchewan has appeared and he maintains the validity of the legislation.\nThe appellant has stated serious objections to the order of the Local Government Board. It is said that the order is not authorized by the provisions of the statute because preliminary requirements were not satisfied, and, moreover, it is suggested that it was incompetent to the legislature to empower the board to make the order. Reluctantly I have come to the conclusion that these objections cannot be determined upon this appeal, because it appears upon the true interpretation of the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922, that no appeal lies from the board's order to the Court of Appeal.\nIt is provided by s. 50, subs. 1 of the Local Government Board Act, R.S.S. 1920, c. 23, that:\n50. (1) An appeal shall lie from the board to the Court of Appeal upon a question of jurisdiction, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is obtained from a judge of the Court of King's Bench sitting in chambers within one month after the making of the order or decision sought to be appealed from or within such further time as the judge, under the special circumstances of the case, shall allow, after notice to the opposite party stating the grounds of appeal.\nSubsections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 follow; they regulate the procedure in appeals upon a question of jurisdiction. Subsection 7 provides as follows:\n(7) Save as otherwise specially provided:\n(a) every decision or order of the board shall foe final; and\n(b) no order, decision or proceeding of the board shall be questioned or reviewed, restrained or removed by prohibition, injunction, certiorari or any other process or proceeding in any court.\nIt must be remembered that the right of appeal does not exist by the common law; it is statutory. The Local Government Board Act, as enacted in c. 41 of 1913, gave no right of appeal The Special Powers Act, as enacted in c. 11 of 1916, gave no right of appeal. The right of appeal which is now expressed by s. 50, subs. 1, above quoted, and which is limited to questions of jurisdiction, was sanctioned by c. 8 of 1917, and, as already stated, after the two last mentioned statutes had been combined to form Parts I and II of c. 23 of the Revised Statutes of 1920, Part II, which enunciates the Special Powers, was repealed, and c. 13 of 1922 was enacted in the place of it. Sections 23, 26 and 27 of the latter Act are as follows:\n23. The board shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases and in respect of all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act.\n26. Every order of the Board or of the Master of Titles shall be final and without appeal, and no order, decision or proceeding of the Board or Master of Titles shall be questioned or reviewed, restrained or removed by prohibition, injunction, certiorari, or any other process or proceeding in any court.\n27. All orders and directions made by the Board or Master of Titles under the provisions of this Act shall, when published by the Board or by leave of the Board in two successive issues of The Saskatchewan Gazette and while the same remain in force, have the like effect as if enacted in an Act of the Legislature, and all courts shall take judicial notice thereof.\nIt is by s. 26, as so enacted, that the words \"and without appeal\" are introduced into the legislation respecting the special powers of the board, which is again embodied in a separate chapter.\nOn behalf of the appellant it was insisted that the Local Government Board Act and the Special Powers Act of 1922 should be read together, and that s. 26 of the latter Act was not intended to take away the right of appeal in matters of jurisdiction which existed under s. 50, subs. 1, of the former Act; and, moreover, it was contended, though not very confidently, that upon any other interpretation ss. 26 and 27 would be in excess of legislative authority, not because the subject matter of these sections would not fall to the province in the distribution of legislative powers as between the Dominion and the provinces, but upon the view that these sections would in effect make the orders of the board absolute, because they withdraw the orders and proceedings of the board from review by prohibition, injunction, certiorari or any other process, and give to the orders statutory effect, while denying a right of appeal, and would, therefore, confer upon the board powers which are not subject to judicial determination or control. While doubtless, ss. 26 and 27 are, upon an admissible interpretation, wholly within the legislative authority of the province, it is not necessary to determine their operation or effect in so far as they are expressed to take away common law remedies, or with relation to those remedies in cases where the board has no jurisdiction upon which to found its order, because it is certain that the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal is within the exclusive gift of the legislature, and if conferred by the legislature, may by the same authority be withdrawn.\nAssuming then that ss. 26 and 27 are competent expressions of legislative intention, the question becomes one of interpretation only. Section 28 of the Special Powers Act, 1922, enacts that:\n28. The provisions of The Local Government Board Act and of The Municipal Debentures Repayment Act, shall, except in so far as inconsistent herewith, be applicable hereto.\nIt may be assumed that this clause would, if there were no inconsistency, be effective to incorporate in the Special Powers Act, subs. 1 of s. 50 of the Local Government Board Act, which expressly provides that an appeal shall lie from the board to the Court of Appeal upon a question of jurisdiction; but how can it be said that the latter provision is not inconsistent with s. 26 of the Special Powers Act which provides that every order of the board shall be final and without appeal? The words \"without appeal\" can have no effect unless it be to take away the appeal which would otherwise exist by the operation of s. 28 of the same Act upon questions of jurisdiction. I regret that I see no escape from this conclusion. The court cannot compatibly with established canons of construction reject words which the legislature has introduced if by reasonable interpretation meaning can be given to them. In my judgment the words \"and without appeal\" are apt for the purpose of taking away the appeal upon jurisdiction which is given by subs. 1 of s. 50 of the Local Government Board Act, and the construction should be ut res magis valeat quam pereat.\nThe conclusion is therefore in agreement with that reached by the court below; and, seeing that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction, this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Idington J. (dubitante).\u2014The appellant is a corporation organized for the purpose, amongst others, of conducting a fraternal insurance business under the Insurance Act of the province of Ontario, and, as such, became a holder of debentures of said town of Humboldt, to the amount of over $6,000.\nThe said town of Humboldt, respondent, is a municipal corporation in Saskatchewan, which would seem to have become so involved in debt as to be practically insolvent, as its counsel seemed in effect to admit on my presenting such a suggestion to him in course of his argument.\nThe said Local Government Board, its co-respondent herein, is a corporation consisting of three members, created by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council pursuant to the Local Government Board Act, 1916, repealed as to all but section 22, bringing it into force, and now appearing in the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1920, by which it was given very extensive powers of investigation respecting which no complaint can be reasonably made, and results of which were to be reported to the Lieutenant-Governor and in many instances to those concerned.\nIn February, 1922, an Act was passed called the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act, 1922.\nUp to the passage of that Act, though there may have been legislation relative to said board and its work of a somewhat doubtful character, there was left open a means of checking the operations thereof in case of its going ultra vires of the powers intended to be conferred on it by the legislature, or even that of the legislature itself.\nIn the course of the board's history the legislature seems to me to have grown continuously bolder by degrees in the way of increasing the powers of the board and rendering it more difficult to test the legality of the legislation or of the board's action thereunder.\nAt first the legislature seemed content simply to declare such course as laid down binding.\nThen a year or two later it provided, in 1917 (by what is now section 50 of the Local Government Board Act, as it appears in the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan for 1920, c. 23), as a means of keeping it within its jurisdiction, for an appeal to the Court of Appeal, by leave of a judge of the Court of King's Bench, sitting in chambers. Subsection 7 of said Act as revised is as follows:\u2014\n(7) Save as otherwise specially provided:\n(a) every decision or order of the board shall be final; and\n(b) no order, decision or proceeding of the board shall be questioned or reviewed, restrained or removed by prohibition, injunction, certiorari or any other process or proceeding in any court.\nThe Local Government Board having made an order on the 28th of December, 1923, dealing with the indebtedness of the town of Humboldt (one of respondents herein) and a trust account of the latter, and giving orders that if valid would certainly impair very much the rights of the appellant, it sought leave to appeal under said section 50, and was granted such leave.\nUpon the said appeal coming up for hearing before said Court of Appeal, the respondents, by their respective counsel, set up as preliminary reply thereto that the right of appeal relied upon, and conferred upon said court, by said section 50 above referred to, had been taken away by section 26 of the Special Powers Act of 1922, which reads as follows:\n26. Every order of the board or of the Master of Titles shall be final and without appeal, and no order, decision or proceeding of the board or Master of Titles shall be questioned or reviewed, restrained or removed by prohibition, injunction, certiorari or any other process or proceeding in any court.\nUpon this section the Court of Appeal held all right of appeal was thereby taken away, and dismissed the appeal.\nThereupon the appellant asked for and was granted by said court leave to appeal to this court. That leave was presumably given by virtue of the new section 41 of the Supreme Court Act, as amended in 1920, which by subsections 1 and (a) reads as follows:\u2014\n1. (1) Special leave to appeal may be granted in any case within section thirty-six by the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province, in which the judicial proceeding was originally instituted:\u2014\nProvided that in any case whatever where the matter in controversy on the appeal will involve,\u2014\n(a) the validity of an Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the legislature of any province of Canada or of an ordinance or Act of the council or legislative body of any territory of Canada; or,\n*****\nIt is under and by virtue of the leave so given that we have heard this appeal. I have read the judgment of my brother Newcombe J. speaking on behalf of the majority of the court and, as I understand it, the decision is made to turn upon the interpretation of the said section 26 above quoted and assuming, as matter of course, that it must be held valid.\nI most respectfully submit that does not necessarily involve the validity of any Act of Parliament or of the legislature, and passing on that minor aspect of the case presented, is not determining what is in dispute.\nThe claim made by the appellant's counsel throughout has been that, if said section 26 is to be given the interpretation given it below, then the legislature has conclusively handed over to the respondent board such powers of legislating as to take away the rights of the appellant and others similarly situated in relation to any of the towns or school districts it has been given any power in or over, and thereby has acted ultra vires.\nHe has cited, amongst other authorities, the recent decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal[4], which was upheld by the judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Re Initiative and Referendum Act[5].\nAnd I am, from a perusal of the judgment in the case lastly mentioned, and consideration thereof and the far reaching consequences of maintaining such legislation as that attacked herein to be intra vires a local legislature, convinced that this court should, under the said circumstances, have considered and passed upon the questions so involved.\nIt is doubtful if the legislature itself could have enacted, as its deputy the board has done, in the way of winding up a bankrupt corporation unchecked by any possible application to the courts.\nI incline to the opinion that appellant's contention on this point and others involving the question of the validity of such legislation is well founded.\nI am quite aware of the necessity that has often arisen for local legislation touching upon and perhaps invading contractual rights, but I cannot recall a case going so far as has been done in this instance, in many ways objected to, and, in my view towards taking possession of the field of bankruptcy and insolvency assigned by item No. 21 of section 91 of the British North America Act of 1867 to the Dominion Parliament, much less attempting to delegate such powers of legislation to a creation of its own.\nHaving come to understand, whilst engaged in the investigation and consideration of the manifold aspects of this by no means simple case, that the majority of this court were likely to be in accord with my brother Newcombe J's. opinion, which I have referred to, I concluded I could see no useful purpose to be served by my following the matter further, except to point out, as I have done, the urgent need there is for having the validity of said legislation determined. Hence I most respectfully point out my doubt as to the correctness of the view taken by the majority and failure to determine what is in question, especially when coming to the conclusion that all right of appeal is taken away and thereby the board is free to go ahead regardless of the limitations imposed upon it by earlier legislation than this Special Power Act.\nIn referring to the field of bankruptcy and insolvency it is fair to say that counsel on both sides admitted that that aspect of the case had never been presented until I started it in the argument herein. But many other points as above suggested were taken challenging the legislation of the legislature, or its deputy, as ultra vires.\nIn making the foregoing suggestions I am not to be taken as expressing any final opinion.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacKenzie, Thorn, Bastedo & Jackson.\nSolicitors for the respondent, the town of Humboldt: Blair, McNeel & Stewart.\n[1] [1924] 18 Sask.

(1922) c. 171. s. 70. A fire insurance policy on railway ties issued by the appellant company contained, immediately after the words descriptive of the subject of insurance and its location, a clause reading \"warranted by the assured that the property insured is not within 1,000 feet of any scrub or brush nor within 50 feet of any railway track or siding.\"\nHeld that this clause was a variation of the statutory condition and, not being indicated as such in the manner required by s. 70 of the Alberta Insurance Act, R.S.A. (1922) c. 171, was ineffective against the insured. The differences between the wording of this clause and the one in The W. M. Mackay Co. v. The British America Assur. Co. ([1923] S.C.R. 335) are of form merely and not of substance.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1924] 2 W.W.R. 1019) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge [2] and maintaining the respondents action to recover under a fire insurance policy.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. for the appellant.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The defendants appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the judgment of Ives J. holding them liable on a fire insurance policy issued to the plaintiffs. The sole defence relied upon is the admitted fact that, contrary to a provision of the policy, the property insured was situated within 1,000 feet of some scrub or bush and within fifty feet of a railway track or siding.\nAttached to and forming part of the policy was the following wording:\nOn ties, the property of the assured, or sold but not delivered or for which they may be (responsible in case of loss or damage by fire, only while piled in their cleared yard on the west bank of the McLeod river, on timber berth No. 1330 being 8i miles south of Hargwen station, Canadian National Railway (connected by assured's own railway) in the province of Alberta.\nWarranted by the assured that the property insured is not within 1,000 feet of any scrub or bush nor within fifty feet of any railway track or siding.\nThe appellants assert that the clause\nwarranted by the assured that the property insured is not within 1,000 feet of any scrub or bush nor within fifty feet of any railway track or siding\nformed part of the description of the property insured, or, if not, that it was a warranty of the existence of a certain state of affairs surrounding the insured property at the date of issue of the policy and that in either case its untruth prevented the risk attaching.\nThe respondents maintain that this clause is inoperative: (a) because it was surreptitiously introduced into the policy by one Slessor, who, they allege, was an agent of the insurers, after the policy had been delivered to them and without their assent or knowledge; the issue on this branch of the case was the agency of Slessor for the insurers;\n(b) because it is a variation of or an addition to the statutory conditions imposed by the Alberta Insurance Act (R.S.A. c. 17, s. 69, s.s. 5) and was not printed as prescribed by s. 70 which reads as follows:\n70. If the insurer desires to vary the statutory conditions or to omit any of them, or to add any new condition, there shall be added immediately after such conditions words to the following effect, which with any such variation, addition or reference to omissions, shall be printed in conspicuous type and in red ink:\n\"Variations in conditions\"\n\"This policy is issued on the above statutory conditions, with the following variations, omissions and additions, which are, by virtue of The Alberta Insurance Act, in force so far only as they shall be held to be just and reasonable to be exacted by the company;\"\nthe warranty clause was not printed in red ink nor was it preceded by the words \"Variations in conditions,\" or any equivalent. The Appellate Division upheld the latter contention following the decision of this court in Mackay v. British America Assurance Co.[3].\nMr. Mann for the appellants very ably and ingeniously, but we think unsuccessfully, endeavoured to distinguish between the wording of the so-called warranty clause in Mackay's Case 3 and that now before us. In Mackay's Case 3 the clause in question read as follows:\nWarranted by the assured that a continuous clear space of 300 feet shall hereafter be maintained between the lumber hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest, or any saw mill or other special hazard.\nThis clause was separated in the policy from the description of the property and of its location by some intervening provisions. The clause now under consideration immediately follows what the respondents admit to be descriptive words of identification\u2014the only description of the risk which the policy contains. The language of the clause in Mackay's policy was that a\ncontinuous clear space of 300 feet shall be maintained;\nwhereas in the policy now before us the term reads\nthe property insured is not within 1,000 feet of any scrub or bush nor within fifty feet of any railway track or siding.\nUpon these differences Mr. Mann rests his submission that the clause with which we have now to deal should be treated either as descriptive or as a warranty not in the nature of a condition, notwithstanding the Mackay decision.\nThat the differences relied upon were of form merely and not of substance has, we think, been clearly shown by Mr. Justice Hyndman in his carefully prepared opinion. Identification of the goods insured was adequately made in the first paragraph of the policy. That paragraph contained a complete description. The purpose of the insertion of the warranty clause which followed it was to stipulate a term or condition of the risk attaching\u2014and, as the appellants, we think properly, admitted, also of its continuing during the period of the policy. That such a \"warranty\" is an addition to the statutory conditions within the meaning of s. 71 is in our opinion concluded by Mackay's Case3\u2014a decision which we would unhesitatingly re-affirm. The distinction between a condition imposed on the risk attach- ing or continuing and a proviso limiting the peril insured against (such as was dealt with in Curtis's and Harvey (Canada) Ltd. v. North British and Mercantile Ins. Co.)[4], was sufficiently indicated in the Mackay Case[5].\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that the clause invoked is not binding on the assured under s.s. 5 of s. 69 of The Alberta Insurance Act.\nIt is unnecessary, in view of this conclusion, to pass upon the question of Slessor's agency.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondents against the appellant upon a policy of insurance in favour of the respondents as owners of certain railway ties.\nThere were attached to the said policy the following clauses amongst others:\u2014\nAssured: Messrs. McPherson and Quigley.\nSeven thousand five hundred dollars on ties, the property of assured or sold but not delivered or for which they may be responsible in case of loss or damage by fire, only while piled in their cleared yard on the west bank of the McLeod river, on timber berth No. 1330 being 8\u00bd miles miles south of Hargwen station, Canadian National Railway (connected by assured's own railway) in the province of Alberta.\nWarranted by the assured that the property insured is not within 1,000 feet of any scrub or bush nor within fifty feet of any railway track or siding.\nThe appellant set this up as a defence.\nThe learned trial judge and the Appellate Division for Alberta unanimously held that this warranty clause was a variation of or addition to the statutory conditions provided by the Alberta Insurance Act, R.S.A., c. 171, and by reason of its not being printed in red ink and otherwise in conformity with the relevant requirements of said statute as set forth in section 70 of said Act, it was, by section 71. null and void and hence no defence.\nSaid sections 70 and 71 are as follows:\u2014\n70. If the insurer desires to vary the statutory conditions or to omit any of them, or to add any new condition, there shall be added immediately after such conditions words to the following effect, which with any such variation, addition or reference to omissions, shall be printed in conspicuous type and in red ink:\n\"Variations in conditions\"\n\"This policy is issued on the above statutory conditions, with the following variations, omissions and additions, which are, by virtue of The Alberta Insurance Act, in force so far only as they shall be held to be just and reasonable to be exacted by the company.\"\n71. No such variation, omission or addition, unless the same is distinctly indicated and set forth in the manner above prescribed, shall be binding on the assured; but on the contrary the policy shall, as against the insurer, be subject to the statutory conditions only.\nIn so holding the said courts adopted our ruling in the case of Mackay v. The British America Assurance Company[6], and I am of the decided opinion that they were right in so doing.\nThere is no reasonable ground for distinguishing the two cases.\nThere can be distinctions attempted, and often are, between any two decisions or cases, which look clever to those adopting them, but I submit the facts in this case render it a stronger case for the application of said statute than did those in the Mackay Case6. There as here there was no written application by the assured. There was not in that case any such excuse for confusion of thought on the part of the assured such as likely to arise on the facts, as they existed in this case.\nThe insurer herein got the benefit of that, by the court holding that the broker was the agent of the insured and not the insurer.\nI pass no legal opinion upon that aspect of this case for it is not necessary herein to do so, taking the view I do as to the applicability of the said section.\nBut the circumstances shew how necessary it is to bring home to the mind of the insured exactly what he is getting.\nThe distinction sought in argument to be made between this case and said Mackay Case6 arising out of the fact that in this case there had been no examination by the insurer, whilst in that of the latter there had been, does not appeal to me.\nIf it were rendered an imperative duty by law for insurers to inspect before insuring whenever possible and practicable, there would be vastly fewer losses by fire. I need not elaborate that, for inspection or no inspection does not, to my mind, make any difference in law. All I mean to say is that the insurer inspecting is better entitled to due consideration if open to him in law, than is he who indulges in the reckless gambling kind of insurance that so often prevails with some insurers.\nThe strictly legal aspect of the case is, however, all we have to deal with, and, having dealt with it so recently in the Mackay Case (1) I see no need for enlarging or repeating elaborate argument herein.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1924] 2 W.W.R. 1019.\n[2] [1924] 2 W.W.R. 737.\n[3] [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n3 [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n3 [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n3 [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n[4] [1921] 1 A.C. 303.\n[5] [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n[6] [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n6 [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n6 [1923] S.C.R. 335.\n",

Ranch Company (Defendant) Respondent\n1924: October 22, 23; 1924: November 19.\nPresent:\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nSale of goods\u2014Contract to supply f.o.b. at point of shipment\u2014Liability to obtain cars\u2014Rights and obligatiom of seller and buyer\u2014Implied condition as to cars being obtainable. On September 11, 1922, the respondent, of Cayley, Alberta, contracted to supply to the appellant, of Vancouver, 30,000 bushels of wheat f.o.b. cars, Cayley, shipment to be made during September and October. Four shipments to Vancouver were made, but the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the only railway at Cayley, refused, from October 19 to October 30, to accept shipments of wheat to Vancouver. The respondent notified the railway company of its requirements of cars, and was ready, able and willing to deliver the balance of the wheat on the cars at Cayley before the end of October if cars could have been obtained. The appellants claimed damages for non-delivery.\nHeld that the respondent was not liable as delivery within the stipulated period was excused to the extent to which it was prevented by the railway company's inability or refusal to supply necessary cars.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014 Where from the nature of the contract and the circumstances under which it was made it is apparent that the parties must have proceeded on the footing that certain conditions, without which performance would be impossible, should exist, their existence may be regarded as an implied term of the obligation undertaken and non-performance due to their non-existence, without default of the obligor, will relieve him from performance.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (20 Alta. L.R. 307) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant's action for damages for non-delivery of a quantity of wheat under an agreement of sale.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. for the appellant. The contract of sale was formed by the Canada Grain Act ( (C.) 1919, c. 27) and the respondent having failed to observe the provisions of s. 196 of said Act respecting the ordering of cars by him cannot escape liability for failure to deliver the grain within the time limited by such contract, even when assuming that it was the appellant's duty to supply cars.\nThe respondent by consigning the grain to its own agent, the bank, at Vancouver, retained the possession of the grain. The respondent by retaining control over and possession of the grain until it was delivered to the appellant at Vancouver on payment of the 80 per cent of the purchase price, must be taken to have accepted the responsibility of finding the cars for its grain, which grain remained its property until delivered in Vancouver on the order of the bank, by the delivery of the bills of lading.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the respondent. In a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered \"f.o.b. cars,\" the obligation is upon the purchaser to provide cars to receive the goods.\nThe absolute refusal of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to accept shipments of grain for Vancouver during the period from October 19 to 31 when the respondent was able, ready and willing to deliver, and the absence of any authority from the appellant to ship elsewhere, prevented and precluded the respondent from completing fulfilment of the contract. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014By a contract made through a broker the defendants (respondents) sold to the plaintiffs (appellants) 30,000 bushels of wheat to be delivered during the months of September and October, 1922, f.o.b. cars Cayley, Alberta, 80 per cent of the price to be advanced against bills of lading. Although the broker's note is silent on the point, both parties treated the contract which it evidences as providing for shipment to Vancouver\u2014and that should, we think, be deemed one of its terms.\nIt is common ground that the Canadian Pacific Railway is the only railway at Cayley and was the carrier contemplated by the contract. The evidence abundantly establishes that the defendants had wheat ready for delivery to meet the obligation of their contract, which they were anxious to fulfil, that they made every effort to obtain cars, but could procure only four during the period fixed for shipment and those cars were duly loaded and forwarded; that, but for the shortage of cars, in no wise attributable to any fault of the defendants, and the absolute refusal of the railway company to accept grain for shipment to Vancouver during a considerable period in the month of October, owing to congestion at that port, the defendants would have carried out their contract and that their failure to do so is ascribable solely to the inability or unwillingness of the railway company to supply cars to take their wheat available for shipment to the plaintiffs.\nUnder these circumstances is the defendants' obligation to deliver the wheat so absolute that, although not at all at fault, they must pay damages for failure to implement it? Or, having regard to the fact known to both parties that the only available carrier was the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. and to the further fact that the defendants exhausted every reasonable means to obtain cars from it, should that obligation be so qualified that, to the extent to which it was prevented by the railway company's inability or refusal to supply the necessary cars, delivery within the stipulated period was excused? The Appellate Division has taken the latter view (Hyndman J. dissenting) and we are, with respect, of the opinion that its judgment was right and should be affirmed.\nIt is well established that where from the nature of the contract and the circumstances under which it was made it is apparent that the parties must have proceeded on the footing that certain conditions, without which performance would be impossible, should exist their existence maybe regarded as an implied term of the obligation undertaken and non-performance due to their non-existence, without default of the obligor, will relieve him from performance. Taylor v. Caldwell [2] and Krell v. Henry [3] afford illustrations of this doctrine. Such a term will no doubt be admitted only where the court thinks it necessarily implied in the nature of the contract and having regard to the surrounding circumstances. Hamlyn v. Wood[4]; Lazarus v. Cairn Line of Steamships[5]. There is also authority, both strong and abundant, that if an unforeseen contingency arises which renders performance impossible, and if it can be confidently said that had the parties contemplated that contingency they would as sensible men have provided that upon its happening performance would be excused, such a term may and should be implied in the contract. Reigate v. Union Mfg. Co. [6]; F. A. Tamplin Steamship Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co.[7]. That in our opinion is this case. That the defendants would have undertaken to pay damages for failure to deliver the wheat in question f.o.b. cars in the contingency which arose, or that the plaintiffs would have been so unreasonable as to ask them to assume such a risk, we regard as practically inconceivable. Had the impossibility of shipment to Vancouver, which actually happened, been anticipated, we are satisfied that the defendants would have insisted upon, and the plaintiffs would have acceded to, a provision either that the contract in so far as performance of it was thus rendered impossible should be abrogated, or that there should be a reasonable extension of the time stipulated for delivery. There may be some ground for Mr. Bennett's contention that the authorities holding that under a contract for the sale and delivery of goods f.o.b. a vessel the purchaser is bound to have a ship ready to receive the goods at the designated place of shipment do not govern such a case as this. The number of owners having ships open for charter is large; here Canadian Pacific Railway Co's cars were the only available means of carriage. There is a dearth of English authority on the question immediately under investigation. But the weight of American authority appears to favour the view that under a contract for the sale of a quantity of goods to be delivered during a specified period \"f.o.b. cars\" at the place where the vendor carries on business, which is silent as to the duty of providing such cars, he is not under an obligation to supply them, but is required only to be ready to load them when supplied. Evanston Elevator and Coal Co. v. Castner[8]; Hocking v. Hamilton et al[9]; Chicago Lumber Co. v. Comstock[10]. A case closely in point where that view prevailed in regard to the respective obligations of vendor and purchaser is Baltimore and Lehigh Ry. Co. v. Steel Rail Supply Co.[11]. See also Marshall v. Jamieson[12], and Pullan v. Speizman[13]\u2014both cases in which the principle of the decisions on contracts f.o.b. ships was applied. But it is probably unnecessary to determine this interesting question in this case, and there are undoubtedly cases of contracts similar in their general character to that now before us in which special circumstances impose upon the vendors the obligation of procuring cars, as was held in Vancouver Milling and Grain Co. v. Alberta Pacific Elevator Ry.[14]. While it may be that, apart from s. 31 of the Sales of Goods Act, it was the duty of the defendants, as the parties to the contract who were at the point of shipment, to take all proper measures to secure cars from the railway company to receive the wheat sold to the plaintiffs, under the circumstances of this case that was the utmost obligation they assumed in respect of procuring carriage for the wheat and that duty, if incumbent upon them, the evidence shews was fully discharged. They did not assume the further obligation of warranting that the railway company over which they had no control would provide the cars they should demand.\nIt is entirely clear from the evidence that failure to comply literally with the provisions of the Grain Act was not the cause of cars not being available. Had those provisions been carried out to the letter it is more than probable that the defendants would have had fewer cars available to receive their wheat than they actually obtained.\nWith Mr. Justice Stuart we regard the making to the order of the Bank of Hamilton of the bills of lading for the four cars of wheat that were shipped as of no significance. Both parties clearly regarded that method of carrying out the provision,\neighty per cent of the price to be advanced against the bills of lading,\nas within the contemplation of the contract.\nThat the contract contemplated that the vendors should retain the right of stoppage in transitu until their drafts against the bills of lading had been taken up has no bearing on the questions of the incumbency or the extent of any duty in regard to the procuring of cars.\nThe case at bar is distinguishable from Blackburn Bobbin Co. v. T. W. Allen & Sons Ltd.[15], relied on by Mr. Bennett. There the customary mode of conveyance for the goods contracted for was unknown to the purchasers; here the purchasers were aware that shipment on cars of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was the only possible means of performance. That shipment was what was contracted for and both parties knew that unless cars from that railway company were available it could not be made, and that the railway company alone could provide the cars\u2014the vendors could not. Though large enough to include it, the words of the contract were not used with reference to the contingency that happened. The parties contemplated the availability of cars as the foundation of what was to be done under the contract. Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton, Ed- ridge & Co.[16]. There was a failure of something which was at the basis of the contract in the mind and intention of the contracting parties. Horlock v. Bed[17], per Lord Shaw. The occurrence (i.e. the lack of cars) caused the foundation of the contract to disappear and with it the contract itself vanished. F. A. Tamplin Steamship Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Products Co.[18].\nFor these reasons the appeal fails.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appeal herein arises out of an action brought by the appellant against respondent on a contract of which the essential features appear in the broker's note which reads as follows:\u2014\n\"C\" No. 2466.\nPhone S. 4849.\nBroker's Bushels\nW. E. McGAW & CO.\nGrain Brokers\nVancouver, Sept. 11, 1922.\nI hereby confirm the following trade:\nSold to Vancouver Milling & Grain Company, Ltd.\nFrom C. C. Ranch Company Ltd.\nCars.

Shipment to be made during September and October.\nContents of cars\nSeller pays brokerage.\nTime 8 p.m.\nW. E. McGaw & Co.,\nPer W. E. McGaw.\nThe appellant carried on business in Vancouver and the respondent carried on its farming business near Cayley, a station on the C. & E. branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co.\nOn the 21st September the respondent sent a telegram to the appellant at Vancouver, saying\nwire instructions for shipping wheat whether export or ordinary.\nand received in answer same day a telegram saying\nbill all cars to our advice domestic rate.\nThis arose out of the fact that the rate of export was a lower freight rate than for domestic use at Vancouver.\nThe respondent shipped accordingly and, as I read the evidence, was ready and willing to ship the entire amount agreed upon within the term specified in said contract, but was met by the insuperability of getting cars from the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. upon which to ship the same as desired.\nThe said railway was the only possible road by which to ship from Cayley to Vancouver.\nIn the earlier part of the period for the shipment the respondent was impeded by reason of weather conditions and only got about seven thousand bushels shipped before the scarcity of cars prevented further shipments and finally the said railway company refused entirely to ship any grain from the said Cayley station to Vancouver for a period from the 19th of October to 30th thereof, and only got one car through on the last day of October.\nThe question is thus raised whether or not there is, under such circumstances, to be implied in the case of such a contract as in question herein, a condition that the parties are freed from liability for breach thereof when caused solely by such unexpected obstacles in the way of its fulfilment.\nThe appellant argues there is not and claims damages from respondent for breach of said contract.\nIt is met in many ways. Amongst others, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Stuart, the contract did not as framed expressly limit shipments thereunder to be made to Vancouver.\nIn this I think there is considerable force and especially when, as it turned out, cars could have been got for shipments easterly as far as Fort William.\nThere is, however, much in the surrounding circumstances of the contract, leading to the reasonable conclusion that the parties both seem to have assumed that Vancouver was the point of destination intended.\nAfter all is that assumption not rested upon implied conditions? And is the implied condition of impossibility of due fulfilment, anticipating in such event a release from all responsibility for damages, arising alone from that cause any less a reasonable implication in the contract.\nMuch was said in argument by counsel for the appellant as to a large number of cars having at an early stage left Cayley; but two complete answers seem to me to exist to such contention. In the first place it is far from being fully demonstrated by the evidence that on a fair distribution of said cars any single farmer in the district served from the Cayley station, could by any means have got more than respondent got and availed itself of.\nIn the next place it seems to have been fairly demonstrated by the evidence adduced on behalf of respondent, that of the four elevators at Cayley each got a fair proportion of the cars supplied there to carry away the grain had therein, and that the respondent had as many bins continuously filled therein as it could reasonably be expected to have kept filled for such a dubious emergency as confronted shippers of grain for Vancouver.\nIncidentally I may remark, in passing that phase of the case, that there did not seem to me to be any weight in the argument that a shipper situated as respondent was ought to have signed a formal demand such as the law provides in way of foundation for enforcing a fair distribution of the cars available.\nAny one trying that on, when all those concerned were agreed to a fair distribution of cars, and were getting it, unless indeed from the friendly spirit exhibited towards the manager of respondent he may have got a trifle more than he was strictly entitled to, would have aroused hostility and gained nothing.\nMr. Justice Stuart and Mr. Justice Beck have each written very fully and ably presenting the case for the respondent on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal whose judgment is now appealed from herein, and cited authorities bearing on the questions raised, all of which I need not repeat herein. But the following citations of authority by Mr. Justice Beck are the most recent brought to our attention and seem amply to justify the conclusion the court below reached. See Krell v. Henry[19]; Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Company[20]; Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton, Edridge & Co.[21]; Jackson v. Union Marine Insurance Company[22], and the older well known leading case of Taylor v. Caldwell[23]. I am also impressed by Mr. Justice Stuart's reference to the Alberta Sales of Goods Act, referring evidently to the following from s. 31 of c. 146:\u2014\nWhere in pursuance of a contract of sale the seller is authorized or required to send goods to the buyer, delivery of the goods to a carrier whether named by the buyer or not for the purpose of transmission to the buyer shall prima facie be deemed to be a delivery of goods to the buyer. (2) Unless otherwise authorized by the buyer the seller shall make such contract with the carrier on behalf of the buyer as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and the other circumstances of the case.\nI have from the consideration of the foregoing and other authorities, and the relevant evidence herein, reached the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The interpretation of f.o.b. contracts has most frequently occurred where carriage from the f.o.b. point was to take place by water. In such a case, in the absence of express or implied agreement to the contrary, it is the duty of the buyer to furnish the ship, and, the ship being furnished, it is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods on board the ship at his own expense,\nupon the terms of a reasonable and ordinary bill of lading or other contract of carriage;\nper Hamilton L.J. Wimble v. Rosenberg[24]. The obligation to deliver and to enter into a contract of carriage is obviously conditional upon the ship being furnished and a contract of carriage being possible. No breach of the seller's obligation arises if the ship is not notified, or if, the ship being notified, receipt of the goods is refused. The contract which has given rise to this litigation contemplated shipment by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., and I think also that it contemplated shipment to Vancouver, although this last is really not material. The critical question is: Did the seller enter upon an obligation to deliver\u2014 that is, to deliver effectively\u2014to the railway company, and to enter into a contract of carriage with the railway company, even though the company should decline to furnish cars or to enter into such a contract? There appears to be no basis for such an obligation. None is expressed, and none can be implied when the words of the contract are read in the light of the uniform interpretation of similar words in contracts of sale contemplating delivery on board ship. Mr. Bennett relied upon a number of American authorities as inconsistent with this conclusion, but on this subject American authority is divided. Without passing upon the relative weight of the decisions which could be cited respectively against and in support of Mr. Bennett's contention, it is sufficient to say that the American authorities yield no decision resultant. They are collected in Professor Williston's book on Sales, in the edition of 1924, at p. 599. Canadian authority, so far as it goes, supports the view just expressed. Pullan v. Speizman[25]; Marshall v. Jamieson[26]. It does not necessarily follow, it should be observed, that under the contract in question it was the duty of the purchaser to provide cars. Upon that point no opinion is expressed.\nIn this view it is quite unnecessary to consider whether the circumstances of this case bring it within the principle of those cases in which, commercial frustration of the contract having resulted from impossibility of performance by the contemplated means, non-performance has been held to be excused. Here, the respondent company has done everything it was called upon to do in the circumstances. The question whether the failure of the railway company to provide cars would afford an excuse within the principle mentioned might have arisen if the contract sought to be enforced in this action had been a contract f.o.b. Vancouver.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1924] 20 Alta.

L.R. 159) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge on an application by the administrator of the estate of Enos Stone deceased for the opinion, advice and direction of the court as to claims to the deceased's property.\nEnos Stone, an illegitimate son of one Sarah Newton, died on or about the thirteenth January, 1918, intestate and unmarried. At the time of his death he was domiciled in Saskatchewan. His estate consisted of real and personal property situated in the province of Saskatchewan. The land comprised in the estate was on the first day of September, 1905, the date of the coming into force of the Saskatchewan Act (4-5 Edward VII (Dom.) c. 42)\u2014Crown land within the province, vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, and was patented to Stone at a later date. On the 23rd September, 1918, letters of administration to his estate were granted to the Western Trust Company as official administrator for the Judicial District of Swift Current. Sarah Newton, the mother of the intestate, was also the mother of another illegitimate son called William Stone, who is living and resides at Madelia, in the state of Minnesota. After the birth of the two illegitimate sons, Sarah Newton was married to one Walter E. Stone who predeceased her, and bore ten children to him. Eight of these children are still alive. Two of the children are dead, but have left issue surviving them. Sarah (Newton) Stone died on the 16th October, 1890. Claims were made to the estate by William Stone and the legitimate children and grandchildren of Sarah Stone, as well as on behalf of the Attorney General for Canada and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan. An application was made under the rules in that behalf by the administrator for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court of King's Bench on the following questions: (1) What persons, if any, are entitled to share the estate of the said deceased. (2) In the event of none of the said persons being entitled to share the estate of the said deceased, whether the property of the said estate will escheat to the Crown, in the right of the Dominion of Canada, or in the right of the province of Saskatchewan. The matter was heard by Bigelow J., in chambers, who held against the claims of William Stone and the legitimate children of Sarah Stone. The learned judge also held that the lands of the intestate escheated to the Crown in the right of the Dominion. As to the personal property, it was held to be bona vacantia and to belong to the Crown in the right of the province, after the payment of all claims of creditors, solicitors' costs and administration fees. The Court of Appeal set aside in toto the judgment of Bigelow J. and declared that all the property of Enos Stone had gone to William Stone, the other illegitimate son of Sarah Newton Stone.\nLafleur K.C. and Plaxton for the Attorney General of Canada, The whole estate, personal as well as real, of the deceased Enos Stone, upon his death intestate without heirs or next of kin, ipso facto passed to and became vested in the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada as escheat and bona vacantia.\nAs between the Dominion of Canada and the province of Saskatchewan, sections 102 and 109 of the B.N.A. Act (1867) have no application to the decision of the question at issue; and, on the true construction of the provisions of \"The Saskatchewan Act\" ( (C.) 1905, c. 42) the royal revenues arising from escheat and bona vacantia within that province belong to the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nThe provisions of \"The Saskatchewan Act\" do not give the province power to enact the sections 23, 24 and 25 of the Devolution of Estates Act (R.S.S. 1909, c. 43). Upon their proper construction, these sections do not operate to carry the real and personal property of the deceased to William Stone or to the legitimate children of Sarah Stone, and the said property have consequently escheated to the Crown in the right of the Dominion.\nBlackwood and Haywood for the Attorney General of Saskatchewan. Sections 23 and 24 of The Devolution of Estates Act are intra vires the provincial legislature. In the alternative, if these sections are held to be ultra vires, the personal property of the deceased should be declared to have passed on his death to the Crown in right of the province.\nCrysler K.C. for the respondent W. Stone. Under the provisions of The Devolution of Estates Act, which the legislature of Saskatchewan was competent to enact, William Stone was entitled to the whole estate of the deceased, real and personal.\nCrysler K.C. for the respondent\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by Mignault J.\u2014This litigation arises out of an originating summons issued at the instance of the Western Trust Company, administrator of the estate of the late Enos Stone, in his lifetime of Cabri, in the province of Saskatchewan, and to which were made parties the Attorney General of the Dominion, the Attorney General of Saskatchewan, William Stone, stated to be the illegitimate son of Sarah Newton, and the children issue of the marriage of the said Sarah Newton and Walter E. Stone. The latter children will be hereafter referred to as the legitimate children of the said Sarah Newton Stone.\nSarah Newton is said to have had two illegitimate children before her marriage with Walter E. Stone, to wit, the deceased Enos Stone, who died \"unmarried and intestate, and William Stone (neither of whom apparently were children of Stone, although they assumed his name), but the appellant objects that the filiation of William Stone has not been legally proved. Sarah Newton Stone had of her marriage with Walter E. Stone ten children, all now living except two who are represented by their children. She died in 1890, many years before Enos Stone. The estate of the latter is valued at $19,757.33, consisting of real and personal property, his lands having been patented to him by the Crown in the right of the Dominion subsequently to the passing of The Saskatchewan Act, c. 42 of the statutes of Canada, 1905.\nTwo questions were submitted for the opinion of the court:\n1. What persons, if any, are entitled to share the estate of the said deceased?\n2. In the event of none of the said persons being entitled to share the estate of the said deceased, whether the property of the said estate will escheat to the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada, or in the right of the province of Saskatchewan?\nThe trial judge, Bigelow J., decided that none of the children, legitimate or illegitimate, of Sarah Newton Stone were entitled to share the estate of Enos Stone; that the land of which he died possessed had escheated to the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada and his personal estate as bona vacantia had gone to the Crown in the right of the province of Saskatchewan. The Attorney General of Canada appealed to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan from that part of the judgment of Bigelow J. which declared that the personal estate of Enos Stone as bona vacantia had gone to the province of Saskatchewan. On this appeal, although the children, legitimate and illegitimate, of Sarah Newton Stone had not themselves appealed, the Court of Appeal intimated that it would consider whether they had any right to the deceased's estate, and no objection appears to have been taken to this course. The judgment set aside in toto the judgment of Bigelow J., and declared that all the property of Enos Stone had gone to William Stone, the illegitimate son of Sarah Newton Stone. From this judgment the Attorney General of Canada appealed to this court, and at the hearing the two attorneys general, and William Stone were represented by counsel. The legitimate children of Sarah Newton Stone were not represented by counsel before us, although notice of the appeal was given them.\nIf William Stone\u2014who, it will be convenient to assume, was the illegitimate son of Sarah Newton Stone, subject to considering later the objection of the appellant that his filiation has not been legally proved\u2014is entitled to the estate of Enos Stone, there can be no question of escheat or of devolution of bona vacantia either in favour of the Crown in the right of the Dominion or of the Crown in the right of the province. If he is not entitled to the estate, it is conceded that the lands of Enos Stone, patented to him from the Dominion after the creation of the province of Saskatchewan, escheated to the Crown in the right of the Dominion, and the issue between the Attorney General of the Dominion and the Attorney General of the province is as to which government is entitled to his personal estate. Counsel for the province of Saskatchewan also conceded that if the Dominion takes the lands of Enos Stone by escheat it takes them subject only to such charges as affect them and not to the general debts of Enos Stone.\nIn declaring William Stone entitled to the estate of Enos Stone, the Court of Appeal based its decision on sections 24 and 25 of The Devolution of Estates Act, c. 16 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1907. These sections (carried into the revision of the statutes of the province in 1909, as ss. 23 and 24 of c. 43, and into the revision of 1920 as ss. 45 and 46 of c. 73), read as follows:\u2014\n24. Illegitimate children shall inherit from the mother as if they were legitimate, and through the mother, if dead, any real or personal property which she would, if living, have taken by purchase, gift, demise or descent from any other person.\n25. If an intestate being an illegitimate child dies leaving no widow or husband or issue the whole of such intestate's property, real and personal, shall go to his or her mother.\nThe contentions of the Attorney General of Canada\u2014and much assistance has been derived from the very able and learned factum filed on his behalf\u2014may be briefly stated in the following propositions.\n1. Sections 24 and 25 of the Saskatchewan statute, in so far as they purport to add to the persons who at common law are entitled to claim the estate of an intestate in the province, and thus to defeat the right of escheat of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, are ultra vires of the province.\n2. Properly construed, these sections do not support the claim of William Stone, assuming him to be the illegitimate son of Sarah Newton Stone, to the estate of Enos Stone.\n3. The Crown in the right of the Dominion is entitled to take by escheat the lands of Enos Stone and as bona vacantia his personal property, and it takes the latter free from the obligation to pay the general debts of the intestate.\nFirst proposition. Very important constitutional problems are involved in the decision of this question.\nUnder the authority granted it by The British North America Act, 1867, the Parliament of Canada, in 1905, created the new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan out of what was known as the North West Territories, which territories were subject to its legislative jurisdiction. The Saskatchewan Act, with which we are concerned here, is c. 42 of the statutes of Canada, 1905.\nVery briefly, the effect of this statute is to create a province with the rights and powers of the other provinces of the Dominion. Some important provisions should however be specially noted.\nThus it is provided by section 3 as follows:\n3. The provisions of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of Saskatchewan in the same way and to the like extent, as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said province of Saskatchewan had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act. and except such provisions as are in terms made or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nAnd by section 21 it is enacted:\u2014\n21. All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the province under The North-West Irrigation Act, 1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said province with the substitution therein of the said province for the Northwest Territories.\nAt this late date it would be idle to deny that within the limits of their jurisdiction the provinces of the Dominion possess powers as ample as the Imperial Parliament in the plentitude of its own power possessed and could confer. Hodge v. The Queen[2]; Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. The Receiver General of New Brunswick[3].\nLegislation as to rights of succession and devolution of estates on intestacy undoubtedly comes within the 13th heading \"property and civil rights in the province\" of s. 92 of The British North America Act. And Attorney General of Quebec v. Attorney General of Canada[4], decided by the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench, is authority for the proposition that the power to extend the degrees of succession so as to comprise illegitimate children is not curtailed by any rights of escheat belonging to the Crown. If therefore s. 92, s.s. 13, of The British North America Act fully applies to Saskatchewan, it seems clear that provincial legislation of the kind in question could not be attacked because in a particular case it may defeat the right of escheat of the Crown, assuming such right to belong to the Crown in the right of the Dominion.\nBut the appellant relies on s. 21 of The Saskatchewan Act, as restricting the right of Saskatchewan so to extend the degrees of succession as to deprive it of the benefit of an escheat which under the common law and irrespective of this legislation it could have claimed. Section 21, no doubt the result of a bargain made with the new province, reserves to the Crown in the right of the Dominion\nall Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto.\nThe reservation of royalties, jura regalia, is merely of those incident to Crown lands, mines and minerals, and while the province cannot by statute appropriate the right of escheat of the Dominion in respect of Crown lands, mines and minerals in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and it has not done so here, it does not follow that it cannot change its laws of inheritance. The contention of the appellant that ss. 24 and 25 are ultra vires should therefore be rejected.\nSecond proposition. The question here is as to the proper construction of ss. 24 and 25 of the Saskatchewan Devolution of Estates Act.\nIt will be useful to give in very few words the history of this legislation.\nAt common law a bastard is nullius filius and cannot therefore inherit from ascendants or collaterals, nor can ascendants or collaterals inherit from him. His only heirs are those of his body.\nThe laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as they existed on the 15th of July, 1870, were introduced into the North West Territories (49 Vict. (D.) c. 25, s. 3). Thus the common law as above stated and also the Inheritance Act of 1833 (3-4 William IV, c. 106) became a part of the law of these territories, subject of course to change by competent legislation.\nIn 1886, by The Territories Real Property Act, c. 26 of the statutes of Canada, 1886, the right of inheritance of and from illegitimate children was first recognized and provisions (ss. 16 and 17) substantially the same as the sections under consideration were enacted by the Parliament of Canada. These provisions, as ss. 14 and 15, were carried into the Dominion Land Titles Act, 1894, c. 28 of the statutes of that year.\nThe latter statute continued in force after the creation of the new provinces and was repealed as to these provinces on the coming in force of the provincial Land Titles Act. This provincial Act reproduced the provisions to which reference has been made, and they were finally inserted in The Devolution of Estates Act of 1907. In passing from one statute to another they have been somewhat broadened out.\nComing now to the construction of ss. 24 and 25 of the Saskatchewan statute, s. 25 can give rise to no difficulty. It means what it says, and under it the whole of the property, real and personal, of an intestate, being an illegitimate child who has left no widow or husband or issue, goes to his or her mother. It will be necessary to determine whether this devolution of the intestate's estate can properly be termed a descent in the sense in which that word is used in s. 24, but for the moment the question is merely as to the meaning of these sections, and the only one that can give us any difficulty is s. 24.\nThat the language of s. 24, while seemingly clear is in reality somewhat equivocal, is shewn by the different constructions which the two courts below have placed on it. The first member of the phrase stating that\nillegitimate children shall inherit from the mother (their mother) as if they were legitimate,\nis sufficiently plain. As far as inheritance from the mother of property belonging to her at her death is concerned, the illegitimate child is placed on the same footing as a legitimate one, and both Mr. Lafleur, representing the appellant, and Mr. Chrysler, who appeared for the respondent William Stone, agreed that the illegitimate child would inherit with the legitimate children property belonging to the mother at her death intestate.\nThe remainder of s. 24 goes much further and gives to the illegitimate child a right of inheritance through his or her mother which, as expressed, seems greater in extent than that enjoyed by her children born in lawful wedlock. For the illegitimate child inherits\nthrough the mother, if dead, any real or personal property which she would, if living, have taken by purchase, gift, demise or descent from any other person.\nThe words \"through the mother\" are probably used here to indicate the course of descent, although the possibility that the legislature considered this as a case of representation cannot be excluded with any certainty. By a fiction of law, the mother, although dead, is supposed to have been living and to have acquired some property by purchase, gift, demise or descent, and this property the illegitimate child inherits \"through the mother.\" No such right of inheritance was granted by the Alberta statute to the legitimate child, and in the case of Enos Stone, if there had not been another illegitimate child, no one would have been entitled to claim that he had inherited the estate. Perhaps unwittingly but none the less effectively the legislature has put a premium on illegitimacy.\nThe appellant, however, contends that the generality of s. 24 is cut down by the use of the terms\npurchase, gift, demise or descent\nwhich he submits should be construed in their strict technical sense. He argues that the only possible title here is one by descent and that descent necessarily supposes that the person taking by this title is the heir of and related by consanguinity to the person from whom he takes.\nDescent is defined as taking real estate by inheritance, that is, as heir of the former holder (Halsbury, vo. Descent and Distribution, No 1). The Inheritance Act, 1833, states that it is\nthe title to inherit land by reason of consanguinity as well where the heir shall be an ancestor or collateral relation as where he shall be a child or other issue.\nAs used in olden times it was an apt expression, for it was a maxim of the law that on the death of the tenant in fee the land should descend and not ascend (Bouvier, Law Dictionary, vo. Descent and Distribution), but now a title of inheritance ascends as well as descends, although it is still called a descent. In a legal system like that of Saskatchewan, where the real and personal property of a decedent is vested in his personal representative and where both devolve according to the same rules (R.S.S. c. 73, s. 3), it matters little that in the technical language of the law \"descent\" is used in respect of real estate and \"distribution\" for the division of the personal estate of an intestate (Bouvier, loco citato supra).\n\"Purchase\" and \"descent\" are very wide and mutually exclusive terms, and as a purchase includes any title other than one by descent, it could comprise a title, if it be not a title by descent conferred by a statute such as the one in question. But in view of the enactment contained in s. 25, it can be said that in Saskatchewan the mother is the heir-at-law of her illegitimate child who dies intestate and leaves neither husband or wife, nor issue surviving, and in that respect a modification of the common law is made by the statute to which full effect must be given. So the title conferred by s. 25 can well be considered a title by descent. If therefore the mother takes by descent under s. 25 it would be consistent with the rules of legal interpretation to conclude that the term \"descent\" in s. 24 comprises a title by descent such as the mother acquires by virtue of s. 25. The conclusion consequently seems inevitable that Sarah Newton Stone, if living, would have inherited the property left by Enos Stone by descent and as a result her illegitimate son William Stone takes this property through her under s. 24.\nIt is a matter of regret that the legitimate children of Sarah Newton Stone cannot take a share in this property, but while s. 24 remains unamended nothing can go to them, for they are not at common law the heirs of Enos Stone.\nDue consideration has been given to the memorandum of additional authorities filed by the appellant some time after the argument. The only case among those cited which appears to call for any comment is the decision of the Supreme Court of Indiana in Jackson v. Hocke[5]. It may be observed however that while s. 2998 of the Indiana statute is somewhat similar to, although not identical with, s. 24 of the Saskatchewan Devolution of Estates Act, there is no provision in the Indiana statute to the same effect as s. 25 of the Saskatchewan Act. The inheritance of the mother under the latter section is certainly an inheritance by descent, and if so it is difficult to appreciate why it should not be considered as an inheritance by descent within the meaning of s. 24.\nIn view of what has been said, the third proposition of the appellant need not be considered, for there is no escheat and there are no bona vacantia.\nAt this late stage of the proceedings, it does not seem proper to order a reference to determine whether William Stone is really the illegitimate son of Sarah Newton Stone. He was treated as such by the two courts below, and this question should have been tried out before the trial court. The appeal therefore fails and I would dismiss it with costs against the appellant in favour of the respondent William Stone. I would not order these costs to be paid out of the estate, for that virtually would oblige the respondent William Stone to pay them out of his property. I would grant no costs on this appeal to the Attorney General of Saskatchewan.\nIdington J.\u2014Enos Stone late of Cabri in the province of Saskatchewan, farmer, was the illegitimate son of Sarah Newton of Lincolnshire, England (later Sarah Stone, wife of Walter E. Stone of the same place), and James Dykens of the same place and died intestate, unmarried, and possessed of real and personal estate.\nLetters of administration of all and singular the property of the deceased were duly granted to the Western Trust Company of the city of Regina, in Saskatchewan, as the official administrator of the judicial district of Swift Current, on the 23rd of September, 1918.\nThere was born to the said Sarah Newton, prior to her marriage to the said Walter E. Stone, another illegitimate son called William Stone. After her marriage she gave birth to a number of legitimate children, some of whom died leaving legitimate issue.\nThe said Sarah Stone died the 6th October, 1890.\nThe said Enos Stone was domiciled in Saskatchewan at the time of his death. The lands comprised in his said estate were patented from the Crown subsequent to the passing of the Saskatchewan Act, being c. 42 of the statutes of Canada 4-5 Edw. VII.\nAn originating summons having been taken out by said administrator to determine who is entitled to the estate of said deceased, the parties were heard by Bigelow J. in Chambers, who held that the land escheated to the Crown in right of the Dominion, and that the goods belonging to the estate of the deceased escheated to the Crown in the right of the province of Saskatchewan, after payment of all claims of creditors, solicitors' costs and administrator's fees out of same.\nUpon appeal therefrom by the Crown on behalf of the Dominion to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, that court set aside said judgment and declared that all the property of the said deceased, Enos Stone, should go to William Stone, the illegitimate son of Sarah Stone, the mother of the said deceased; subject to payment of debts, succession duty, costs of administration and all other claims and expenses properly chargeable against the estate.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal properly points out that though the English law as introduced in the North West Territories might have produced an escheat in favour of the appellant, yet there had been very important changes made by the Territories Real Property Act, c. 26 of the statutes of Canada, 1886 (later R.S.C. 1886, c. 61) in the law relating to inheritance by and from illegitimate children to which I am about to advert, as the continuation thereof is in truth the turning point of this appeal.\nI also attach, however, great importance to the ss. 4 and 5 of said Act as consolidated.\nS. 4 is as follows:\u2014\n4. From and after the commencement of this Act, all lands in the Territories shall be subject to the provisions hereof;\nand s. 5 is as follows:\u2014\n5. All lands in the Territories which, by common law, are regarded as real estate, shall be held to be chattels real, and shall go to the executor or administrator of any person or persons dying seized or possessed thereof, as personal estate now passes to the personal representatives.\nImagine how this would have shocked the founders of so much of the law cited in many pages of the appellant's factum, as if binding us now.\nI most respectfully submit that if we would correctly interpret and construe the later legislation we have to consider as bearing upon the issues raised herein, we must bear in mind the true meaning of s. 5.\nThe sections following are in harmony therewith but need not be quoted until we come to ss. 16 and 17, which are as follows:\u2014\n16. Illegitimate children shall inherit from the mother as if they were legitimate, and through the mother if dead, any property or estate which she would, if living, have taken by purchase, gift, devise, or descent from any other person.\n17. When an illegitimate child dies intestate, without issue, the mother of such child shall inherit.\nThen we have the Land Titles Act of 1894, of which the general tenor is the same and in that we have ss. 14 and 15, which are as follows:\u2014 14. Illegitimate children shall inherit from the mother as if they were legitimate, and through the mother, if dead, any land which she would, if living, have taken by purchase, gift, devise or descent from any other person.\n15. When an illegitimate child dies intestate, without issue, the mother of such child shall inherit any land which the said child was the owner of at the time of his death.\nThe course of succession generally was also changed by this Act, and the heir was superseded by the next of kin by s. 3, which is as follows:\u2014\n3. Land in the Territories shall go to the personal representatives of the deceased owner thereof in the same manner as personal estate now goes, and be dealt with and distributed as personal estate.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice of the court below that all this must be taken as an explicit waiver by the Crown of its right of escheat in favour of the mother and I may add that the clear resultant effect of the foregoing helps us to interpret and construe in a wider sense than appellant's counsel urges we can.\nI can conceive that the word \"descent\" might be given a much more limited meaning than has been given it by the Court of Appeal, but I submit that in light of the foregoing history of the legislation, and adding thereto much of the history thereof, given us by the learned Chief Justice, which I have not seen necessary to repeat, we must interpret and construe the said word \"descent\" as it evidently was intended to be interpreted and construed by the legislators using it.\nTo discard that, to a Canadian, almost self-evident meaning, and substitute the meaning an English Parliamentary draftsman possibly would have attached thereto, and rejected it, and substituted something else more absolutely accurate, would deprive the legislation of any effect.\nI submit we must try to give it some effect and doing so we must adopt the meaning given it in the court below.\nWhen we have done that this appeal in my opinion fails.\nAll that ensued upon the creation of the province of Saskatchewan was obviously the result of the negotiations between the then Dominion Government and those suppliants desiring the creation of a new province, or indeed two new provinces, for the creation of Alberta as a province was considered and disposed of at the same time. And the Saskatchewan Act (being 4-5 Edw. VII, c. 42 of the Dominion Parliament) declared by s. 3 thereof as follows:\u2014\n3. The provisions of The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1885, shall apply to the province of Saskatchewan in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said province of Saskatchewan had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nAnd by s. 16 thereof all the laws and regulations made thereunder were, so far as not inconsistent therewith, continued in force.\nI see nothing in said Act that interferes with the said enactments in question herein, or the interpretation and construction thereof in the sense I have suggested and which has been adopted by the judgment appealed from.\nIt so happened that the only large question dealt with by said Act and the only one pretended to be inconsistent with said law, is s. 21 of said Saskatchewan Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n21. All Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interests of the Crown in the waters within the province under The North-West Irrigation Act, 1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said province with the substitution therein of the said province for the North-West Territories.\nIt has been submitted to us in course of argument herein that inasmuch as the granting of\nCrown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto\nwere to continue vested in the Crown and be administered by the Government of Canada, the right of escheat was intended to belong to the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nI cannot see anything therein to warrant such a pretension. Indeed if such a thing had been thought of I imagine it would, if so decided, have been expressed in entirely different language.\nThe right of escheat, of course (where existent, as it is not herein), belongs to the Crown, but the question remains whether of the Crown in right of the Dominion or of the province. The case of The Trusts & Guarantee Company v. The King[6], does not, whatever it decides, determine that point, for, as Chief Justice Haultain points out, the opinion of our former Chief Justice, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, held expressly another way, and I, and Mr. Justice Brodeur, certainly were not of the opinion that there was an escheat in favour of the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nI may be permitted here, with great respect, to submit that neither the said judgment, nor that in Attorney General of Ontario v. Mercer[7] goes quite as far as submitted in the judgment appealed from.\nFor the present I feel no necessity for passing upon the question, inasmuch as there is in the view above expressed, no ground for escheat.\nThe newly created legislature re-enacted the law as it had stood under Dominion legislation, and with the result that William Stone, according to the opinion of the court below, with which I agree, is the party entitled to receive what remains after the due administration of the estate of the late Enos Stone in the hands of the administrator.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs of all parties to be paid by the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the Attorney General of Canada: Turnbull, Turnbull & Kinsman.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: H.

Taylor K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court Anglin C.J., Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ., was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The SS. Perene going out of St. John Harbour on 1st February, 1921, at the end of the middle watch, ran down and sank the three-masted schooner Maid of Scotland, which was then off the entrance of the harbour intending to beat her way up. The owners of the schooner, defendants in the first named action, proceeded in the Exchequer Court in Admiralty to recover damages for the loss of the vessel. The schooner was laden with 646 tons, 14 cwt. of anthracite coal from New York belonging to R. P. & W. F. Starr, Ltd, the respondent in the second of the above named actions. This company also proceeded in the Exchequer Court in Admiralty to recover damages for the loss of the cargo. The two cases were tried together before the local judge of the court at St. John, upon agreement that the evidence to be given should apply to both cases. The learned local judge for the reasons stated in the very careful judgment which he delivered found for the plaintiffs in both cases and assessed the damages for the schooner at $26,465 and for the cargo at $10,640.78. From these judgments the Perene, defendant in both cases, appeals to this court alleging that the findings are erroneous and that she is not responsible for the collision.\nThese two appeals, in each of which the Perene is the appellant, and in which both respondents were represented by the same counsel, were, for convenience, heard together. At the conclusion of the appellant's argument the court considered that the appellant had not, as to either appeal, made out a case of error in fact, or the disregard of any cardinal principle, such as would justify the court in varying the judgments either upon the main question of responsibility, or as to the quantum of damages, except in one particular, as to which counsel for the respondents were heard and the cases reserved for consideration. It appeared that in assessing the damages of the owners the local judge, having valued the vessel at the time of her loss at $20,000, allowed in addition several items, including one for insurance premium unexpired, amounting to $1,634, and that, in assessing the value of the cargo, he allowed for marine insurance premium $156.93, and he states that as to these special items of insurance premium liability was not disputed. Upon appeal however the appellant maintains that these two items were allowed, the one to the owners of the schooner, the other to the owners of the cargo, without authority in law or precedent, and that the damages in each case should therefore be reduced by these amounts respectively. As the question in its bearing as to the respective cases depends upon different considerations I shall consider the cases separately.\nPerene v. Maid of Scotland\nNo explanation is given in the judgment for including the insurance premium as part of the respondents' damages except the statement that the right to the unexpired insurance premium was not disputed. The schooner was insured by a time policy, and the $1,634 is claimed as that part of the insurance premium paid by the owners of the schooner which, it is said, was attributable to the unexpired period of the policy. The appellant, however, now contends that, the risk having attached, there can be no apportionment of the premium by reason of the loss of the ship by the perils insured against before the expiry of the policy, and that the premium does not constitute an element of loss which can properly be considered in the assessment. On the other hand it is urged that either the premium should be apportioned and the amount attributable to the unexpired period of the policy made good by the appellant, by whose negligence the schooner was sunk; or that the value of the schooner for purposes of assessment should be regarded as enhanced by the fact that she was covered by insurance which had at the time of the loss a considerable period to run. The question is not, so far as I have been able to discover, directly covered by judicial decision. In the case of The Harmonides[3], a similar claim was made and disallowed by the District Registrar, but although the report was reviewed on appeal upon other grounds, no question was raised as to the propriety of the District Registrar's disposition of the item for insurance premium; also it appears from Mr. Roscoe's valuable book on The Measure of Damages in Maritime Collisions, 2nd edition, pp. 37, 38, 174, that such claims are not allowed in the Registrar's office. It seems clear enough that no proportionate allocation of the premium upon a marine risk can be referred to any part of the period for which the risk is contracted; the contract is entire and the premium has relation only to the risk in its entirety; therefore it is difficult to perceive how any just distribution can be made. If the risk had not attached presumably the premium would be adjusted by refund from the insurer to the insured, and in such a case, upon obvious principles, neither would be entitled to recover from the wrongdoer through whose fault the property was lost before the attaching of the risk. The expense of the premium is directly attributable to the contract, not to the collision, and damages based upon interference with the insurance contract are too remote. Moreover, since it is the insured and not the wrongdoer who has the benefit of the insurance, it is incompatible with principle that the latter should pay for it. This objection is well stated by Mr. Roscoe, citing Yates v. White[4]; and Bradburn v. Great Western Ry. Co.[5], where he says:\nIf any part of the premium could be recovered from the owner of the wrongdoing ship the latter would be fairly entitled to ask that the amount paid under the policy should be taken into consideration in the assessment of the damages; and it has been held that a wrongdoer is not entitled to claim any reduction in respect of money received by an injured party under a policy.\nFor these reasons I am disposed to think that, notwithstanding the absence of any objection at the trial, the learned judge had no authority in law to bring the insurance premium into the assessment of damages.\nI do not think, however, that either because of the insurance or for any other reason the value of the vessel as found by the local judge should be increased, and therefore in the result the conclusion upon the whole case with regard to the schooner is that the judgment below should be varied by reducing the amount found, namely, $26,465 by $1,634, the amount included in it for insurance premium, and that in all other respects the judgment should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the judgment at the trial. But inasmuch as the defendants in the Exchequer Court did not dispute the insurance premium, which also represents only a comparatively small item of the aggregate amount involved in the appeal, they will, notwithstanding the variation of the judgment, have no costs of the appeal.\nPerene v. Starr, Ltd.\nIn figuring the value of the cargo the local judge includes the amount paid for the coal, 10 per cent added for profits, commission brokerage and overhead, a small advance on freight, cost of exchange and marine insurance premium, $156.93, the latter being the cost of insurance for the voyage, and beginning with a quotation from Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 26, p. 541, he says:\u2014\nCargo owners who have lost their goods carried in one vessel in consequence of a collision due to the negligent navigation of another vessel, are as a rule entitled to recover from the owners of the other vessel the value of the goods at the place and time and in the state at and in which they ought to have been delivered to the owners, as the value is the market price of the goods if there is a market there. If not, such value has to be calculated, taking into account among other matters the cost price, the expenses of transit, and the importer's profit.\nNo evidence was given before me to show what the market price of the goods was at the city of St. John, the place at which the coal ought to have been delivered to the plaintiffs. Such value must, therefore, be calculated, and among other matters to be taken into account as laid down in the paragraph which I have quoted from Halsbury, are the cost price, the expenses of transit and the importer's profit.\nIt was not contended on behalf of the defendant that ten per cent of the amount of the coal was too large a sum to be allowed to cover the items mentioned and which were described by Mr. Starr as covering profits, incidental expenses, brokerage, cost of telegraphing and other items. I am of opinion that the charge was a moderate one, and as no objection was taken to it on the ground of the percentage charged, and as in calculating the market value the items mentioned should be taken into account, I will fix the damages at the full amount of $10,640.78 with interest from the first day of February last.\nThere appears to be no misdirection here. It is true that the selling price of coal at St. John is not proved by evidence of the market, but Mr. Starr who was called to establish the value gave his testimony without any objection whatever, and from this it would appear that according to the actual price paid, plus the additions above mentioned, the coal would have a value of less than $16.50 per long ton at St. John, and seeing that the local judge found the value in accordance with the proof so made; that the admissibility of the evidence was not questioned; and particularly that no objection to any item was made, except as to the propriety of including any sum for estimated profit; it would seem, having regard to the course of the trial, that his finding ought not to be disturbed. The cost of the insurance, if the cargo had safely come to hand, would have been realized out of the proceeds of the sale, and I see no reason why the total value as found by the local judge should be reduced by the amount of the premium; it really would form part of the cost of the goods to the owner at St. John. For these reasons and for the reasons stated by the local judge, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The steamship Perene, in the Bay of Fundy, on the 1st of February last, ran down in collision the sailing schooner Maid of Scotland and thereby sank her and her cargo and four of her crew, which consisted of six men in all. The result was the total loss of the schooner and her cargo, as well as of four lives.\nThe learned Chief Justice Hazen, as Local Judge in Admiralty, having tried the claims of the owners of the schooner Maid of Scotland arising out of said collision, and the claims of the respondent R. P. & W. F. Starr, Limited, owners of the cargo, delivered, on the 30th of April, a long and well considered judgment finding the appellant wholly to blame.\nAt a later date, the 13th of May last, he heard the counsel for the respective parties relative to the damages to be allowed as flowing from and recoverable by the respective respondents, and delivered, as result thereof, on the 19th of May last, a lengthy and able judgment covering in every reasonable way the entire questions arising in both cases.\nFrom these judgments the Perene appealed to this court and, after a long argument by the leading counsel (exceeding the limit of time allowed by the rules of our court), we came to the unanimous conclusion that as to the question of which party was to blame, there was no doubt in our minds that the judgment of the learned trial judge was right, and there was no need for counsel for respondent to deal with anything except the question of damages, and the appellant's counsel were heard as to the items they objected to.\nThey objected to the principle upon which the learned trial judge proceeded-, in assessing the damages for the loss of the schooner.\nThat seemed to me hardly arguable as there was ample evidence for him to have allowed more for the value of the schooner than he did. I will advert to that later in considering some objections taken to some of the other items that the owners of the schooner were allowed.\nMeantime I will take up the claims for the loss of the cargo with which the learned judge dealt first. He sets forth the claims made in respect thereof, and deals therewith, as follows:\u2014\nIn the case in which R. P. & W. F. Starr, Limited, is plaintiff, being No. 227, the amount which the plaintiff claims is $10,640.78, with interest at five per cent from the first day of February, and the claim is made up as follows:\nAmount paid for coal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$ 9,215 48\nTen per cent which Mr. Starr gives as the amount\nto cover commission brokerages and overhead . . . . . .\n921 54\nAdvance made on freight . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n58 20\nPremium actually paid for U.S. funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n288 03\nMarine Insurance premium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n156 93\n$10,640 78\ntogether with interest from the time of the loss at five per cent.\nOf these items the only one to which objection is taken by counsel for the defendant is the second item, viz., $921.54, and it is submitted that so far as that covers profits and commissions it is not competent to the plaintiff to claim it and he is not entitled to it. In support of this proposition two cases were cited\u2014Ewbank v. Nutting[6], and British Columbia, etc., Co. v. Nettleship[7], both of which are common law cases, the facts being entirely different from those in the present case, and it is admitted by the defendant's counsel that they are not directly in point.\nHe then proceeded to quote the rule laid down in Halsbury, vol. 26, page 541, and refer generally to the evidence, and continued as follows:\nIt was not contended on behalf of the defendant that ten per cent of the amount paid for the coal was too large a sum to be allowed to cover the items mentioned and which were described by Mr. Starr as covering profits, incidental expenses, brokerage, cost of telegraphing and other items. I am of opinion that the charge was a moderate one, and as no objection was taken to it on the ground of the percentage charged, and as in calculating the market value the items mentioned should be taken into account, I will fix the damages at the full amount of $10,640.78 with interest from the first day of February last.\nI see no ground for complaining of said finding and would dismiss the appeal with costs to the said owners of the cargo.\nThen as to the claims of the owners of the Maid of Scotland, the learned trial judge presents that as follows:\u2014\nComing now to the other case, No. 226, Frank K. Warren v. SS. Perene, the plaintiff claims damages for the loss of the Maid of Scotland of $40,000, and the following additional amounts:\nValue of stores and ship chandlery . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$ 1,300 00\nCost of removing spars . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,000 00\nInsurance premiums unexpired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1,634 00\nFreight on coal for Starr payable in U.S. funds . . . . .\n750 00\nEarnings of voyage to Canary Islands payable in U.S. funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2,000 00\nPremium on freight on coal and lumber to the Canary Islands for U.S. funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n81 00\n146,765 00 Of these items those for the unexpired insurance premium, the freight on the Starr coal, the earnings of the voyage to the Canary Islands and the premium for the United States funds are not disputed. The plaintiff also claims interest from the first day of April last, the date on which under the charter party the vessel after discharging its cargo at St. John and loading there with lumber, would have delivered the same at the Canary Islands. That charter party was given in evidence. It was dated on the 17th January, 1924, and under it the vessel was chartered from St. John to Las Palmas, Grand Canary, to carry a cargo of pine or spruce lumber not exceeding 450,000 si. The amount to be paid under the charter party at $10 s.f. amounted to $4,500, and the evidence was that the disbursements and expenses in connection with this would amount to $2,500, leaving a balance of profit of $2,000. Under the authorities it is quite clear that the plaintiff is entitled to this amount.\nThe principal controversy was over the amount that should be allowed as damages for the total loss of the Maid of Scotland, and it will be necessary to consider the principles that should be applied in arriving at such damages.\nI wish to draw particular attention to the statement of the learned judge in the foregoing as to those items not disputed, and which, practically, I submit, must be taken as attesting an admission as made by the appellant at the trial.\nNow it is in regard to one of these very items that is for the proportion of the insurance premium allowed, that the counsel for appellant had most to say here, in dealing with the minor items.\nI pressed him for evidence relevant thereto for, as I pointed out to him, there might be some very satisfactory explanation, but he could not point to any; however he was frank enough to admit that he had not taken any objection thereto at the trial, or on argument below, and only thought of it afterwards.\nCounsel for respondent affirmed he had never heard of this objection until he read the factum of appellant.\nIt is to be observed that the case was tried without any pleadings. The preliminary act of each party is all that appears in the record. Counsel for respondent suggested that the learned trial judge no doubt had in mind the contest over the value of the vessel and that he may have borne that in mind in trying to do justice herein between the parties, for the estimate upon which he proceeded was so far below the claim made and the last word in that connection upon which I surmise he acted, was by Mr. Warren, who put it at $20,000 to $25,000, and he allows only the lower of these estimates when I imagine he might have easily gone a few thousand dollars higher, and that may be simply because he felt he was making allowances in other items which must be considered.\nOf course such speculative reasoning is not very satisfactory.\nBut upon thinking this matter over and reading further than the argument led me, I find that in the conclusion the learned judge reaches, he allows interest to the respondent only from first of April next, whilst in the other case he allows interest from the first of April last; and gives reason therefor as follows:\nwith interest at five per cent on this amount from April 1 next, the date at which the charter for carrying lumber to the Canary Islands would have expired.\nIf I am right in my conjecture that he was trying thereby and by the freight allowances he made, to arrive at a just dealing between the parties, then I feel, as respondents were entitled to interest from the date of the accident and wrong done by the appellant, which has not been allowed but postponed till following April, which, at five per cent, would balance things up, the claim now made by appellant is rather frail, indeed has no proper foundation in justice to be given effect to in this court.\nThere is a freight claim also allowed which may be viewed in same light.\nI am not at all in doubt that a judge or jury think interest should be allowed from the date of the accident; the law will give it unless there is some special provision relative to such a case as this.\nOften there is a very great difference in this application of the allowance of interest to the particular case in question in the varying jurisdiction we have to deal with.\nAll the other grounds of objection on the part of counsel for appellant are matters involving no principle of law.\nAnd I submit that the case of Tyrie v. Fletcher[8] does not touch what we have to deal with herein. As between insured and insurer it is clear law, unless by the contract differed from, but it is not what is involved herein.\nAnd the cases cited by appellant of Cattle v. The Stockton Waterworks Co.[9], and La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme de Remorquage \u00e0 H\u00e9lice v. Bennetts (1), do not touch this case and, though cited as doing so in principle, I respectfully beg to differ.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Baxter, Lewin, Carter & Hunton.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Fred.

Scott K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was written by ANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The question to be decided on this appeal is whether \u201cthe book value\u201d of the testator\u2019s businesses, at which the respondents are given an option to acquire them, is that which appeared at the date of the testator\u2019s death in his books or is that shewn on the last statement of its affairs entered in the firm\u2019s books by the managers thereof in the usual course of business prior to the exercise of such option. Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Latchford, who heard the matter on an originating summons, took the former view; the Appellate Divisional Court the latter.\nClause \u201cc\u201d of the will reads as follows:\n(c) I direct that my store property on Wyndham street, Guelph, shall be taken in and considered as one of the assets of my Guelph business and that my store property in Owen Sound shall be taken in and considered as one of the assets of my Owen Sound business. Both of the said properties shall be taken in at the book value thereof and the income therefrom shall be paid into and all taxes and outgoings in connection therewith shall be paid and borne by my said Guelph business and my said Owen Sound business respectively.\nClause \u201cf,\u201d on which the question now before us arises, is in the following terms:\n(f) I direct that after the expiration of five (5) years from my decease unless otherwise arranged with my executors, my sons, if they desire to purchase the said businesses shall commence to pay my estate for the same upon the basis of the book value thereof at the rate of not less than ten per cent (10%) thereof annually.\nThe Appellate Division also held that \u201cthe book value of the store properties\u201d referred to in clause \u201cc\u201d of the will means the book value as it appears in the last annual or other statement entered in the firm\u2019s books by the managers thereof in the usual course of business, whereas, Latchford J. had held that \u201cthe book value\u201d as shown by the books of the testator at his death is what is meant in that clause.\nThe present appeal is from the variation by the Appellate Divisional Court of the judgment of Mr. Justice Latchford on both these points.\nThe testator owned two businesses\u2014one in Guelph, the other in Owen Sound. By his will he directed that these businesses should be carried on by his trustees (his widow, eldest daughter and two sons) under the management of the two sons who had been actively engaged with him in the businesses and had a sum of $30,000 \u201cstanding to their credit\u201d in them. The trustees were given power to fix a \u201ccash salary\u201d for the managers; they were required to set aside annually a sum equal to 7 per cent on the testator\u2019s capital invested in the businesses which, with 7 per cent per annum on his residuary estate, would provide an \u201cincome fund\u201d from which his widow should receive an annuity of $6,000 and the residue would be distributable amongst his four children equally. Any surplus profits of the businesses, after paying the managers\u2019 salaries, setting aside such 7 per cent and providing whatever further sums the trustees should deem proper \u201cfor depreciation, taxes, contingencies and reserve,\u201d were to belong to the two sons as additional salary, but were to remain with the $30,000 above mentioned in the businesses at their credit, but without bearing interest, until such time as they should purchase the same.\nThe testator also directed that the proceeds of the sale of certain lands owned by him in Saskatchewan should be paid into and form part of the assets of his businesses and that the properties in which his Guelph and Owen Sound businesses were carried on should also be assets of those businesses respectively and should \u201cbe taken in at the book value thereof.\u201d He empowered his trustees to invest further estate moneys in the Guelph and Owen Sound businesses and, if they thought fit, to establish other similar businesses. The businesses were to be carried on as long as the trustees should think it practicable or desirable; but, in the event of Mrs. Ryan\u2019s death before the sons had acquired them, a joint stock company was to be incorporated to take over the businesses on a basis which would ensure to his two daughters 7 per cent on their interest or share of the estate invested in them.\nThe adjudication of Latchford J. that\nthe sons cannot make an election to buy any of the businesses of the testator till after the expiration of five years from the death of the testator,\naffirmed by the Appellate Divisional Court, has been accepted by the parties and is, therefore, binding, as is also the determination of the Appellate Division, reversing the decision of Latchford J., that the 7 per cent payable into the \u201cincome fund\u201d out of the profits of the businesses is to be computed upon\nthe net capital as it appears in the last annual or other statement entered in the firm\u2019s books by the managers thereof, in the usual course of busi- ness from year to year, and if supplemented by the trustees from the proceeds of the Testator\u2019s Saskatchewan lands referred to in the will, or by other advances, as it may appear from year to year in the books of the two establishments.\nIt is abundantly clear that the store properties were to be regarded as part of the assets of the businesses from the death of the testator. Clause \u201cc\u201d so directs. It was as of that date that they were to \u201cbe taken in.\u201d There would, therefore, with the utmost respect, seem to be no room for doubt that \u201cthe book value\u201d of the store properties dealt with in clause \u201cc,\u201d as was held by Latchford J., is \u201cthe book value\u201d thereof as shewn in the books at the time of the testator\u2019s death.\nThe interpretation of clause \u201cf\u201d is perhaps not so free from difficulty. A careful study of all the provisions of the will does not disclose any ground which can be said to be entirely conclusive for supporting either of the two constructions of it which are preferred by the respective parties. Taking all the considerations which have been suggested into account, however, the weight of them seems to us to favour the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Latchford.\nWhat is given to the sons is an option to purchase. They are under no obligation to acquire the businesses. In our opinion the apparent intention of the testator was that if they wished to exercise that option they should pay to his estate the capital he had invested in the businesses represented by their value, including that of the real estate, as they stood on his books at his death; that, in addition, they should pay to the estate any capital subsequently invested in the businesses by his trustees; whether proceeds of sales of Saskatchewan lands or other advances of estate moneys; and that as to such additional investments the sums payable would be the amounts which would appear in the firm\u2019s books as the value of the assets in which they were invested when put into the businesses. The same observations would apply to any estate moneys invested by the trustees in establishing other similar businesses.\nAs to the existing businesses, the testator probably desired to fix a price at which his sons might acquire them. If their value should materially increase (as is said to be the case with the real estate) the sons might reap an ad- vantage from their industry, foresight and good management; should the values substantially decline under their management, the sons were not obliged to purchase on the terms of the option, but could bargain with their fellow-trustees, with whom the will expressly provides they may \u201cotherwise arrange\u201d for the acquisition of the businesses; and, failing an agreement, by taking proper steps they could secure the right to bid on the businesses if offered for sale by the trustees. But, if they should exercise the option given by the will, it must be at a price which would ensure the general estate payment of the entire capital invested by the testator in the businesses as he left them, and also any other estate capital subsequently put into them by the trustees. It is quite unlikely that the testator meant to place his sons in a position where their interests would conflict with their duty, as might be the case if the purchase price under the option were to be the book values placed by them as managers upon the businesses at whatever date they might elect to purchase.\nMoreover, as above indicated, the words \u201cthe book value thereof\u201d in clause \u201cc\u201d clearly means, in our opinion, the values at which the store properties were entered in the testator\u2019s books at the time of his death. While it cannot he said to be a canon of construction that identical words recurring in a will must be taken to have been used to express the same meaning (compare Ridgeway v. Munkittrick[1], per Sugden L.C., with In re Brooke, Edyvean v. Archer[2], and In re Cozens, Miles v. Wilson[3]), it is at least consistent with good sense that prima facie when a testator repeats an expression or formula of words, which he had already used to convey a particular idea, he may be presumed to intend again to express the same idea. Of course the context, the nature of the subject-matter or the whole tenor of the instrument may sufficiently indicate an intention to use such formula or expression in some different sense and the presumption will then be rebutted. But here there is no inconsistent context, the subject-matter is neutral in suggestion and any indication afforded by the will as a whole rather points to the words, \u201cthe book value,\u201d being intended to prescribe the same criterion of value in clause \u201cf\u201d as in clause \u201cc.\u201d There appears, therefore, to be no ground for departing from the view, which has been termed \u201cgood sense\u201d and \u201ca principle of common sense,\u201d that where a word or phrase is used with a definite meaning in one clause of a deed or will it will be presumed to mean the same thing if used in another part of such deed or will where its meaning is not so clear. (In re Birks, Kenyon v. Birks[4]; Edwards v. Edwards[5]).\nFinally, it is common ground that from the purchase price payable on exercising their option the sons will be entitled to deduct the entire sum of $30,000, which stood to their credit in the businesses at the time of their father\u2019s death, on whatever basis that purchase price should be arrived at. It would seem strange indeed, if the value of the businesses according to the last statement entered by them as managers in the firm\u2019s books had greatly diminished, that the sons paying that reduced value should, nevertheless, be entitled to deduct from it the entire sum of $30,000 and also any further sums held in the businesses as surplus profits appropriated to them as additional salary under a provision above referred to. It is difficult to accept that as the testator\u2019s intention. It would be equally difficult to believe that, if the value of the businesses had greatly augmented through the prudence, foresight and industry of the sons, their father meant to exact from them, as a condition of exercising their option, a purchase price equal to such enhanced value. That such was not his intention is shewn by the very provision assigning to them as additional salary the net profits of the businesses remaining after making the deductions for their cash salaries as managers, the 7 per cent contribution to the \u201cincome fund\u201d and the other charges for which the trustees are directed to provide.\nNor does the provision of clause \u201cg\u201d directing the payment into \u201cthe income fund\u201d of 7 per cent annually\nupon the book value of my capital invested in the said businesses from time to time\npresent any difficulty. The words \u201cfrom time to time\u201d were necessary because of the provision for additions to the invested capital of the proceeds of the sales of Saskatchewan lands and the advances from the testator\u2019s general estate which the trustees were empowered to make. Their presence rather indicates that intending the words \u201cthe book value of any capital invested in the said businesses\u201d in clause \u201cg\u201d to mean the amounts so invested as shown in the firm\u2019s books at some date other than that of his death, the testator thought it necessary to add a phrase apt to convey that idea.\nReading the will as a whole the dominant idea of the testator seems to have been, after providing for his widow, that there should be equality in the distribution amongst his four children of the amount of the value of his estate as he would leave it. Subject to that, he desired that the businesses, which he had established, and out of which he had made his fortune, and in the worth and earning capacity of which he probably had the fullest confidence, should not disappear or pass into the control of strangers, but should continue in the hands of his two sons who were already actively engaged therein and for whom, he no doubt thought, they would provide honourable and prosperous careers. There are two outstanding features of the scheme which the testator sought to formulate in regard to the taking over of the businesses by his two sons designed to secure to them every reasonable advantage therefrom and at the same time adequately to protect the interests of his daughters in that part of his estate which consisted of capital invested and to remain for some time invested in those businesses. While, on the one hand, the sons should have the full benefit of any net profits beyond the outlay and reserve necessary for the carrying on of the businesses on a safe basis, and a reasonable return to his estate for the use of his capital invested in them, on the other, in the event of his sons exercising the option to buy the businesses the capital so invested as he left it, and any additional capital the trustees might put in, would all be repaid to, and would form part of, his general estate in which his two daughters were to share equally with his two sons. Only by construing the words \u201cupon the basis of the book value thereof\u201d in clause \u201cf\u201d as meaning on the basis of the values of the businesses as they appeared in the testator\u2019s books at the time of his death can effect be given to both of these apparent intentions of the late George Byron Ryan.\nFor the foregoing reasons this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Latchford restored in the two particulars which are the subject of the appeal. This seems to be a proper case for a direction that the costs of both appellants and respondents should be paid out of the testator\u2019s estate as between solicitor and client.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an application to the Supreme Court of Ontario by the executors and trustees of the last will and testament of the late George Byron Ryan, for the advice and opinion of the said court in regard to the interpretation and construction of said will.\nSome thirteen questions were asked. Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Latchford heard the application and gave judgment answering said questions.\nTwo of the executors (the sons of deceased and beneficiaries under said will) appealed therefrom to the Appellate Division of said Supreme Court, and the present appellants (the two daughters of deceased and beneficiaries under said will) cross-appealed, and judgment was given maintaining the said judgment except as to one point involved, and varied in that regard the said judgment.\nHence this appeal by said daughters.\nHaving carefully considered the several opinions given by the respective judges in the courts below, and the arguments addressed to us, I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Latchford restored, and that the costs of all parties here should be allowed and paid out of the estate.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hellmuth, Cattanach & Meredith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aylesworth, Wright, Thompson & Lawr.\n[1] [1841] 1 Dr. & War. 84, 93.\n[2] [1903] A.C. 379, 384.\n[3] [1903] 1 Ch. 138, 143.\n[4] [1900] 1 Ch. 417, 418.\n[5] 12 Beav. 97, 100.\n",

The appeal to this court was dismissed with costs. The appellant then applied for a stay of proceedings in the action pending a projected appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nHeld that the application as made could not be granted as, security for the debt and costs in the courts below not having been given, the control of the issue of execution for them rests wholly with the provincial courts; a judge of this court can only direct that further proceedings be stayed in this court until the appellant should have an opportunity of presenting a petition for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nMOTION by the appellant for stay of proceedings pending a projected appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nThe facts are fully stated in the judgment of the Chief Justice on the application.\nA.

The plaintiffs might, therefore, at any time have issued execution out of the provincial court for the judgment debt and costs. The certificate of the judgment of this court has not yet issued. After delivery of judgment here the defendant moved in the provincial court for a stay of execution pending a projected appeal to the Privy Council. That motion was rejected. Counsel for the plaintiffs opposed the present application on the ground that, security for the debt and costs below not having been given, the control of the issue of execution for them rests wholly with the provincial courts. Section 76 (d) of the Supreme Court Act enacts that\nif the judgment appealed from directs the payment of money, either as a debt or for damages or costs, execution thereof shall not be stayed, until the appellant has given security to the satisfaction of the court appealed from, or a judge thereof, * * *\nIt would seem, therefore, that it was not the policy of Parliament that the Supreme Court of Canada, or a judge thereof, should control, or interfere with, the issue of execution on a judgment for the recovery of money when security for the payment thereof has not been given as indicated in s. 76 (d). One method, and one only, is sanctioned for obtaining a stay of execution in such a case at any stage of the proceedings in this court, and that is the giving of security to the satisfaction of the court appealed from, or a judge thereof. That the control of the issue of execution in such a case is fully vested in the court appealed from is further indicated by the provisions of s. 77. Other cases not within the proviso to s. 76 may fall within rule 136.\nBut I have jurisdiction to direct, as requested by the appellant, that further proceedings be stayed in this court until it shall have had an opportunity of presenting a petition for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Such an order may issue upon the appellant undertaking to present its petition for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee at its first sittings after the first of January next.\nThe costs of the present application will be costs in the projected appeal, if leave be given, and, if leave be refused, must be paid by the appellant to the respondents.\nMotion dismissed.\n",

(1888) provided that \"the council may, by a resolution, exempt from the payment of municipal taxes * * * any person who carries on any industry, or trade, or enterprise * * *.\" In 1906, the town of Notre Dame des Neiges (annexed in 1910 to the city respondent) passed a resolution exempting one E. G. and his successors or \"ayants cause\" from payment of taxes for a period of fifteen years upon farms of a total area of 192 acres, inasmuch as E. G. undertook to subdivide the property into building lots and to build during the first year a certain number of houses. In 1908, E. G. sold his property to the North-mount Land Company to whom right to exemption was confirmed; and the latter sold in 1910 to the appellant part of the property, undiveded. The taxes for 1911, $1,000, were paid to the respondent; but the taxes for 1912 and 1913, $3,675, were unpaid. Proceedings were taken by the respondent for the sale of the property owned by the appellant. The latter pleaded that, under the terms of the resolution, it was entitled to the benefit of the exemption granted to its predecessor in title, as its successor or \"ayant cause.\" At the time of the action the property bought by the appellant was still vacant.\nHeld that the appellant, not being presumed owing to its character and and aims to have purchased the tract of land for the purposes of engaging in speculative building, was not an ayant-cause of its vendor and therefore was not entitled to claim the exemption from taxes granted to the latter.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Court of King's Bench sitting as the Court of Review and affirming the judgment of the trial judge, who had dismissed the opposition filed by the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nBeaulieu K.C. and St. Jacques K.C. for the appellant.\nLaurendeau K.C. and St. Pierre K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The statutory authority, by virtue of which the appellants claim the right to a commutation of taxes, which is asserted in this litigation, is to be found in section 4559 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, and is in these words:\n4559, The council may, by a resolution, exempt from the payment of municipal taxes, for a period not exceeding 20 years, any person who carries on any industry, or trade, or enterprise whatsoever, as well as the land used for such industry, trade or enterprise; cr may agree with such person for a fixed sum of money payable annually for any period not exceeding 20 years, in commutation of all municipal taxes.\nSuch exemption or agreement does not extend to work upon watercourses, boundary ditches, fences, clearances or front roads connected with taxable property so exempted or commuted.\nPurporting to exercise the authority created by this enactment, the town of Notre-Dame des Neiges passed the following resolution on the 9th February, 1906:\nAttendu que monsieur Edouard Gohier, agent d'immeubles, a acquis et entend acqu\u00e9rir dans la ville de Notre-Dame des Neiges, les terrains suivants, savoir:\nLa ferme Swail, portant le num\u00e9ro vingt-cinq (25) formant environ cent vingt-deux arpents, la ferme Lacomb, portant le num\u00e9ro vingt-sept (27), et formant environ vingt-huit arpents, le terrain Leslie, portant les num\u00e9ros quarante (40) quarante A, quarante B, (40A-40B) formant quarante-deux arpents environ, et qu'il entend exploiter ces terrains en lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir et ouvrir des rues, y b\u00e2tir des maisons et faire la concession de ces terrains.\nAttendu que cette exploitation serait de nature \u00e0 augmenter consid\u00e9rablement la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re imposable de la ville de Notre-Dame des Neiges et donnerait, par cons\u00e9quent, des revenus consid\u00e9rables \u00e0 la dite municipalit\u00e9;\nAttendu que ces terrains ne paient actuellement pour toutes taxes municipales que les sommes respectives de $274.85;\nIl est en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9solu: sur proposition de monsieur l'\u00e9chevin J.

The property in question appeared on the assessment roll in the name of the appellants, with a valuation of $100,000 in the year 1911, and of $175,000 in each of the years 1912 and 1913. The assessment ($1,000) for the year 1911 was paid by the appellants; those for the years 1912 and 1913 (amounting in the aggregate to $3,675) were not paid, and proceedings were accordingly taken for the sale of the property. The contention on behalf of the appellants is that, under the terms of the resolutions, they are entitled to the benefit of the commutation granted to their predecessor in title, Edouard Gohier, as his successor or ayant-cause.\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether the arrangement with Gohier was a commutation authorized by the enactment quoted above; although it may be observed that the decision of the Court of Review affirming the judgment of Lafontaine J. in Corporation de Cartierville v. Compagnie des Boulevards[1], would, if followed, exclude the appellants' claim. The interpretation of the agreement embodied in the first resolution upon which the appellants rest their claim is this; the conditions, they say, laid down by the resolution, having been performed, as is formally declared by the resolution of 1908, the right to the commutation of taxes agreed to became vested in the Northmount Land Company, the successors of Gohier, and this right, it is said, passed to the appellants as purchasers from the company. In reply to the argument based upon the clause of the resolution providing that the reduction of taxes is only to affect lands remaining in the hands of Gohier, his successors or ayants-cause, and consequently is not applicable to any portion of the lands sold or granted by Gohier or the Northmount Land Company, it is asserted that the effect of this clause is to exclude from the benefit of the agreement only such parts of the land as are granted as building lots, and that the clause does not contemplate such a transaction as that with the appellants, under which a considerable area was sold en bloc.\nThis argument seems to proceed upon an inadmissible view, both of the resolution and of the statute. The statute sanctions agreements for exemption and for commutation of taxes with some person who \"carries on\" an \"industry, trade or enterprise.\" Primarily, the privilege relates to taxation in respect of the \"industry, trade or enterprise,\" and it is quite indisputable that the statute contemplates the continuation of the privilege only so long as the \"industry, trade or enterprise,\" in respect of which it is granted, is carried on. The exemption or commutation may also extend to lands used for the \"industry, trade or enterprise,\" but it is equally clear that the duration of this exemption is limited in the same way. The statute does not refer to successors, although it may be assumed, without expressing an opinion upon the point, that so long as the identity of the business which is the primary subject of the exemption or commutation is preserved, the benefit of the agreement with the municipality may pass to a successor or a transferee; but there is nothing in the language of the statute giving colour to the contention that lands affected by the privilege by reason of being used for the purposes of the business continue to enjoy it after they have been severed from the assets of the business and have passed into other hands than those of its owners.\nThe resolution, of course, must be read in light of the terms of the statutory authority upon which the municipality purported to act. Assuming that Gohier and the North-mount Land Company were carrying on an \"industry, trade or enterprise\" in the sense of the statute, and assuming, further, that this \"industry, trade or enterprise\" has not come to a termination, it is impossible to hold, on the evidence in the record, that the appellants have acquired and are prosecuting it. The Northmount Land Company apparently did not denude itself of the whole of the lands unsold when, in 1910, it made the transfer of the tract in question to the appellants. It was not disputed that the fifty acres acquired are still vacant, and it cannot be presumed that the appellants, having regard to their character and aims, purchased this tract of land for the purposes of engaging in speculative building, assuming them to have the juristic capacity to do so.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Idington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of King's Bench of Quebec on the appeal side, allowing an appeal from the Court of Review and confirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the opposition made by appellant to the seizure of certain of its properties for nonpayment of municipal taxes, was dismissed.\nThere has been written by Mr. Justice Tellier a dissenting judgment in the said Court of Review; and others by Mr. Justice Dorion and Mr. Justice Hall in said Court of King's Bench, each dealing at length with the questions raised, so fully and effectively, that, as I agree in the main therewith, I see no useful purpose to be served by repeating herein the reasons thereby assigned in support of the claims of respondent.\nI doubt much the original validity of the commutation relied upon by appellant; but apart altogether from that, agreeing as I do with the said reasons demonstrating that the appellant is not entitled to relief thereby, I am content with expressing said doubt.\nThe factum of respondent calls our attention to the decision of this court in the case of Ville Saint-Michel v. Shannon Realties, Limited[2], upheld later on appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nHad that decision been arrived at a couple of years earlier by said courts, I imagine it would have saved much judicial labour in the course of what this cause has come through, for appellant paid one year's taxes and failed apparently to take any steps, as it should have done if any ground therefor, in way of challenging the assessments it now complains of.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Jacques, Filion & Houle.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Jarry, Damphousse, Butler & St.-Pierre.\n[1] [1916] Q.R. 51 S.C. 170.\n[2] [1922] 64 Can.

The respondent telephoned to the appellant company requesting it to send a carter for the merchandises for shipment to the railway company; and later on, a pretended carter arrived stating he had come for the \"C.P.R.,\" asked for and received delivery of the parcels. This carter, a former employee of the appellant, had borrowed the cap and apron of one Jutras, then a carter employed by the appellant, and prevailed on Jutras to allow him to use the appellant's wagon, stating that he required it to cart some trunks. The goods thus obtained were stolen by the pretended carter and his confederates also former employees of the appellant.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the appellant cannot be held responsible for the loss of the respondent's goods. Under the circumstances of this case the appellant cannot be held liable as a common carrier under articles 1674 and 1.675 C.C.; it cannot be held liable as having held out the guilty carter as having authority to call for goods in its name, under article 1730 C.C.; and there is no delictual liability on the part of the appellant under article 1054 C.C.\nAPPEAL per saltum from the judgment of the Superior Court, province of Quebec, Surveyer J., maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nChipman K.C. and Montgomery K.C. for the appellant.\nDe Witt K.C. and Harold for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by Mignault J.\u2014This is an appeal per solium by consent of the parties from a judgment of the Superior Court in Montreal, Surveyer J.\nA criminal conspiracy between former employees of the appellant company, hereinafter called the conspirators, to rob wholesale merchants in Montreal by pretending to be carters employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, has given rise to this litigation, and the respondents claim from the appellant, a cartage company employed by the railway company, $3,629.27, the value of certain parcels of merchandise which they allege they confided, on November 5 and November 27, 1917, to a carter in charge of a wagon marked \"C.P.R.\" in large letters and belonging to the appellant. They say that this carter wore the cap provided by appellant as well as the apron and other insignia usually worn by the employees of the appellant, and asked for and received delivery of these parcels. They had telephoned to the appellant requesting it to send a carter for this merchandise for shipment by the railway, and in due time the pretended carter arrived stating he had come for the \"C.P.R.\" The goods thus obtained were stolen by this carter and his confederates and were never recovered. The alleged responsibility of the appellant is based on articles 1053 and 1054 of the civil code, or in the alternative on articles 1674 and 1675, or on article 1730 of the same code.\nSimilar actions claiming damages arising out of the same conspiracy were brought before the Quebec courts and were finally disposed of by the Court of King's Bench, appeal side. In this case however the amount involved allowed of an appeal to this court. The trial having taken place in 1920 before Surveyer J., the learned judge suspended judgment until May, 1924, apparently to await the decision in the other cases. The learned judge did not make any specific findings of fact on the somewhat contradictory evidence, being content to hold generally that the plaintiffs had proved the essential allegations of their declaration and that the plea had not been established. The judgment further stated that the question at issue had come up several times before the Court of King's Bench, that the majority of the judges of that court had maintained actions based on similar, although possibly not identical, sets of facts, and that it was advisable to secure the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, inasmuch as the present case was the first which, in view of the amount claimed, was susceptible of appeal to this court.\nIt is necessary therefore to review the evidence adduced before the trial court, which will be done as briefly as possible.\nIn the fall of 1917, one Alfred Jutras was a carter employed by the appellant to deliver parcels from the railway to consignees in the outlying districts of Montreal. It was not a part of his ordinary duties to fetch parcels for shipment by the railway, but occasionally he might be requested by telephone to do so when he telephoned to the company for instructions. He furnished his own cap and apron and used a horse and wagon belonging to the appellant. The four conspirators were Percy, a brother-in-law of Jutras, Wistaff, Tremblay and Fournier, former employees of the appellant, all of whom were called at the trial. The modus operandi was to borrow Jutras' wagon as well as his cap and apron, and then one of the conspirators called at the place of business of a wholesale merchant asking whether he had any parcels for the \"C.P.R.\" This scheme of robbery was successful for some time, but finally the conspirators as well as Jutras were arrested and found guilty by the criminal courts. Jutras, who appears to have been the tool of the others\u2014a disputed point being whether he was aware of their criminal designs\u2014was condemned to two months imprisonment, while the others received penitentiary terms. The part played by Jutras, however, must be determined on the evidence in this case, and a point which was considered of some importance in the other cases, but its relevancy must be carefully considered, is whether he was particeps criminis.\nAccording to the testimony of Jutras, and also of Percy, Tremblay and Fournier, Jutras was merely asked to lend his wagon \"pour un voyage,\" being told that the others wished to earn some money by carrying trunks. Jutras says that he received small sums of money for the use of his wagon, while Tremblay states that he was also given some shoes stolen from Slater's shoe store, and that he aided in opening the box containing the shoes. The testimony of Wistaff would indicate that Jutras knew that his wagon was borrowed to steal goods from the respondents, but the evidence of the other conspirators does not bear this out. Unfortunately we have not a finding of the learned trial judge on the question whether Jutras was or was not aware of the criminal designs of these men, if this circumstance be really material as to the liability of the appellant. The preponderance of testimony, if these conspirators were all equally credible witnesses, does not appear to attach guilty knowledge to Jutras, although it would probably not be unreasonable to infer such knowledge from all the circumstances of the case. In the absence of any specific finding of fact it will be well to determine what responsibility the appellant incurred, if any, on either assumption.\nWe may now examine the different cases in which the Quebec courts have dealt with the question of the liability of the railway company or the cartage company by reason of this criminal conspiracy. Their decisions of course were based upon the facts established in evidence in each case, which, as Surveyer J. observes, may not have been identical with those with which we are here concerned.\nThe first case in order is that of The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Hodgson Sumner Company, Limited[1], by Martin, Greenshields, Dorion, Allard and Tellier JJ., where the judgment of the Superior Court, Lafontaine J., was affirmed, Mr. Justice Allard dissenting.\nIn that case, the parties had made a joint admission of the pertinent facts which in its entirety is not cited in the report. Martin J., said at p. 172:\nI do not think the case comes within the principles expressed in article 1730 CO. which is a plain principle of justice common to all systems of law. Appellant's liability if existing in this case must, I think, rest on delictual, not contractual grounds. Jutras betrayed the trust reposed in him. The same thing was, however, done on several occasions in the same manner by Jutras and he was convicted and sentenced for having been implicated in the whole series of frauds extending from September to December, 1917, as well as Tremblay, Fournier, Percy and others. Jutras did not go to the plaintiff company's premises but remained with whichever of the two, either Tremblay or Percy, who did not go to plaintiff's premises. Does not that mean that Jutras was a guilty participant, particeps criminis, in the theft? Greenshields J., was also of opinion that Jutras was particeps criminis with Tremblay and Percy. On that assumption he said he had no doubt whatever that in law the appellant would be responsible to the respondent for the loss. He was not prepared to accept the finding of the trial judge placing the responsibility of the appellant on article 1730 CO., but held the railway company liable on the sole ground of Jutras' guilty participation in the theft. Had he not arrived at this conclusion of fact, he would have been disposed to relieve the appellant from liability.\nDorion J. was of opinion that neither article 1053 C.C. nor article 1054 C.C. could be applied. He excluded the latter provision saying at p. 178:\nLa faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du choix de Jutras, comme employ\u00e9 de la Dominion Transport Co., n'est pour rien dans l'occasion, car Jutras n'a pas failli dans l'exercice de ses fonctions: la faute qu'il a commise en pr\u00eatant sa voiture en est ind\u00e9pendante. Ainsi, mon employ\u00e9, \u00e0 qui j'ai confi\u00e9 une hache pour travailler \u00e0 mon service et qui s'en servirait pour commettre un meurtre, n'engagerait pas ma responsabilit\u00e9; non plus, \u00e0 plus forte raison, si le meurtre \u00e9tait commis par quelqu'un \u00e0 qui il aurait pr\u00eat\u00e9 ma hache. Je ne serais pas plus responsable du pr\u00eat ou du louage de l'instrument que de la vente.\nToute la question est de savoir si Jutras agissait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions en d\u00e9tournant de son usage l'instrument de travail qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9. Je laisse toujours de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la circonstance de l'enseigne que portait la voiture, et je conclus que, si la voiture n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 marquee du nom de l'employeur, celui-ci n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable de la fraude commise.\nThe learned judge then considered the latter circumstance and arrived at the conclusion that the appellant was liable under the rule expressed in article 1730 C.C. as having given reasonable cause for the belief that the person who called for the goods was the mandatary of the appellant. Mr. Justice Tellier concurred in the reasons of Mr. Justice Dorion.\nMr, Justice Allard dissented, being of opinion, as to the alleged delictual liability, that Jutras, even if he were the employee of the appellant, the railway company, which he was not, being merely the servant of the cartage company, was not in the performance of the work for which he was employed when he loaned his wagon. He also considered that the delictual act was not the direct and immediate consequence of the loan of the wagon. He rejected the contention of the respondent that the appellant was bound as carrier under articles 1674 and 1675 C.C., because the person who had received the goods had no mandate to receive them. As to the argument based on article 1730 C.C., he was of opinion that the appellant had not given reasonable cause for the belief that the person who obtained delivery of the parcels had authority to receive them. The circumstance that Jutras was the employee of the cartage company and not of the appellant and that the wagon was the property of the former was also relied on by the learned judge.\nThe conclusiveness of this decision, it may be remarked, is somewhat impaired by the fact that no single ground of liability was adopted by a majority of the learned judges.\nThe next cases in order are those of Abraham et al. v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company and The Redmond Company v. The Dominion Transport Company, Limited,[2], the court being composed of Greenshields, Allard and L\u00e9tourneau JJ, In the first case the trial judge (Lane J.) had dismissed the action; in the second one, Mr. Justice Duclos had maintained it. The Court of King's Bench confirmed the first judgment and reversed the second, Mr. Justice Greenshields dissenting. Here the wagon of the cartage company was not loaned by Jutras, but by another of its carters, one Martineau. It was held that Martineau had no knowledge of the purpose for which his wagon was loaned. These two cases are of less importance here, for we are concerned with the act of Jutras and not of Martineau. The report contains only the reasons of judgment of Lane J. in the Superior Court, but the appellant in the present case prints as an appendix to his factum the very full judgment of L\u00e9tourneau J.\nThen we are referred to the case of The Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. The Canadian Converters Company, Limited[3]. Here the court (Allard, Rivard and Hall JJ., Mr. Justice Allard dissenting) dealt with the act of Jutras in loaning his wagon to the conspirators and sustained the judgment of the trial judge, Duclos J. Mr. Justice Hall was of opinion that Jutras was particeps criminis. He held that Jutras was acting in the execution of his duties, that if for some legitimate reason he had sent Tremblay or Percy to call for the goods, the receipt of the goods by the person to whom he loaned his wagon would have been a receipt by himself according to the maxim qui per alium facit, per seipsum facere videtur. The learned judge was also disposed to concur in the reasons of Mr. Justice Dorion in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Hodgson Sumner Co.[4], not considering that they were inconsistent with what he had said. Mr. Justice Rivard accepted the reasons of Dorion & Tellier JJ., in the case just mentioned, while Mr. Justice Allard dissented on the same grounds as in the case above noted.\nFinally, also in connection with Jutras' act, we have the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, in the case of Gardner et al. v. Dominion Transport Co.[5], Allard, Rivard and Hall JJ., reversing, Mr. Justice Allard dissenting, the judgment of the trial judge, Maclennan J. The following consid\u00e9rant of the judgment shews that the liability of the cartage company was placed squarely on article 1054 CC.:\nConsidering that the said Jutras, while in the performance of the work for which he was employed, participated in the fraudulent and criminal acts of the said Tremblay and his associates.\nIn all the cases where the act of Jutras in loaning his wagon was an element of the alleged liability of the defendant, Martin, Greenshields, Hall and Rivard JJ., the latter in the case of Gardner v. Dominion Transport Company5, placed the liability of the defendant upon article 1054 C.C. Dorion, Tellier, and Rivard JJ., the latter in the case of The Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. The Canadian Converters Co.[6], rejected the contention of delictual liability, but applied to the case under consideration the rule of article 1730 C.C. Mr. Justice Allard dissented in all the cases where the defendant was declared liable. In the two cases of Abraham and of The Redmond Company, the former against the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. and the latter against the Dominion Transport Co.[7], Allard and L\u00e9tourneau JJ., rejected the plaintiff's action, and Mr. Justice Greenshields dissented. No judge of the Court of King's Bench relied on articles 1674 and 1675 C.C.\nReverting to the present appeal, before discussing the alleged delictual liability of the appellant, it will be well to examine whether on the evidence the appellant can be held responsible for the loss of the respondent's goods as a common carrier under articles 1674 and 1675 C.C., or as having held out the guilty carter as having authority to \u20acall for goods in its name, art. 1730 C.C.\nThe contention based on articles 1674 and 1675 C.C. can be easily disposed of. The goods were never delivered to or received by the appellant or any of its servants. The man who obtained them was not in its employ nor did he have authority to sign bills of lading on behalf of the railway company. As we have seen, none of the judges in the previous cases have attached liability to the appellant on this ground.\nAnd as to article 1730 C.C., the facts in evidence do not appear to support any claim against the appellant for having held out the man who called for the goods as having authority to receive them on its behalf. This article supposes that there was no mandate whatever, but that the plaintiff has been misled by appearances wilfully or carelessly allowed to exist by the defendant. Here, although Jutras' wagon bore the letters \"C.P.R.,\" and although the man who called for the goods wore Jutras' cap and apron, it does not appear that the respondents were induced by this circumstance to part with their goods. Whether, if they had been so misled, liability of the appellants would have ensued it is unnecessary to determine. Moreover, the testimony of their employees shews that any carter merely opening their door and calling out: \"Any goods for the C.P.R.,\" was allowed to take away parcels for shipment. Johnson, the respondents' shipper, says:\u2014\nI have the knowledge that I packed, marked and made out the bill of lading and had the C.P.R. call, sometimes I called myself, and sometimes I had somebody else to call, but I gave orders to call, and after that the C.P.R. called, a man came to the door, called out \"C.P.R.,\" and I had the bills signed and my assistant put the case on the elevator, the elevator man took them out and loaded them on the truck with the carter.\nElsewhere Johnson says that the respondents used to have a steady rig, but that was cut out in November, 1917, and afterwards\nwe had to call up the C.P.R., then a man would come to the door and call out \"C.P.R. cartage,\" then if we had the goods there he came in and signed the bills, and we handed out the goods.\nThe conspirators, former carters of the appellant, were no doubt aware of the rather incautious way in which goods were handed out for shipment, and they made their calls, not in answer to telephone messages, but on the chance that there would be parcels for shipment which would be handed over to them on their merely asking for parcels for the \"C.P.R.\"\nIt is important to add that the respondents filed a statement of telephone calls received by the appellant from the respondents, and calls on November 5th and November 27th are entered therein. The following day in each case a regular teamster of the appellant called at the respondents' store in answer to these messages. Whether he obtained goods or not does not appear.\nLeheron, the respondents' elevator man, states that the invariable custom is not to give out freight unless the rigs bear the letters \"C.P.R.\" or \"G.T.R.\" Wistaff, one of the conspirators, says that Jutras' wagon bore the letters \"C.P.R.\" Whether the respondents' employees noticed these letters on the wagon, they do not say, but Wistaff's statement is that he signed the bill of lading outside, so they might have seen them. Wistaff signed the name \"Lalonde\" and Percy the name \"Lajeunesse,\" which were fictitious names, and not those of any of the appellant's carters.\nAll things considered and the onus being on the respondents, it does not appear that the latter have made out a sufficient case to call for the application of article 1730 C.C. Certainly no acts or conduct of the appellant calculated to induce the belief that the man who asked for the goods was its employee have been shewn. The cap and apron were furnished by the carter and not by the company, and so were the carter's property, and they were used by the robbers, the latter say, in order that the appellant's foremen, who drove around town all day to watch the teamsters, might not think that the company's wagon was being driven by a stranger. No holding out by the appellant is established.\nThere remains only the question of delictual liability, and if the appellant is responsible for the loss of the goods it can only be under article 1054 C.C. No case has been made out under article 1053 C.C.\nThe scope of article 1054 C.C. has been fully discussed in recent decisions of this court and of the Judicial Committee. The rule it lays down is perfectly plain and the question which arises in concrete cases is whether the facts in evidence call for its application, that is to say whether the servant was in the performance of work for which he was employed when he caused the damage.\nThe ordinary duties of Jutras were to deliver parcels from the railway, occasionally he might be sent to fetch them from the shippers. For that purpose, the appellant furnished him with a horse and wagon. Had he stolen a parcel entrusted to him for shipment, had he run down a pedestrian while delivering parcels, there is no doubt his employers would have been responsible, for the damage would have been caused in the performance of the work for which he was employed. But he had no authority to loan his wagon either for or without a consideration. He could use it only on his master's business, and if he loaned it for any other purpose, lawful or unlawful, he was acting on his own account and not on the account of his master. Had he used the wagon to commit a burglary or for a joy ride, his employer would have been no more answerable for the damage caused than was the owner of the automobile in Curley v. Latreille[8].\nBut it is said that Jutras was particeps criminis in the robbery committed by the conspirators. The only act of participation alleged is the loan of the appellant's wagon with Jutras' cap and apron, and if Jutras had no authority from the appellant to loan the wagon, the purpose for which he made the loan and his knowledge, innocent or guilty, of the object for which the wagon was borrowed cannot create a liability which article 1054 C.C. does not impose on the master. It is true that if the servant commits a crime in the performance of the work for which he is employed, the master is civilly responsible for the consequent damage. But it does not follow, because the servant committed a crime or was an accomplice in a crime committed by others, that the master is liable. The commission of the crime must be in the performance of the servant's work; if it is entirely outside the scope of the servant's duties, there is no room for liability. Similarly while the master is answerable for an abuse of a duty which he has confided to his employee, he is not responsible for something done entirely outside of the duty, even if it could not have been done without the tool or other object which he entrusted to his servant. The example given by Mr. Justice Dorion in the passage quoted above clearly shows the fallacy of the respondents' contention.\nWhether therefore Jutras was or was not particeps criminis in the unauthorized loan of his master's wagon, the answer is the same and the inevitable conclusion is that the appellant is not liable for the theft of the respondents' goods.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, with costs here and below.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant carried on in Montreal the business of a carter, chiefly engaged as agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in collecting goods from merchants and transporting them to the said railway company's freight sheds or cars for shipment over its line; and delivering goods, received by said railway at said freight sheds or cars which had brought them, to the parties entitled to receive them.\nThe respondents are merchants in Montreal and as such apparently extensive shippers of the goods they deal in over the said railway, and they had long been accustomed to entrust the carriage thereof to appellant\u2014almost daily.\nThe appellant had usually from a hundred to a hundred and fifty men employed as drivers of its wagons carrying such freight, and of these, one Jutras had been one for a considerable length of time before the occurrences in question herein.\nThe system followed by appellant and its customers requiring its services was, that when they had any goods ready for shipment they would telephone the appellant's office and those in charge thereof would direct by phone or otherwise such of their carters as they chose to select to respond to such call by going to the place where such service was wanted with the wagon, and the carter was expected to wear a certain type of apron and cap and mittens, indicating the service on which he was engaged; and the wagon had painted thereon in large letters \"C.P.R.\" on the side and front, indicating also its service, and the proprietor thereof. The following admission was made by the appellant at the trial hereof:\nThe defendant admits that Alfred Jutras was a carter and in its employ on the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 27th of November, 1917, and that on those days he took out a rig belonging to the defendant company and was paid for his services for those four days.\nThere were other telephone messages from respondents, in said November besides those on the dates mentioned, requesting appellant's services, but these are given as the important dates in question herein.\nThe said Jutras was in fact one of a gang of thieves, which had been carrying on its work during some months, from some time in September or earlier, to some time in December, 1917. And on two occasions in said month of November (on one or other of said dates given in above quotation) they used the wagon of appellant, which was being driven by said Jutras, as admitted above, on said dates.\nJutras, it is sworn by one or more of the said gang giving evidence herein, accompanied others of the gang up to the vicinity of the respondents' place of business, on the occasion in question herein, and awaited their return with the wagon he had been driving, as admitted.\nOne of the gang (wearing Jutras' apron and other insignia, above referred to, which Jutras lent him for the occasion) on reaching said place of business, announced by calling out \"C.P.R.\" to respondents' shipper, one Johnson, that he had come for their freight; satisfied Johnson that he was serving appellant in response to the phone message, and signed the bills of lading and other documents usually required for the shipment of their goods; and then Johnson called his assistant to put the goods, then packed and ready to be loaded, on the elevator.\nThen one Leheron, the only man delivering any goods, testifies as follows:\nQ. Mr. Leheron, in November, 1917, where were you employed?\u2014A. At Mark Fisher's.\nQ. Do you have anything to do with delivery of goods?\u2014A. I deliver all the goods.\nQ. You deliver all the goods?\u2014A. All the goods by freight.\nQ. Did you deliver a parcel of goods outward on the 6th of November, 1917?\u2014A. Yes, I deliver every day.\nQ. Did you deliver these goods?\u2014A. I don't know what goods they are. I deliver the goods but I don't know what goods they are.\nQ. Do you deliver all the goods that go out from Mark Fishers?\u2014A. Yes. Q. Did you ever deliver goods to any one but a regular rig * * *?\u2014A. No, sir, it is always the C.P.R., G.T.R., or Canadian Northern, all the rigs I put my goods in.\nQ. Unless the rigs bear the letters C.P.R. or G.T.R. you do not give out the freight?\u2014A. No, sir, that is my orders by Mark Fisher.\nQ. That is your invariable custom?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nCross-examined by Mr. W. R. L. Shanks, of counsel for the defendant :\u2014\nQ. Do you know what goods you delivered? How do you know it was on the 6th of November, 1917?\u2014A. I do not know what goods are delivered. I deliver the goods, I don't know what goods they are. I have not got anything to do with that.\nQ. You are delivering goods every day practically?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Do you know whether you delivered the goods referred to in this case?\u2014A. There is nobody else but me does it.\nQ. Do you know whether you delivered them on the 5th or the 6th November?\u2014A. That I could not tell you. It is such a long time ago.\nQ. You take a receipt of some kind?\u2014A. No, sir, I never take a receipt.\nQ. Who takes the receipt?\u2014A. The shipper.\nInstead of taking the goods to the freight shed the man who got delivery, being a brother-in-law of Jutras, took them to a receiver of stolen goods. I may say he falsely signed thus for the goods under the assumed name of H. Lajeunesse.\nThis like performance with the same wagon and apron and cap and mittens, was gone through with Jutras' concurrence on the 27th of November, 1917, but with another man driving the wagon; going into the respondents' office, and doing the signing under the assumed name of Lalonde and then, when delivery got in same way as before, taking the goods to the receiver of stolen goods.\nThe present action is brought to recover from the appellant the value of the goods thus improperly taken by the connivance of its employee, Jutras, from the respondents.\nThe learned trial judge after reciting the essential part of the pleadings of the parties hereto, considering that the plaintiff had proved the essential allegations of its declaration and that defendant (now appellant) had not established its plea, directed judgment to be entered for the amount claimed.\nFrom this judgment, which follows the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, on the appeal side, in a number of cases arising out of a wave of crime, as it were, the appellant, by consent of the parties hereto, has appealed per saltum to this court. I am quite convinced (after reading the entire evidence in the case, and much of it more than once, and considering same as carefully as I can), that Jutras was an active party to the thefts in question of the respondents' goods whilst admittedly in the employment of the appellant, and hence appellant is liable therefor to the respondents.\nI cannot accept the evidence of the said Jutras who tells such an improbable story, in face of the facts testified to by a number of witnesses some of whom, of course, one must look upon with some suspicion by reason of their past records.\nI can see no interest they have in lying in regard to much of their evidence, which I accept especially as the circumstances in many ways seem to corroborate their respective stories.\nJutras pretends that he only got paid for the use of appellant's wagon which he, as its driver, was paid by appellant for driving on said dates.\nHe seems quite unconscious that in taking pay therefor he was doing what no honest man could be guilty of. He took much more than that out of the proceeds of other thefts of a like kind, if others are to be believed.\nThe pretence he and his brother-in-law set up of the wagon being lent for a trip for some valises, is rather extraordinary in face of what we are told as to a dozen or more occasions for which it was used for the like purpose as on the occasion herein in question.\nMoreover there is a rather curious phase of the case put forward by the appellant as to the record of the telephone calls from the respondents relative to the occasion in question. The appellant's own record tends to shew that on the 5th of November a call was made by the respondents at 9.15, as testified by respondents' evidence also, and that was responded to by sending one McKinnon on the 6th of November at 3 p.m., and that the call of the 27th of November at 3 p.m., was responded to by sending one, Corlett, at 7 a.m. of the 28th.\nWe have no evidence of either McKinnon or Corlett. I am curious to know why so. If they really went I should have been pleased to have it verified and the result appear in evidence, had I been trying the case. Then I submit that appellant's factum seems to skip all reference to Leheron's evidence and then argues as if no one at respondents' place of business had seen this wagon in question on the occasion on which it was there.\nLeheron shews he was the man alone who delivered goods, and never delivered any without seeing the mark of identification thereon, of the system it belonged to, for such were his instructions from Mark Fisher. Evidently that was the check the respondents relied on.\nAnd it seems to me that some of the thieves well knew that, and hence their anxiety to get Jutras' wagon and other insignia, already referred to.\nMoreover why stress Johnson's failure to see the wagon in face of such a system?\nIndeed I infer, from Johnson's story about telling his assistant, after getting the signature to the documents, to place the packages of goods on the elevator, that his office was either a floor above or below the exit for their delivery, and hence he could not well be expected to look out for the wagon marks.\nAs I have stated my conclusion as to the facts, I do not see the need for going into an elaborate discussion of the law, for there are several different articles respondents can rely upon.\nSurely no one will pretend that if Jutras had answered one of these calls in person and with appellant's wagon marked \"C.P.R.\" on front and side, as already indicated, and bearing other insignia required by appellant (and he Jutras determined to steal the goods) that appellant could escape liability for the theft, if so committed. And I fail to see that the consequences could be any different and appellant's liability any less when he was on active duty and supplied others accused with the means of deceiving, and thereby gets the goods and is a party to the whole scheme of theft.\nI have read most of the other cases of the same kind referred to, which had arisen out of the same wave of crime, as it were, and I agree with the majority in the appellate court below. With due respect I cannot agree with the reasoning and conclusion reached by Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau. Of course I do not mean that his entire reasoning is erroneous, much of it would apply to many cases likely to happen but not to this rather gross case. I would therefore be in favour of dismissing this appeal with costs, and support the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: DeWitt, Howard & Harold.\n[1] [1920] Q.R. 31 K.B. 170.\n[2] [1922] Q.R. 34 K.B. 417.\n[3] [1924] Q.R., 36 K.B. 385.\n[4] Q.R. 31 K.B. 170.\n[5] [1924] Q.B. 36 K.B. 414.\n5 [1924] Q.B. 36 K.B. 414.\n[6] Q.R. 36 K.B. 385.\n[7] Q.R. 34 K.B. 417.\n[8] [1919] 60 Can.

VII, c 53 (D).\nBy an agreement made in 1901 between the Canadian Northern Ry. Co. and the Government of Manitoba the Lieutenant Governor in Council was authorized to fix the rates to be demanded by the company for the carriage of freight on its lines in the province. This agreement was confirmed by Acts of Parliament and the legislature respectively, the Dominion Act containing the following provisions: Sec. 3. \"Nothing in this Act or in the indenture contained in the schedule shall * * * (a) divert or limit, temporarily or otherwise, the rights or powers * * * of any commission * * * respecting any matter or thing, obligation or duty; (c) authorize the Canadian Northern Ry. Co. * * * to charge or demand any discriminating rate for the carriage of freight or passengers, or to allow or make any secret or special tolls, etc., or any higher rates for the carriage of freight or passengers, than those heretofore or hereafter fixed * * * by any commission or other authority.\"\nHeld, that sec. 3 (a) clearly reserves the rights and powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners which is a commission or authority within its terms; and that 3 (c) which deals with special matter of tolls does not except that subject from the generality of 3 (a) on the principle generalia specialibus non derogant, inasmuch as the two subsections are concerned with different matters and do not overlap nor conflict.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada on a question of the jurisdiction of the board.\nThe question for decision is thus stated in the order granting leave to appeal.\n\"Whether the judgment of the board, as set out in the reasons for judgment, was right in determining that the Manitoba Agreement and the Acts, statutes of Manitoba, 1901, chap. 39, and statutes of Canada, 1901, chap. 53, do not limit the power of the board to increase or authorize the increase of the tolls and rates to an amount exceeding the tolls established for the carriage of goods and passengers upon the lines of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, referred to in the said agreement and statutes.\"\nChrysler K.C. and Craig K.C. for the appellants.\nPhippen K.C. and Fraser K.C. for the respondent the Canadian Northern Ry. Co.\nLafleur K.C. and Flintoff for the respondent the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nNewcombe J.\u2014By order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada of 26th December, 1917, upon application of the respondent companies and of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo, Pere Marquette, New York Central, Michigan Central, Kettle Valley and Great Northern Railway Companies, it was ordered that, subject to the provisions of the Crow's Nest Pass agreement and of the judgment pronounced by the learned Chief Commissioner, and concurred in by the other members of the board, copy of which was attached to the order, the standard tariffs of maximum mileage tolls approved by the board to be charged between stations on the individual steam railway systems subject to its jurisdiction might, by new tariffs to be submitted for the board's approval and published in the Canada Gazette as required by sections 327 and 331 of the Railway Act, and, following such approval and publication, made effective not earlier than 1st February, 1918, be increased to the extent limited by the order.\nUpon the hearing of the application counsel were heard not only on behalf of the parties and the railway companies above mentioned, but also on behalf of a number of the Boards of Trade of the more important cities from Montreal to Vancouver, the Canadian Manufacturers Association, various manufacturing concerns and others interested in railway tariffs. The appellant Government opposed the application upon the ground, among others, that the increase of rates, which was in the result granted, would conflict with an agreement of 11th February, 1901, between the appellant Government and the Canadian Northern Railway Company, one of the respondents, whereby, in consideration of a guaranty of the company's bonds, the company agreed that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council should fix the freight rates of the company as provided in clause (8) of the agreement which will presently be quoted; and inasmuch as this agreement had been confirmed by statute of Manitoba, ch. 39 of 1901, and also had been in a qualified or limited manner recognized by statute of the Dominion, ch. 53 of 1901, the province contended that the board had no authority to increase the tolls in excess of those established under the agreement.\nThe case was very carefully considered in the decision of the board.\nAfterwards, by order of 22nd January, 1918, upon application to the board by the appellants for leave to appeal from the order, the board granted leave to appeal upon the following question:\u2014\nWhether the judgment of the board, as set out in the reasons for judgment, was right in determining that the Manitoba Agreement and the Acts, statutes of Manitoba, 1901, chapter 30, and statutes of Canada, 1901, chapter 53, do not limit the power of the board to increase or authorize the increase of the tolls and rates to an amount exceeding the tolls established for the carriage of goods and passengers upon the lines of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, referred to in the said agreement and statutes.\nAlthough the appeal has been pending since the date of the last mentioned order it was brought to hearing only during the present sittings of the court. The appellants' case was very fully presented, but the court considered it unnecessary to hear counsel for the railway companies who had appeared to maintain the order of the board.\nI am now to state reasons why, in the judgment of the court, the appeal should be dismissed.\nBy the agreement of 11th February, 1901, which was executed under seal by the respective parties, and for considerations which are not in question, the Canadian Northern Railway Company agreed by clause (8) that:\nUp to the 30th day of June, A.D. 1930, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall from time to time fix the rates to be charged or demanded by the company for the carriage of all freight from all points on the company's lines in Manitoba to Port Arthur, and from Port Arthur to all points on the company's lines in Manitoba, and from all points on the company's lines in Manitoba to all other points on said lines in Manitoba. Provided always that, before any rates are so fixed, the company shall be heard and their interests taken into consideration. The company agrees that it will not at any time after the said rates have been so fixed charge or demand for the carriage of freight between the points aforesaid greater rates than those so fixed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The Canadian Northern Railway Co. was, at the time of the making of this agreement and still is, a Dominion company under the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and the agreement itself, as the 4th clause recognizes, acknowledges the necessity of legislation by the Parliament of Canada in order to make its provisions effective in their application to the railway. The parties covenant that they will use their best endeavours to procure from the Provincial Legislature and from the Parliament of Canada such legislation as may be necessary to confirm the agreement, and to enable and require the parties to carry it out in order that its true intent and meaning may be properly and fully accomplished.\nThe agreement having been executed was accordingly submitted to the Legislature and to Parliament. Chapter 39 of Manitoba, confirming the agreement, was enacted on 20th March, 1901, and the Dominion Act, chapter 53 of 1901, was enacted on 23rd May of that year.\nIt follows from what has been said, and it is common ground in the case, that the tariff rates, or powers for fixing tariff rates, stipulated for by the agreement are binding upon the railway and can be justified as rates to be charged by it only by Dominion legislation. The Act, chapter 53 of 1901, by s. 2 declares that the Canadian Northern Railway Company has and shall be deemed to have had at the time of the execution of the agreement full power, among other things, to make the covenants and agreements therein contained relating\nto the rates to be charged or demanded by the said company for the carriage of freight and passengers.\nThen follows s. 3, upon the effect or meaning of which the case depends; its material provisions are as follows:\u2014\n3. Nothing in this Act or in the indenture contained in the schedule hereto, or done in pursuance of this Act or of the said indenture, shall,\u2014\n(a) divest or limit, temporarily or otherwise, the rights or powers (under existing or future legislation of the Parliament of Canada) of the Governor in Council, or of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, or of any commission or other authority, respecting any matter or thing, obligation or duty;\n(c) authorize the Canadian Northern Railway Company, contrary to the meaning of The Railway Act, to charge or demand any discriminating rate for the carriage of freight or passengers, or to allow or make any secret or special tolls, rebate, drawbacks or concession, or any higher rates for the carriage of freight or passengers than those heretofore or hereafter fixed, under the authority of existing or future legislation of the Parliament of Canada, by the Governor in Council, or by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, or by any commission or other authority.\nIt is admitted that the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada is a commission or authority within the meaning of clause (a), and therefore it is difficult to perceive how this Act, which is the only competent legislative sanction for the rates stipulated by the agreement, can, in view of the plain reservation of the powers of the board by clause (a) admit of an interpretation which would divest those powers.\nAlthough it was not denied that s. 3 (a) is expressed in terms broad enough to reserve to the board jurisdiction to make the order in question, it was suggested that this is a general clause, limited by s. 3 (c), which is of a special character, relating to tolls, and operates, therefore, upon the principle of the general maxim \"generalia specialibus non derogant,\" to withdraw or except that subject from the generality of s. 3 (a). But clauses (a) and (c) are in truth concerned with different subject matters; they do not overlap, and therefore the latter cannot derogate from the former. Clause (a) relates to the powers of the Governor in Council, the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, or any commission or other statutory authority, while clause (c) is concerned only with powers of the respondent company. Each of these clauses operates within its own plane and they do not conflict. Moreover it will be observed by clause (8) of the agreement that the authority for the fixing of rates by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to which the company consented, was limited to a period which will expire on 30th June, 1930, and that it exists therefore only temporarily. Now s. 3 (a) of the Act to which the agreement is scheduled provides that neither the Act nor the agreement is to divest or limit temporarily or otherwise the powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners; presumably the word \"temporarily\" was introduced for a purpose, and the right to fix the rates conferred by clause (8) of the agreement is, so far as has been made to appear, the only right or power provided for by the agreement which may be aptly described as \"temporary.\" If this be true, s. 3 (a), not only by general provision includes the jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners relating to rates for the carriage of freight and passengers, but also particularly embraces their jurisdiction as to rates.\nThe question subject to appeal should therefore be answered affirmatively, upholding the jurisdiction of the board.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chrysler & Chrysler.\nSolicitor for the respondent the Canadian Northern Ry.

The order given was for \"used pipes in good working condition.\" D. Submitted to a judgment in favour of the representatives of its employee under the Workmen's Compensation Act for $2,560. D. sued to recover this sum from S.; in a second action S. claimed the same sum by way of warranty from his vendor Z., and in a third action Z. sought to recover by way of sub-warranty from his vendor B.\nHeld, that since no care which could reasonably be expected from the vendors would have disclosed the presence of the gun cotton, there was no delictual liability under Art. 1053 C.C.\nHeld, that a merchant-vendor, not the manufacturer, is legally presumed to know latent defects in the thing sold only where his calling imports a profession of skill or knowledge in regard thereto on which the purchaser might reasonably rely.\nHeld that a second-hand dealer is therefore not subject to the legal presumption of knowledge contained in par. 2 of Art. 1527 C.C. He is liable only to the extent indicated in Art. 1528 C.C., unless he had actual knowledge of the latent defect from which injury has arisen, or had some reason to suspect its existence, non-disclosure of which might amount to dol.\nHeld that the presumption of knowledge under par. 2 of Art. 1527 C.C. is rebuttable only by proof that the nature of the defect was such that its existence could not have been suspected by the vendor and that he could not have discovered it by any precaution he might reasonably be expected to take.\nHeld also that the damages claimed by D. from S. are not recoverable as resulting from a conventional or contractual warranty, as these damages could not \"have been foreseen\" by the vendor within the meaning of Art. 1074 C.C.\nJudgment from the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 37 K.B. 451) reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the action by the Davie Shipbuilding Co. was maintained against the appellants Samson & Filion, the action in warranty by Samson & Filion was maintained against the appellant Ziff and the appellant Ziff's action in sub-warranty against the respondents Baker & Betcherman was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nAntonio Langlais K.C. for Samson & Filion.\nBelleau K.C. for The Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co.\nRyan K.C. and Budyk for Ziff.\nFripp K.C. and Mayrand for Baker & Betcherman. The judgment of the majority of the Court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014These actions arise out of the death of an employee of the Davie Shipbuilding Company caused by an explosion of gun-cotton in a 6-inch iron \"second hand\" pipe in the course of its being heated preparatory to the use of a \"T\" attached to it for the purpose for which it had been bought by the shipbuilding company. The company submitted to a judgment in favour of the representatives of their employee under the Workmen's Compensation Act for $2,560.\nIn the first suit they seek to recover this sum from Samson & Filion, from whom they allege they had bought the pipe in question, in Quebec, in April, 1919; in the second action Samson & Filion claim over, by way of warranty, from their alleged vendor, Ziff, on a sale made in Montreal, in March, 1919; in the third action Ziff seeks to recover similarly, by way of sub-warranty, from his alleged vendors, Baker and Betcherman, on a sale made in Ottawa, in February, 1919. The first two actions were maintained in the Superior Court and the third was dismissed. All three judgments were upheld on appeal.\nAlthough it is suggested that the pipe in question was at one time in use in a munitions factory and that the presence of gun-cotton in it is thus accounted for, that fact is not established. It is common ground, however, that the explosive substance was in the pipe during all the time occupied in its passing through the hands of the several parties to these actions. It is also common ground that none of them up to the moment of the explosion had any knowledge of the fact that the pipe contained such a substance; nor does it appear that any of them (unless it be Baker & Betcherman) knew that the pipe had been used in, or had come from, a munitions factory.\nWhile anybody even cursorily examining the pipes would probably have noticed white markings upon them, and on more careful investigation might have discovered a white powder in some of them, it is not contended that such a discovery would have given any reason to suspect that the white substance was in reality a dangerous explosive such as gun-cotton. Indeed the presence of the white powder was noticed by the shipbuilding company's employees in small quantities in a number of the pipes which they handled, but was taken by them to be asbestos. The learned trial judge in discussing the facts says that, however vigilant or distrustful, no buyer of used iron pipe would imagine that it might contain a dangerous explosive. Mr. Justice Flynn, who delivered the principal judgment in the Court of King's Bench, while of the opinion that the vendors of the pipes must have noticed the white substance, is convinced that they had no suspicion of its being an explosive. These findings were not attacked, no doubt because they were regarded as unimpeachable. It seems clear that there was nothing to arouse any suspicion and that only a chemical analysis of the substance in the pipes would have revealed its dangerous character.\nThe learned trial judge dealt with the first two cases on the basis of delictual responsibility. The Court of King's Bench, on the other hand, treated them as falling within Art. 1527 C.C.\u2014as cases in which there was a legal presumption of knowledge on the part of the vendors entailing the consequences of actual knowledge, i.e., responsibility for all the damages sustained by the purchasers. Consequently Samson & Filion were held liable to the Davie Shipbuilding Company and Ziff to Samson & Filion. Ziff's action against Baker & Betcherman failed in both courts for lack of proof that the pipe in question was one of those bought by him from them.\nSamson & Filion v. Davie Shipbuilding Company\nThe plaintiffs in this action rest their claim on three distinct bases:\u2014\n(a) delictual fault (Art. 1053 C.C.),\n(b) breach of legal warranty against latent defects (Art. 1522 C.C.) coupled with a legal presumption of knowledge of such defects (Art. 1527 C.C.), and (c) breach of conventional warranty.\nThe finding of the trial judge that the pipe in which the fatal explosion occurred was one of the lot sold by Samson & Filion to the Davie Shipbuilding Co., affirmed by the Court of King's Bench, could not, upon the evidence, be seriously questioned. On the argument it was suggested that the plaintiffs had been subrogated to the rights of the representatives of their employee who was killed. To their right under the Workmen's Compensation Act there could be no effective subrogation. Any claim such representatives might have had under Art. 1056 C.C.\nagainst third parties responsible for the accident\n(R.S.Q. Art. 7334) was never preferred and there has been no assessment of damages on that footing; nor was there any discussion of such a claim in this action. The plaintiffs' declaration makes no allusion to it. That ground of claim may, therefore, be dismissed without further consideration.\n(a) It may also be said at once that, in our opinion, the facts in evidence fall far short of what would suffice to warrant a finding of failure to take such reasonable care as would involve delictual fault entailing liability under Art. 1053 C.C. The learned Chief Justice indeed negatived that basis of liability when he said:\nquel acheteur, fut-il le plus vigilant, le plus averti ou le plus m\u00e9fiant, ira se douter que des tuyaux de fonte puissent contenir un explosif dangereux?\nDelictual fault as a basis of liability was properly rejected by the Court of King's Bench.\n(b) That court, as already stated, held the appellants liable for a breach of the warranty against latent defects imposed by Art. 1522 C.C. and responsible\nfor all (the) damages suffered by the buyer\nas vendors against whom there was a legal presumption, under Art. 1527 (2), of knowledge of a latent defect which caused such damage.\nIt may be arguable that what is invoked as a conventional warranty given by the appellants, presently to be dealt with, superseded any legal warranty under Art, 1522 and that the claim based on Arts. 1522 and 1527 C.C. would be thereby precluded. But the Court of King's Bench did not take that view, and, as they have rested their judgment on those articles, it will probably be better first to deal with that basis of liability as if there had been no conventional warranty\u2014especially since what is to be said in this case on that assumption will also apply to the case of Ziff v. Samson & Filion, where there is no suggestion of conventional warranty. Arts. 1527 and 1528 C.C. read as follows:\u2014\n1527. If the seller knew the defect of the thing, he is obliged not only to restore the price of it, but to pay all damages suffered by the buyer.\nHe is obliged in like manner in all cases in which he is legally presumed to know the defects.\n1528. If the seller did not know the defects or is not legally presumed to have known them, he is obliged only to restore the price and to reimburse to the buyer the expenses caused by the sale.\nThe corresponding articles of the Code Napoleon, 1645 and\n1646, are:\u2014\n1645. Si le vendeur connaissait les vices de la chose, il est tenu, outre la restitution du prix qu'il en a re\u00e7u, de tous les dommages et int\u00e9rets envers l'acheteur.\n1646. Si le vendeur ignorait les vices de la chose, il ne sera tenu qu'\u00e0 la restitution du prix, et \u00e0 rembourser \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur les frais occasionn\u00e9s par la vente.\nNotwithstanding the omission of the second paragraph of Art. 1527 C.C. from Art. 1645 C.N., and the corresponding omission from Art. 1646 C.N. of the words,\nor is not legally presumed to have known them,\nfound in Art. 1528 C.C., the French authorities are agreed that there exists in French law a presumption similar to, if not identical with, that indicated in the second paragraph of Art. 1527 C.C. and that cases within that presumption fall under Art. 1645 and not under Art. 1646 C.N. French text-writers and jurisprudence are, therefore, helpful in determining the scope of, and the limitations upon, the application of paragraph 2 of Art. 1527 C.C., with which we are presently concerned\u2014the more so since the codifiers cite Pothier, Vente, 212-3, and Obligations, 163, and Domat, Liv. I, tit. II, s. XI, No. 7, as the basis of Art. 1527 C.C., Laurent (v. 24, No. 294) informs us that Arts. 1645-6 C.N. are likewise derived from Pothier.\n(1) Ex facie it is not every seller who is in fact ignorant of defects in the thing sold by him who comes within the second paragraph of Art. 1527 C.C., but only such vendors as are \"legally presumed to know.\" Since the code does not enumerate or otherwise define the vendors to whom this presumption attaches, we are driven to the common law to ascertain who they are.\n(2) Also ex facie the presumption is juris tantum and not juris et de jure. Hence it is rebuttable but by what proof is again a question for careful consideration.\nMoreover, although the liability under Art. 1527 C.C., as under Art. 1645 C.N., is stated to be for\nall damages suffered by the buyer, the damages recoverable are necessarily subject to some restrictions. The basis of the liability under Art. 1527 C.C. is dol actual or presumed. The code provides that even where the inexecution of an obligation is due to fraud of the obligor, only the damages immediately and directly resulting therefrom (Art. 1075 C.C.) can be recovered. It would also seem clear that when an article is sold for a definite purpose and is put to some other use entailing greater loss the damages attributable to a latent defect which may be recovered by the buyer under Art. 1527 C.C. may not exceed those that would have been suffered had it been used as intended. (Pothier, Vente, No. 214). That is merely an application of the principle underlying Art. 1074 C.C. Whether when the sale is not for any definite purpose, but is of an article the ordinary use of which is well established, and the buyer puts it to some extraordinary use, he can recover under Art. 1527 C.C. to the extent to which his loss is aggravated by reason of such extraordinary use may perhaps be more doubtful. Pothier's view is against such recovery. (Vente, 214). Laurent, (v. 24, No. 295 in fine), however, suggests that where knowledge of a defect by the vendor is presumed all the resultant loss to the purchaser may be regarded as within the ordinary rule governing damages, the foreseeable damages (Art. 1074 C.C.) in such a case being much more comprehensive than in the case of an.\" ordinary vendor.\"\nBut we are not presently concerned with the limitations on the amount of damages recoverable and they are alluded to merely to indicate that Art. 1527 C.C., notwithstanding the comprehensiveness of its terms, is subject in its application to some restrictions. The damages suffered by the shipbuilding company were undoubtedly the direct and immediate result of the presence of the gun-cotton in the pipe sold to it by the appellants. That pipe was not put to any extraordinary use or subjected to any unusual treatment and, while the buyers gave a written order for the articles they required, specifying the quantity of each size of pipe (thus indicating that they were acquired for immediate use and for some definite purpose), there is no evidence that that purpose was communicated to the vendors, or, if it was, that the pipes were put to a use not contemplated by them. (1) Whether the vendors in the present instance, their ignorance in fact of the presence of the gun-cotton in the pipe which they sold having been conceded and knowledge of anything which should have aroused suspicion as to its presence having been negatived, (Pothier, Vente, 212; Laurent, v. 24, no. 295), were sellers who should be presumed to have had knowledge of that \"defect\" may next be considered.\nWithout so deciding, we shall assume, as was held by the Court of King's Bench, that the presence of the gun-cotton in the pipe in which it exploded, although an extraneous substance, was a defect within Art. 1527 C.C.\nThe buyers were not seeking either resiliation or compensation for diminished value as provided by Art. 1526 C.C. In pursuing those remedies it would have been unnecessary to establish either knowledge or presumption of knowledge of the defect. But, claiming, as they do, under Art. 1527 C.C., and not averring actual knowledge, it becomes a vital question whether on such a sale as that under consideration\u2014a sale of second-hand pipes by a second hand dealer\u2014a legal presumption of knowledge by the seller of any latent defect in them arises under the second paragraph of that article.\nWe naturally turn to Pothier for the principles which must govern this inquiry. He distinctly excludes from the legal presumption of knowledge the vendor who is neither the maker of the goods sold nor a merchant.\nHors ces cas d'un ouvrier ou d'un marchand, le vendeur qui n'a eu ni la connaissance, ni aucun juste soup\u00e7on du vice redhibitoire * * * n'est aucunement tenu du dommage que ce vice a cause \u00e0 l'acheteur dans ses autres biens. (Vente, 215).\nUpon this exclusion of the \"ordinary vendor\" all the text-writers are in accord. Such a vendor is on the same footing as to presumed knowledge and means of knowledge as the buyer. In the absence of conventional warranty the latter will not be justified in relying on the skill or knowledge or means of knowledge of the former. Art. 1527 C.C. cannot be invoked; the only remedies are those provided by Arts. 1526 and 1528 C.C.\nEqually distinctly Pothier declares that the manufacturer or artisan who sells his own product is invariably presumed to know of defects in it and to be liable for damages caused by them to purchasers on the same footing as if he had actual knowledge of such defects. (Vente, 213; Oblig, 163). Here again the commentators are in accord. (Guillouard, Vente, 463; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, 436). Indeed the codifiers of the Quebec Code, in their fourth report, at p. 14, give as an instance of legal presumption of knowledge under para. 2 of Art. 1527 C.C.,\nmechanics, who would be presumed to know defects in the quality of the materials used by them in their trade.\nThe extent and the force of the presumption in such a case is exemplified in Ross v. Dunstall[2]; see Wilson v. Vanchestein[3]; compare Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e c. Tonna[4].\nIt is important to note, however, the nature of the presumption and the basis on which Pothier rests it (Oblig. 163, par. 2). It is not a presumption of fault as some French writers seem to opine (Mourlon, no. 607; Guillouard, Vente, no. 463; D. Rep. Vices Redhib. 160). It is a presumption of knowledge which Art. 1527 (2) declares and which such a vendor as un homme du m\u00e9tier will not be allowed to deny. (Guillouard, Vente, no. 463). Against him there is a fin de non-recevoir which precludes his alleging a belief that the article sold was free from defects since that would be to aver as a defence what must be imputed to him as a fault, imperitia culpae annumeratur, (Pothier, Louage, 119). In such a case the vendor has opportunities of knowledge not open to the purchaser and it is only natural and to be expected that the purchaser should rely upon him for disclosure of latent defects. Hence the presumption of knowledge and its consequences.\nWe come now to a more debatable case, that of the merchant selling goods not made by himself. Is every such merchant subject to a presumption of knowledge of defects, or does it arise only where from the nature of his business he may reasonably be said to profess possession of it, and a purchaser from him may fairly act on the assumption that he has it? The authorities are in accord that in the case of a merchant-vendor who deals in a definite class of goods in regard to which he may reasonably be supposed to possess skill and special knowledge\u2014un marchand qui vend des ouvrages * * * du commerce dont il fait profession, (Pothier, Vente, 213); un marchand feasant le commerce de choses pareilles, (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, no. 436); qui n'est pas en effet un vendeur ordinaire, (D. 73, 2.56)\u2014knowledge of latent defects will be presumed. Such merchants are classed amongst those who are legally presumed par profession to know the latent defects in their wares (5 Aubry et Rau, p. 113), and therefore held to be within Art. 1527 C.C. Beaver Oil Co. v. V\u00e9ronneau[5]; Lajoie v. Robert[6]; 7 Mignault, p. 213; 3 Langelier, p. 526.\nAlthough many French text-writers broadly assimilate the case of the merchant to that of the manufacturer or workman and use terms quite wide enough to include any sort of merchant-vendor (Guillouard, Vente, no. 463, in fine), others, more discriminating, confine the application of the presumption of knowledge, or, as some of them put it, of fault, to merchants of whom it may in a certain sense be said that their business is their profession\u2014\" le commerce dont ils font profession.\" For the wider application of the presumption the concluding paragraph of no. 213 of Pothier's treatise on Vente is invoked as authority. That learned writer having dealt in the preceding paragraph with the liability of the workman whose lack of skill or knowledge of things concerning the art he professes to exercise is imputed to him as a fault, opens the concluding paragraph with the general statement il en est de m\u00eame d'un marchand fabricant ou non-fabricant. But he had already in the first paragraph of the same section (no. 213) restricted the application of the presumption to un marchand qui vend des marchandises du commerce dont il fait profession and had added ce marchand est tenu de la reparation de tous les dommages, etc. As an illustration he had put on the same footing the cooper (le tonn\u00e9lier) and the merchant who deals in casks (le marchand de tonneaux), assigning as the reason for the liability of each\nson imp\u00e9ritie ou d\u00e9faut de connaissance dans tout ce qui concerne son art, est une faute qui lui est imput\u00e9e, personne ne devant professer publiquement un art, s'il n'a toutes les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires pour le bien exercer: Imperitia culpae annumeratur.\nIn no. 215 he contrasts with these the case of a purchase of casks from a vendor who is neither a cooper nor a dealer in casks, and whose liability is accordingly restricted to the restitution of the price (Art. 1526 C.C.) The restriction of the presumption of knowledge to a vendor who may be regarded as un homme du m\u00e9tier is emphasized in the treatise on Obligations (no. 163), where Pothier illustrates it by the case of a sale of defective wood by a carpenter entailing full liability, whereas on a like sale by a person not un homme du m\u00e9tier, but an \"ordinary vendor,\" the damages recoverable by the purchaser are confined to a reduction in price. See also Pothier, Louage, 119. Since the Codifiers indicate the texts of Pothier, Vente, 213, and Obligations, 163, as the basis of Art. 1527 C.C. it seems reasonable to hold that the vendors who will be \"legally presumed to have known\" latent defects for the purpose of par. 2 of that article are only those to whom lack of knowledge would be imputable as fault\u2014those on whose skill or knowledge, because their calling imports possession of it, a purchaser would be justified in placing, and might be expected to place, reliance. It is not, therefore, surprising to find that in the French cases in which merchant-vendors actually ignorant of defects in articles sold by them have been held liable under Art. 1645 C.N. on the footing of presumed knowledge or of fault, attention is generally directed by the courts to the special skill or knowledge which their public carrying on of a particular line of commerce imports. Spondet peritiam artis is the underlying principle of liability. Guillouard, (Vente, no. 463) puts the basis of responsibility in such cases in these words:\nLe vendeur devait, \u00e0 raison de la profession qu'il exerce, conna\u00eetre les d\u00e9fauts, m\u00eame caches, de la chose qu'il vend;\nPothier (Vente, no. 213) as already stated, refers to the \"marchand qui vend les choses du commerce dont il fait profession.\" For a few instances in which the courts have indicated the profession of special skill or knowledge on the part of the merchant-vendor as the basis of his liability under Art. 1645 C.N. (Art. 1527 (2) C.C.), reference may be made to D. 1912, 1. 16 and note; D. 1894,2.573,574 Pand. Fr. P\u00e9r. 1892. 2.169; D. 1873,2.55; D. 1863,2.27; Lajoie v. Robert[7].\nBut it sometimes happens that, although the appellation merchant may not improperly be given to the vendor, he does not deal in the goods sold by him in such a way that they can fairly be said to be des ouvrages du commerce dont il fait profession. The business he carries on does not import public profession of any special skill or knowledge in regard to his wares on which a customer might be expected to rely. To such a merchant-vendor the presumption of knowledge does not attach. Cessante ratione legis cessat et ipsa lex.\nIs there any tenable ground for imputing a profession of skill or knowledge in regard to the wares he sells to the second-hand dealer in scrap pipes or similar material? Can a purchaser reasonably claim that he relied on such a vendor's possession of such special skill or knowledge? In our opinion, assuredly not. In his case, therefore, the basis of responsibility\u2014professed skill or knowledge, on which the imputation of actual knowledge rests\u2014is lacking. The second-hand dealer must, for the purposes of Art. 1527 C.C., be regarded as an \"ordinary vendor,\" not subject to the legal presumption of knowledge under par. 2 of Art. 1527 C.C. and therefore liable only to the extent indicated in Arts. 1526 and 1528 C.C., unless indeed he had actual knowledge of the latent defect from which injury has arisen or had some reason to suspect its existence, non-disclosure of which might amount to dol. D. 1873. 2. 55.\nA fortiori is this so where, as in the case of the sale by Ziff to Samson & Filion, both vendor and purchaser are second-hand dealers. They stand on an equal footing as to the possession of skill and have equal opportunities of ascertaining any latent defects. Writing recently in 22 La Revue Trimestrielle, at p. 648, M. R\u00e9n\u00e9 Demogue says:\nLorsqu'un professionel passe un contrat, ses obligations sont plus ou moins \u00e9troites selon qu'il traite avec une personne de profession voisine, ayant des connaissances sp\u00e9ciales \u00e9gales aux siennes, ou non.\n(II) By what proof is the presumption of knowledge under Art. 1527 (2) C.C. rebuttable? Certainly not, as some writers seem to suggest, (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, no. 436 in fine; Dalloz, Nouveau Code Civ. Art. 1645, no. 28), merely by proof, however cogent, that the vendor was in fact ignorant of the defect. The hypothesis of the second paragraph of Art. 1527 C.C. is that very ignorance. But there are many cases in which, if the presumption would otherwise have arisen, the circumstances show that knowledge by the vendor was impossible and common sense demands that he should be held free from liability. An instance that at once occurs to the mind is that of a sale by a retail grocer of goods put up by the manufacturer in sealed packages. If such goods should contain some foreign deleterious substance, while the manufacturer might have difficulty in escaping responsibility, it would be absurd to hold the retail vendor liable under Art. 1527 (2) C.C. The circumstances peremptorily rebut any presumption of knowledge by him.\nThe presumption made in the French law is regarded as rebuttable by proof that the defect was of such a nature that the vendor could not have discovered it; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, no. 436; Guillouard, Vente, no. 463 in fine; Dalloz, Jur. G\u00e9n. Vices Redhib. 160; Pand. Fr. Rep. Vices Redhib. no. 344. In the work of Mr. Justice Mignault, (vol. 7, p. 113) the opinion expressed is that proof that discovery of the vice was impossible, notwithstanding les pr\u00e9cautions minutieuses, will suffice. Vid. D. 59. 2. 153,155. We are inclined to the view that the presumption of knowledge, for such it is, created by par. 2 of Art. 1527 C.C. is rebuttable by proof that the nature of the defect was such that its existence could not have been suspected by the vendor and that he could not, by any precaution which he might reasonably be expected to take, have discovered it, and that, having regard to the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge and by Mr. Justice Flynn, above noted, liability in the present case under Art. 1527 C.C. should on that ground be held not to have been established. Both because they are not vendors against whom a legal presumption of knowledge of latent defects would arise and also because, on the evidence, no care which could reasonably be exacted from them would have disclosed the fact that the pipes they sold contained a dangerous explosive, we are, with deference, of the opinion that in respect of any purely legal warranty, liability under Art. 1527 (2) C.C. does not attach to the appellants Samson & Filion.\n(c) There remains for consideration what the plaintiffs (respondents) prefer as a conventional warranty. The order given by them to the appellants for the pipes in question was for \"used pipes in good working condition.\" The plaintiffs aver that by accepting and filling an order drawn in those terms the appellants warranted that the pipes they supplied were in condition for immediate use by the purchasers in an ordinary way, and that any condition, such as the presence of an explosive substance in them, that would render them unfit for such use would amount to breach of conventional warranty and would entail liability for all damages directly resulting.\nWhatever obligation the vendors incurred arose out of their acceptance of the order in the terms in which it was couched. They certainly undertook to furnish pipes answering the description given and are subject to whatever liability inexecution of their contractual obligation entails. That liability is subject to the limitation imposed by Art. 1074 C.C., which reads as follows:\n1074. The debtor is liable only for the damages which have been foreseen or might have been foreseen (qu'on a pu pr\u00e9voir) at the time of contracting the obligation, when his breach of it is not accompanied by fraud.\nWere the damages suffered by the respondents as a result of the explosion foreseen or foreseeable within the meaning of this article? That they were not actually foreseen is clear. Whether they should be regarded as damages which \"might have been foreseen\" depends on the purview of that phrase as used in the article, which is in ipsissimis verbis as Art. 1150 C.N. The codifiers references under Art. 1074 are to Pothier, Vente, 72-3; Obligations, 165; Domat, Liv. I, tit. I, s. II, 17-18; and 6 Toullier, 284 et seq. In their report (p. 18) they state that the group of articles which comprises Art. 1074 embodies the rules contained in the French code and declares the existing law. The text of Domat throws no light on the question presently before us. Toullier says that, however immediately or directly the damages flow from the inexecution of the obligation, they will not be recoverable if they could not be foreseen. He adds that if the cause of the occurrence which entails loss to the buyer was known to the seller (no doubt meaning was known or ought to be held to have been known), he will be liable for all the damages sustained since he is deemed to have been willing to make them good.\nPothier (Oblig. no. 160) says:\nLorsqu'on ne peut reprocher au d\u00e9biteur aucun dol, et que ce n'est que par une simple faute qu'il n'a pas ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 son obligation; soit parce qu'il s'est engag\u00e9 t\u00e9m\u00e9rairement \u00e0 ce qu'il ne pouvait accomplir, soit parce qu'il s'est mis depuis, par sa faute, hors d'\u00e9tat d'accomplir son engagement ; dans ce cas, le d\u00e9biteur n'est tenu que des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'on a pu pr\u00e9voir, lors du contrat, que le cr\u00e9ancier pourrait souffrir de l'in\u00e9xecution de l'obligation; car le d\u00e9biteur est cens\u00e9 ne s'\u00eatre soumis qu'\u00e0 ceux-ci.\nAfter pointing out that, ordinarily, foreseeable damages are restricted to those which are intrinsic\u2014par rapport \u00e0 la chose m\u00eame\u2014and do not extend to extrinsic loss, i.e. to that sustained by the obligee dans ses autres biens (Oblig. no. 161; Vente 72), Pothier adds that sometimes extrinsic damages are recoverable (no. 162), giving as one example a case where an express provision of the contract anticipated the very occurrence which occasioned the loss; and as another a case where the object of the purchase was made known to the vendor and its frustration entailed loss of business by the purchaser. (See also Vente, no. 73). In the former the cause of the damage, in the latter the kind of damage suffered was foreseen. In no. 163 (Oblig.) he deals with a case in which knowledge of the cause of the damage imputed to un homme du m\u00e9tier affords a ground for holding him liable for extrinsic loss\u2014limited, however, to the risk which the circumstances showed he contemplated undertaking. Vide Delvincourt, Notes, no. 2, p. 532. Marcad\u00e9 (v. 4, no. 523) seems to regard the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic loss as futile, the sole question, he says, being whether the prejudice suffered should have been foreseen.\nWith the exception of Aubry et Rau (v. 4, p. 308, note 41), the authorities seem to be in accord that the effect of Art. 1150 C.N. is to exclude the recovery of extrinsic damages of which the cause could not have been foreseen at the time of making the contract. (Dal. Rep. Prat. Obligations, nos. 461-2; Gaz. du Palais, 1902, pp. 6-9; 5 Mignault, pp. 419-420; 3 Langelier, pp. 524-6; 5 Labori, Rep. du Dr. Dommages-Int\u00e9r\u00eats, no. 50; 16 Laurent, 289-293; Demolombe, Contrats, 578 et seq; 10 Duranton, 470 et seq; 7 Huc. pp. 211-12; 5 Demante, 66, bis III.) Aubry et Rau (loc. cit.) would further restrict the recovery under Art. 1150 C.N. to compensation in respect of such injury and loss as might themselves have been foreseen.\nIn the present case, as already indicated, neither the occurrence from which the respondents' loss resulted, nor the cause of that occurrence, nor the nature and extent of the damages it entailed could have been foreseen by the appellants. If, therefore, the case should be regarded as merely one of inexecution of the vendors' contractual obligation which arose from their acceptance of the order to furnish the goods answering the description \"in good working condition,\" the damages which the plaintiffs claim are not recoverable.\nIf, however, the words \"in good working condition\" in the respondents' order should be regarded as something more than descriptive of the quality of the pipes to be supplied, and the acceptance of such an order should be deemed to import some warranty that the pipes furnished pursuant to it were in a condition suitable for immediate use, (Lamer v. Beaudoin[8]), any obligation in damages arising out of a breach of that warranty would, in our opinion, be subject to the limitations either of Art. 1074 C.C. or of Art. 1528 C.C. Those limitations in such a case as this do not materially differ. Under Art. 1074 C.C. recovery is restricted to damages foreseeable, because only for them is liability impliedly assumed by the obligor. Under Art. 1528 C.C., if it be applicable, recovery is confined to such compensation as is allowable where all fraud or dol, actual or imputable, is excluded.\nNo doubt, by an instrument clearly expressing, or necessarily implying, such an intention, liability may be assumed for all damages consequential upon a breach of contractual obligation, though they be unforeseeable and should arise from a cause of which there is no knowledge either actual or presumable. Modus et conventio vincunt legem. But, in view of the fundamental distinction in regard to the measure of the damages recoverable established by the civil law between cases of dol or fraud, on the one hand, and those of innocent breaches of contractual obligations, on the other, the intention, in a case falling within the latter class, to assume the wider responsibility imposed by law in cases of dol or fraud will not be lightly imputed.\nIn the present case fraud is not suggested, and, as already stated, there is no basis for any imputation of dol arising from presumed knowledge. The occurrence which occasioned the damages and its cause were alike unforeseen and unforseeable. Viewed as in the nature of a warranty arising out of their acceptance of the order for pipes \"in good working condition,\" the obligation of the vendors would no doubt be conventional in its origin. It would accordingly not be confined to latent defects properly so called. The presence of a foreign substance in the pipes rendering them unfit for use would be a breach. Failure by the purchasers to make such inspection before using the pipes as, having regard to their description as \"used pipes,\" ordinary prudence, would, in the absence of such a warranty, have dictated, would not avail the vendors as a defence, even had the defect which caused the damage been readily discernible. But the warranty would, nevertheless, be implied by law rather than expressed and the obligation would attach to the appellants in their character as sellers. Arising, as it does, out of a stipulation incident to a contract of sale, whether express or implied, that obligation would, therefore, seem to be subject, as to the extent of the responsibility in damages which it entailed, to Arts. 1527-8 C.C. Lamer v. Beaudoin[9]. We find nothing in the terms of the order indicative of an intention on the part of the contracting parties that the vendors should renounce the restriction on the measure of damages afforded by Art. 1528 C.C. and assume the wider responsibility attached by the law only to cases of fraud or dol. (Pand. Fr. 1892. 2. 169). The right to recover the damages claimed in this action on the ground of conventional warranty, therefore, in our opinion cannot be maintained.\nFor these reasons the appeal of Samson & Filion against the judgment condemning them must be allowed.\nZiff v. Samson & Filion\nThe dismissal of the action against Samson & Filion necessarily destroys the basis of their claim in warranty against their vendor Ziff.\nMoreover, there certainly was nothing in the nature of a conventional warranty on Ziff's sale to Samson & Filion. On the contrary, in shipping the pipes he sold Ziff was careful to describe them in the Bills of Lading merely as \"car pipes scrap\" and in the invoice as \"78,700 pounds pipe.\" Neither was the use to be made of the pipes known when he effected the sale. :\nThat the pipe which exploded was one of the pipes sold by Ziff to Samson & Filion is clearly established by the evidence. If the principal action had been maintained we would thus have been confronted in the action against Ziff with a sale of second-hand pipes, without either express warranty or express exclusion of warranty, by one dealer in that class of goods to another. Responsibility for the damages claimed was in the Ziff case rested by the plaintiffs either on delictual fault or on a breach of implied warranty entailing liability under Art. 1527 C.C. For the reasons stated in the Samson & Filion case, liability on neither ground was incurred by Ziff. Indeed, so far as responsibility under Art. 1527 C.C. is concerned, as already stated, he would appear to be in even a better position with regard to Samson & Filion than they were in regard to their purchasers, the Davie Shipbuilding Company, since both Ziff and Samson & Filion were dealers in second-hand pipes and therefore each had, or ought to have had, equal skill and equal opportunities for ascertaining any latent defects in them.\nThe appeal of Ziff against the judgment condemning him must also be allowed.\nZiff v. Baker & Betcherman\nThe evidence in this action would not justify a reversal of the concurrent findings of the Superior Court and of the Court of King's Bench on the question of identification which is purely one of fact. Moreover, as we think the action against Ziff not maintainable, the basis of his claim in warranty disappears. It is unnecessary therefore, to consider the contention of counsel for Baker & Betcherman that their liability would depend upon and be excluded by Ontario law. Jones v. Just[10].\nThe appeal in Ziff v. Baker & Betcherman fails.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014\nSamson & Filion v. Davie Shipbuilding Co.\nThe respondent having bought from appellant certain pipes the former needed in its business, which is that which its name implies, proceeded to make use of them and, in course thereof, an explosion ensued which resulted in the death of one of its employees. As a result thereof the legal representatives of said deceased, were awarded, under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Quebec, damages to the amount of $2,560 against respondent herein.\nThe respondent paid such damages and costs, and then sued the appellants, who had, in selling said pipes to the respondent, represented them as in good working order, when in fact they were not, but liable, by reason of some material inside same, to produce such an explosion as took place, as already stated. On the trial of said action the learned trial judge found appellants liable and gave judgment for said damages with costs.\nFrom that judgment appellants appealed to the Court of King's Bench, and that appeal was dismissed with costs.\nThis is an appeal therefrom taken, I infer from the appellants' factum, as a precautionary measure awaiting the result of an action they had brought against one Ziff, from whom they had bought said pipes.\nI see no ground for the appeal and think same should be dismissed with costs.\nThe foregoing was written by me several weeks ago and now I have given me a copy of the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of our court, allowing the appeal with costs, and which I have read with care.\nI am, however, unable to change my views expressed in the foregoing; especially seeing that the learned trial judge was the Honourable Chief Justice, Sir F. X. Lemieux, of the Superior Court for the District of Quebec, who entered judgment for the now respondent for the amount claimed, and was upheld by the unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench at Montreal, consisting of Chief Justice Lafontaine and four others, said court, however, resting upon article 1527 of the Civil Code, instead of a quasi delict \u2014as they seem to think the learned judge had done.\nMoreover, the factum of counsel for the appellants for the appeal here does not attempt seriously to argue that said courts erred.\nIndeed, as I suggested in my foregoing notes, it seemed to be a matter of practical expediency in view of their claim over against Ziff, and ended by presenting the following suggestion:\u2014\nAppellants had no defence to the action taken by respondent but that negligence of respondent's employee and the fact that they had bought the pipes from Wm. Ziff whom they called in warranty. It is true that defendant in warranty Ziff did not take their place and stead. It is also true that the principal action was one trial and the action in warranty was another, but in those actions in warranty should not the person responsible for the fault be also held responsible for all the costs? The ruling of the Superior Court is to this effect.\nAppellants were satisfied with the judgment of the Superior Court. It is only upon defendant in warranty's inscription of his case before the Court of King's Bench that they appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court in the event and only event that the Court of King's Bench would modify the ruling of the trial judge. It is only upon defendant in warranty's inscription before this court that appellants inscribed their case, to see that, somebody having to pay, they shouldering only other people's responsibility, should not be compelled or should have a recourse against someone.\nZiff v. Samson & Filion\nThis appellant (having failed in the action taken by respondent against him in the courts below seeking relief by way of action in warranty, in respect of the pipes sold by respondent to the Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Company Limited, out of which sale and actual warranty so much litigation has arisen) appeals here.\nHis appeal here in his action against Baker and Betcherman, I had for my part disposed of by writing my opinion at the same time as I had written in the Samson & Filion appeal; holding that his said appeal should be dismissed.\nHis liability on the alleged warranty to Samson & Filion, I by no means could hold clear, either on the facts or the law, and I concluded to await the decisions of the Chief Justice and my brother judges.\nThe learned Chief Justice having sent me a copy of his judgment dealing with all three appeals, I see little hope of anything therein for respondent's recovery against this appellant.\nIt has always seemed to me very difficult to hold this appellant liable, for he was selling only scrap, whereas Samson & Filion were selling pipes (which by no means was of the scrap order), though picked out of a mass of what had been sold to them as scrap.\nIf they had only taken due care to clean them thoroughly their express warranty of their being in good working order would have been, I have no doubt, quite justifiable, and been justified.\nThe appellant in the result, of course, is entitled to succeed, with costs throughout.\nZiff v. Baker & Betcherman\nThe appellant carried on the business of an iron merchant in Montreal, in 1919.\nThere was an incorporated company known as the Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Company, Limited, which, during said year, carried on the business which said name implies, at Quebec.\nThere was a firm called Samson & Filion, at the same time in Quebec and, amongst other things, they dealt in second-hand goods out of which they sold, in March, 1919, a quantity of iron pipe of three different dimensions, to the said corporate company and when those in charge of its business come to use said piping an explosion took place which resulted in the death of one of its workmen.\nThe company being held liable under the Quebec Working Men's Compensation Act, to the extent of $2,560 for damages suffered by the legal representatives entitled to recover same under said Act, paid the same, and some costs.\nThe said incorporated company then brought an action against said firm of Samson & Filion, who in turn brought an action in warranty against appellant, and he in turn brought an action in sub-warranty against, the respondents, who carried on business in Ottawa, and, appellant says, were the parties from whom he had bought the goods he had supplied to Samson & Filion.\nThe courts below seem to have found it impossible to maintain the said lastly mentioned action, by reason of failure, on appellant's part, to identify the goods he claims respondent sold him, as those which came from Samson & Filion to the Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Company, Limited.\nAny goods of the kind sold by respondent to appellant were of the second hand class known as scrap and were of a mixed lot such as enabled the appellant to pick out piping of the size wanted by the shipbuilding company\u2014but whether the same he picked out is exceedingly doubtful. The law governing the question raised as to any warranty from the respondent, would be that of Ontario, for the bargain between the appellant and the respondent was actually made here in Ottawa, and for the goods to be put free on board the cars here, and then respondent's duty would end.\nThere is not pretended to have been any express warranty, and certainly, after reading the evidence of the said parties hereto,, there was none to be implied, according to the opinion I have formed.\nAnd in light of the evidence adduced as to our law relevant to such a dealing, I am surprised at this final stage of the course of litigation that has arisen, being continued so far.\nNot only do I hold that in applying our Ontario law (of which we must take judicial notice) to the relevant facts to be considered herein, the appellant has no ground to rest upon for its appeal here, but I also incline to agree with those in the courts below who doubt the identity of the goods in question herein with those sold by appellant to Samson & Filion.\nI would therefore dismiss this appeal here with costs throughout.\nAppeal Samson v. Davie Co. allowed with costs.\nAppeal Ziff v. Samson allowed with costs.\nAppeal Ziff v. Baker dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Samson & Filion: Langlais, Langlais, Godbout & Tremblay.\nSolicitors for Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co.: Belleau, Baillargeon, Belleau & Boulanger.\nSolicitor for Ziff: J.

S.C.R. 246 dist.\nThe principle of law that an immovable forming part of the public domain cannot be seized or alienated does not apply when that immoveable has been so incorporated by unlawful process.\nExcept in cases of donation, or abandonment or sale by mutual consent, a municipal corporation to become owner of real property must previously and under pain of nullity perform all the formalities required for expropriation proceedings, and unless these have been rigourously executed, the owner of the property, who has been dispossessed against his will, is not restricted to a claim for an indemnity, but he may revendicate his property by way of action p\u00e9titoire.\nAn immovable affected by an hypothec cannot be legally dedicated by the owner to the public; and, in such case, Arts. 1590 and 1591 C.C. do not apply.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 37 K.B. 399) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Laurendeau K.C. and St-Pierre K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Dugas K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court. (Anglin C.J.C and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Ferguson a poursuivi la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al pour se faire d\u00e9clarer seul et v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire d'une lisi\u00e8re de terrain faisant partie de certains immeubles situ\u00e9s dans le quartier C\u00f4te des Neiges de cette cit\u00e9, et portant les num\u00e9ros officiels 1, 2 et 3 de la subdivision du num\u00e9ro 162 du cadastre fait pour le village incorpor\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te des Neiges.\nIl pr\u00e9tend que la cit\u00e9 occupe et poss\u00e8de cette lisi\u00e8re de terre ill\u00e9galement et sans droit, et demande qu'elle soit condamm\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9vacuer, \u00e0 lui en remettre la possession int\u00e9grale et \u00e0 le restaurer dans la pleine jouissance de ses droits. A l'encontre des pr\u00e9tentions de Ferguson, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'a pas invoqu\u00e9 un titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle s'est content\u00e9e d'all\u00e9guer sa prise de possession \u00e0 la suite de pourparlers avec un M. Antoine Robert, au moment o\u00f9 ce dernier \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de la lisi\u00e8re de terre dont il s'agit. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, dans tous les cas, en tenant compte de cette prise de possession, tout ce que Ferguson pourrait exiger maintenant serait un montant repr\u00e9sentant la valeur de cette lisi\u00e8re. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que Ferguson n'avait pas \u00e9tabli son titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question; et, comme cons\u00e9quence, elle l'a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de son action.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi en appel (le juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9tant dissident) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, au contraire, que Ferguson avait acquis un titre \u00e0 la lisi\u00e8re de terre qu'il revendique; que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'en \u00e9tait jamais devenue propri\u00e9taire; qu'elle l'avait admis; et qu'elle avait m\u00eame reconnu le titre de Ferguson. En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour du Banc du Roi a infirm\u00e9 le jugement rendu par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance et elle a maintenu les conclusions de l'action.\nLe dossier est plut\u00f4t avare d'informations; et, avec le juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il faut regretter que les renseignements fournis \u00e0 la cour soient aussi restreints. Plusieurs faits essentiels auraient peut-\u00eatre donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la cause un aspect diff\u00e9rent, s'ils eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9s. Cela ne permet pas cependant de baser la d\u00e9cision sur des suppositions; et, en dehors des pr\u00e9somptions que l'on peut l\u00e9galement d\u00e9duire des faits connus, il est n\u00e9cessaire de demeurer dans le cadre limit\u00e9 des circonstances que les parties ont bien voulu d\u00e9voiler \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate.\nLe titre le plus ancien qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit remonte au 14 juin 1890. C'est un acte de vente par Octave Provost et autres \u00e0 Antoine Robert. Il importe d'en extraire la description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue, car l'on verra que les actes subs\u00e9quents ont tous proc\u00e9d\u00e9 par voie de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette description initiale. Elle se lit comme suit :\nUn emplacement compos\u00e9 et form\u00e9 des lots de terre portant les num\u00e9ros un, deux et trois de la subdivision officielle du lot de terre portant le num\u00e9ro cent soixante et deux (162-1-2 & 3) des plan et livre de renvoi officiels du cadastre pour le village incorpor\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te des Neiges, district de Montr\u00e9al, avec la maison et d\u00e9pendances construites sur les dits lots de subdivision, un et deux, avec droit pour le dit Robert et repr\u00e9sentants de mettre et tenir en tout temps un tuyau d'un pouce sur les lots num\u00e9ros cinq et six de la dite subdivision officielle, appartenant \u00e0 Z\u00e9phirin Lapierre ou repr\u00e9sentants, pour conduire l'eau de la source qui existe sur le dit num\u00e9ro six sur les dits lots num\u00e9ros un, deux et trois pour Futilit\u00e9 du dit Robert et repr\u00e9sentants lequel emplacement contient environ cinq arpents de superficie plus ou moins, et est born\u00e9 en front par le chemin public, et avec toutes les d\u00e9pendances y attenant.\nAntoine Robert, le 24 f\u00e9vrier 1905, par acte re\u00e7u devant ma\u00eetre Dunton, N.P., \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, s'est reconnu endett\u00e9 envers le r\u00e9v\u00e9rend Anthony Johnston Provost en la somme de $25,000 et le r\u00e9v\u00e9rend Henry en la somme de $21,000 qu'il promit leur rembourser dans les deux ans qui suivaient; et, comme garantie de ces obligations, il hypoth\u00e9qua, en faveur de The Royal Trust Company, de Montr\u00e9al, pour le compte des obligataires, plusieurs immeubles, parmi lesquels \u00e9tait compris celui qu'il avait acquis d'Octave Provost et autres le 14 juin 1890. Dans cet acte hypoth\u00e9caire, l'immeuble qui nous occupe est d\u00e9crit par les m\u00eames num\u00e9ros officiels que dans l'acte d'acquisition, avec l'addition suivante:\nas the whole is mentioned in the deed of sale consented to Antoine Robert by Octave Provost, and others, before M. J.A. Dorval, notary, on the fourteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety and registered in the registry office for the counties of Hochelaga and Jacques Cartier under no. 36, 261.\nLe 22 septembre 1906, Antoine Robert n'ayant pas rempli ses obligations, The Royal Trust Company fit signifier \u00e0 ce dernier une action dont les conclusions ses lisaient comme suit :\nWherefore plaintiff brings suit and prays that the defendant be adjudged to pay and to satisfy to it, in its said quality as trustee under the said act and deed of hypothec before Dunton, notary, under date of the 24th day of February, 1905, filed as plaintiff's exhibit P-I herein, and that the said property so hypothecated as aforesaid, and in detail described in paragraph 4 of the foregoing declaration, be seized and brought to judicial sale to the end that the plaintiff in its said quality may be paid by preference out of the price thereof, the said sum of fifty-eight thousand and seventy-four dollars and sixty cents, the whole with costs.\nUne discussion s'est engag\u00e9e devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, et \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'audition devant nous, sur la nature exacte de cette action.\nL'honorable juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, tout en admettant qu'il\nexiste une action appel\u00e9e personnelle hypoth\u00e9caire,\ndans notre droit, et que\nl'on peut combiner \u00e0 la fois les conclusions de l'action personelle pour obtenir un jugement de condamnation contre le d\u00e9biteur pour le paiement de la dette et les conclusions demandant le d\u00e9laissement qui caract\u00e9rise l'action hypoth\u00e9caire,\n\u00e9tait cependant d'avis que l'action du Royal Trust ne contenait pas les conclusions n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e comme une action hypoth\u00e9caire.\nL'honorable juge Dorion \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 la consid\u00e9rer comme\nune action personnelle hypoth\u00e9caire, malgr\u00e9 le doute que peuvent faire na\u00eetre ses conclusions \u00e0 peine suffisantes.\nL'honorable juge Tellier a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion qu'une partie des conclusions \u00e9taient celles \"d'une action r\u00e9elle\", parce que le Royal Trust r\u00e9clamait\nl'exercice d'un droit r\u00e9el qui lui appartenait sur la chose d'autrui (et que) le droit de faire vendre les immeubles hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s est de l'essence m\u00eame de l'hypoth\u00e8que. On peut exercer ce droit aussi bien contre le d\u00e9biteur personnel, quand il est d\u00e9tenteur, que contre un tiers-d\u00e9tenteur.\nIl r\u00e9f\u00e8re, dans ses notes, au sixi\u00e8me rapport des codificateurs, page 61, \u00e0 Ferri\u00e8re, Dictionnaire de Droit, verbo Hypoth\u00e8que, p. 1061, et \u00e0 Domat, tome 2, Hypoth\u00e8que, page 23.\nNous avons fait cette digression \u00e0 cause de l'importance que cette question a prise lors de l'argument; mais nous ne croyons pas devoir pousser davantage la discussion sur ce point, vu qu'elle n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la solution du litige. Le 25 avril 1908, le territoire, dans lequel se trouvait l'immeuble appartenant \u00e0 Antoine Robert et hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 en faveur de The Royal Trust Company, fut annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al qui s'engagea, entre autres choses, \u00e0 \u00e9largir le chemin de la C\u00f4te des Neiges par lequel cet immeuble \u00e9tait born\u00e9 en front (Statut de Qu\u00e9bec, 8 Ed. VII, c. 85, s. 1b, par. 3).\nLe 5 ao\u00fbt 1910, Antoine Robert offrit de c\u00e9der \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al\ntout le terrain n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9largissement \u00e0 prendre sur les lots dont il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire,\nparmi lesquels se trouvaient ceux qu'il avait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s en faveur de The Royal Trust Company. La superficie de la lisi\u00e8re de terre comprise dans cette offre y est mentionn\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant de 19,576 pieds. Le prix est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 soixante-quinze cents du pied pour\nla valeur du terrain et tous les dommages;\net les conditions suivantes sont stipul\u00e9es:\nJe fais cette offre sans garantie et sujette \u00e0 l'acceptation par les cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires, si la chose est n\u00e9cessaire.\nIl est entendu que je prendrai la cl\u00f4ture actuelle et que je la placerai dans sa nouvelle position \u00e0 mes frais. Cette offre est bonne jusqu'au 15\u00e8me jour d'ao\u00fbt 1910.\nAu moment de l'offre, l'action intent\u00e9e par The Royal Trust \u00e9tait encore pendante. Aucune explication de ce long retard n'est fourni par le dossier.\nLe 15 ao\u00fbt 1910, d\u00e9lai extr\u00eame accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al par Robert pour accepter son offre, la ville n'avait rien fait.\nMais le 15 septembre 1910, le bureau des commissaires a fait rapport recommandant l'acceptation de cette offre et que le maire et le greffier de la cit\u00e9 soient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 signer les contrats conform\u00e9ment au plan pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet par l'arpenteur-g\u00e9om\u00e8tre de la ville; et, le 27 septembre 1910, le conseil de la ville de Montr\u00e9al, ayant pris connaissance du rapport des commissaires, r\u00e9solut de l'adopter suivant sa forme et teneur.\nCe qui s'est pass\u00e9 par la suite est rest\u00e9 dans l'obscurit\u00e9.\nNous savons seulement que les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s n'ont pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du conseil. Elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9e \u00e0 Antoine Robert. Aucun acte de vente n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti. Ni l'une, ni l'autre des parties n'a fait la moindre d\u00e9marche pour qu'il le soit. Le prix de vente n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ni pay\u00e9, ni r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par Robert, ni offert par la ville. Le montant est rest\u00e9 dans la caisse municipale. On ignore s'il a continu\u00e9 de figurer dans les pr\u00e9visions budg\u00e9taires de la ville. On ne sait m\u00eame pas s'il est encore disponible soit en fait, soit en conformit\u00e9 avec les exigences de la charte.\nDans son plaidoyer, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ne nous dit pas ce qu'il en est advenu. Elle se contente de soumettre que, dans tous les cas, vu la prise de possession du terrain, Ferguson ne pourrait plus r\u00e9clamer qu'un\nmontant repr\u00e9sentant la valeur desdits lots.\nBien plus, comme nous aurons l'occasion de le voir plus loin, assign\u00e9e dans une saisie-arr\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \"ne rien devoir\" \u00e0 Robert.\nLe 23 d\u00e9cembre 1910, The Royal Trust Company obtint son jugement contre Robert devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. L'action \u00e9tait donc rest\u00e9e en suspens au del\u00e0 de quatre ans. Pourquoi? Nous l'ignorons. Il y a eu inscription en revision et le jugement initial fut confirm\u00e9 le 25 janvier 1913. Le dossier ne nous r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas si Robert avait produit un plaidoyer \u00e0 l'encontre de l'action.\nDans l'intervalle, la ville avait pris possession de la lisi\u00e8re de terrain. Mais elle ne s'est pas m\u00eame donn\u00e9 la peine de nous dire quand, ni comment. Il est clair cependant qu'elle devait poss\u00e9der toutes ces informations; et si elles \u00e9taient de nature \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer sa cause, elle seule devra en souffrir. Elle s'est born\u00e9e \u00e0 faire entendre un assistant-ing\u00e9nieur qui n'avait pas une connaissance personnelle des faits et qui n'occupait pas cette position lorsqu'ils se sont pass\u00e9s. Il nous dit, \"d'apr\u00e8s les rapports\", que le chemin de la C\u00f4te des Neiges a d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9largi en 1911 et que le macadam y a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 \"construit\". Il n'a\npas eu connaissance personnellement que la cit\u00e9 ait fait un acte de possession avant 1912 (et, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0), la cl\u00f4ture semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e.\nC'est sa conclusion, apr\u00e8s qu'il eut constat\u00e9:\nC'est comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e; il y avait deux broches, je pense, et les piquets semblaient se tenir \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s.\nNous n'en savons pas plus long. Cette version n'implique nullement que Robert a d\u00e9plac\u00e9 la cl\u00f4ture. Il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 important d'\u00e9lucider ce fait, puisque, dans son offre, Robert avait convenu :\nIl est entendu que je prendrai la cl\u00f4ture actuelle et que je la placerai dans sa nouvelle position, \u00e0 mes frais. S'il l'e\u00fbt fait, on eut pu en d\u00e9duire qu'il avait conclu le contrat avec la ville, malgr\u00e9 l'expiration du d\u00e9lai qu'il avait fix\u00e9 dans son offre. Mais le maigre renseignement fourni par l'assistant-ing\u00e9nieur de la ville s'accommode peut-\u00eatre mieux encore de l'id\u00e9e que les employ\u00e9s de la ville auraient tout simplement recul\u00e9 la cl\u00f4ture, en s'emparant du terrain pour faire le chemin, comme le sugg\u00e8rent ces \"deux broches\" avec piquets qui \"semblaient se tenir \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s\". Robert, pour placer la cl\u00f4ture \"dans sa nouvelle position\", eut sans doute install\u00e9 une cl\u00f4ture r\u00e9elle et solide.\nEn tout cas, il y avait l\u00e0 un point \u00e0 approfondir qui e\u00fbt pu \u00e9claircir la situation. Tel qu'il est, il peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 tout aussi bien comme un second acte d'empi\u00e8tement de l'appelante que comme un fait tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer une renonciation au d\u00e9lai par Robert. C'est dire qu'il reste inutile comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans la solution de cette cause.\nToute information sur les agissements de Robert \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0 fait absolument d\u00e9faut. Il n'y a pas l'ombre d'une preuve qu'il ait vu ou su que la ville s'\u00e9tait empar\u00e9e de son terrain. Nous ne savons m\u00eame pas ce qu'il est devenu; car il n'est plus question de lui par la suite. La pr\u00e9somption est qu'il s'est d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 de toute l'affaire, parce que l'hypoth\u00e8que consentie au Royal Trust absorbait toute la valeur de son immeuble, et d\u00e8s que le jugement e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en vertu de cette hypoth\u00e8que par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1910, le parti qui pouvait \u00eatre tir\u00e9 d'une vente \u00e0 la ville concernait plut\u00f4t les cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires, pour qui le Royal Trust agissait comme fiduciaire, et \u00e0 l'acceptation de qui Robert avait assujetti son offre \u00e0 la ville, \"si la chose \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire\".\nIl suffit de signaler que l'enqu\u00eate n'a d\u00e9voil\u00e9 aucun acquiescement m\u00eame tacite de la part de Robert \u00e0 l'empi\u00e8tement commis par la ville.\nLe Royal Trust a fait saisir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Robert par un bref de terris \u00e9mis le 15 avril 1913. Nous n'avons pas le proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie, mais nous avons l'avis de vente publi\u00e9 par le sh\u00e9rif, le 21 mai 1913. Il d\u00e9crit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui va \u00eatre vendue de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que dans l'acte originaire de Provost \u00e0 Robert, auquel d'ailleurs il r\u00e9f\u00e8re par le nom du notaire qui l'a re\u00e7u, la date, le num\u00e9ro d'enregistrement et le bureau o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9. La vente par le sh\u00e9rif a eu lieu le 26 juin 1913. L'acte est produit et suit textuellement la description de l'avis public et de la vente de Provost \u00e0 Robert, y compris la superficie qui demeure invariablement fix\u00e9e \u00e0 \"environ cinq arpents, plus ou moins\". The Royal Trust se porta adjudicataire.\nA la suite de cette vente, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al produisit entre les mains du sh\u00e9rif une r\u00e9clamation pour les taxes municipales dues pour les ann\u00e9es 1911 et 1912 sur la totalit\u00e9 des lots de Robert (sans restriction). Elle a admis en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e. L'on remarquera que ces deux ann\u00e9es sont subs\u00e9quentes \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle avait pr\u00e9tendu accepter l'offre de Robert et m\u00eame, \u00e0 sa prise de possession de la lisi\u00e8re de terrain.\nLe 15 juin 1921, The Royal Trust a vendu \u00e0 Ferguson la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 acquise \u00e0 la vente par le sh\u00e9rif; et, dans l'acte, la description est identique \u00e0 celle de tous les autres actes depuis Provost jusqu'au sh\u00e9rif.\nFerguson y est d\u00e9crit comme r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 London, Ontario.\nLe 20 juillet suivant, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, assign\u00e9e comme tiers-saisie par The Royal Trust tentant de collecter la balance de son jugement contre Robert (suivant l'allusion d\u00e9j\u00e0 faite plus haut), \"d\u00e9clare ne rien devoir\" \u00e0 Robert, mais en plus \"expose ce qui suit\":\nLe 5 ao\u00fbt 1910, Antoine Robert offre de c\u00e9der \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, tout le terrain n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'expropriation du chemin de la C\u00f4te des Neiges, pour la somme de $14,682, le terrain \u00e0 prendre sur les lots suivants, savoir :\n1. sur le lot no. 11, 13,919 pieds;\n2. sur le lot no. 162-3, 2,174 pieds;\n3. sur le lot 162-2, 1,862 pieds;\n4. sur le lot 162-1, 1,621 pieds, faisant un total de 19,576 pieds \u00e0 75c. du pied, comprenant la valeur du terrain et tous les dommages \u00e0 souffrir pour l'\u00e9largissement du chemin.\nLe 15 ao\u00fbt (\u00e9videmment une erreur pour \"septembre\"), 1910, un rapport du bureau des commissaires a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au conseil et adopt\u00e9 le 27 septembre, 1910, mais le d\u00e9fendeur a toujours n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de passer titre.\nEn 1912, le lot no. 11 soit 13,919 pieds a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 du Royal Trust Co. au prix de $10,000.\nLe 23 octobre 1913, le Royal Trust Co. est devenu propri\u00e9taire par vente au sh\u00e9rif des lots nos. 162, subd. 1, 162, subd. 2, 162, subd. 3 du cadastre de la C\u00f4te des Neiges, sur la personne d'Antoine Robert, en vertu d'un jugement en date du 13 d\u00e9cembre, 1910, confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision le 25 janvier 1913.\nLe 15 juin 1921, le Royal Trust a vendu \u00e0 Malcolm M. Ferguson, les lots 162-1, 162-2, 162-3 du cadastre de la C\u00f4te des Neiges. Cette d\u00e9claration est fort significative; mais on doit y signaler surtout l'information que le lot n\u00b0 11\na \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 par la cit\u00e9 du Royal Trust au prix de $10,000.\nOr, ce lot faisait partie de l'offre de Robert, en date du 5 ao\u00fbt 1910, comme la d\u00e9claration le dit elle-m\u00eame. Si la cit\u00e9 a cru devoir, plus tard, l'acqu\u00e9rir du Royal Trust, c'est donc qu'elle consid\u00e9rait elle-m\u00eame que la convention avec Robert n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. Et il est difficile de voir pourquoi les autres lots mentionn\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame offre seraient trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment.\nVainement, la cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendrait que cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9mane d'un simple employ\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que dans le cas de toutes les corporations; et c'est l'acte de la cit\u00e9 par son repr\u00e9sentant d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9.\nLa vente par le sh\u00e9rif avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e le 25 octobre 1913; celle du Royal Trust \u00e0 Ferguson le fut le 16 juillet 1921. Le certificat de recherches ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune autre inscription au bureau d'enregistrement.\nLa pr\u00e9sente action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e le 1er septembre 1921.\nVoil\u00e0, dans leur ordre chronologique, tous les faits que nous poss\u00e9dons.\nIl faut \u00e9videmment commencer par scruter le titre de Ferguson; car si l'intim\u00e9 ne peut d\u00e9montrer qu'il poss\u00e8de un titre, il ne peut discuter celui de l'appelante. C'est d'ailleurs ainsi qu'a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance, qui, \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le titre de Ferguson \u00e9tait nul, n'a pas pouss\u00e9 plus loin son investigation.\nNous sommes d'accord avec la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi pour dire que Ferguson a un titre \u00e0 la lisi\u00e8re de terrain en litige.\nEn remontant \u00e0 l'acte de vente de Provost et autres \u00e0 Antoine Robert (14 juin 1890), le plus ancien qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier, on trouve la description de l'immeuble comprenant alors d'une fa\u00e7on indiscutable la lisi\u00e8re dont il s'agit.\nCette description a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite dans l'acte hypoth\u00e9caire consenti par Robert au Royal Trust. A ce moment-l\u00e0 (24 f\u00e9vrier 1905), il n'\u00e9tait pas question de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et il est clair que les parties contractantes avaient en vue d'hypoth\u00e9quer tout le terrain que Robert avait acquis de Provost et autres. Partant de l\u00e0, \u00e0 moins de trouver dans la r\u00e9daction des actes subs\u00e9quents une restriction dans la description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (ce que l'on y chercherait en vain), il nous para\u00eet d'une logique in\u00e9luctable que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de laquelle The Royal Trust a pris des conclusions dans son action du 26 septembre 1906, celle qui a fait l'objet des jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour de Revision, puis de la saisie et de la vente judiciaires, celle que le sh\u00e9rif a entendu transmettre au Royal Trust comme adjudicataire et que ce dernier a ensuite vendue \u00e0 Ferguson, est identiquement la m\u00eame. The Royal Trust, en demandant dans son action contre Robert\nthat the property so hypothecated as aforesaid and in detail described in paragraph 4 of the foregoing declaration be seized and brought to judicial sale to the end that the plaintiff in its said quality may be paid by preference out of the price thereof, etc.,\ns'adressait de toute \u00e9vidence \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9grale, puisque cette d\u00e9claration date de 1906 et que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'est entr\u00e9e en cause qu'en 1910. C'est donc bien la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9grale, sans abstraction de la lisi\u00e8re occup\u00e9e par la cit\u00e9, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 int\u00e9grale sur laquelle portait son hypoth\u00e8que, que le Royal Trust a fait saisir et vendre en vertu des jugements qu'il a obtenus.\nCe raisonnement ne saurait \u00eatre entam\u00e9 par le seul fait que la description dans l'acte du sh\u00e9rif s'accompagne des mots: \"bounded in front by C\u00f4te des Neiges road\". C'est la m\u00eame id\u00e9e que la description du premier titre: \"born\u00e9 en front par le chemin public\". Les deux expressions ont en vue la m\u00eame limite; et cela est bien indiqu\u00e9 par l'addition dans la description\nas the whole is mentioned in the deed of sale consented to Antoine Robert by Octave Provost and others before Mr. J. A. Dorval, notary, on the fourteenth day of June, 1890, registered, etc., under no. 36261.\nCela r\u00e9sulte aussi du fait que la superficie mentionn\u00e9e est la m\u00eame dans l'acte du sh\u00e9rif et dans l'acte \u00e0 Ferguson que dans le titre de Provost \u00e0 Robert.\nLes mots: \"as the said property now subsists\", que l'on trouve dans le titre de Ferguson ne s'adressent ni \u00e0 la superficie, ni \u00e0 la description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais \u00e0 son \u00e9tat et \u00e0 sa condition. La vente comprenait\nthe house and other buildings thereon erected;\net c'est \u00e9videmment par rapport \u00e0 ces constructions que la clause a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e. Cela explique pourquoi personne n'y a attach\u00e9 d'importance et que l'attention n'y a \u00e9t\u00e9 attir\u00e9e, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, que lors de l'audition devant cette cour.\nEt ce n'est pas ainsi, non plus, que l'appelante a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le titre de Ferguson. Bien loin d'all\u00e9guer que ce dernier n'avait pas acquis cette lisi\u00e8re de terrain, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a admis implicitement que la vente du sh\u00e9rif, puis celle du Royal Trust \u00e0 l'appelant, incluaient cette lisi\u00e8re; et elle a pr\u00e9tendu que Ferguson n'y avait pas droit parce que ces deux ventes \u00e9taient nulles et ill\u00e9gales. C'est \u00e9galement le motif du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur ce point.\nCette ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 et cette nullit\u00e9 r\u00e9sulteraient de ce que la saisie et la vente judiciaires auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites super non domino quant \u00e0 la lisi\u00e8re de terrain dont la ville s'\u00e9tait empar\u00e9e, et par application des articles 613 et 699 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile.\nCette vente par le sh\u00e9rif a eu lieu le 26 juin 1913. En vertu de sa publicit\u00e9, une vente judiciaire doit \u00eatre tenue pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 connue de tous. En plus, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a, de fait, eu connaissance de celle-ci d\u00e8s qu'elle a eu lieu, puisqu'elle a remis au sh\u00e9rif sa r\u00e9clamation pour taxes dues par l'immeuble vendu. Or, ce n'est que huit ans apr\u00e8s, le 6 octobre 1921, que, dans son plaidoyer, elle attaque indirectement la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette vente. (Guyon v. Lionais[2].\nLe caract\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui s'attache, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 un titre provenant du sh\u00e9rif donne lieu de se demander si l'on peut de cette fa\u00e7on mettre en doute sa validit\u00e9. Puisque le d\u00e9cret purge m\u00eame le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (Pothier, 3e \u00e9d., Bugnet, v. 10, n\u00b0 638; Renaud v. Denis[3], Ville d'Outremont v. Cabana[4], en dehors du cas de proc\u00e9dure ultra vires, comme celles que cette cour eut \u00e0 examiner, par exemple, dans la cause de Lambe v. Armstrong[5], on ne devrait pas admettre sans une \u00e9tude approfondie qu'un titre du sh\u00e9rif soit absolument nul ab initio, qu'il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire, au moins, de le faire d\u00e9clarer nul par les tribunaux (Perrault v. Chevalier) [6], et qu'il ne faille pas pour cela s'adresser \u00e0 eux de la mani\u00e8re et dans les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus par les articles 784 et suivants du Code de Proc\u00e9dure (Pothier, 3e \u00e9dition, Bugnet, vol. 10, n\u00b0 658, p. 300, 2e al. et n\u00b0 659). L'arr\u00eat re Lambe v. Armstrong[7] est l\u00e0 comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour indiquer qu'il ne s'agit pas, dans ce cas, d'une simple question de proc\u00e9dure.\nMais nous voulons, pour le moment, mentionner seulement que cet aspect de la question ne nous a pas \u00e9chapp\u00e9 et que nous en r\u00e9servons la d\u00e9cision pour un cas o\u00f9 la solution du litige l'exigera. Cela ne se pr\u00e9sente pas ici, car nous sommes d'avis que la vente faite en l'esp\u00e8ce par le sh\u00e9rif ne saurait \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour l'unique raison invoqu\u00e9e par la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.\nSi, comme la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi le croit, l'action de Royal Trust contre Robert \u00e9tait une action hypoth\u00e9caire ou en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que, le jugement obtenu pouvait, sans l'ombre d'un doute, \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 sur l'immeuble affect\u00e9 par l'hypoth\u00e8que, sans tenir compte de la pr\u00e9tendue possession de la ville (Art. 614 C.P.C.; Arts. 2016, 2074 C.C).\nMais, ind\u00e9pendamment de la nature de l'action de Royal Trust contre Robert, il nous para\u00eet que le Royal Trust, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu jugement contre Robert, avait le droit, dans le cas actuel, de faire saisir et vendre la totalit\u00e9 des lots en question, comme immeubles de son d\u00e9biteur.\nLes biens du d\u00e9biteur sont le gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers et il est tenu vis-\u00e0-vis d'eux de remplir son engagement sur tous ses biens mobiliers et immobiliers, pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir (Arts. 1980, 1981 C.C.). Le cr\u00e9ancier qui a obtenu jugement contre son d\u00e9biteur peut faire saisir et vendre, pour satisfaire \u00e0 tel jugement, les biens meubles et immeubles de ce d\u00e9biteur (Art. 1585 C.C.; Art. 613 C.P.C.)\nIci, Robert rencontrait toutes les exigences pour que la saisie fut valide.\nIl \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 et il \u00e9tait r\u00e9put\u00e9 poss\u00e9der animo domini (Ville d'Outremont v. Cabana[8]. L'empi\u00e8tement de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e9tant peut-\u00eatre une d\u00e9tention de facto, mais certainement pas (comme nous nous proposons de le d\u00e9montrer) une possession de jure, ne pouvait faire obstacle \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la saisie et de la vente judiciaires.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, avec toutes les circonstances qu'elle connaissait et que nous avons \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es au commencement n'avait certainement pas, au sens juridique, une possession contraire \u00e0 celle de Robert. Elle ne pouvait ignorer le droit sup\u00e9rieur de Robert. Il y avait, chez elle, absence d'animus, comme l'a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9claration sur la saisie-arr\u00eat apr\u00e8s jugement. (Voir Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. Possession, nos 2, 3, 4).\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rons \u00e0 Pothier, 3e \u00e9dition Bugnet vol. 10, n\u00b0 526:\nLa saisie r\u00e9elle doit se faire sur le propri\u00e9taire de l'h\u00e9ritage ; une saisie faite super non domino est nulle. Observez n\u00e9anmoins qu'on entend par propri\u00e9taire, non pas seulement celui qui l'est dans la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais encore celui qui poss\u00e8de l'h\u00e9ritage animo domini, soit qu'il en soit v\u00e9ritablement propri\u00e9taire, soit qu'il ne le soit pas; car il est r\u00e9put\u00e9 l'\u00eatre, lorsque le v\u00e9ribable propri\u00e9taire ne r\u00e9clame point; ce qui suffit pour que la saisie faite sur lui soit valable et purge m\u00eame le droit du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire, s'il ne s'y oppose pas.\nEt Bugnet ajoute, dans une note:\nContre le propri\u00e9taire apparent, sauf le droit de revendication de la part du propri\u00e9taire v\u00e9ritable, qui pourra m\u00eame, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, demander la nullit\u00e9 de l'adjudication, v. art. 717 c. proc. par. 1, l'adjudication (sur saisie immobili\u00e8re) ne transmet \u00e0 l'adjudicataire d'autres droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que ceux appartenant au saisi.\nC'est dire clairement qu'une saisie ne sera pas nulle, si elle est pratiqu\u00e9e sur un possesseur animo domini, pour la seule raison qu'il ne serait pas le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire; sauf le droit de revendication r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier. Et cette doctrine de Pothier est \u00e9galement celle qui est enseign\u00e9e par Pigeau (vol. I, p. 779) et d'H\u00e9ricourt (Trait\u00e9 de la vente des immeubles par d\u00e9cret, tome premier, p. 47). Mais c'est dire \u00e9galement que la saisie sur le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire, en ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement qui l'a condamn\u00e9, est l'exercice normal du droit du cr\u00e9ancier sur son gage, au sens de l'art. 1981 du Code civil, et que jamais une vente judiciaire, \u00e0 la suite d'une pareille saisie, ne sera d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle \u00e0 la demande d'un usurpateur comme la ville de Montr\u00e9al, qui n'a m\u00eame pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de se servir de l'opposition \u00e0 la saisie.\nLa situation qui r\u00e9sulte du d\u00e9cret est bien expliqu\u00e9e dans le passage suivant du jugement de l'honorable juge Fournier re McGregor v. The Canada Investment and Agency Co.[9]. D'apr\u00e8s la loi et les d\u00e9cisions dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec la vente judiciaire accompagn\u00e9e des formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales donne un titre complet et absolu \u00e0 l'adjudicataire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue et purge tous les droits dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre grev\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'exception de l'hypoth\u00e8que r\u00e9sultant de la commutation des rentes seigneuriales, de l'emphyt\u00e9ose, des substitutions non ouvertes et du douaire coutumier non ouvert. Par l'art. 711 C.P.C. le d\u00e9cret purge tous les autres droits.\nComme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit plus haut, le testament McGregor ne contenant pas de substitution, la vente judiciaire a eu son plein et entier effet et a purg\u00e9 les droits du propri\u00e9taire faute d'avoir fait opposition \u00e0 la vente en temps opportun. On ne trouvera pas de d\u00e9cision de nos cours contraires \u00e0 ce principe mais on en trouve qui le soutiennent hautement.\nDans une cause de Patton v. Morin[10], o\u00f9 la nullit\u00e9 d'un d\u00e9cret \u00e9tait demand\u00e9e comme fait super non domino il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9: 1. que le d\u00e9cret purge un immeuble de tous les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, except\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire est lors du d\u00e9cret en possession de l'immeuble saisi super non domino; 2. que si au moment de la saisie de l'immeuble le vrai propri\u00e9taire n'en est pas en possession, il doit, pour conserver son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s'opposer \u00e0 la vente par les moyens ordinaires. Un des consid\u00e9rants de ce jugement est comme suit: \"Consid\u00e9rant que la vente judiciaire accompagn\u00e9e des formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales, doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e et ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e en droit sans porter atteinte \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 d'un titre accord\u00e9 par les mains de la justice, la cour maintient la d\u00e9fense du d\u00e9fendeur et renvoie l'action du demandeur.\"\nUn autre consid\u00e9rant affirme le principe que le demandeur aurait d\u00fb se porter opposant \u00e0 la saisie et vente du dit immeuble, mais qu'au contraire il a laiss\u00e9 vendre et adjuger le dit immeuble en justice sans formuler sa plainte et s'opposer \u00e0 la dite saisie et vente.\nIl s'agit ici d'un cas bien diff\u00e9rent de ceux de Dufresne v. Dixon[11] et V\u00e9zina v. Lajortune[12], sur lesquels la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a voulu appuyer sa d\u00e9cision dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nDans chacun de ces arr\u00eats, cette cour a reconnu \u00e0 celui qui, lors du d\u00e9cret, avait \u00e0 la fois le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession, le droit de revendiquer son immeuble contre l'adjudicataire \u00e0 une vente judiciaire faite sur la t\u00eate d'un saisi, non possidente i.e. qui n'\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas \"propri\u00e9taire apparent\", suivant l'expression de Bugnet.\nNous laisserons \u00e0 l'honorable juge Taschereau, qui a si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans la cause de Dufresne v. Dixon11 et dans la cause de McGregor v. The Canada Investment & Agency Co.[13] le soin d'indiquer lui-m\u00eame la distinction entre les deux:\nI am also of opinion that, as held by the court below, the plaintiff, being of age at the time of the sheriff's sale to the defendant (though I do not see what difference that makes), was bound then to oppose the sale and assert his right, if he had any; that his default to do so precludes him from now attacking the validity of the defendant's title, as this sale has been accompanied with all the formalities required by law, and as Craig upon whom it has been made was then in possession as proprietor of the said lot in virtue of duly registered authentic deeds. The case of Dufresne v. Dixon[14], cited by the appellant was totally different from the present one, as a reference to the report will clearly show.\nThere the sheriff had sold Mrs. Dixon's property to which she had a title and of which she was in possession, and so having both title and possession the sheriff's sale thereof against another person was annulled. Here the actual possession was in Devlin, but by the registry office the title was in Craig. Now, under these circumstances, Devlin's possession was Craig's possession. Upon Craig alone could that property be sold, as it was so sold. If at the period of the seizure of an immovable the proprietor is not in possession thereof he must, for the preservation of his rights of property, oppose the sale by the usual means. Such is the law as laid down in the case of Patton v. Morin[15], to which we must give application in the present case. Assuming that he had rights to this property the appellant has lost them by the sheriff's sale. Vigilantibus non dormientibus subvenit lex. In Rodi\u00e8re, Proc. Civ. (2 vol. p. 292) and B\u00e9riat de St. Prix (2 vol. p. 658), inter alias, the difference between the old and the new law in France on this subject is pointed out.\nDe m\u00eame, re V\u00e9zina v. Lafortune[16], V\u00e9zina, lors du d\u00e9cret contre Senneville, avait le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en son nom et il avait la possession de l'immeuble saisi et vendu pour la dette de Senneville. La cour, \u00e9tant d'avis que V\u00e9zina avait tout le temps continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, annula, \u00e0 sa demande, une saisie et une vente faites sur Senneville, en vertu d'un jugement condamnant Senneville, qui n'\u00e9tait pas en possession.\nDans chacun de ces arr\u00eats, elle a mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 un d\u00e9cret qui avait port\u00e9, suivant l'expression de Verdier (vol. 2, \"Transcription hypoth\u00e9caire\", n\u00b0 299),\nsur un bien qui n'\u00e9tait plus dans le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur\net qui avait suivi une saisie faite super non possidente. Elle l'a fait \u00e0 la demande du propri\u00e9taire ayant titre et possession.\nC'\u00e9tait appliquer le principe du droit d\u00e9 revendication que Bugnet reconna\u00eet plus haut et que l'on trouve \u00e9galement dans Pigeau (Proc\u00e9dure du Ch\u00e2telet, tome premier, p. 779):\nQuand on dit que le d\u00e9cret purge la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 non r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, cela ne s'entend que du cas o\u00f9 celui \u00e0 qui elle appartenait a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 en demeure de la faire conna\u00eetre; et il ne l'est pas, tant qu'on le laisse en possession de son bien, quand m\u00eame ce bien aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 compris dans la saisie-r\u00e9elle, les affiches, l'ench\u00e8re et toutes les poursuites. Bardet, tit. I, liv. I, c. 7, et apr\u00e8s lui d'H\u00e9ricourt, page 49, rapportent un arr\u00eat du 14 f\u00e9vrier, 1627, qui l'a ainsi jug\u00e9. C'est l'avis de Gourget, en son trait\u00e9 des Cri\u00e9es, et cela parait conforme \u00e0 la raison. Ce propri\u00e9taire, ne se voyant pas d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9, a d\u00fb croire naturellement qu'on ne pouvait le d\u00e9pouiller sans l'actionner, et il a pu ignorer que son bien f\u00fbt saisi, n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 averti d'une mani\u00e8re sensible et non \u00e9quivoque.\nMais il y a loin entre le cas o\u00f9, sur l'instance du propri\u00e9taire en possession lors du d\u00e9cret, ce dernier est mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 pour la dette d'une autre personne qui n'\u00e9tait pas en possession, et la demande actuelle de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, qui, n'ayant d'autre base que son usurpation, voudrait faire d\u00e9clarer nulle une saisie pratiqu\u00e9e sur Robert, v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire dont le titre est enregistr\u00e9, et une vente en ex\u00e9cution d'un jugement condamnant ce m\u00eame Robert \u00e0 payer une dette garantie par hypoth\u00e8que sur l'immeuble ainsi saisi et vendu. (Perreault v. Chevalier[17].\nNous sommes donc d'avis qu'il n'appartenait pas \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al de demander l'annulation de la saisie et de la vente judiciaires par lesquelles The Royal Trust a acquis la lisi\u00e8re de terrain en litige. Le titre conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e9tait r\u00e9gulier et valide; et Ferguson, qui d\u00e9tient ce titre du Royal Trust, a \u00e9tabli son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la lisi\u00e8re en question.\nIl va sans dire que nous n'\u00e9cartons nullement le principe de l'inali\u00e9nabilit\u00e9 du domaine public, dont il est trait\u00e9 avec tant d'autorit\u00e9 dans l'opinion dissidente de l'honorable juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Nous faisons simplement la distinction entre une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui est devenue l\u00e9galement une partie du domaine public et celle qui y a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e sans droit. Toute notre discussion jusqu'ici est bas\u00e9e sur notre opinion (qu'il nous reste \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper) que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'a jamais acquis de droits sur la lisi\u00e8re de terrain qui nous occupe. L'honorable juge Lafontaine est d'avis contraire; et c'est, en somme, cette divergence de vues sur ce point essentiel qui est \u00e0 la base de la diff\u00e9rence dans les solutions. Il ne para\u00eet \u00eatre entr\u00e9 dans l'id\u00e9e de qui que ce soit que la ville pouvait arbitrairement incorporer cette lisi\u00e8re dans son chemin et, par le fait m\u00eame, fermer la porte aux revendications ou \u00e0 l'exercice des droits des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, en vertu du principe de l'inali\u00e9nabilit\u00e9.\nDans l'arr\u00eat rendu par la Cour de Revision (Torrance, Papineau et Loranger JJ.) en La Banque d'Hochelaga v. Compagnie du Chemin de fer de Montr\u00e9al, Portland & Boston[18], on r\u00e9p\u00e8te jusqu'\u00e0 sati\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le rapport que la compagnie de chemin de fer avait pris possession \"avec le consentement des propri\u00e9taires\", et le fond du jugement est r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans le consid\u00e9rant suivant (p. 583) :\nConsid\u00e9rant que, si les propri\u00e9taires ne peuvent refuser de c\u00e9der la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de leurs terrains et d'en livrer la possession \u00e0 la compagnie, moyennant telle indemnit\u00e9, il ne leur est pas loisible d'en r\u00e9clamer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de s'en faire restituer la possession, lorsqu'ils ont volontairement laiss\u00e9 la compagnie prendre possession du sol et y asseoir son chemin de fer; et que la seule chose qu'ils puissent l\u00e9galement demander alors est l'indemnit\u00e9, qui est cens\u00e9e repr\u00e9senter, tant pour eux que pour leurs cr\u00e9anciers, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'ils avaient et dont ils ont ainsi laiss\u00e9 prendre possession.\nAvec la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous sommes d'avis que les circonstances \u00e9tablies dans la cause actuelle ne permettent pas de dire que Robert a volontairement laiss\u00e9 la ville prendre possession de son terrain.\nEt m\u00eame une corporation municipale ne saurait fonder son titre sur une simple usurpation\u2014sauf si elle persiste assez longtemps pour atteindre la p\u00e9riode de la prescription acquisitive.\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ne r\u00e9clame pas la prescription; et, d'ailleurs, il est \u00e9vident que la dur\u00e9e de sa pr\u00e9tendue possession ne le lui permettrait pas.\nLe fait est qu'il est difficile, \u00e0 l'examen de son plaidoyer, de savoir exactement en vertu de quel titre elle affirme ses pr\u00e9tentions.\nElle all\u00e8gue l'offre de Robert, les r\u00e9solutions du bureau des commissaires et du conseil, et sa prise de possession.\nElle ne tente pas de justifier cette possession par l'abandon ou \"d\u00e9dication\" du propri\u00e9taire. Il est clair, d'apr\u00e8s les circonstances expos\u00e9es au d\u00e9but, qu'elle essaierait vainement d'abriter ses droits derri\u00e8re cette doctrine. Robert ou The Royal Trust n'ont jamais eu\nl'intention de donner au public le droit de jouir de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme chemin, (Brodeur J. re Gauvreau v. Page[19]. Voir aussi Anglin J. re Harvey v. Dominion Textile Co.[20], 59; et Mignault J. re Gauvreau v. Page19, p. 198.\nD'ailleurs, l'existence de l'hypoth\u00e8que du Royal Trust e\u00fbt emp\u00each\u00e9 tout abandon efficace de la part de Robert. Quelle que soit la port\u00e9e des articles 1590 et 1591 du code civil, ils exigent au moins une vente forc\u00e9e ou une expropriation. Un simple abandon du propri\u00e9taire ne saurait pr\u00e9valoir contre les droits hypoth\u00e9caires d'un tiers, qu'il ait ou non commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 les exercer au moyen d'une action hypoth\u00e9caire ou d'une action en d\u00e9claration d'hypoth\u00e8que.\nIl ne reste donc \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al qu'une pr\u00e9tention possible, et ce serait qu'elle aurait achet\u00e9 de Robert la lisi\u00e8re de terrain en question.\nDisons tout de suite qu'il n'y a pas eu d'expropriation et qu'on n'en a m\u00eame pas commenc\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures.\nLes statuts 8 Ed. VII, c. 85, s. 1, par. 3 et 1 Geo. V, c. 48, s. 3, n'ont rien ajout\u00e9 aux droits de la ville. Ils n'ont fait que lui imposer l'obligation d'\u00e9largir le chemin de la C\u00f4te des Neiges ; mais ils ne lui ont conf\u00e9r\u00e9, pour ce faire, aucuns pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux. Il y est dit seulement que, si elle est forc\u00e9e d'avoir recours \u00e0 une expropriation, elle devra proc\u00e9der en vertu de la loi 54 Viet., c. 38. C'est la loi d'expropriation, applicable (sauf exceptions) \u00e0 toute la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et qui, en 1909, s'est trouv\u00e9e incorpor\u00e9e dans les articles 7581 et suivants des statuts refondus.\nPour les besoins de cette cause, il suffit de signaler que, m\u00eame si elle avait adopt\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures en expropriation, la ville, en ce qui concerne la possession du terrain, e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gie par les articles suivants de la loi:\n7595. Sur le paiement ou l'offre l\u00e9gale de l'indemnit\u00e9 ou de la rente annuelle adjug\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie qui y a droit, ou sur le d\u00e9p\u00f4t en cour du montant de cette indemnit\u00e9 en la mani\u00e8re ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e, la sentence arbitrale donne \u00e0 la partie en faveur de laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, le pouvoir de prendre possession imm\u00e9diate des terrains, et d'exercer les droits ou de faire les choses pour lesquelles l'indemnit\u00e9 ou la rente annuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. Si quelque r\u00e9sistance ou opposition est faite \u00e0 la prise de possession de tels terrains ou l'exercice de tels droits, le juge peut, sur preuve satisfante de la sentence arbitrale, adresser son mandat, au sh\u00e9rif du district ou \u00e0 un huissier, suivant qu'il le trouve convenable, pour mettre en possession la partie qui y a droit et pour faire cesser toute r\u00e9sistance ou opposition,\u2014ce que doit faire le sh\u00e9rif ou l'huissier, en prenant avec lui l'assistance suffisante.\nLe juge ne doit accorder ce mandat que lorsqu'un avis du temps et du lieu auxquels la demande lui en est faite a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 dix jours d'avance au propri\u00e9taire du terrain, au curateur s'il est absent, ou \u00e0 la personne ayant droit d'en passer titre translatif, ou ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat dans le terrain \u00e0 exproprier.\n7596. Un cautionnement doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 par un d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans une banque constitu\u00e9e en corporation d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par le juge, d'une somme suffisante \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, pour d\u00e9frayer l'indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et tous les frais de proc\u00e9dure sur l'incident.\n7597. La requ\u00eate, le mandat de possession, le certificat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 et tous autres documents se rapportant \u00e0 telle proc\u00e9dure incidente, doivent rester dans les archives de la cour sup\u00e9rieure du district o\u00f9 telle proc\u00e9dure est faite, et un registre sp\u00e9cial de telle proc\u00e9dure est tenu par le protonotaire.\nNulle partie du d\u00e9p\u00f4t ou de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui en provient ne doit \u00eatre rembours\u00e9e ou pay\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie, ni pay\u00e9e au propri\u00e9taire du terrain, sans un ordre du juge, qui est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9mettre.\n7598. Tout propri\u00e9taire qui n'est pas pay\u00e9 int\u00e9gralement, en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais, du montant qui lui est accord\u00e9 par la sentence arbitrale, dans deux mois de la reddition de cette sentence, peut exercer son recours contre la personne, compagnie ou corporation, pour recouvrer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et la possession de son terrain ou de son droit, par action civile ordinaire dans laquelle il peut demander les dommages que de droit.\nMais, comme il n'y a pas eu d'expropriation, il faut chercher dans le code civil ou dans la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al le principe du droit que cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tend s'arroger ici.\nIl n'y a certainement pas eu vente de Robert \u00e0 la cit\u00e9. Sans doute, le consentement des parties \u00e9tait suffisant, et le seul fait que Robert eut \"n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de passer titre\" n'\u00e9tait pas concluant. Mais, sans prononcer d'opinion sur l'obligation de traiter avec les cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires (qui pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une des conditions de l'offre de Robert), il fallait pour que la vente f\u00fbt \"parfaite\" (Art. 1472 C.C.) que l'acceptation de la cit\u00e9 f\u00fbt manifest\u00e9e ou communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 Robert. Cela n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait; et ce motif du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi nous para\u00eet bien fond\u00e9.\nIl n'y a aucune preuve que Robert ait eu connaissance de la r\u00e9solution par laquelle la cit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendait accepter. Et, \u00e0 supposer qu'il e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre li\u00e9 par la publicit\u00e9, il est \u00e0 remarquer que les r\u00e8glements de Montr\u00e9al sont suivis d'un avis public (art. 301 de la charte), mais rien n'exige la m\u00eame chose pour une r\u00e9solution; et aucun avis de celle dont il s'agit ne para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9. Il y a cependant une objection encore plus s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante. La r\u00e9solution de son conseil municipal n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e que le 27 septembre 1910. Or, Robert avait mis dans son offre la stipulation suivante :\ncette offre est bonne jusqu'au 15eme jour d'ao\u00fbt 1910.\nIl s'ensuit que, lorsque la ville a pr\u00e9tendu accepter l'offre, cette derni\u00e8re n'existait plus. Au moment de son acceptation, la ville ne pouvait plus contraindre Robert. On n'a qu'\u00e0 se demander si, dans les circonstances, la ville e\u00fbt pu poursuivre Robert en passation de titre. La r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative s'impose.\nFerguson a le droit d'opposer \u00e0 la ville ce d\u00e9faut d'acceptation en temps utile, puisque, ayant lui-m\u00eame un titre \u00e0 la lisi\u00e8re en question, il peut se pr\u00e9valoir des d\u00e9fauts du pr\u00e9tendu titre que la cit\u00e9 lui oppose.\nIl n'y a donc pas eu de vente de Robert \u00e0 la ville. Cela dispense de se demander si une pareille vente, au cas o\u00f9 elle aurait exist\u00e9, aurait eu le caract\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur d'invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'article 1590 du code civil.\nMais pr\u00e9tendrait-on que Robert, par sa conduite subs\u00e9quente, peut \u00eatre tenu pour avoir renonc\u00e9 au d\u00e9lai qu'il avait fix\u00e9 dans son offre ou au droit qui lui appartenait de recevoir un avis d'acceptation de la ville?\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, cette renonciation ne pourrait s'induire que de son silence, car, comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, la preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le de sa part aucune d\u00e9marche post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son offre. Depuis ce moment-l\u00e0, il dispara\u00eet compl\u00e8tement.\nEn droit, nous d\u00e9ciderions que pareille renonciation implicite de la part de Robert ne pourrait \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e au Royal Trust, cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, ni au titre du sh\u00e9rif r\u00e9sultant d'une vente judiciaire provoqu\u00e9e par ce cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire.\nEn fait, la position de Robert \u00e9tait aux antipodes de celle de Michaud v. City of Montreal jug\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9[21]. A supposer que les principes servant de guides \u00e0 une \"Court of Equity\", qui paraissent avoir inspir\u00e9 le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans cette cause, puissent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 un litige r\u00e9gi par la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, il reste que Michaud \u00e9tait maire de la cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve, lorsque le conseil municipal avait adopt\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution par laquelle elle acceptait son offre; que non seulement il avait eu ainsi pleinement connaissance de cette r\u00e9solution, mais qu'il avait m\u00eame initial\u00e9 le projet de contrat pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite par le notaire repr\u00e9sentant la cit\u00e9; et qu'il \u00e9tait encore maire, lorsque Maisonneuve prit possession de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\nand proceeded to throw it into a public way, to pave it and otherwise to fit it for the public use.\nIl avait donc, on peut le dire, particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la prise de possession par la ville. Dans ces circonstances, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 non pas m\u00eame que la ville \u00e9tait devenue propri\u00e9taire par suite de sa prise de possession, mais que nos tribunaux\nwill not permit a man, afterwards, to assert his title to the land in question.\nEt lord Cave ajoute (p. 418) :\nA point was made by the counsel for the appellant based on the formalities required for the exercise of the compulsory powers to take land given by the statute law; but those formalities cannot be applicable to a case like the present, where there was no compulsory taking, but a gift of the land.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui avait conclu dans le sens confirm\u00e9 plus tard par le Conseil Priv\u00e9, avait dit m\u00eame en pr\u00e9sence de faits aussi probants que ceux de cette cause de Michaud v. Cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve[22], par la bouche du juge-en-chef Lamothe :\nIl nous faut trouver, dans le dossier, un abandon clair et non \u00e9quivoque de ce terrain, sinon le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9; sinon nous devrons appliquer l'art. 407 du C. civ., qui dit que personne ne peut \u00eatre force de c\u00e9dar so propri\u00e9t\u00e9, si ce n'est moyennant une juste et pr\u00e9alable indemnit\u00e9.\nLa donation \u00e9tait compl\u00e8te par la r\u00e9solution du conseil de ville, r\u00e9solution \u00e0 laquelle M. Michaud avait donn\u00e9 son plein assentiment. M. Michaud ne peut reprendre aujourd'hui une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il a abandonn\u00e9e au public et \u00e0 la ville de Maisonneuve.\nMais en dehors d'un cas de donation ou d'abandon ou de vente de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9, les tribunaux de Qu\u00e9bec n'ont jamais dispens\u00e9 les corporations municipales\nd'accomplir au pr\u00e9alable les formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par l'expropriation,\net ce, avec rigueur et sous peine de nullit\u00e9. On peut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 Deal v. The Corporation of Phillipsburg[23], La Corporation du canton Nelson v. Lemieux[24], Doyon v. La Corporation de la paroisse de Saint-Joseph[25], Holton v. Callaghan[26], Corporation du comt\u00e9 de Dorchester v. Collet[27], King v. Corporation de la partie nord du Township d'Irlande[28], Walsh v. Corporation de Cascap\u00e9diac[29].\nDans la cause de Compagnie du chemin de fer Central v. Legendre[30], la Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que:\nUn propri\u00e9taire a un recours direct par action p\u00e9titoire contre une compagnie de chemin de fer qui se serait mise en possession d'un terrain pour sa voie ferr\u00e9e, sans le consentement du propri\u00e9taire et sans lui faire d'offre pr\u00e9alable pour le terrain ainsi occup\u00e9.\nEt encore plus r\u00e9cemment, dans la cause de Canada & Gulf Terminal Ry. Co. v. McDonald[31] la m\u00eame Cour du Banc du Roi a jug\u00e9:\nLa prise de possession d'un terrain par une compagnie de chemin de fer pour la construction de sa voie, avec la tol\u00e9rance du propri\u00e9taire, ne prive ce dernier, tout au plus que des recours en complainte ou en r\u00e9int\u00e9grande. Il conserve le droit d'exercer l'action p\u00e9titoire et de revendiquer le terrain, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par la compagnie de l'indemniser selon la loi.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 approuv\u00e9 ces principes dans son arr\u00eat re City of Montreal v. Hogan[32], o\u00f9 l'honorable juge Taschereau, plus tard juge-en-chef, rendant le jugement unanime de la cour, dit \u00e0 la page 5:\nThat the respondent has been illegally dispossessed of this property and that he is entitled to revendicate it cannot now be controverted by the appellants. A municipal corporation, it is needless to say, has no right to acquire real property except in the cases and in the manner provided by the statute from which it derives its powers.\nDans cette cause de City of Montreal v. Hogan (1)\nthe officers of the corporation had taken possession of the land, made a macadamized roadway over it, removed sidewalks, electric light poles, etc., back to the new line of the street, and opened it to public traffic;\ncependant la d\u00e9cision fut (p. 5) :\nWe order judgment to be entered declaring the respondent proprietor of the property in question and ordering the appellant to put him, the respondent, in due possession thereof in the same state as it was when they took possession of it, within fifteen days after the signification of this judgment.\nL'affirmation de l'honorable juge Taschereau, qu'une corporation municipale\nhas no right to acquire real property except in the cases and in the manner provided by the statute from which it derives its powers\npourrait se r\u00e9clamer de ces deux articles du code civil:\n399. Les biens appartiennent ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat, ou aux municipalit\u00e9s et autres corporations, ou enfin aux particuliers. Ceux de la premi\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce sont r\u00e9gis par le droit public ou par les lois administratives.\nCeux de la seconde sont soumis \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards pour leur administration, leur acquisition et ali\u00e9nation, \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles et formalit\u00e9s qui leur sont propres.\nQuant aux particuliers, ils ont la libre disposition des biens qui leur appartiennent sous les modifications \u00e9tablies par la loi.\nOn voit la distinction que fait l'article, au sujet du \"droit public\", entre les biens de l'Etat et ceux des municipalit\u00e9s.\n404. Les biens des municipalit\u00e9s et des autres corporations sont ceux \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou \u00e0 l'usage desquels ces corps ont un droit acquis.\nAux deux articles du code civil, ajoutons les articles suivants de la charte de Montr\u00e9al, qui \u00e9taient en vigueur lors de la prise de possession et n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9s qu'en 1914, c'est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s la vente du sh\u00e9rif, en l'esp\u00e8ce:\n419. La cit\u00e9 n'ouvrira, n'\u00e9largira et ne prolongera aucune rue, ruelle, voie ou place publique \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit indiqu\u00e9e et projet\u00e9e sur le dit plan g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la cit\u00e9, ou ne soit comprise dans quelque modification ou addition faite \u00e0 ce plan; ni \u00e0 moins que deux mois au moins ne se soient \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis la confirmation par la cour sup\u00e9rieure ou par un juge d'icelle de tel plan, modification ou addition; et l'ouverture, l'\u00e9largissement ou le prolongement d'une rue, ruelle, voie ou place publique ne sera commenc\u00e9, ou n'aura lieu, ou n'aura d'effet \u00e0 moins que les formalit\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s prescrites relativement au mode d'expropriation ne soient strictement, observ\u00e9es, ni \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit pourvu au co\u00fbt de l'am\u00e9lioration projet\u00e9e et au paiement de tous les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats et indemnit\u00e9 qui pourront \u00eatre payables ou exigibles, y compris les frais de toutes les proc\u00e9dures s'y rattachant.\n420a. Toutes les rues priv\u00e9es ou ruelles ouvertes \u00e0 l'usage du public, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme immeubles imposables, tant qu'elles n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement c\u00e9d\u00e9es \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 et mises sous son contr\u00f4le.\nEn pr\u00e9sence de ces dispositions expresses de sa charte et pour toutes les raisons que nous avons expos\u00e9es, il nous para\u00eet impossible de maintenir les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelante. Le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi qui nous est soumis contient un ordre exactement semblable \u00e0 celui de cette cour, dans la cause de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Hogan[33] ; et nous sommes d'avis que ce jugement est bien fond\u00e9.\nNous ne partageons pas la crainte exprim\u00e9e, ici, par l'appelante \u00e0 l'audition que ce jugement soit difficile d'ex\u00e9cution (art. 541 C.P.C.) sous pr\u00e9texte qu'il ne d\u00e9finit pas suffisamment les bornes de la lisi\u00e8re revendiqu\u00e9e. La chose est bien simple: la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al devra remettre ce dont elle s'est empar\u00e9e. Nul mieux qu'elle ne doit savoir ce que cela comporte. D'ailleurs sa d\u00e9fense \u00e9crite (par. 7 et 9) indique qu'elle sait exactement de quoi il s'agit; et elle n'aura, pour compl\u00e9ter son information, qu'\u00e0 r\u00e9f\u00e9rer soit\nau plan pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par John R. Barlow et dat\u00e9 novembre 1909\nmentionn\u00e9 dans l'offre de Robert, soit au rapport de son arpenteur-g\u00e9om\u00e8tre, Charles Laberge, annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution de son bureau des commissaires en date du 15 septembre 1910, soit au\nplan produit par la d\u00e9fenderesse montrant la partie des lots en litige.\nCependant, nous ne devons pas oublier que l'effet du jugement est d'ordonner \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al de livrer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 la possession d'une lisi\u00e8re de terrain qui, dans le moment, fait physiquement partie d'une rue publique ; que, en plus, en vertu des statuts d'annexion, la cit\u00e9 est tenue de porter cette rue \u00e0 sa largeur actuelle. Pour cette raison, nous croyons que la rigueur du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi peut \u00eatre att\u00e9nu\u00e9e. Nous nous inspirons des principes pos\u00e9s par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Parkdale v. West[34] et dont le tr\u00e8s grand nombre pourraient trouver ici leur application. La Cour du Banc du Roi a fix\u00e9 \u00e0 quinze jours de la signification du jugement le d\u00e9lai pendant lequel la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al devra \u00e9vacuer le terrain et en livrer possession \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9; elle avait le pouvoir d'\u00e9tendre ce d\u00e9lai (arts. 579 et 610 C.P.C.). Nous nous servirons de ce pouvoir et accorderons un mois \u00e0 l'appelante afin de lui permettre de conclure un arrangement avec l'intim\u00e9 ou de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'expropriation requise pour obtenir l\u00e9galement la possession et le titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la lisi\u00e8re de terrain en litige. Sauf cette modification, le jugement a quo doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant never either bought or expropriated the land herein in question.\nThere were some negotiations between it and one Robert, the owner of the equity of redemption, but they never produced anything creating a final result conferring a right on appellant to enter on the premises. And when the mortgagees attempted to get at the supposed price, the appellant rightly denied that it owed anything in regard thereto.\nIt, therefore, in entering thereon, was a mere trespasser, and has never been anything else. Hence the whole of the fabric of claims it makes herein is unfounded. The facts upon which other points have been argued do not, under such circumstances, support the contention put forward by the appellant's counsel herein.\nThe cases of Dufresne v. Dixon[35], and V\u00e9zina v. Lafortune[36], have not the slightest resemblance in the fundamental facts in question therein to those of the facts in question herein. Hence they cannot affect my opinion above expressed, in the consideration of the facts as presented herein.\nI may speak with deference as to the other leading point argued by counsel as to what constituted an hypothecary action, for my brother Mignault J. (better versed in the code than I am), seemed to be inclined to accept the meaning put forward by appellant's counsel.\nMr. Lafleur, arguing for respondent, convinced me that his view was the correct one. And unless the words \"hypothecary action\" are to be restricted in a way that I cannot maintain when considering their use in many articles of the code, I cannot agree with the pretensions of the appellant in that regard.\nHence, as I see them, the many other minor features presented by appellant's counsel cannot avail it. Indeed most, if not all, fall as soon as the relevant facts are correctly interpreted as, for example, the use of the words describing the land in question.\nThere has never been any legal highway constituted over that part of the land in question and hence the pretension that the respective descriptions, in the sheriff's deed to the Royal Trust Company, and by the latter to the respondent, in the respective references to the grantors in said deed to the C\u00f4te des Neiges road, as pretended to exist to-day, are wholly unfounded in law. Indeed the expressions used therein are quite incapable, I submit, of meaning anything else than the boundary of that road as it existed before the trespasses of the appellant.\nAnother question arises out of the pretensions of the meaning of the words \"hypothecary sales,\" for I find, on reference to the Act enabling the appellant to act, and indeed requiring it to act, by way of expropriation in default of obtaining a title by negotiation expressly direct, such expropriation to be made by virtue of the Act, 54 Vict., c. 38, and not by the terms of the charter of the appellant city.\nWhen we turn to the Act we find it expressly recognizes the rights of hypothecary creditors, and that the amount fixed by arbitration must, if the title cannot be cleared up otherwise, be deposited with the prothonotary. See the article 5754s therein, and those preceding it in that statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jarry, Damphousse, Butler & St. Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott & David.\n[1] [1924] Q.R. 37 K.B. 399.\n[2] [1874] 27 L.C.

V, c. 20; 9 Geo. V, c. 53 (N.B.)\nBy the Intoxicating Liquor Act of New Brunswick, 1916, liquor was sold by licensed vendors; by an amendment in 1919 control of the business by the Crown through a board was authorized, such board being permitted to take over the stock of liquor held by the licensees of whom the Canadian Drug Co. was one, who were required, on request, to furnish a statement of the stock in hand or in transit with the prices paid and other particulars, the value to be based on such statement or, if that could not be done, to be determined by a method agreed upon. Upon payment therefor the liquor should become the property of the Crown. The Amending Act came into force on April 18, 1921, and the operating board was appointed on the same day; on May 10 the Customs duty on liquor was increased; the parties agreed on the value of the liquor of the Canadian Drug Co. except on the point as to whether or not the increased duty should be added to the value and the amount of the sales tax or any interest should be allowed; the liquor was delivered to the board in June and July and paid for in October subject to the above mentioned rights as to value. Held, that the value of the liquor should be determined as of the date at which delivery was made and the Drug Co. was entitled to the increased duty.\nHeld also, that the case must be treated as one of purchase and sale in which the vendor is entitled to be paid the amount of the sales tax on the price.\nHeld further, that the vendor was not entitled to interest either on the purchase price or the amount of the sales tax.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThis appeal is from the judgment on a case stated for the opinion of the court below. The stated case is as follows:\u2014\n1. The defendant is the Board created under and by virtue of Act of Assembly, 9 George V, 1919, chapter 53. The Board was constituted by Order in Council dated April 18, 1921.\n2. The plaintiff previous to and at the time of the passing of the said Order in Council was a wholesale licensee authorized to sell intoxicating liquors under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916.\n3. On or about the twenty-first of June, 1921, the plaintiff delivered to the defendant two thousand six hundred and fifty-six cases of liquors under the terms of the said Act, containing approximately five thousand three hundred and twelve gallons, and on or about the twenty-fifth day of June, 1921, delivered to the defendant eight hundred cases of liquor then being held in bond, and other smaller lots were also taken over by the defendant at a later date.\n4. Subsequent to the payment by the plaintiff of the customs duties on said two thousand six hundred and fifty-six cases of liquor, and while the same were still in plaintiff's possession and before delivering same to the defendant, namely, on or about the tenth day of May, 1921, the duty on intoxicating liquor was increased by the Dominion Parliament to ten dollars per gallon on the strength of proof.\n5. The defendant through the Lieutenant-Governor in Council paid the plaintiff the sum of eighty-one thousand six hundred and eighty-two dollars and seventy-two cents 10th October, 1921, for the purpose of satisfying the plaintiff's claim for the said liquors, and which sum the plaintiff received without prejudice to his claim herein. The said sum was made up as shown in the schedules annexed hereto and marked \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C,\" the sum allowed for duty being based upon the rate in force previous to May 10, 1921.\n6. At the time the goods were entered for duty by the plaintiff it was still carrying on its business as a wholesale licensee. Looking to the taking over of said goods the following letters were written by the defendant to the plaintiff dated the 18th April, 1921; 7th May, 1921; and 16th May, 1921; and by the plaintiff to the defendant dated the 13th May, 1921, copies of which are attached hereto marked \"D,\" \"E,\" \"F\" and \"G.\"\n7. That the plaintiff continued in business until the 15th July, 1921, for its export business and until the 30th June, 1921, for its local business.\n8. The question to be determined by the court is whether the plaintiff is entitled to be paid under said Act, 9 George V, chapter 53, the value of the said liquors at the time they were taken over by the defendant or the value of the said liquors prior to the increase in the Canadian duty to ten dollars a gallon. If the court is of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to be paid the value of the said liquors at the time of delivery to the defendant, judgment will be entered for the plaintiff for twenty-four thousand seven hundred and fifty-five dollars and sixty-four cents and interest thereon to date of judgment, if the court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to interest, and twelve hundred and ten dollars and sixty-three cents sales tax thereon and interest on said sales tax to date of judgment (if the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to interest and sales tax), together with costs. If the court is of opinion that the plaintiff is not so entitled judgment will be entered for the defendant with costs.\nThe material statutory provisions are set out in the judicial opinions published herewith.\nTaylor K.C. for the appellant.\nHughes K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Rinfret JJ.), was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014A question of law is here submitted in the form of a special case stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick under the provisions of Order XXXLV, Rule 1, Judicature Rules of New Brunswick, which provides that the parties to any cause or matter may concur in stating the questions of law arising therein in the form of a special case for the opinion of the court; that every such case shall concisely state such facts and documents as may be necessary to enable the court to decide the questions raised thereby, and that the court shall be at liberty to draw from the facts and documents stated any inferences, whether of fact or law, which might have been drawn therefrom if proved at the trial.\nThe special case, which is dated 17th December, 1923, consists of eight paragraphs, as follows. See page 24.\nBy the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916, of New Brunswick, c. 20, the sale of intoxicating liquor in the province, except by licensees, was generally prohibited, and provision was made for the issue of wholesale and retail licences for the sale of liquor in the quantities permitted or for specified purposes. The licences were granted by the provincial Secretary-Treasurer to the licensees, and for the warehouses or stores occupied by them respectively. They were to expire on 1st May in each year, which date, by the amendment now to be mentioned, was changed to 31st October. By the amending Act, c. 53 of 1919, it was provided that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council might take over and conduct the business of the wholesale vendors in the province licensed to sell liquors under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, and that he might appoint a board of three persons to represent him in carrying out the provisions of the Act. It was stated in the argument that when the amending Act came into operation there were in the province only three wholesale licensed vendors. The appellant company was one of these.\nBy ss. 3, 4 and 5 of the last-mentioned Act it is provided as follows:\u2014\n3. Each of the wholesale licensees shall, upon request in writing, deliver to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council a correct list of the stock of liquor on hand held by him, as well as any liquor purchased prior to the delivery of such request and in actual transit at the time, together with a statement of the true prices paid for each item of liquor mentioned in such statement, and in every case in which any such liquor has been purchased subject to a discount or allowance of any kind the same shall be correctly set forth in such statement, which shall be signed by the licensees, the object being to enable the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to arrive at the actual value of the whole stock on hand or in transit as aforesaid, and the said value so arrived at, with the cost of the freight added, together with the value of any equipment hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed to be the purchase price of such liquor and equipment.\n(a) Should there be any part of the stock on hand the value of which cannot be determined as aforesaid, such other method of fixing its value shall be adopted as may be mutually agreed upon.\n(b) Any necessary equipment used by the licensee in carrying on such business may be purchased by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council at a price to be either mutually agreed upon or determined by valuation.\n4. Upon payment over to the vendor of the amount of the purchase price by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council the said liquor enumerated in such list with the equipment, if any, shall forthwith become the property of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and all right and title thereto shall thereupon be vested in the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as trustees free of all claims whatsoever, and the licence held by such vendor under the said Act shall thereafter be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\n5. The right of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to import, buy and sell liquor for the purposes of this Act or the Intoxicating Liquor Act, shall be as full and ample in all respects as the right of a licensee licensed under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, and any proceedings incident thereto or connected in any way with any matter or thing authorized or permitted by this Act to be done or performed may, with the consent of the Attorney General, be taken by any court of law or otherwise In the name of the said board representing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThese sections belong to a group which, it is declared by s. 11, shall be read with and as part of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916, and it is also provided that all enactments inconsistent therewith shall be deemed to be repealed. Section 13 is as follows:\u2014\n13. All liquor used, sold or kept for sale in the province of New Brunswick, either by doctors, dentists or licensees, shall be purchased from the board representing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nBy the following section, 31st October is substituted for 1st May, as the date of the expiry of the licences.\nThe amending Act was passed on 17th April, 1919; the material sections were to come into force by proclamation which was subsequently issued, and the board was constituted by order in council of 18th April, 1921. Thereupon the chairman of the board wrote the appellant company, by letter dated 18th April, referring to the Act and stating that an order in council had been passed appointing the board, or commission, as it is called in the correspondence, and stating that at a regular meeting of the commission the chairman had been directed to request the wholesale vendors to submit a statement of the estimated amount of liquor as defined by the Act which they would have in stock on 1st May, 1921, and requesting the appellant company in accordance with this order to furnish him\nwith full information of the amount of stock you would be able to turn over to the Commission on the 1st proximo enumerating the brands and also the sale prices to us,\nadding that the board was very desirous to obtain this information at the earliest possible moment. The letter concludes with a statement that the writer expected to be in St. John on 20th April to arrange a meeting of the commission there, and that he would be pleased to meet a representative of the appellant company \"who could give the quantity of stock on hand and the prices thereof.\" This letter obviously had in view negotiations between the parties for sale of goods to be delivered on 1st May at prices to be stipulated. There is in evidence another letter of the chairman to the appellant company dated 7th May, which reads as follows:\u2014\nFredericton, N.B.,\nMay 7, 1921.\nThe Canadian Drug Co.,\nSt. John, N.B.\nGentlemen: I would draw your attention to my letter of the 18th of April, wherein I requested you to deliver to me a statement showing the stock of liquor which you would have on hand on May 1, 1921. I would also make reference to my conversation with you in St. John, April 20, regarding the same subject. I regret very much to say that this statement has not yet been received by me.\nIn accordance with the Intoxicating Liquor Act amended as passed April 17, 1919, I would request that you deliver to me a correct list of the stock of liquor on hand, held by you, as well as any liquor bought by you and which is in actual transit. I shall also require a statement of the true prices paid for each item of liquor mentioned in your statement, and any other case in which any such liquor has been purchased subject to a discount or allowance of any kind. In addition to this value you may state the cost of freight on those purchases.\nThe above statements are urgently required by our board, in order that the necessary arrangements may immediately be made for the taking over of your stock, to effect the cancellation of your wholesale licence, and to begin the functioning of the board, as required by law.\nI am enclosing a copy of the above mentioned Act for your information, and would particularly draw your attention to section 3 contained therein. Trusting to receive the statement as requested by registered mail without further delay, I remain,\nYours very truly,\nChairman.\nNew Brunswick Board of Liquor Commissioners.\nThe answer of the appellant company, which is dated 13th May, is as follows:\u2014\nMay 13, 1921.\nHon. J. F. Tweedale,\nChairman of the Board of Liquor Commissioners,\nFredericton, N.B.\nDear Sir: We have your favour of the 7th (which is unsigned by you), and note your remarks contained therein. When the writer personally met you with Mr. Bently and Mr. McGuire on your last visit to St. John and discussed this matter, at that time he asked you if you desired list of stock on hand at the present time and if you were prepared to take over and pay for it then; your reply was that you were not in a position to take over any stock as you wanted to be equipped for doing business and you had no money to pay for same. The writer asked you when you would be in a position and your reply was not before the middle of June or July and you asked writer if we would have sufficient stock to start you in business at that time; his reply to you then was if you would give us definite date when you would start in business, when you would be prepared to take over stock; your reply was that, after the Commission came back from Montreal you would have another interview with him and in the meantime you asked him if he would write you giving you all the information possible with regards to the liquor business, etc., in New Brunswick, you would appreciate it very much; on account of absence and pressure of business the writer has not been able to do this, but he understands you will be here on Tuesday when we will submit list of our stock and prices.\nYours truly,\nAnd to this the chairman replied, under date of 16th May, as follows:\u2014\nFredericton, N.B., May 16, 1921.\nThe Canadian Drug Co., Ltd.,\n72 Prince William Street,\nSt. John, N.B.\nGentlemen: I have your favour of the 13th inst., and in reply would say that I expect to be in St. John to-morrow (the 17th inst.), when I shall personally take up with you the subject matter to which you make reference in your communication.\nI regret very much that our letter of the 7th inst. to you was inadvertently mailed without my signature, but I am enclosing you another which is duly signed by me to replace the original, and is for your retention please.\nYours very truly,\nJ. F. Tweeddale,\nChairman.\nNew Brunswick Board of Liquor Commissioners. The office of the board was at Fredericton and that of the appellant company at St. John, and it was therefore from Fredericton and St. John that these letters were respectively despatched. The 7th May, 1921, fell on a Saturday, but whether or not the chairman's letter of that date was received before 10th May is not stated. I shall assume however that it was received on the 9th, as that would be in ordinary course of the post if the letter were posted on the 7th.\nThis letter closed the correspondence and it is apparent that no agreement had at that time been reached. It was intended, as the chairman's last letter states, that the discussion should be continued on the occasion of his visit to St. John on the following day.\nIt is not stated that the appellant company at any time complied with the request of the board of 7th May to deliver a correct list of the stock of liquor on hand and in actual transit with a statement of the true prices paid for each item, and cost of freight thereon, although the list which bears date 21st June, to which I shall refer, contains this information, in addition to other particulars, with regard to the liquor which was taken over by the board on 21st and 25th June. The statement required by letter of 7th May, as therein explained, had for its purpose that arrangements might immediately be made for the taking over of the stock and to effect cancellation of the plaintiff's wholesale licence, and so that the board might begin its operations as required by law, but the letter contains no express intimation that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council proposed to exercise any faculty of decision with which he may have been endowed by the statute to arrive at or determine the actual value of the stock. In fact neither the actual value nor the cost could be arrived at upon evidence of the true prices paid plus freight under the provisions of the first paragraph of s. 3, because the stock in hand of the appellant company had, for the greater part, been imported by the company, which had paid thereon large amounts for customs duty in addition to freight, insurance, and other items of expense contributing to the cost and to the value. It is matter of plain inference that the parties met at St. John after the chairman's letter of 16th May, and it is stated that, on or about 21st June, the board received and took over from the appellant company a large part of the latter's stock on hand according to the list of that date, in which were set out the various items and opposite thereto the invoice prices including freight, insurance, etc.; the rate of duty paid; the total amount of customs duty; and the wharfage and cartage per case. It appears from this statement that duty had been paid upon each item except one, namely, 800 cases Old Orkney, which had been imported at a cost, including freight, insurance, etc., wharfage and cartage, of \u00a32,423.12.9, converted into Canadian currency, rate of exchange 4.40, at $10,664.02; the Old Orkney was in bond, and there was in the statement no charge for duties upon it. The total value figured according to this statement is $64,941.47.\nAll the liquors mentioned in this list were delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant on 21st June, except the 800 cases of Old Orkney, which were delivered on 25th June.\nSubsequently the remainder of the appellant company's stock was taken over on different days from 5th July to 27th July, when the last delivery was made.\nThe question for decision is not very aptly framed; it is as follows:\u2014\nThe question to be determined by the court is whether the plaintiff is entitled to be paid under said Act, 9 George V, chapter 53, the value of the said liquors at the time they were taken over by the defendant or the value of the said liquors prior to the increase in the Canadian duty to ten dollars a gallon.\nNow the plaintiff is by strict interpretation not entitled to be paid anything under the said Act; it is only by virtue of the proceedings authorized by the Act, or by agreement which the parties are by the Act empowered to make, that the plaintiff can in a sense be entitled to payment under the Act. The Act itself does not bind the Government to acquire the stock of any vendor although it authorizes the acquisition by the exercise of the powers which the Act confers. The object of the question is, however, sufficiently plain. It is put in view of the facts stated and the inferences to be drawn therefrom; for while mere questions of fact cannot be raised upon a special case, Burgess v. Morton[2], the court may nevertheless draw proper inferences of fact which have not been specifically admitted when these are not inconsistent with and reasonably follow from the facts stated; this power is expressly recognized by the rule.\nThe question has in contemplation the necessity of determining whether the value of the liquor, actually acquired by and delivered to the board for the purposes of the Act, is to be ascertained as of a time before the customs duty was increased, and the date of the increase is accepted as decisive of the point of time at which, as an admitted fact, the liquor took on an additional value of $24,755.64, for the reason that after the appellant company had paid the customs duty upon the greater part of its imported stock, the rate of duty imposed upon the like goods was raised by the Customs Tariff Amendment Act, 1921, which, although not sanctioned until 4th June, declared by s. 4 that these duties shall be deemed to have come into force on 10th May, and to have applied to all goods imported or taken out of warehouse for consumption on or after that day, and to goods previously imported for which no entry for consumption was made before that day.\nThe parties, by the correspondence and by the negotiations which ensued, were endeavouring to arrive at the actual value of the goods, and they succeeded except as to the incidence of the value which the goods acquired on 10th May. The difficulty which they encountered in coming to an agreement upon the question submitted, as they did upon the other questions presented by their negotiations, appears to have arisen from the fact that the respondent considered that, either by operation of the statute or by the effect of what was done in pursuance of its provisions, the law required that the valuation should proceed as of a date previous to 10th May, and, if so, that the accession of value on that date would not belong to the appellant. Now while the Act of 1919 plainly contemplates, as the justice of the case requires, that a licensee shall be compensated for his stock on hand when acquired by the board, and that the compensation shall be a purchase price based upon the actual value of the goods, there is no express provision of the Act, and so far as I can perceive no implied provision, requiring that the value shall be fixed otherwise than with regard to the goods actually acquired, and as the value exists at the time of the acquisition.\nThere are several dates which figure in the case. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 1916 of the province, under which the appellant company was licensed, was passed on 29th April of that year; it was proclaimed on 18th April, 1921; the board representing the Lieutenant-Governor in the Board representing the Lieutenant-Governor in Council for the administration of the Act was appointed also on 18th April, 1921; there are the three letters in evidence which have been quoted, dated respectively 7th, 13th and 16th May, 1921; there is the date when the Customs Tariff Amendment came into operation, 10th May, 1921; there are the dates when the liquor in question was delivered, 21st and 25th June, 1921; there is the date when the liquor was paid for, 10th October, 1921, and, finally, there are the dates, 30th June, 15th July, and 31st October, 1921, respectively, when the appellant company ceased to do local and export business and when its licence was to terminate under the provisions of the Act of 1919.\nOf these dates, that of the passing of the Act of 1916 can have no effect because that is the Act under which the appellant was licensed and which provides for the carrying on of his trade as a licensed vendor. Neither can the assent to the amending Act of 1919, nor the date of its proclamation, be taken as the date for ascertaining the value because, without mentioning other reasons, that Act in itself, while it authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to take over the stock, does not require that he shall do so. The chairman's letters of 7th and 13th May do not, for reasons to be stated, impose any obligation upon the board nor upon the appellant, except it may be to require the latter to furnish a list with prices of its stock on hand for the consideration of the Lieutenant-Governor; it is admitted by the case, and explained by the correspondence, that this request was not complied with previously to 10th May, and the only list in the case is that of 21st June, when the duty-paid goods mentioned therein were delivered. Section 3 provides alternative methods of fixing value ; it may be arrived at by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, if he proceed in due course of the law to ascertain and declare the value, or the valuation may be fixed by such other method as may be mutually agreed upon; but moreover by s. 5 it is affirmed that the right of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to buy liquor for the purposes of the Act shall be as full and ample in all respects as the right of a licensed vendor under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, and the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor, which are exercised by the board, to acquire liquor for the purposes of the Act, either from licensees or others, whether or not they include power to acquire compulsorily, are therefore not limited in any manner which would exclude authority to purchase. It follows from the admissions that the liquor in question was acquired by the board, by authority of the legislature and by the appellant's consent, on and not before 21st June, 1921, when the delivery was made on terms of a price to be paid. The parties agreed that the price which the appellant had paid for the goods, the customs duties actually paid, the freight and insurance, and the minor charges which entered into the actual cost should be figured in the value; but the board, while admitting that the value of the goods was enhanced by an amount equivalent to the increase of customs duty, rejected the appellant's claim to be compensated for that, because it seems to have been considered by the board that this accretion of value took place only after the board had acquired the property, or the right to it.\nIt was suggested at the argument that the compensation to be paid was to include the actual value of the goods in so far only as the value did not exceed the cost; but by the admissions it is not the value, but the title to it, which is in dispute; it is expressly admitted that the value of the liquors was at the time of delivery greater by $24,755.64 than it was before 10th May. There is no sug gestion that the value was advanced or diminished after 10th May; and therefore the question must be answered favourably to the appellant unless, by the operation of the statute of 1919, or by the effect of the letter of the chairman of the board of 7th May, a time previous to 10th May is limited beyond which increase in the value of the goods would not accrue to the benefit of the licensed vendor.\nOne of two methods of determining the value, so far as it was determined, must have been adopted; either, first, by judicial finding of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the first paragraph of s. 3; or secondly, by agreement In my judgment the stated facts are very suggestive of an inference that when the parties came together they realized that the project of taking over the liquors was one which should be arranged by negotiation and agreement, and that it was by that method that the board acquired the stock; but that question is, for the present purpose, immaterial, because in either case the question here submitted was expressly reserved. If the Governor in Council found and declared the value, he did so after 10th May, and in like manner if the parties negotiated for sale at a price, their negotiations were concluded after 10th May.\nThe learned judge at the trial was of the view that the statute, c. 53 of 1919, operated as a notice to treat; and, applying the rule laid down in Rex v. Hungerford Market Co.[3], and subsequent decisions under the Land Clauses Act of 1845, found that the passing of the Act on 17th April, 1919, or the proclamation of it which followed, created an obligation upon the Government to acquire and upon the licensees to acquiesce in proper steps for the acquisition, leaving nothing to be determined but the actual value of the goods or the purchase price, which ought to be ascertained as of the coming into force of the Act; or, if the Act in itself did not so operate, that the letters written by the chairman of the board on 18th April and 7th May had the effect of determining the time of taking, and therefore he concluded that the compensation should be measured by the value as of a date not later than 18th April, or certainly not later than 7th May. Grimmer J., in the Appeal Division, disagreed with this view holding that the Act did not provide for compulsory taking, and that neither the proclamation of the statute nor the correspondence in proof was effective to define the time for ascertainment of value or purchase price. Nevertheless he reached a result in conformity with that at which the trial judge had arrived upon the view that the licensee was entitled to receive only the cost of the goods, and that the cost had not been affected by the increase of duties. White J., while also of the opinion that the claim failed, considered that the taking was compulsory, and the learned Chief Justice, while agreeing in the result, expressed no reasons.\nThe statute itself, as has been said, contains no mandatory provision that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall take over the stock in trade of a licensee; he may or may not give notice calling for a list of the stock and the prices paid therefor with the object of arriving at the actual value; but even if such notice be given, it would appear that the licensee may nevertheless carry on his business as usual and dispose of his stock, or acquire new stock, and that his licence is to remain in operation until his entire stock shall have been taken over and paid for, or until 31st October, when the licence would by its own terms expire.\nThe letter written by the chairman of the respondent board to the appellant company of 7th May is the only communication from the board which might upon any possible interpretation have statutory effect. It does include a request conveyed, as is said,\nin accordance with the Intoxicating Liquor Act amended as passed April 17, 1919,\nthat the appellant deliver to the chairman a correct list of its stock of liquor on hand and in transit with a statement of the true price paid for each item, and it is said that in addition the cost of the freight may be stated; but the statute of 1919 provides for none of the steps to be taken by either party consequent upon demand for particulars of goods and prices such as were directed to follow upon notice to treat by the legislation which was considered in the cases upon which the learned trial judge relies, and in which it was held that the notice when given by corporations or trustees for public purposes, not directly representing the Crown, is of binding effect. Obviously there could be no proceedings, against the Crown or against the board in its capacity as exercising the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to compel any action in consequence of the notice. The Crown was not bound to proceed to determine the value in the execution of any statutory powers; it gave no express notice of an intention to do so; and, its determination of the value, if any, took place after 10th May, and was provisional and subject to the question submitted by the case. Therefore in my view, notwithstanding the chairman's letter of 7th May, whether or not it was received before 10th May, the appellant company retained the jus disponendi of its stock in trade unimpaired by any right which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council or the board had acquired in consequence of that letter.\nIn The Queen v. The Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, Forests, etc,[4], the Commissioners of Woods and Forests had given notice to a landowner under the powers of an Act for forming a royal park (9-10 Vict., c. 38) that they required his land for the purposes of the Act, and he had in consequence sent in his claim for compensation, to which the commissioners did not agree and he accordingly required to have a jury summoned to assess the amount, which they refused to do; the landowner obtained a mandamus commanding the commissioners to summon a jury, and the return stated that they acted only on behalf of Her Majesty under the provisions of the Act; that they had expended or appropriated the value of the funds which they had been able to raise; that they had no means of raising any further sums at present; and that they gave notice to the claimant and others only for the purpose of ascertaining what sum would be required to purchase the lands for the purposes of the Act, and to determine whether its objects could be effected, and that it seemed probable that the sum which they were authorized to expend would be exceeded.\nThe observations of Patteson J., pronouncing the judgment of the court, are apposite, and the present case seems to fall within them so far as concerns the effect of the notice. The learned judge said:\nIf this were the case of a railway or other private company, no doubt the return would be insufficient because, notice having been given that the lands were required, and a claim sent in accordingly, a contract is entered into, and the parties stand in the relation of vendor and purchaser. If the company had not the means of paying for the lands, they should have abstained from giving notice to the owner. But a private company to whom an Act is granted for their profit differs materially from commissioners appointed under a public Act to do on behalf of the executive government certain things for the benefit of the public; and the principle that imposes liabilities upon a private company, as arising in consideration of the statute granted to them, has no application in the case of such public commissioners. There may be reason for holding a notice to treat for a purchase, when given by a private company which has the option of taking land, to be a declaration of their option to take, and a contract or purchase, of which this court will compel specific performance, making the obligation on such a company reciprocal with the obligation on the landowner. But, in the case of commissioners for the public having a limited power of taking land provided the required quantity can be obtained for a given sum, a notice to treat for the purchase should be construed to be that which it is; the commissioners cannot ascertain whether the land can be obtained for a price unless they treat for the purchase. There is a duty under the statute to open the treaty; but it would defeat the intention of the legislature if the opening of a treaty was held to be the completion of the contract.\nSteele v. Corporation[5]; Birch v. The Vestry of the Parish of St. Marylebone[6].\nAppellant owned the goods and had the same right to be paid for them, upon delivery, which an ordinary vendor of goods possesses; the statute provided that, upon payment of the purchase price to the vendor by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the liquor should become the property of the latter; if the statute provided for expropriation, and the goods were acquired in that manner, the appellant came under no obligation previously to 21st June when the provisional statement of value was made up and the goods delivered; if the transaction was a sale it was not completed until after 10th May. In the interval the property and the risk were the appellant's. It is admitted that the goods had then increased in value by an amount stated, and in my judgment it does not admit of doubt that the whole value was the appellant's asset for which the appellant was entitled to be paid. The appellant received from the Lieutenant-Governor in Council on 10th October, 1921, in respect of the liquor in question, $64,941.47, and by admission should be paid $24,755.64 more if, in the opinion of the court the appellant was entitled to be paid the value of the liquor at the time of delivery to the respondent. In my view the appellant was so entitled.\nWhat I decide as matter of law in response to the question submitted is that neither the statute nor anything done under it, nor any of the facts admitted or to be inferred, operated to deprive the appellant company, on or before the 10th May, of any right or title which it theretofore had to the liquor delivered to the board on 21st June, and from this it follows that the appellant was on 10th May solely entitled to any value which was at that time represented by the goods.\nThere are two subordinate questions as to interest and sales tax.\nInterest is payable only by statute or by contract. In re Gosman[7]; it is not payable as damages for detention of debt. London, Chatham & Dover Ry. Co. v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[8]. The provisions of the New Brunswick Judicature Act, ss. 24-26, cited at the argument, do not, in my view, impose a liability for interest; neither is there any contract for the payment of interest, and the claim for interest therefore fails.\nAs to the sales tax, upon the assumption that the transaction between the parties should be regarded as a sale of the goods by the appellant to the respondent, no reason is suggested why this sale was not subject to the tax. The only compulsory power which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council possessed to acquire the goods was under section 4, whereby it is provided that the liquor shall forthwith become the property of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council upon payment by him to the vendor of the purchase price. In fact, although the liquor was delivered by the appellant to the respondent board on 21st and 25th June, the price was not paid until 10th October following, and in the interval I should think that the Government was indebted to the appellant in the amount of the purchase, for the price of goods sold and delivered. It may be true that the vendor was influenced in the arrangement by the fact of the legislation under which the licenses were to be terminated, and by which the board was empowered to take over the stock in hand of the licensees, but if the parties reached an agreement, as I think they did, it would still be an agreement notwithstanding the conditions which operated to bring about the relationship of vendor and purchaser.\nThe appeal should be allowed and, in accordance with the submission, judgment should be entered for the appellant for $25,966.27, together with costs throughout. Idington J.\u2014The appellant was licensed under the \"Intoxicating Liquor Act, 19.16,\" of New Brunswick, to sell by wholesale intoxicating liquors in said province in manner therein provided, and had been engaged in carrying on said business under said Act for some considerable time prior to the amending Act, 9 Geo. V, chapter 53, by which the legislature changed its system of using such licensed wholesale dealers for one substituting a board such as the respondent to carry on the like business as appellant and another had been doing to supply retail dealers.\nThe appellant in the course of carrying on said business had acquired a considerable quantity of intoxicating liquors. It evidently was the expectation of the legislature that the licensed wholesale dealers, seeing their substitute designed to take over the business, would be glad to sell their stock of liquor to the board to be created under said amending Act, and they made no imperative provision in the way of expropriating the stocks of liquor held by any such licensed wholesale dealers, but enacted as follows:\u2014\n1. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the Province of New Brunswick may take over and thereafter conduct the business of the wholesale vendors in this province, licensed to sell liquor under the \"Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1916.\"\n2. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may appoint a board of three persons to represent the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in carrying out the provisions of this Act.\n3. Each of the wholesale licensees shall, upon request in writing, deliver to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council a correct list of the stock of liquor on hand held by him, as well as any liquor purchased prior to the delivery of such request and in actual transit at the time, together with a statement of the true prices paid for each item of liquor mentioned in such statement, and in every case in which any such liquor has been purchased subject to a discount or allowance of any kind the same shall be correctly set forth in such statement, which shall be signed by the licensees, the object being to enable the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to arrive at the actual value of the whole stock on hand or in transit as aforesaid, and the said value so arrived at, with the cost of the freight added, together with the value of any equipment hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed to be the purchase price of such liquor and equipment.\n(a) Should there be any part of the stock on hand the value of which cannot be determined as aforesaid, such other method of fixing its value shall be adopted as may be mutually agreed upon.\n(b) Any necessary equipment used by the licensee in carrying on such business may be purchased by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council at a price to be either mutually agreed upon or determined by valuation. 4. Upon payment over to the vendor of the amount of the purchase price by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council the said liquor enumerated in such list with the equipment, if any, shall forthwith become the property of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and all right and title thereto shall thereupon be vested in the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as trustees free of all claims whatsoever, and the license held by such vendor under the said Act shall thereafter be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nThere was a correspondence stated by the said respondent board, in April, 1921, shortly after its creation, with the appellant, looking for the information it and others of like licensees were respectively bound, by said section 3 above quoted, to furnish respondent.\nMisapprehension on the part of the appellant, partly through a blunder on the part of respondent's manager failing to sign his letter, and the absence in Quebec of those composing the board (or the more active members thereof), in quest of knowledge from those in the latter province well qualified by experience to give them information bearing on the new functions of the respondent, caused delay in compliance with said section 3.\nI cannot see the importance that counsel for respondent saw fit to attach thereto.\nIt is self-evident, I imagine, that a lapse of time must inevitably take place before the respondent could get into a position to carry on, and appellant meantime must unless a great many people were to be put to needless inconvenience. And the time for the licence to run had not expired.\nBoth parties hereto seem to have acted very reasonably after due allowance is made for the first misadventure I have referred to.\nIt so happened that all said section 3 requires was complied with, and then the appellant, as entitled to do, pointed out that by reason of the Dominion Parliament having doubled its tariff on such liquors that inevitably raised their actual value in New Brunswick beyond the original cost, and that the actual value prior thereto of the liquor in question could not be held by any fair-minded person at the same price as paid for them before the said increased tariff was enacted.\nHence the parties hereto differed, and could not agree upon the \"actual value.\" Why not? Surely in the actual condition of things in Canada, he who in Canada had bought before the increased tariff had got something which, by that increase of tariff rate, became automatically worth, in actual market value, that much more. For he who had not had the foresight to look ahead and buy, must pay, when driven to buy in any open Canadian market, the cost price before the increase in tariff plus the new increase in tariff.\nThis result of changes in tariff affecting \"the actual values\" (which I hold means market values) of goods in general use, is so obvious and so well known and recognized that I am surprised to find any difficulty in correctly appreciating it.\nIf the tariff instead of being doubled had been obliterated, the actual value of the goods in question would have become that much less in value, and the appellant would inevitably have lost that much.\nIt is nothing new to find business men looking ahead and trying to measure the trend of public opinion and its probable effect on legislators possessed of the power to change the tariff up or down.\nAnd for that very reason astute governments having the power of doing so maintain, on such a question when the acute stage is reached, absolute silence, and the change is made suddenly so that all will be treated fairly.\nOf course if the tariff is moved up he having a large stock of goods will be counted lucky, but if down unfortunate.\nThe parties hereto not being able to agree on this single point settled all others according to the provisions above quoted, and left this point unsettled, but without prejudice to the appellant claiming for more if it could show an increase in way of actual value arising out of said incident.\nThe appellant then sued respondent for same and some other causes, and, like sensible men, agreed upon a stated case, which is set forth as follows (in which the exhibits named are not included). See page\nThis case was duly submitted to the court in New Brunswick and was heard by Mr. Justice Barry, whose decision was against the appellant, following a train of reasoning which, with great respect, I cannot follow. He seems to proceed upon the theory, from the authorities he refers to, that this is a case of expropriation.\nYet he, after citing many such, speaks as follows:\u2014\nExcepting only that they refer to the compulsory taking of lands instead of goods the authorities which I have quoted seem to me to be exactly applicable to the circumstances of the present case, for I can see no reason for the application of any different rule of compensation on the case of goods compulsorily taken from that applied in the case of lands. The plaintiff was not, it is true, obliged to part with its stock of liquors, but having parted with them and handed them over to the board representing the Government, it must be taken to have parted with them upon the terms and conditions stipulated in the Act and upon no other.\nThe learned trial judge thus expressly admits, and correctly so, that the plaintiff, now appellant, was not obliged to part with its stock of liquor.\nWith that admission the authorities he cites and upon which he founds his judgment can, I respectfully submit, be of no service in determining the issues in question herein.\nFor aught I can discover I see no reason in law why appellant could not have shipped its entire stock to Quebec and got from the Liquor Commission there the prices prevalent after the raising of the tariff.\nI submitted that proposition to counsel arguing herein, but got no reason, nor any pretence that in law it was impossible.\nOf course in such event it might be out the freight.\nOn appeal to the New Brunswick Court en banc Mr. Justice Grimmer, who was the only member of said court writing at length, was very emphatic in his view that the case could not be treated as one of expropriation.\nHe seems, however, to have reached the same conclusion by a process of reasoning that, I respectfully submit, I cannot adopt in the interpretation and construction of section three, above quoted from the said amending Act.\nThe expression therein of\nthe object being to enable the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to arrive at the actual value of the whole stock in hand\nseems to me to bear but one interpretation and that is \"the actual value of the whole stock in hand\" at the time the respondent was taking it over.\nThese words seem to me too clear for any other alternative as being had in view. And, therefore, I think this appeal should be allowed and the amount of $24,755.64 agreed upon by sections 8 of the stated case, and interest thereon from the date of delivery of the goods to the respondent to the date of judgment herein.\nAs to the item of $1,210.63, sales taxes thereon, I can see no reason why that should not be allowed.\nThe respondent's counsel, and some judicial expressions in the court below, suggested that there were evidently more items allowed in adjusting the supposed actual value than are explained, and hence enough had been paid.\nI cannot understand that forlorn hope at all, for there were a great many items beyond those set forth in the stated case, which I am quite sure would be elements entering into the proper adjustment of the actual value which the respondent could be trusted to deal with, and no doubt properly did so.\nIt occurs to me that these very items having been allowed by those who knew what they were about is destructive of the arguments based on the price lists and on the adding of freight to goods in transit as if bearing on the goods long in stock.\nSuch a method of applying an Act such as this does not commend itself to me.\nSome of us, including myself, had occasion some months ago to consider, in the case of Versailles Sweets v. Attorney General of Canada[9], a great variety of grounds for paying, and a greater variety for non-payment, of sales taxes and, I imagine, the officers in charge of that branch of the public service know a great deal more than ordinary counsel or judges who have not had their minds directed to the subject. And I am confident that they are not likely to be biased, and when they persist for a couple of years and finally threaten suit, and counsel cannot see their way to advise resisting or defending such a suit, I feel I have no right to interfere as the probabilities are that the officers were correctly advised and the items were chargeable and surely should be added to the price of goods being sold, or supposed to be sold, at actual value.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacRae, Sinclair & MacRae.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McLellan & Hughes.\n[1] [1924] 4 D.L.R. 273.\n[2] [1896] A.C. 136.\n[3] 4 B. & Ad. 372.\n[4] 15 Q.B. 761.\n[5] 7 B. & S. 261.\n[6] 20 L.T. 697.\n[7] 17 Ch.

V, c. 60, s. 5956 (t.)\nThe municipal council of the town of Trois-Pistoles passed a by-law on the 26th January, 1920, authorizing the borrowing, by way of debentures, of a sum of $22,500, for the purchase of an electric lighting plant for which the town held an option expiring the 30th April, 1920. By resolution of its council the town decided to accept the option on the 6th of April, 1920. The mayor and the secretary-treasurer, as the executive officers of the municipal council, arranged with the bank for the advance of the purchase money pending the sale of the debentures and undertook that the proceeds of the sale would be deposited with the bank to be applied in re-payment of the advances. On the 30th of April, 1920, at the instance of the bank, a promissory note for $12,441.89 and a so-called interim debenture for $22,500 were signed by the mayor and the secretary-treasurer and handed to the bank. Then the town issued debentures in series of $100, $250 and $500 respectively in conformity with the by-law and deposited the proceeds to the credit of its general bank account. Instead of reimbursing the advances made by the bank as agreed, the town drew against these moneys for its general purposes. On the 30th of July, 1921, the mayor and the secretary-treasurer, without any express authority, renewed the promissory note of $12,441.89 by giving another note for $9,005.31, the balance having been paid by the town.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 36 K.B. 355), Malouin J. dissenting, that the giving by the mayor and the secretary-treasurer of the promissory note for $12,441.89, of the renewal note for $9,005.31 and of the interim debenture being unauthorized and therefore void, the appellant in the first action was entitled as a ratepayer to ask the courts to pronounce their nullity.\nHeld also, reversing the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 36 K.B. 78), Anglin and Malouin JJ. dissenting, that there had been a diversion of the proceeds of the debenture loan within the meaning of section 5956 (t.) of the Cities and Towns Act, 8 Geo. V, c. 60, and the mayor and the secretary-treasurer were bound jointly and severally to pay to the town the sum of $9,005.31 in order to extinguish the balance owed by it to the bank on the purchase price of the electric plant.\nPer Anglin J. (dissenting).\u2014As the note given by the municipal officers was void, the overdraft in the general bank account of the municipality, which had been created by the advances made under the arrangement of the 6th of April, continued; and, as the proceeds of the debenture loan were subsequently deposited in that account, were applicable to such overdraft and were sufficient to cover it, there was no effective diversion of such proceeds within the meaning of sec. 5956 (t) and personal liability of the municipal officers therefor did not arise.\nAPPEAL from the decisions of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgments of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant's actions.\nThe material facts of the cases and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the appellants.\nF. Roy K.C. for the respondent La Banque Nationale.\nSt. Jacques K.C. and J. Langlais for the respondents Martin and others.\nRiou v. Martin\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action brought by the appellant as a ratepayer of the town of Trois-Pistoles against the respondents to recover, on behalf of said municipality, by virtue of s. 5956t of the statutes of Quebec as enacted by 8 Geo. V, c. 60, and which reads as follows:\u2014\n5956t. The moneys realized from a loan or from a bond issue made by any municipality incorporated by special act or in virtue of a general act shall be applied exclusively to the purpose for which they are intended, provided, however, that if they exceed the amount required for such purpose, the excess may be applied to other purposes specified in a subsequent by-law of the council, approved in the same manner as the by-law authorizing such loan or bond issue.\nEvery member of the council, who, either verbally or in writing, by his note or tacitly, authorizes the misapplication of such money, shall be personally responsible for all sums thus illegally diverted from the use for which they are intended, towards the corporation, which may recover the same by an action in law, enforceable by coercive imprisonment against the member or the members of the council in default. Such responsibility shall be joint and several, and shall apply to the secretary-treasurer or other officer who participates in such illegal diversion of such moneys, or who causes the same.\nThe action to recover such money may likewise be taken by any ratepayer or by the Minister of Municipal Affairs.\nThe action was dismissed by the learned trial judge and, upon appeal therefrom to the Court of King's Bench, said dismissal was maintained by a majority of three to two, Chief Justice Lafontaine and Mr. Justice Rivard dissenting.\nThe said Chief Justice has, in his opinion, dealt with the questions involved so fully and satisfactorily that I see nothing to add thereto supplemented as it is by a brief opinion of Mr. Justice Rivard.\nI agree entirely with their reasoning and for said reasons I am of the opinion that the appellant should succeed herein to the extent of recovering $9,005 with costs throughout against the respondents.\nRiou v. Town of Trois-Pistoles\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action brought by the appellant an elector and ratepayer of the defendant, la ville de Trois-Pistoles, to have declared null and void certain so-called securities of the 30th April, 1920, given by the mayor and town treasurer of said defendant Trois-Pistoles, ostensibly on behalf of said defendant, to the respondent La Banque Nationale and a promissory note given in renewal thereof for balance of $9,005.31 on the 30th July, 1921.\nThe action was dismissed with costs by the learned trial judge, from which judgment the appellant took an appeal to the Court of King's Bench, which court dismissed his appeal with costs, the learned Chief Justice Lafontaine dissenting.\nHence this appeal herein.\nI agree with the reasons assigned by said Chief Justice for allowing the appeal below, and for the like reasons am of the opinion that this appeal as prayed for to the extent of $9,005.31, should be allowed with costs throughout as against the respondents.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with Mignault J.\nAnglin J.\u2014In the first-named action the plaintiff, a ratepayer of the defendant municipality, seeks to have a certain document in the form of a promissory note and a so-called interim debenture, both given in the name of the defendant municipal corporation by its mayor and secretary-treasurer to cover the amount of advances made to it by the respondent bank and applied for the purchase of an electric lighting plant, and a renewal of the note for a reduced amount declared illegal, null and void.\nIn the second action another plaintiff, likewise a ratepayer, demands that the defendants\u2014the mayor, secretary-treasurer and councillors of the town of Trois-Pistoles\u2014be penalized under s. 5956 (t) of the Revised Statutes of Quebec (8 Geo. V, c. 60) for having diverted part of the proceeds of a debenture loan, destined, inter alia, to pay the purchase price of the electric plant acquired by the town, by allowing such proceeds to be deposited in the town's general bank account and to be withdrawn from that account for its general purposes while the aforesaid note remained in the hands of the bank unpaid.\nAlthough the respondent bank by its plea upheld the validity of the impeached securities, it is now common ground in the first-named action that the giving of those securities was wholly unauthorized, and that, as against the defendant municipal corporation, they are void. In view of the defence pleaded by the bank the plaintiff was, in my opinion, entitled as a ratepayer of the defendant municipality to judgment so declaring.\nBut counsel for the respondent bank maintains that, apart from the note and the so-called debenture taken by it as security, there is a liability on the part of the defendant municipality to it for the moneys advanced to and used by the latter to pay for the electric plant which it acquired under the authority of by-law no. 28, the validity of which is not challenged, and he also contends that upon such advances by way of over-draft the bank is entitled to interest. The appellant concedes the liability of the town to repay the advances actually made but contests the right of the bank to treat them as a loan or to claim interest, insisting that, apart from the note, there was no contract to pay interest on the advances and no mise en demeure such as might found a claim for interest as damages under art. 1077 C.C.\nThe advances were made on the 6th of April, 1920; the note was taken on, and bears date, the 30th of April, 1920; the debentures authorized by by-law no. 28 bear date and carry interest at 5\u00bd per cent from the 1st of May, 1920; the original note provided for interest at 6 per cent and the renewal at 7 per cent. The arrangement to give the note and interim debenture so-called was made when the advances were obtained.\nThere can be no doubt that both the bank and the municipal officers who negotiated with it for the advances contemplated that they should bear interest and, although the note taken for them was invalid, having regard to the fact that it was given pursuant to an agreement made at the time when the moneys were advanced, I am disposed to treat it as evidence of an arrangement made at that time that the bank should receive interest at the rate stated in the note on the over-draft which resulted from the advances, which were made by the respondent bank honouring cheques drawn on the current account of the municipal corporation then devoid of funds.\nThe debentures intended to provide funds to pay the purchase money of the electric plant were not then available. The option held by the town was about to expire. The municipal council had determined to accept that option. It was, I think, within the implied authority of the mayor and secretary-treasurer as the executive officers of the municipal council to arrange with the bank for the advance of the purchase money pending the sale of the debentures and to agree to pay a reasonable rate of interest thereon until the proceeds of the debentures should be available and to undertake that the proceeds of the debentures when sold would be deposited with the bank to be applied in repayment of the advances. That was in fact the arrangement made. It was distinctly advantageous to the town, which was thus enabled to acquire the plant it had determined to buy and to dispose of its debentures gradually when and as the market enabled it to obtain the best prices, instead of being obliged to sell them immediately and en bloc for whatever price could be had for them on such a forced sale. Moreover, the municipality has had the benefit of interest at 5\u00bd per cent on those debentures from the 1st of May, 1920.\nUnder the agreement made with the bank the proceeds of the sale of the debentures were to be deposited with it to repay the advances. To that extent the debentures were practically held by the municipality in trust for and disposed of by it on account of the bank. I am of the opinion that by virtue of the agreement made at the time of the advances the bank is entitled on a contractual basis to claim interest at 6 per cent (the rate specified in the note) on the amount thereof from time to time remaining unpaid after crediting against them proceeds of the debentures deposited with it as of the respective dates when such deposits were made. The arrangement that such proceeds should be so applied and credited was definitely made, was eminently proper, and bound both the bank and the municipality. There never was any authority to depart from it. The apparent departure shewn by the bank's books is accounted for by the erroneous assumption that the note given by the municipal officers was valid and effectual to take the overdraft out of the general bank account of the municipality. It was not so. The over-draft in that account resulting from the advances remained and in my opinion it should be regarded as having been met by the deposits of the proceeds of the debentures when and as the same were made.\nUnder all the circumstances the judgment dismissing the first-named action should be vacated and judgment entered in lieu thereof declaring the two documents of the 30th of April, one in the form of a promissory note and the other so-called interim debenture, void; that the advances made by the bank created a valid indebtedness to it by the municipal corporation; and that so much of such indebtedness as from time to time remained unpaid carried interest at 6 per cent from the date at which the advances were made until the same were repaid by deposits of proceeds of debentures pursuant to the arrangement with the bank. If the parties cannot agree upon the amount that should be allowed for interest under this declaration an account to determine it may be taken according to the usual practice of the Superior Court in such cases.\nWhat, if any, may be the bank's right in regard to interest on the over-draft in the municipality's current account, which will result from the application of the deposits of proceeds of debentures above indicated, is a question not before us in this litigation. The plaintiff is entitled to his costs throughout.\nFrom what I have said in dealing with the action first named it is apparent that in my opinion there never was any effective diversion of the proceeds of the debenture loan authorized by by-law no. 28. Those proceeds were deposited in the bank account of the defendant municipality with the bank, as was agreed, and they will be applied, as they should have been under that agreement, towards repayment to the bank of the moneys advanced by it to provide the purchase price of the electric plant acquired by the town under the authority of by-law no. 28. It follows that the action to penalize the defendants cannot succeed.\nThe conduct of the defendants was, however, exceedingly careless, to say the least, in allowing the bank account of the municipality to continue to show an apparent application of the proceeds of the debentures issued under by-law no. 28 to purposes for which they were not intended. Had the document in the form of a promissory note given by the mayor and secretary-treasurer on the 30th of April, 1920, and its subsequent renewal been valid instruments a very strong case might have been made to support the plaintiff's action for penalties. In any event, the municipal officers were distinctly remiss in failing to see that the securities taken by the bank on the 30th of April were not cancelled or delivered up when the bank had received proceeds of debentures sufficient to satisfy the advances in respect of which they were given. While I would, for the reasons indicated, dismiss the plaintiff's appeal in the second-named action, under the circumstances the respondents are in my opinion not entitled to costs.\nMignault J.\u2014Il y a deux actions ici, et malgr\u00e9 la similitude des noms elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9es par deux personnes diff\u00e9rentes. Dans la premi\u00e8re en date, commenc\u00e9e le 23 ao\u00fbt, 1921, Joseph-Magloire Riou, se donnant la qualit\u00e9 de cultivateur, contribuable et \u00e9lecteur propri\u00e9taire de la ville de Trois-Pistoles, \u00e9tait demandeur, la corporation de la ville de Trois-Pistoles, d\u00e9fenderesse, et La Banque Nationale, mise-en-cause. Dans la seconde, intent\u00e9e le 26 septembre, 1921, le demandeur \u00e9tait Joseph Riou, qui se d\u00e9crivait comme contribuable, propri\u00e9taire foncier et \u00e9lecteur municipal de la ville de Trois-Pistoles, et les d\u00e9fendeurs, Hormisdas Martin et al, \u00e9taient le maire, le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier et des conseillers municipaux de cette ville. Les deux actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es tant par la cour sup\u00e9rieure que par la cour du Banc du Roi et les deux demandeurs en appellent \u00e0 cette cour.\nComme il s'agit des m\u00eames faits dans les deux actions, bien que les causes d'action soient distinctes, il vaut mieux commencer par une relation des faits aussi courte que possible.\nLe conseil municipal de la ville de Trois-Pistoles adopta le 26 janvier, 1920, un r\u00e8glement no 28, autorisant un emprunt par \u00e9mission de d\u00e9bentures au montant de $22,500, dont $12,127 pour achat d'un r\u00e9seau d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique, $2,873 pour am\u00e9lioration et agrandissement de ce r\u00e9seau, et $7,525 pour \u00e9teindre et consolider des emprunts temporaires. Ce r\u00e8glement fut approuv\u00e9 par les \u00e9lecteurs municipaux propri\u00e9taires et par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil au d\u00e9sir de la loi.\nLa ville d\u00e9tenait alors une promesse de vente consentie par le propri\u00e9taire du r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique qui expirait le 30 avril, 1920. Comme il fallait du temps pour vendre les debentures, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'acheter imm\u00e9diatement le r\u00e9seau, et une r\u00e9solution du conseil de ville, en date du 6 avril ratifia l'acte d'achat qui fut pass\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour. Le vendeur fut pay\u00e9 au moyen de deux ch\u00e8ques sign\u00e9s au nom de la ville que la Banque Nationale consentit \u00e0 honorer malgr\u00e9 que la ville n'e\u00fbt pas en d\u00e9p\u00f4t des fonds suffisants, l'entente entre le g\u00e9rant de la banque et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier \u00e9tant que la banque serait rembours\u00e9e par la vente des d\u00e9bentures aussit\u00f4t que cette vente pourrait s'effectuer. C'\u00e9tait, il semble, la coutume des administrateurs de cette ville d'emprunter pour rencontrer les d\u00e9penses courantes et \u00e0 la rentr\u00e9e des taxes de rembourser le pr\u00eateur, ou, comme le dit le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, de payer les d\u00e9penses apr\u00e8s qu'elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites.\nLe 30 avril, apparemment sur les instances du g\u00e9rant de la banque, on donna \u00e0 la banque un billet \u00e0 demande pour $12,441.89, portant int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 6 p. 100 par ann\u00e9e. Ce billet fut sign\u00e9 au nom de la ville par Hormisdas Martin, maire, et Louis Riou, secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, qui pr\u00e9tendaient y \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s par le r\u00e8glement du 26 janvier 1920. Ce r\u00e8glement, cependant, n'autorisait pas la confection de ce billet et l'emprunt de la banque, et il est admis maintenant que le maire et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier ont sign\u00e9 le billet sans y \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s soit par le r\u00e8glement, soit par le conseil de ville.\nEn m\u00eame temps que le billet, on remit \u00e0 la banque, comme garantie, une pr\u00e9tendue d\u00e9benture de la ville, sign\u00e9e par le maire et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, sans date d'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, qu'on appelle \"d\u00e9benture temporaire,\" au montant de $22,500, qu'on d\u00e9clarait \u00eatre \u00e9mise en conformit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement no 28 du 26 janvier, 1920. Cette d\u00e9benture est mentionn\u00e9e au billet, mais elle est loin d'\u00eatre conforme au r\u00e8glement, car ce r\u00e8glement permettait l'\u00e9mission de d\u00e9bentures en trois s\u00e9ries de $100, $250, et $500 respectivement. Du reste, on ne pouvait \u00e9mettre une d\u00e9benture temporaire. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'insister, car de part et d'autre on reconna\u00eet que cette d\u00e9benture est nulle, comme on admet que le billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 sans autorit\u00e9.\nLe billet et la d\u00e9benture temporaire rest\u00e8rent donc entre les mains de la banque, et nonobstant l'\u00e9mission de cette d\u00e9benture temporaire, les officiers de la ville \u00e9mirent des d\u00e9bentures conformes au r\u00e8glement, qu'ils mirent en vente. Le produit de la vente des d\u00e9bentures fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au cr\u00e9dit du compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la ville \u00e0 la banque, et la ville tira sur ce compte pour ses besoins ordinaires et la banque paya ses ch\u00e8ques, et pendant tout ce temps le billet donn\u00e9 pour l'achat du r\u00e9seau d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique restait en souffrance. Le compte de banque fut v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 et balanc\u00e9 de temps \u00e0 autre et, tant \u00e0 la banque qu'\u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9, on para\u00eet avoir oubli\u00e9 que l'entente mentionn\u00e9e plus\"haut \u00e9tait que l'avance faite par la banque pour l'achat du r\u00e9seau d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique serait pay\u00e9e au fur et mesure de la vente des d\u00e9bentures. Au contraire, les officiers de la ville employ\u00e8rent le produit de cette vente pour les besoins g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la ville\u2014et ce \u00e0 la connaissance et, il ne para\u00eet pas douteux, avec le consentement du g\u00e9rant de la banque\u2014au lieu de s'en servir pour le remboursement de cette avance.\nLe 30 juillet, 1921, le maire et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier renouvel\u00e8rent, sans autorit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, le billet de $12,441.89 par un autre billet de $9,005.31 portant int\u00e9r\u00eat de 7 p. 100, la diff\u00e9rence ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 la banque \u00e0 m\u00eame les fonds de la ville en d\u00e9p\u00f4t. A cette \u00e9poque, toutes les d\u00e9bentures paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues, mais l'avance faite par la banque pour l'acquisition du reseau \u00e9lectrique n'\u00e9tait pas rembours\u00e9e. Le billet donn\u00e9 en renouvellement, qui repr\u00e9sente la diff\u00e9rence due sur cette avance, \u00e9tait encore en souffrance \u00e0 la banque lorsque le g\u00e9rant de la banque a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin, le 16 mars, 1922.\nVenons maintenant au m\u00e9rite des deux actions.\nPremi\u00e8re action\nL'appelant, Joseph-Magloire Riou, demande le maintien de l'injonction interlocutoire qui accompagnait son action, et il conclut en outre \u00e0 ce qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la confection, la signature et l'escompte \u00e0 la Banque Nationale du billet de $12,441.89, en date du 30 avril, 1920, et le renouvellement de ce billet pour $9,005.31, en date du 30 juillet 1921, sont nuls, ill\u00e9gaux et ultra vires tant de la ville que du maire et du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier et \u00e0 ce qu'ils soivent annul\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure a reconnu la nullit\u00e9 des billets et de la d\u00e9benture temporaire. L'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance s'exprime ainsi:\nIl n'est pas besoin de dire que ces billets et ce simulacre de debenture \u00e9taient du papier sans aucune valeur.\nMais alors pourquoi cette cour n'a-t-elle pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cette nullit\u00e9, objet de la demande, au lieu de renvoyer l'action du demandeur? Le jugement, dans un de ses consid\u00e9rants, dit\nqu'il n'y aurait aucun objet pratique et aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 annuler les dits billets et l'escompte qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nCependant si le billet est nul, l'escompte de ce billet ne saurait donner de droits \u00e0 la banque, sauf \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si celle-ci peut r\u00e9clamer le remboursement de l'avance qu'elle a faite \u00e0 la ville en payant les ch\u00e8ques de cette derni\u00e8re au propri\u00e9taire du r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectrique. Et l'action du demandeur ne contestait nullement le droit d'action qui pouvait r\u00e9sulter \u00e0 la banque du paiement de ces ch\u00e8ques. L'annulation du billet et de l'escompte ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet du d\u00e9bat judiciaire, et la d\u00e9fenderesse ayant soutenu la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, il semble \u00e9vident que la cour sup\u00e9rieure ne devrait pas \u00e9carter cette question de nullit\u00e9 en disant qu'il n'y avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 la trancher.\nReste la question de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de 6 p. 100 stipul\u00e9 par le premier billet et de 7 p. 100 par le billet donn\u00e9 en renouvellement. Si ces deux billets sont nuls comme non autoris\u00e9s, cette stipulation d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat exc\u00e9dant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gal est sans effet. D'ailleurs si la banque a un droit d'action contre la ville pour avoir pay\u00e9 ses deux ch\u00e8ques (ce qui semble probable, Rolland v. Caisse d'Economie[2], et cette cr\u00e9ance ne d\u00e9pend pas de l'escompte des billets, mais du paiement des ch\u00e8ques), il sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9 quand elle exercera ce recours si la ville lui doit de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il ne s'agit ici d'aucune condamnation contre la ville en faveur de la banque, mais seulement de savoir si le demandeur \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9 \u00e0 attaquer les billets et leur escompte.\nLa conclusion, c'est que l'on doit d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 de ces billets et de la d\u00e9benture temporaire y mentionn\u00e9e. Mais il n'y a aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 maintenir l'injonction interlocutoire qui accompagnait l'action du demandeur, et qui a eu son effet pendant l'instance.

V (Qu\u00e9.), c. 60, dont la section 1\u00e8re ajoute aux statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec la disposition suivante:\u2014\n5956t. Les deniers provenant d'un emprunt ou d'une \u00e9mission d'obligations fait par toute municipalit\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en corporation par une loi sp\u00e9ciale ou en vertu d'une loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, doivent \u00eatre exclusivement appliqu\u00e9s aux fins auxquelles ils sont destin\u00e9s, pourvu toutefois que, s'ils exc\u00e8dent le montant requis pour ces fins, l'exc\u00e9dent puisse \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres fins sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es dans un r\u00e8glement subs\u00e9quent du conseil, approuv\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que le r\u00e8glement autorisant cet emprunt ou cette \u00e9mission de bons. Tout membre du conseil qui, soit verbalement, soit par \u00e9crit, par son vote ou tacitement, autorise le virement de ces deniers, est personnellement responsable de toutes les sommes d'argent ainsi ill\u00e9galement d\u00e9tourn\u00e9es de l'usage auquel elles \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es, envers la corporation qui peut, par une poursuite en justice entra\u00eenant l'emprisonnement, les recouvrer du membre ou des membres du conseil en d\u00e9faut.\nCette responsabilit\u00e9 est solidaire et s'applique au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier ou autre officier qui participe au virement ill\u00e9gal de ces deniers ou qui en devient l'auteur.\nLa poursuite en recouvrement de ces deniers peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e \u00e9galement par tout contribuable ou par le ministre des affaires municipales.\nLa relation des faits au commencement de ce jugement d\u00e9montre bien qu'il y a eu dans l'esp\u00e8ce virement de fonds. La partie du produit de la vente des debentures qui \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 payer le co\u00fbt de l'acquisition du r\u00e9seau d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e au compte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 la banque de la ville de Trois-Pistoles, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour les besoins g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la ville. Le compte de banque, v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 et balanc\u00e9 de temps \u00e0 autre comme dit plus haut, en fait foi. Et il y a de plus un aveu de ce virement de fonds dans la lettre du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier au ministre des affaires municipales de la province en date du 14 juillet, 1921. Si l'article 5956t ne s'applique pas dans un tel \u00e9tat de choses, on peut tr\u00e8s bien se demander quelle application il peut avoir. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il y ait eu crime ou malhonn\u00eatet\u00e9. Il suffit qu'on ait d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 les fonds emprunt\u00e9s de la destination que leur donnait le r\u00e8glement d'emprunt. Or il n'est pas douteux que c'est ce qu'on a fait dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nIl importe peu que la ville ait pay\u00e9 le vendeur du r\u00e9seau d'\u00e9clairage \u00e9lectrique. Elle l'a pay\u00e9 au moyen d'une avance faite par la banque qui a honor\u00e9 ses ch\u00e8ques alors qu'elle n'avait pas de fonds \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, et la ville n'a fait que changer de cr\u00e9ancier. Il restait \u00e0 payer sur cette avance, le 30 juillet 1921, une somme de $9,005.31.\nToutefois la condamnation \u00e0 rembourser cette somme de $9,005.31 \u00e0 la ville, pour qu'elle soit employ\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9teindre la balance due par la ville sur cette avance, ne doit \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e que contre le maire Hormisdas Martin et le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier Louis Riou, mais ils devront y \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s solidairement. Il n'y a pas au dossier une preuve suffisante que les autres conseillers poursuivis aient particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce virement de fonds. Ceux-ci devront \u00eatre d\u00e9charg\u00e9s de la condamnation demand\u00e9e contre eux.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Hormisdas Martin et de Louis Riou, avec frais de toutes les cours contre eux.\nMalouin J.

P. Davis K.C. and E. F. Newcombe for the appellant. The $130,000 in question were the proceeds of the sale of the capital assets of the company and not income received by the company in the ordinary course of carrying on its business and, therefore, was not taxable under the Act. Even if the sum in question must be considered \"income\" within the Act, it was income of the year 1920 in which the sale was made and, therefore, is not assessable.\nIf it is held that the appellant's contention in this last respect is wrong, then in any event only the sums of money which were received in the years 1921 and 1922, which amount to $66,269.28 can properly be assessed against the appellant.\nThe evidence shows that the object of the company was to log these timber properties, and that they were only sold when the company had sold its logging equipment and apparently given up its business.\nThe onus was upon the Crown to shew that the profit was earned in an operation which was a part of the business carried on in fact by the company. Stevens v. Hudson Bay Co.[2] ; Tebreau Rubber Co. v. Farmer[3] ; Commissioner of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust Ltd.[4].\nKillam for the respondent. The profit was property assessed as income, first according to the definition of income as contained in the Taxation Act, and also in view of the decisions rendered in similar cases. Northern Assurance Co. v. Russell[5] ; Scottish Investment Trust Co. v. Surveyer of Taxes[6] ; California Copper Syndicate v. Harris[7] ; Stevens v. Hudson Bay Co.[8] ; Commissioners of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust Ltd.[9].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellant company in 1920 sold its Thurlow Island timber limits at a price which was largely in advance of the moneys expended in acquiring them, part of which price was paid in 1920, part in 1921, and part, though not the whole of the residue, in 1922. The principal topic of controversy on this appeal is whether the profit accruing from this sale was, in whole or in part, assessable to income tax. The solution turns primarily upon the answer to be given to the question whether or not the profit falls within the category of \" income \" within the meaning of the British Columbia statute. A subsidiary question, turning upon the effect of a statute of 1921 that authorizes the assessor to enter upon the roll of one year the amount of assessable income received during any previous year but not included in the statutory return made by the person receiving it, will also have to be disposed of.\nIn dealing with the major question it may be assumed, as it was assumed on the argument, that the distinction between the accretions to capital, such as the capital profit realized upon the sale of a capital investment, and the profit derived from the labour, or capital, or both combined, in carrying on or carrying out a venture or a business for profit, is a distinction both admissible and proper under the terms of the British Columbia statutes of 1911 and 1917.\nThe appellant company was incorporated under the British Columbia Companies Act of 1907, and its objects, declared in its memorandum of association, were; to take over as a going concern a certain logging business carried on in the state of Washington, with a view to adopting a specified agreement identified by reference to the articles of association, and to carry the agreement into effect; to acquire by purchase or otherwise timber licences, timber leases and timber lands, and to sell and deal in these; and to carry on a general business as loggers and dealers in logs and timber of all sorts. The company was also empowered to carry on any other business capable of being conveniently carried on in connection with the business already mentioned; to make arrangements, by way of partnership or otherwise, with others carrying on any of these businesses; and to acquire the shares and securities of any joint stock company so engaged, and generally to deal with these. There are general powers to buy and sell lands and other property, to borrow money and create securities of various kinds, and, finally, there is power to distribute any property of the company among the members in specie.\nIt is sufficiently clear from the memorandum of association that one of the substantive objects of the company was to acquire timber lands and timber rights with a view to dealing in them and turning them to account to the profit of the company. The nature of the business actually carried on by the company from its inception down to 1916 is not disclosed. We learn of one transaction and one only\u2014the purchase of the limits already mentioned, in 1910. Whether the logging business in Washington referred to in the memorandum of association was actually taken over, and, if taken over, whether it was carried on or resold, we do not know; nor do we know anything of the terms of the agreement which the company was to carry into effect on taking over that business. In 1916 the principal partners of the company, Messrs. Anderson and Jeremiason, arranged with one Kiltze for a right of way through his property, a lot adjoining the Thurlow Island limits\u2014a right of way required for the convenient exploitation of the limits. At about the same time, apparently, the company purchased from Kiltze the timber on his lot, this timber being afterwards sold to a Mr. P. B. Anderson. In 1917 the company entered into an arrangement with the same Mr. P. B. Anderson, by which Anderson undertook to remove all timber from the limits, paying for the timber so taken off, as well as all that ought to be taken off but should be left standing, at the rate of $2.50 per thousand feet, board measure; to manufacture the timber into logs, and to sell them at the best price obtainable, and to pay to the company one-half of the moneys realized from such sales. Anderson proceeded to carry out the agreement, and did so, apparently without interruption, until the year 1920, when he bought the timber outright under the agreement already mentioned, at the price of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars odd, $80,000 being paid at the date of the agreement, and $50,000 being payable in each of the years 1921 and 1922.\nFor the purposes of this appeal it will not be necessary to consider critically the words of the British Columbia definition of \" income.\" It may be assumed, as it was assumed on the argument\u2014for the purposes of this appeal only\u2014that the tests which have been applied in the decisions of the courts upon controversies arising under the Income Tax Acts of the United Kingdom are those by which the liability of the appellant company is to be determined.\nThe principle of these decisions can best be stated for our present purpose in the language of Lord Dunedin in his judgment delivered on behalf of the Judicial Committee, in Commissioner of Taxes v. The Melbourne Trust, Ltd.[10],\nIt is common ground that a company, if a trading company and making profit, is assessable to income tax for that profit. *** The principle is correctly stated in the Scottish case quoted, California Copper Syndicate v. Harris[11]. It is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of income tax that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realize it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to income tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realization or conversion of securities may be so assessable where what is done is not merely a realization or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business;\nor, in the language of the judgment from which this quotation is made, which follows in sequence after the passage cited:\nWhat is the line which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to define and each case must be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined being\u2014Is the sum of gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by realizing a security, or is it a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making?\nor, in the form adopted by Sankey J.\u2014in Beynon v. Ogg[12]\u2014from the argument of the Attorney General\u2014was the profit in question\na profit made in the operation of the appellant company's business?\nThe appellant company is a company incorporated for the purpose of making a profit by carrying on business in various ways including, as already mentioned, by buying timber lands and dealing in them. It is difficult to discover any reason derived from the history of the operations of the company for thinking that in buying these timber limits the company did not envisage the course it actually pursued for turning these limits to account for its profit as at least a possible contingency; and, assuming that the correct inference from the true facts is that the limits were purchased with the intention of turning them to account for profit in any way which might present itself as the most convenient, including the sale of them, the proper conclusion seems to be that the assessor was right in treating this profit as income.\nOn behalf of the appellant company it is contended, first, that the onus was upon the Crown to shew that the profit was earned in an operation which was a part of the business carried on in fact by the company; and, secondly, that from what is described as the isolated case of the purchase and sale of these timber limits no inference as to the course of the company's business can properly be drawn.\nFirst, as to the contention on the point of onus. If, on an appeal to the judge of the Court of Revision, it appears that, on the true facts, the application of the pertinent enactment is doubtful, it would, on principle, seem that the Crown must fail. That seems to be necessarily involved in the principle according to which statutes imposing a burden upon the subject have, by inveterate practice, been interpreted and administered. But, as concerns the inquiry into the facts, the appellant is in the same position as any other appellant. He must shew that the impeached assessment is an assessment which ought not to have been made; that is to say, he must establish facts upon which it can be affirmatively asserted that the assessment was not authorized by the taxing statute, or which bring the matter into such a state of doubt that, on the principles alluded to, the liability of the appellant must be negatived. The true facts may be established, of course, by direct evidence or by probable inference. The appellant may adduce facts constituting a prima facie case which remains unanswered; but in considering whether this has been done it is important not to forget, if it be so, that the facts are, in a special degree if not exclusively, within the appellant's cognizance; although this last is a consideration which, for obvious reasons, must not be pressed too far.\nMaking all such allowances, however, it seems reasonable to conclude in this case that the judge of the Court of Revision could properly hold that the appeal must be dealt with on the hypothesis that the company's business included that of making a profit by buying timber limits with the intention of turning them to account (and by selling them, if necessary) in such a manner as might seem most convenient and profitable; and that the timber limits in question were not purchased solely with the view to logging them.\nIn support of the suggestion that the principal business of the company was in fact the business of logging there is, apart from the memorandum of association, no evidence entitled to appreciable weight, and hardly any which can properly be considered at all. A witness was called who at one time was secretary of the company, but whose connection with the company, according to his own statement, began later, at all events, than the year 1920. He was asked the question\u2014\" What has been the principal business of the company?\" and his answer was \" Logging.\" The balance sheets themselves shew that the company was not in possession of any logging equipment after the year 1917 (there is nothing to shew that it ever had any); and in the income tax return made in the year 1922, signed by this witness, as well as by the president of the company, the business of the company is said to be \" timber investments.\" Counsel for the Crown very properly declined to cross-examine him, on the ground that he had no personal knowledge of the relevant facts. It is not unimportant to remark that neither of the principal partners of the company, who could have given a history of the company's affairs from its inception, was called as a witness nor, as has already been mentioned, was any but the most meagre evidence adduced as to the character of the company's operations before 1916.\nIn support of the contention that the limits were in fact bought with the exclusive object of logging them, the only evidence is the evidence of the same witness, who had and could have no personal knowledge of the design of the directors of the company in purchasing the limits, while the gentlemen who could have given information on the subject, both authentic and exact, were not examined. The witness deposed, it is true, to a conversation in 1916 with these two gentlemen, which was relied upon as indicating that at that time they contemplated logging the property. The conversation, as narrated by the witness, is equally consistent with the existence of an intention to acquire a right of way over adjoining property, affording improved facilities for working the limits, in order to enhance the value of the timber, and with a view to realizing that value in any manner in which it might most profitably be realized, by sale or otherwise; and could afford at the highest only the most shaky basis for the suggested inference, in the absence of the direct evidence which could have been and was not given, if the fact was as suggested.\nAs to the suggestion that the purchase and sale of these limits was only an isolated transaction of its kind, it will be necessary to discuss whether, assuming it to be the fact, that could assist the appellant company. But while considering what are the findings of fact upon which the examination of the questions raised by the appellant must proceed, it is to be observed that, strictly, this transaction was not an isolated transaction. The evidence disclosed, rather by accident, another transaction in timber, a purchase apparently in the year 1916, from the witness Kiltze, and the sale of the timber so purchased to the Mr. P. B. Anderson already mentioned. This transaction, it is true, in itself, without any further explanation, has not much significance. The purchase may very well have been prompted by the circumstance that the timber adjoined the company's limits and could profitably be worked along with them, thus, in any event, adding to the value of the limits; this minor transaction constituting, one might perhaps say, a mere incident in the larger one. But, on the other hand, there is the investment in the shares of the Standard Lumber Company, of which no explanation is given; and when these facts are related to the circumstance that in 1922 the business of the company was described as the business of \" timber investments,\" words fairly descriptive of a category of investments embracing standing timber, as well as shares in timber companies, one can hardly, in the absence of explanation from the appellant company, proceed on the assumption that the venture in question was the sole transaction of the kind in the history of the company.\nMr. Davis, who argued the appeal with all his usual ingenuity and force, sought to bring the transaction under discussion within the analogy of a sale by a trader or manufacturer of his premises or part of his plant. In the case of a joint stock company incorporated under the British Columbia \" Companies Act,\" the recognized distinction has full play between capital which is not available for distribution among the shareholders\u2014except in cases in which a special statutory procedure is followed, in which case the company is entitled to reduce its capital, whether share capital or paid-up capital\u2014and surplus assets which are legally susceptible of distribution as dividends. Upon this distinction all surplus assets, over and above the paid-up capital, are so distributable if the governing body of the company is minded to distribute them. And it may often happen that the proceeds realized from the sale of business premises or part of a manufacturer's plant are surplus assets in this sense, which, for the purpose of considering the legal authority of the company to distribute such proceeds as dividends, would not fall within the denomination \" capital.\" A distinction, however, between \" capital\" in the popular sense, in which the word is employed as the antithesis of \" income,\" and this stricter conception of the law of companies, appears to be well recognized in the decisions upon the incidence of the income tax; and without expressing an opinion upon the point, it may be assumed that the distinction is not abrogated by the statute under which this tax, now in question, is imposed. Sales of a business premises or a manufacturing plant, where the proceeds are to be reinvested in the purchase of a new plant or new premises, would, as a rule, no doubt fall within the first alternative of Lord Dunedin's test, \" change or realization of investment,\" even although the money realized should, in whole or in part, be lawfully distributable among the shareholders as dividends. The company's limits having, it is said, been purchased with a view to logging them, and the sale having taken place in execution of a resolve on the part of the company to abandon that branch of its business (evidenced, it is suggested, by the absence of all reference to the logging plant in the annual balance sheets produced), the facts of this case, it is argued, bring it within the same category.\nIn view of the terms of the British Columbia definition, assuming the limits had been bought with no definite intention of realizing a profit out of them otherwise than by logging them\u2014that is, through logging operations carried on by the company itself in which the timber would be cut down, converted into logs and sold\u2014it may be open to question whether the judge of the Court of Revision would have been entitled, having regard to the memorandum of association and the other circumstances mentioned, to treat the profits as a capital profit and not assessable to income tax. The point does not strictly arise on this appeal, and it is unnecessary to consider or discuss the question whether it would be a proper reading of the words already quoted to treat them as contemplating a profit made by a joint stock company in any profit-making \" venture\" falling within any of the different kinds of business or venture the company assessed is authorized to engage in. Most, if not all, of the decisions to which we have been referred, in which the profit in question arose from the purchase and sale of a single property or of the totality of a stock in trade of a given class, have been cases in which sale was held to have been definitely contemplated from the outset as one, at least, of the modes of dealing by which the expected profit was to be earned. In the California Copper Syndicate's Case[13], the dealing which was the source of profit under discussion was a sale of property which, it was found as a fact, had been purchased with the \" sole object\" of reselling it at a profit. In Beynon v. Ogg[14], the wagons, from the sale of which the profit there in debate was derived, were purchased, it was also found as a fact, as a speculation with the same expectation and object. In The Commissioner of Taxes v. Melbourne Trust, Ltd.[15], already referred to, the object of the company was to take over, nurse, develop and realize the assets out of the sale of which the profit in question arose.\nIt is perhaps open to doubt whether so much emphasis would have been laid upon the circumstances that the property was acquired solely with a view to selling it if the statute to be applied had been expressed in the language of the British Columbia definition. Two recent authorities not mentioned in the argument seem to suggest that in these cases this circumstance was, perhaps, over-emphasized.\nIn the Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Korean Syndicate[16], the syndicate was formed by an association of persons with the object, as expressed in the memorandum of association, of acquiring concessions and turning them to account for the profit of the shareholders. The company acquired a concession in Korea, giving it the right to prospect over a large area and the exclusive right of working minerals within a particular district in that area. The original plan was that the syndicate should work the concession with its own capital, but after proceeding in this way for some years, it was considered more advantageous to deal with the concession in another way, and in the result it was handed over to another syndicate to work it, on terms of making annual payments. In discussing the question whether or not the syndicate was assessable in respect of these annual payments, Atkin L.J. says:\nIt (the syndicate) has acquired concessions, and it has turned them to account, and the profits that arise in this matter are profits that arise from its so turning them to account. It seems to me that it does not at all matter how it chooses to turn them to account.\nIn Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[17], the controversy turned upon the character of profits realized by the company from the sale of wagons which had been used in a branch of its business concerned exclusively with the letting of wagons on hire, the principal business of the company being the manufacture of such vehicles. It was found by the commissioners that,\nas the main object of the company was to make a profit in one way or another out of making wagons and rolling stock, no sharp line could be drawn between wagons sold, wagons let on hire-purchase, and wagons let on simple hire[18],\nand that the sale of these wagons was therefore a profit-making operation in the course of the company's business. The essential conditions of assessability (where a profit proposed to be assessed is the profit derived from a sale of part of the company's property) appear to be that the company is dealing with its property in a manner contemplated by the memorandum of association as a class of operation in which the company was to engage, and, moreover, that the governing purpose in acquiring the property had been to turn it to account for the profit of the shareholders, by sale if necessary.\nReverting to the contention already mentioned, that the transaction with which we are concerned being an isolated transaction it cannot be brought within the second alterna- tive of Lord Dunedin's test, this rule would have excluded from the scope of the tax the profits under consideration in the California Copper Syndicate's Case[19] and in Beynon v. Ogg[20] ; and on principle it is not easy to understand why a profit made out of a profit-making venture which, as such, is within the scope of the memorandum of the association, is not an operation in execution of a profit-making scheme within the contemplation of the decisions, merely because that venture has been the only transaction of its kind in the history of the company.\nThe sole raison d'\u00eatre of a public company is to have a business and to carry it on. If the transaction in question belongs to a class of profit-making operations contemplated by the memorandum of association, prima facie, at all events, the profit derived from it is a profit derived from the business of the company.\nWhether a single speculation by an individual, having no relation to his ordinary calling or business, from which a profit has been derived, could be a profit-making venture within the meaning of the British Columbia statute, or an adventure within the meaning of the English Act, is a question we are not required to consider. There are obvious distinctions for this purpose between the transactions of a joint stock company and the transactions of an individual, distinctions which may, according to the circumstances, affect the incidence of income tax. As Lord Sterndale M.R. said, in the Korean Syndicate's Case[21],\nI do not admit, either, that there can be no difference for this purpose between an individual and a company. If once you get the individual and the company spending money on exactly the same basis, then there would be no difference between them at all. But the fact that the limited company comes into existence in a different way from that in which an individual comes into existence is a matter to be considered. An individual comes into existence for many purposes, or perhaps sometimes for none, whereas a limited company comes into existence for some particular purpose, and if it comes into existence for the particular purpose of carrying out a transaction by obtaining concessions and turning them to account, then that is a matter to be considered when you come to decide whether doing that is carrying on a business or not.\nThe observation of Hamilton J. (Lord Sumner), in Liverpool and London and Globe Ins. Co. v. Bennett[22], is also in point. I am of opinion (said that learned judge), that this analogy fails altogether and that the company's business cannot be split up in this way. The private individual may save to provide for his old age or his family; he has leisure to enjoy, he has ambitions to gratify, and his existence in fact can be separated into his private and his trading life. Nothing of the kind can be done with an insurance company. Its existence is limited by the scope of its memorandum and articles. It is a trading company and a trading company alone. It has no interests and no field of operations outside its business.\nMr. Davis relied mainly on two authorities: The Tebrau Rubber Syndicate's Case[23] and Stevens v. Hudson's Bay Company[24]. It is undeniable that Lord Salvesen's judgment in the first of these cases contains dicta which give some support to the contention that, assuming the timber limits in question were purchased with the primary object of logging them, though for turning them to account for profit by sale if necessary, the profits derived from the sale would not be assessable. But these are dicta only, and they are expressed in such a way as to make it at least doubtful whether Lord Salvesen intended to lay down a general proposition applicable to cases other than those in which the whole undertaking of the company is disposed of. Lord Johnston, at all events, proceeds upon the ground, as already mentioned, that the profit was realized in a transaction that involved the winding up of the company. It was not a sale in carrying on, or carrying out, the business of the company but a sale inviting the abandonment of it. Lord Salvesen appears to have been disposed to take a somewhat more restricted view of the scope of the statutory provisions he was applying that subsequent decisions would appear to warrant. The California Copper Syndicate's Case[25], in respect of which he seems to have entertained considerable doubt, was in principle approved by the Judicial Committee in the Melbourne Trust Case[26] already referred to; and if the view of his judgment is that advanced on behalf of the appellants, it would be difficult indeed to reconcile it with the judgments, or with the decision, in the Korean Syndicate's Case[27].\nAs to the Hudson's Bay Company's Case[28], the profit in question arose from a sale of land owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, the title to which was derived from the original grant, the land being included in those reserved under the well-known arrangement with the Canadian Government, through which that Government acquired ownership, speaking generally, of the lands in the Canadian Northwest. The principle of the decision is made clear by the judgments of the Master of the Rolls and Lord Justice Farwell. The transaction was considered to be analogous to a sale by an individual of ancestral lands or of pictures from his picture collection, bought as part of the collection. It was not a sale in execution of a profit-making enterprise, either \" adventure,\" or \" trade,\" or \" business.\" The Master of the Rolls likened the position of the Hudson's Bay Company, which came into being under a charter of Charles II, to that of an individual, and the Master of the Rolls and Farwell L.J., dwelt upon the difference between a chartered company, with unlimited powers (in relation to which the familiar distinction above adverted to, with respect to inviolable capital, and surplus assets distributable among the shareholders as dividends, has no meaning), and a company formed under the Joint Stock Companies Act.\nThe principle of this decision can have little application to the facts of the present case. The view taken by the Court of Appeal was that it was no part of the business of the Hudson's Bay Company to make a profit by buying and selling lands; that the transactions out of which the profits arose were merely conversions of part of the company's capital into another form; and therefore fell within the first of the categories mentioned in the citation from Lord Dunedin's judgment.\nFor these reasons, the profits now in question were assessable in the years in which they were realized; but the statute of 1921, having obviously no retrospective operation, gave no authority to the assessor to make any assessment in respect of moneys received before the enactment was passed, and the assessment must be reduced accordingly to $66,269.28. As the appellant company achieves a substantial success, it is entitled to its costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis, Pugh, Davis, Hossie & Ralston.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Killam & Beck.\n[1] [1924] 2 W.W.R. 926.\n[2] [1909] 101 L.T.R. 96.\n[3] [1910] 5 T.C. 658.\n[4] [1914] A.C. 1001.\n[5] [1898] 2 T.C. 571.\n[6] [1893] 2 T.C. 231.\n[7] [1904] 5 T.C. 159.\n[8] [1909] 101 L.T.R. 96.\n[9] [1914] A.C. 1001.\n[10] [1914] A.C. 1001, at pp. 1009 and 1010.\n[11] 6 F., 894; 5 T.C. 159.\n[12] [1918] 7 T.C. 125, at p. 132.\n[13] 5 T.C. 159.\n[14] 7 T.C. 125, at p. 130.\n[15] [1914] A.C. 1001.\n[16] [1921] 3 K.B. 258.\n[17] [1924] 40 T.L.R. 435.\n[18] 129 L.T. 691, at p. 694.\n[19] 5 T.C. 159.\n[20] 7 T.C. 125.\n[21] [1921] 3 K.B. 258 at p. 273.\n[22] 5 T.C. 159.\n[23] 5 T.C. 658.\n[24] 101 L.T.R. 96.\n[25] 5 T.C. 159.\n[26] [1914] A.C. 1001.\n[27] [1921] 3 K.B. 258.\n[28] [1921] 3 K.B. 258.\n",

The moneys received therefrom and from other sources outside the partnership affairs being deposited in the partnership account. In 1910 a settlement between the parties took place and the appellant\u2019s testator was paid $2,000 by cheque drawn upon the firm account. On appeal from a former report it had been held that, on the evidence then before the court, this sum was paid to equalize the interest of the partners in the firm\u2019s assets and that the balance of moneys in the firm\u2019s bank account after such payment was made belonged to the partnership; but the matter was referred back to the Master to permit the present respondents to adduce further evidence to controvert these conclusions.\nHeld that it must be regarded as res judicata that the sum of $2,000 was paid to equalize the interests of the partners in the then subsisting assets and that the moneys in bank after the settlement were partnership assets, unless the present respondents should prove on the reference back that any part of the moneys belonged to their testator.\nHeld also that the evidence on the reference back had not displaced the prima facie case on these points made by the appellant on the first hearing before the Master.\nIn the result the appeal was allowed to the extent of some $300 to which the appellant was entitled.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed in toto.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario restoring the local master\u2019s report which had been varied by a Judge in Chambers.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the appellant.\nH.S. White K.C. for the respondents. The CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with the reasons for judgment stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I have an impression that the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division in disposing of the appeal from the Master\u2019s last report herein, presented the correct view to be taken herein, by any one recognizing the settlement of 1909 between the parties now deceased and respectively represented herein by appellant and respondents.\nI should therefore have preferred that the appeal herein had been allowed entirely and the judgment of said Chief Justice restored.\nI cannot say, however, that I have, in face of so many diverse judicial views as have been taken of the curiosities presented by the evidence, sufficient confidence in my said impression to entitle me to dissent from the unanimous opinion of the majority of this court, and others who have had to consider the case in course of nearly six years of litigation.\nI see no useful purpose to be served by pursuing the matter further.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree with the opinion expressed in Mr. Justice Magee\u2019s judgment that the respondents did not acquit themselves of the onus which I think quite clearly rested upon them, to show that the monies deposited in the bank to the credit of the firm, $2,703.74, on the first January, 1910, were not partnership monies. I do not mean by that that there appears to be upon a review of the evidence merely a balance of considerations in favour of the appellant upon this point, but that the respondents have quite failed to produce evidence adequate to support a judgment in their favour. I think Mr. Justice Magee\u2019s reasoning is convincing, and I concur in the conclusion at which he arrived, and should accordingly allow the appeal, substituting a judgment in the sense of that conclusion. The usual consequences as to costs should follow. I can only add that it seems to be regrettable that the extent and burden of the litigation should be so outrageously disproportionate to the amount involved; but for this, I am happy to say, no responsibility rests upon the professional representatives of the parties concerned. ANGLIN J.\u2014With Mr. Justice Magee I am of the opinion that the bank accounts standing in the name of the firm of Carscallen Bros. at the date of the settlement of 1909-10 were prima facie firm assets and that the burden of proving that they were the individual property of Thomas G. Carscallen was on his representatives. I also agree with the view of that learned judge that the evidence in the record does not suffice to displace the presumption of firm ownership arising from the fact that these monies stood to the credit of the firm.\nThat the payment of $2,000 then agreed to be made to John C. Carscallen was designed to equalize the drawings of the two partners was his evidence before the master; that that payment was prima facie intended to bring about a condition of equality in interest in the assets of the firm was the holding of Mr. Justice Middleton in his reasons for judgment on appeal from the first report of the local master, or, as put in that learned judge\u2019s formal order, the declaration then made was\nthat the settlement made on the 1st of January, 1910, was to equalize the interest of the partners in the then subsisting partnership assets.\nIn his reasons for judgment Mr. Justice Middleton also said that he did not agree with the master\u2019s acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the sum of about $1,000 then in bank to the credit of the firm was vested in Thomas G. Carscallen as a result of the settlement. On the evidence, as it then stood, it was held that all the moneys in bank to the credit of the firm must be deemed firm assets. To that extent there is res judicata.\nBut a clause in the order referring the matter back to the master reserved\nliberty to the plaintiffs to establish the right, if any, of the late Thomas G. Carscallen to any of the money standing in the name of the partnership.\nThat could be done only by adducing further evidence. Mr. Justice Magee\u2019s observation as to the result of the first reference\u2014that\nthe whole attempt of the plaintiffs to prove ownership of the $2,703.74 by Thomas was abortive and the evidence offered taken as a whole was inept and inconclusive,\nis I think equally applicable to the reference back. I agree in his conclusion thus expressed:\nThe onus was dearly I think on the plaintiffs to disprove the firm\u2019s apparent ownership and this in the face of their testators\u2019 admitted heavy (?) drawings they have not done. To bring about the result indicated by Mr. Justice Middleton as the purpose of the settlement, $2,000 was paid to John C. Carscallen out of the moneys standing to the credit of the firm\u2014as that learned judge said in his judgment, \u201cby the partnership.\u201d The statement in his later memorandum\u2014\nI do not know if this was paid out of the partnership and do not determine this\u2014\nmust have reference to the reservation of liberty to adduce further evidence on the reference back. The payment being made out of moneys standing to the credit of the firm was prima facie accepted by John C. Carscallen as a firm payment and not as a payment by Thomas C. Carscallen or chargeable to him personally. As put by Mr. Justice Magee,\nhis acceptance of payment by firm cheques goes far to indicate that it was Thomas\u2019 undertaking the $2,000 should be paid by the firm and not by himself.\nAgain the evidence does not, in my opinion, displace the presumption that the payment was a firm disbursement or justify any other view being taken of it.\nThe master\u2019s second report contains these paragraphs:\u2014\n3. I find that the amount of $2,000 agreed to be paid the said J.C. Carscallen on the 1st January, 1910, and which was paid him was in full payment of his share of the profits of the undertaking business to that time.\n4. That the only other assets of the partnership business he was entitled to share in at that time was the uncollected accounts of the business on the 1st January, 1910, amounting to $1,550.40 and the plant and chattels of the partnership property.\nIn his reasons for so reporting he says:\u2014\nAbout 1910 some claim was apparently made by J.C. that he had not received his share of the profits of the business and after some negotiations and figuring his brother agreed to allow him $2,000 in payment of his share of the business to the 1st January, 1910, which was all the interest he could possibly have in the moneys deposited in the name of the firm. This amount was paid him and thereafter he could only be entitled to receive his half share of the profits of the undertaking business, being of course entitled to a half interest in the plant and chattels.\nFrom these findings it is apparent that the residue of the moneys in bank at the date of the settlement, after deducting the $2,000 to be paid to John C. Carscallen, viz., $703.74, were treated by the master as the personal property of Thomas G. Carscallen and were not taken into account as partnership assets as, in my opinion, they should have been, and, as I incline to think, the order of Mr. Justice Middleton required unless new evidence given on the reference back should establish that they were the individual property of Thomas G. Carscallen. As already stated such evidence was not given.\nIn restoring the second report of the master, which had been varied by Mulock C.J.E., the Appellate Divisional Court proceeded on the view of the matter now under consideration taken by the master, as appears from the following passage in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hodgins:\u2014\nThe Master has proceeded upon the idea, which is to my mind consistent with what occurred and with the evidence and accounts, that the settlement was payment in full up to the 1st January, 1910, of the respondent\u2019s testator\u2019s \u201cshare in the business\u201d as it is put in his first judgment or as expressed in his formal report, \u201cin the profits of the undertaking business to that time.\u201d The Master treating 1st January, 1910, as a starting point, has taken the whole accounts of the business since then and has allowed the respondents\u2019 testator one-half of everything realized except the residue of the moneys in the bank, which is now less than was shewn to be there on 1st January, 1910, charging him with what he had drawn or collected. Having regard to what is found respecting the bank accounts and to the evidence of Baker, the Master clearly meant and said that the cash in the banks was no part of the assets of the business on 1st January, 1910, but were wholly the property of the appellant\u2019s testator.\nIt would follow from what I have already indicated that in my opinion in respect of this item of the bank accounts the share of the appellant, executor of the late John C. Carscallen, should be increased, as Mr. Justice Magee would have directed on the hearing of the appeal from the order of Mulock C.J.E. varying the master\u2019s second report, by the sum of $351.87.\nIncidentally I should observe that in dealing with this matter the majority of the learned judges in the Appellate Divisional Court would appear to have been under a misapprehension of fact, as is indicated in the following paragraph from the judgment of Mr. Justice Hodgins:\u2014\nIf the money in the bank when the settlement was made was $5,847.42 and the respondent\u2019s testator became by virtue thereof entitled to one-half of it, namely, $2,700 it is odd that he should have agreed to its being used the next year as a fund out of which the appellant\u2019s testator could pay the $2,000 and so reduce his share in that asset to $1,700.\nThe balance of money in the bank when the settlement was made was not $5,847.42, but $2,703.74; $5,847.42 was a sum stated by an accountant, Baker, who gave evidence on the second reference, to represent moneys deposited to the firm credit during the period 1906-9 derived from sources other than the partnership business. As Mr. Justice Magee says The bank pass books shew moneys in the Merchants Bank on 1st January, 1910, to be in current account $1,634.63 and savings bank $1,069.11, or together $2,703.74.\nRegarding the bank accounts as they stood at the date of settlement as the individual property of Thomas G. Carscallen, the master necessarily dealt with the payment of $2,000 to John C. Carscallen as having been made, not as a firm disbursement, but as a payment on account of Thomas G. Carscallen and chargeable to him personally. In so doing I think he ignored the effect of the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton directing the reference back. Proceeding on this basis the master took no account of the $2,703.74 in bank on the 1st of January, 1910, as a firm asset, as he should have done. On the other hand he did not charge the firm account with the $2,000 paid to John C. Carscallen, which also should have been done. Taking both these items into the account would mean that the balance of $14,456.68, found by the master to be the sum distributable, should have been increased by $703.74, and the share therein of John C. Carscallen should, accordingly, have been not $1,232.77, as reported, but $1,584.64. To this extent the defendant\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nJudgment varied.\nSolicitor for the appellant: V.M. Wilson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.H. Preston.\n",

D. and others, by contract in writing, agreed to sell certain land, within a stated time, for $30,000 to W. who, within such period, was to have the exclusive right to buy it. W. had an interest in the land which, if he failed to purchase, he agreed to sell for $1,000. But, while the contract was in force, he sold this interest to R. for $4,000 of which he got paid $1,125 on account. W. did not purchase within the time stated and was tendered a deed with a cheque for $1,000 to convey his interest as agreed to D. and others. This being refused, the latter brought action for specific performance of the contract and to have the deed to R. set aside as being given without consideration and with a collusive and fraudulent intent. The trial judge dismissed the action holding the conveyance to R. to be bona fide and that performance could not be decreed. The court en banc accepted his finding of bona fides but held the plaintiffs entitled to other relief than damages against W. for breach of contract, which the trial judge held was the only remedy they had. The relief granted by the court en banc was to award to the plaintiffs the balance of the purchase money due from R. to W. and give them the benefit of a lien or charge of W. on his interest in the land for payment of his purchase money therefor.\nHeld that, under the Registry Act of Nova Scotia then in force (R.S.N.S. 1900, c. 137, s. 15), R. has acquired a title clear of all legal and equitable claims; but the option agreement was still in existence as against W. and also bound R., after he had actual notice of it, to the extent to which it was then available; and it should be given effect to on equitable principles as to the unpaid purchase money.\nThe question whether the right to the vendor's lien ever existed was not raised by the plaintiffs, nor evidence upon the subject taken at the trial.\nHeld that, the judgment appealed from (57 N.S. Rep. 262), should be varied by striking out the direction that the plaintiffs should have the benefit of any lien in favour of W. as unpaid vendor.\nEvidence was given at the trial showing that W. had obtained an advance from a bank, which was not a party to the action, on the security of the money payable to him by R.\nHeld, that R. is entitled to protection against the bank's claim and the case should be remitted to the court below to have the bank added as a party and its rights to R's purchase money ascertained. That court has inherent power to correct the error in its judgment resulting from its failure to dispose of the bank's claim. R's failure to bring this matter to the attention of the court on the settlement of the judgment would, according to the general rule of procedure, be a reason for depriving him of his costs but the court feels justified in making an exception in this case.\nIdington J. dissenting, would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellants.\nThe facts are fully stated in the head-note.\nC.

Webb, of the city of Sydney in the county of Cape Breton, real estate broker, hereinafter called the purchaser of the other part.\nWhereas, the vendors allege that they are part owners of the estate known as the Monastery of Petit Clairveaux of Big Tracadie, in the counties of Antigonish and Guysborough, and the province of Nova Scotia, containing 709\u2153 acres more or less.\nNow this agreement witnesseth that the vendors in consideration of the sum of five dollars of lawful money of the Dominion of Canada, in hand well and truly paid to them by the purchaser, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, hereby covenant and agree to sell to the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, or the nominee of the said purchaser, free from encumbrances, the said land and buildings for the sum of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) at any time before the second day of July, A.D. 1923. This offer to be irrevocable until the said last mentioned date. This offer, if accepted before the said date, shall thereupon constitute a binding contract of purchase and sale; all adjustments to be made to the date of transfer; the purchaser to examine the title at his own expense.\nThis offer may be accepted by a letter posted or telegram sent to the vendors at their last known address.\nIf the vendors paint the exterior walls of all wooden buildings and the roof of the Monastery as well, the purchaser agrees to pay for the land and buildings herein, in that event, the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000). Should the purchaser fail to buy the property herein on or before the 2nd day of July, 1923, then he will sell to the vendors for one thousand dollars ($1,000) whatever interest he may have in the herein mentioned property. The purchaser herein is hereby appointed by us to be the sole and only agent or party, from the date of the ensealing and delivery of this agreement until the said 2nd day of July, A.D. 1923, with authority to sell and purchase this property, and he is thereby given exclusive rights to sell, buy or bargain for the sale or purchase of the above estate within the time herein mentioned. We, the vendors herein, bind ourselves to abstain from any dealings, either directly or indirectly, with persons or corporations of whatsoever nature, for the purpose of sale, purchase, transfer, or dealing of or with the herein estate.\nIt is hereby declared and agreed that these presents and everything herein contained shall respectively enure to the benefit of and by binding upon the parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever.\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered in the presence of:\n(Sgd.) A. A. Ollerhead.\n(Sgd.) Tony D. Pistone (Seal)\n(Sgd.) Felix Dipenta (Seal)\n(Sgd.) Alex. Martinello (Seal)\n(Sgd.) P. J. Webb (Seal) Webb failed to buy the property on or before the 2nd July, 1923. About the 11th of July, the respondents tendered him a deed and a cheque for one thousand dollars ($1,000) for his interest in the property. He declined to accept them and then disclosed the fact that he had already deeded the property to the appellant Reeves.\nThe respondents thereupon brought this action to enforce their contract specifically, alleging that Webb had transferred his interest to Reeves for the purpose of defeating their rights under the agreement, and that such transfer was without consideration and was taken by Reeves with knowledge of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1922, and entered into between Webb and Reeves with a collusive and fraudulent intent.\nBy the prayer of their statement of claim, respondents asked for a declaration that the deed from Webb to Reeves was void, an order setting it aside, specific performance of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1922, and that the appellants should be ordered to execute a proper conveyance to the respondents of all their interest in the property; and \"such other relief as to the Honourable Court may seem right and proper.\"\nThe appellants Webb and Reeves filed separate defences.\nWebb pleaded that the agreement of the 2nd November, 1922, did not and was not intended to preclude his disposing of any interest he might have in the lands therein referred to. He denied the tender and added that, if made, it was made too late. He admitted the execution of a deed of his interest to Reeves, but denied that it was without consideration or collusion and fraudulent and that it had been made in order to defeat the respondents' rights.\nReeves also denied that the deed was without consideration and more particularly that he had knowledge of the agreement between Webb and the respondents.\nThe trial judge found that the respondents had failed to prove a covinous agreement between Webb and Reeves. He declared that he accepted the latter's evidence in full and that this showed that Reeves was not aware of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1922, which was not registered, as he had ascertained by having the records searched. Reeves was held to have been a bona fide purchaser for value of Webb's interest in the property. It was therefore immaterial whether Webb had acted in bad faith or not. Cameron v. Moseley[2]. The fact was that Webb had placed it out of his power to perform his part of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1922, and specific performance could not therefore be decreed against him. The respondents were left with the possibility of recovering damages for breach of contract against Webb, if they elected so to proceed.\nUpon appeal, while all the judges accepted the trial judge's findings of fact, a majority of the court differed from him in regard to the relief to which the respondents were entitled.\nMr. Justice Rogers, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Chisholm concurred, was of opinion that, on the facts as they appeared, there was an insuperable difficulty to granting specific performance simpliciter as against Reeves, who had honestly entered into the bargain and had completed his title by registration without notice, actual or constructive, of the agreement of the 2nd November, 1922. He thought, however, that the option agreement was still in existence as against Webb and also bound Reeves, after he had actual notice of it, to the extent to which it was then available; and that it should be given effect to on equitable principles as to the unpaid purchase money.\nWebb had sold his interest to Reeves for $4,000; he has been paid $1,125 on account of the purchase money and was still entitled to a balance of $2,875 which, in equity, was the money of the respondents and should be accounted for to them.\nThe court en banc accordingly awarded the respondents judgment against Webb for $125 representing the amount by which he had been paid in excess of the sum of $1,000 which he was to get from the respondents under the agreement of the 2nd of November. It further declared that the respondents were entitled to all unpaid purchase money in respect of the property sold by Webb to Reeves, namely, $2,875; and decreed that Reeves should pay this amount to the respondents, who, it held, were also entitled to the full right and benefit of a lien and charge of Webb, as vendor, for the unpaid purchase money against the interest in the lands conveyed by him to Reeves. In the words of Mr. Justice Rogers:\u2014\nThe court thus turned over to the respondents all the benefit of their contract upon which it could lay its hands.\nAs the view of the case on which equitable relief was thus accorded had not been presented on the pleadings or at the trial, the court en banc allowed all proper and necessary amendments and dealt with the action as if they had been formally made.\nMr. Justice Mellish dissented. Although of opinion that the disposition of the case made by the majority of the court might be justified by the facts disclosed by the evidence, he thought that it should not be made without Reeves having had an opportunity to raise such defences as he might desire to offer. He was unwilling to interpret the general prayer in the statement of claim \"for such relief as the court may think right and proper,\" as sufficient to warrant such a disposition of the rights of the parties on the pleadings and evidence as they stood. The evidence had disclosed that, in the previous November, Webb had secured an advance from the Bank of Commerce and assigned to the latter any moneys that he might receive from the sale of the property now in question. The respondents had made no intimation that they were willing to recognize such assignment. Moreover, they had thus far taken pains to have the sale from Webb to Reeves set aside and, in his opinion, unless they were now willing to affirm that sale, their only remedy lay in damages; and it was very doubtful whether they could now affirm the sale after having elected to disaffirm it.\nFinally, in his view, the appellants might have sought relief against the clause in the agreement requiring Webb to make a conveyance of his interest for $1,000, as in the nature of a penalty or forfeiture for his failure to carry out the other terms of the agreement. Under all these circumstances, he deemed it not desirable to make the disposition of the case favoured by the majority of the court.\nIt will thus be apparent that the judges in the Nova Scotia courts differ only in regard to the propriety of granting upon the present record a remedy appropriate to the state of facts upon the existence of which they are in accord.\nIt cannot be and is not disputed that, under \"The Registry Act\" of Nova Scotia then in force (R.S.N.S., 1900, c. 137, s. 15), Reeves has acquired a title clear of all legal and equitable claims. But the unregistered agreement of the 2nd November, 1922, was nevertheless a document of a nature to create an interest in land, upon its being accepted by the respondents. No repudiation by Webb resulting from the mere alienation to Reeves, in the absence of communication to respondents, could affect the latter's right to insist upon specific performance so far as possible (Williams, Vendor & Purchaser, 3rd ed., vol. 1, p. 14). The acceptance here was unconditional and made within reasonable time; and, if Webb could still set up irregularity in the tender of the 11th July, after he had rendered any tender futile by conveying the property to Reeves, any exception to it was abandoned at bar.\nWhat we have really to consider in this case, is whether the granting of the remedy decreed by the court en banc should be upheld on the present record.\nNo doubt the administration of the relief by way of specific performance is in the discretion of the court\u2014a discretion not arbitrary or capricious, but judicial, and to be exercised according to fixed rules (Lord Chelmsford in Lamarre v. Dixon) [3], yet \"more elastic than is generally permitted in the administration of judicial remedies\" (Harris v. Robinson) [4]. Although the trial judge refused to decree specific performance, he did so only because he thought that \"Webb had placed it out of his power to perform his part of the agreement.\" It is not pretended that the form of relief accorded by the appellate court was submitted for his consideration, nor does it appear that, if it had suggested itself to him, he would have refused to resort to it, rather than merely reserve to the respondents a right of action in damages against Webb.\nThe question now before us, however, is whether the remedy directed by the court en banc is not the best that could be devised under the circumstances; and, if all legitimate interests are otherwise adequately protected, whether the granting of that remedy should not be approved. It must not be forgotten that the refusal to grant specific performance, in a case like the present one, does not rest upon the nature or terms of the contract, nor\nupon any principle of justice that operates in favour of the defendant, but is based upon the necessity of the case arising out of the nature of the relief sought\n(Fry, Specific Performance, 6th ed., page 463, par. 990).\nFor that reason, it is well understood that in capacity to perform a contract \"literally and exactly\" is not a reason for refusing to perform it in substance (Fry, p. 467, par. 1001) and the courts will be anxious to compel the execution of such a contract cy-pr\u00e8s, if it is otherwise unobjectionable, and \"such a plan is feasible\" (Fry, page 470).\nThe following extract from Williams, Vendor and Purchaser (3rd ed., vol. 1, page 536), is in point:\u2014\nIf the vendor, pending completion of the original sale, re-sell the land and convey the legal estate therein to another without receiving payment of the whole price, the second purchaser is protected against the first purchaser's prior equity as regards so much of his purchase money as he has paid before receiving notice of the first sale, and is entitled to hold his legal estate as security for the amount so paid. But, after he has received such notice, he cannot safely pay the rest of his purchase money; for he will not be entitled to set up his contract of sale as specifically enforceable against the first purchaser, and, as between himself and the vendor, that contract will be rescinded and he will be discharged from all further performance of his obligation thereunder.\nReference is made in a note to Jones v. Stanley[5]; Story v. Windsor[6]; Hardingham v. Nicholls[7]; Tourville v. Naish[8]. See also XXV Halsbury, Laws of England, page 377, no. 838. But for the Registry Act, that precise relief might have been awarded here. Yielding to the requirements of the Registry Law, the court will modify the relief which it would otherwise have granted, but only so far as is necessary to meet those requirements.\nThe Appellate Court has put into effect cy-pr\u00e8s the principle expounded above; it has followed the property where it has found it, in another guise, converted into money (Ferguson v. Wilson) [9].\nThe course taken commends itself on equitable principles, unless it can be excepted to upon any legitimate ground open to the parties herein. Now the objections taken to the course followed are enumerated in the reasons of the dissenting judge in the count en banc and in the grounds taken before us by counsel for appellants. Some of them are opposed to the application of the relief generally; the others are open only to one or the other of the parties individually.\nThe first objection of Mr. Justice Mellish is that the court en banc could not dispose, as it has done, of the rights of the parties on the pleadings as they stood. But that difficulty no longer exists after all necessary amendments have been allowed. The exercise of the power to amend, when warranted, as it is here by the Judicature Act of Nova Scotia and Rule XXVIII made thereunder, is discretionary and, consistently with its jurisprudence in matters of practice and procedure, this court will rarely, if ever, interfere with it.\nAnother objection of the dissenting judge is based upon his doubt whether the respondents would be willing to accept the relief in the form ordered by the majority of the court en banc, that difficulty has also disappeared since the respondents have acquiesced in the judgment and are defending it before this court. And there is no inconsistency in their action. The result of the decree which they are now upholding is to enforce, as far as may be, the very relief which the respondents sought by their original statement of claim.\nAnother objection of the dissenting judge is that Webb might perhaps have himself claimed a relief in equity against the clause in the agreement requiring him to make a conveyance of his property worth $4,000 at least for $1,000, as a penalty or forfeiture for his failure to carry out the other terms of the agreement.\nThis objection was not taken in the statement of defence, nor apparently before the trial court. It is urged before us no doubt on account of its having been suggested by the dissenting judge in appeal.\nWe are unable to construe the clause in the agreement of November, 1922, now under consideration, as stipulating anything in the nature of a penalty or a forfeiture. It was, in fact, assented to in consideration of the main agreement by which Webb was given from the 2nd November, 1922, until the 2nd July, 1923, exclusive authority to sell, purchase or bargain for the sale or purchase of the property for the sum of $30,000 (or $35,000 if the exterior walls and roof of the monastery were painted). The agreement was irrevocable, and on a sale made during that time, any profit in excess of the stipulated sum would have belonged exclusively to Webb. On the other hand, he voluntarily agreed that, in exchange for the right thus granted, he would, if he did not buy the property before the said 2nd day of July, 1923, sell to the respondents for $1,000 whatever interest he might have in it.\nAny hardship on the defendant which might flow from the specific performance of such an agreement would be merely a consequence of the fact that his speculation proved unfortunate for him (Haywood v. Cope) [10]. The agreement apparently secured to him, at least when he signed it, an expectancy of profits corresponding in some measure with those which the respondents may now reap from their contract. Moreover, the mere inadequacy of the consideration, unaccompanied by any element of fraud or misrepresentation, would hardly afford him a good defence in the premises (Fry, 6th ed., nos. 399, 426, 436, 440, 444).\nThere remains a last objection suggested by the dissenting judge in appeal based upon the assignment by Webb to the Bank of Commerce of any money that he might receive from the monastery property. This really appears to be the most serious ground upon which the judgment a quo may be assailed.\nWhat may be the rights of the Bank of Commerce under the assignment is not by any means clear, but this no doubt is due to the fact that only a passing reference was made to it in the evidence and, at the trial, it was not thought necessary further to inquire into it.\nIt does result, however, from the judgment of the court en banc that, while the interests of the Bank of Commerce cannot be said to have been finally disposed of, because it was not a party to the case, yet the appellant Reeves is ordered to pay the balance of the purchase money to the respondents although he had been made aware of an alleged assignment of the same purchase money by Webb to the bank. Lord Langdale M.R., in re Thomas v. Bering[11], lays it down as a general principle\nthat the court will not execute a contract, the performance of which * * * would be prejudicial to persons interested in the property, but not parties to the contract. The court, before directing the partial execution of the contract by ordering the limited interest of the vendor to be conveyed, ought to consider how the proceeding may affect the interests of those who are entitled to the estate, subject to the limited interest of the vendor.\nSee also what Lord Romilly, M.R., says in Attorney-General v. Sittingbourne[12].\nReeves is undoubtedly entitled to be protected against any claim of the bank before being required to make payments to the respondents. This can properly be done by remitting this action to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in order that the Bank of Commerce may be added as a party to it and that proper steps may then be taken to ascertain what rights, if any, it has in the money payable under the Webb-Reeves contract, and to determine the respective priorities of the bank and the respondents in regard thereto. That being done, proper directions can be given for payment by Reeves; and, on complying with them, his contractual obligations will be fully discharged.\nThe consideration given to the objections of Mr. Justice Mellish has disposed of all but one of the points in respect of which the appellants at bar alleged error in the judgment of the court en banc.\nThere remains only the objection resulting from the fact that the judgment appealed from decided that the appellant Webb had a vendor's lien against the estate of the appellant Reeves in the lands in question and that the respondents are entitled to the benefit of such lien.\nThe question whether the right to this lien ever existed was not raised by the pleadings. No evidence upon the subject was taken at the trial, and neither there nor in the court en banc was the matter ever mentioned.\nHad the issue been raised, it would no doubt have been open to Reeves either to show that the right of lien had been expressly waived or that for other reasons such a lien did not exist or was not available to the respondents.\nIt is, however, unnecessary further to inquire into the propriety of the decree of the court en banc in that respect, since the declaration of the existence of a lien was not really material for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion which has been reached. Counsel for the respondents has stated before us that he did not insist upon the maintenance of the lien and the objection of the appellant Reeves on that ground can be met by striking out from the formal judgment any reference to the existence of such lien and charge in favour of Webb as unpaid vendor.\nIn the result, it follows therefore that this court finds itself in accord with the disposition which the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc has made of this case and with the relief which it has seen fit to grant to the respondents, save the declaration of lien, and subject to the further inquiry into the respective rights of the respondents as found by that judgment and those of the Canadian Bank of Commerce.\nIt is eminently satisfactory that the matters in controversy can be thus finally determined and further litigation avoided. This accords with the spirit of the Judicature Act.\nWhile, however, pleadings may be amended at any stage in order to do justice, care should be taken that issues should not be determined without due notice and hearing, and this is a principle which we are sure is fully recognized by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, but unfortunately in this case, in working out a measure of equitable relief and directing the necessary amendments, the majority of the court failed to consider the possibly competing rights of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, which, as appears from the testimony of one of its local managers, had, in order to secure an advance to the appellant Webb, obtained from him an assignment of any moneys payable from a sale of the Monastery property which might include the moneys payable by Reeves. The court was not, however, lacking in inherent jurisdiction to correct this error and to give directions which would have avoided the necessity of this appeal, and it would have been good practice and in the interests of economy if the appellant Reeves had presented his grievance to the court when the judgment came to be settled, and the fact that he failed to do so would ordinarily be a reason for depriving him of the costs of this appeal in accordance with the principle enunciated in Tucker v. N. B. Trading Co.[13]; and Wilson v. Carter[14]. The following observation of Lord Hobhouse in the latter case is applicable:\nTheir Lordships do not doubt that the court has power at any time to correct an error in a decree or order arising from a slip or accidental omission, whether there is or is not a general order to that effect.\nA fortiori of course the court has power to correct slip or an oversight in the judgment pronounced when settling the terms of a decree or order. His Lordship proceeded to say:\nUnfortunately the respondent did not take the proper course of applying to the Supreme Court to correct the accidental omission in the order granting leave to appeal. If he had done so no doubt the mistake would have been put right as a matter of course.\nThe suggestion was, however, made during the course of the argument, and it met with no denial, that this jurisdiction is not exercised in Nova Scotia, and, moreover, since the right of the bank was one of the grounds of dissent expressed by Mellish, J., the appellant Reeves may have considered that the question had not escaped consideration by the majority of the court. In these circumstances we are disposed to think that the appellant Reeves ought not to be deprived of his costs of this appeal; but, for the reasons which we have stated, this case must be regarded as an exception from the rule of practice which prevails in this court that costs will not be allowed for the correction of an error upon appeal which might conveniently have been set right by application to the court below.\nFor these reasons the appeal of the appellant Reeves should be allowed; the judgment should be varied by striking out the declaration of lien, and the action should be remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to add the Canadian Bank of Commerce as a party and to inquire into and determine the respective priorities of the appellants and the bank with respect to the moneys payable under the agreement of sale from Webb to Reeves; further directions and subsequent costs reserved to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The appellant Reeves should have his costs of this appeal. Idington, J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by respondents against appellants in which the former, suing upon an agreement giving an option, alleged by their declaration that appellant Webb had, in order to defraud respondents of their rights under said option, conveyed the land in question to his co-appellant, Reeves, who well knew such fraudulent purpose, and respondents sought to have the said conveyance to Reeves set aside, and specific performance of said option directed.\nThe learned trial judge who heard the evidence of Reeves accepted his story and found he had bought in good faith and for valuable consideration and paid a substantial part of the price.\nThe action was accordingly dismissed with costs. The respondents made no application to amend their pleadings, nor, so far as I can see, was the case fought out on any other issue than that raised by said pleadings.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal that court maintained said findings of fact, but seemed, by a majority, to discover some other cause of action that respondents might have in way of following the fruits of the sale from Webb to Reeves through a presumed vendor's lien that Webb might have in virtue of the sale made by him to Reeves, and allowed the appeal to that court.\nI may say there was no evidence adduced on that point and indeed the pleadings would not, until amended, permit of such a trial.\nIt is by no means certain to my mind that, under the circumstances, a lien existed.\nA vendor's lien is so often defeated by reason of the attendant circumstances that accompany or ensue upon the carrying out of a sale that I would be very loath to hold that one existed unless a straight issue, of that question of its existence, had been raised at the trial.\nMoreover there does appear, accidentally as it were, evidence leading me to believe it quite probable that the agreement of Reeves with Webb had been entirely assigned by Webb to the Canadian Bank of Commerce as security. If so, the said bank would, even if the existence of a vendor's lien was put beyond peradventure, have to be made a party in order to protect appellant Reeves. The last word may not have been said on the question of respondents' right to enforce the option they claim.\nFor the foregoing reasons and those assigned by Mr. Justice Mellish in his dissenting opinion, I think this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored; without prejudice, however, to the respondents' rights, if any, to bring another action for other causes of action, than the issue fully tried out in this action.\nI cannot refrain from observing that by his factum respondents' counsel, though two courts below have decided against the cause of action set up, seems far from being convinced that it has no foundation.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: R.

Also, that when at the shipper\u2019s request the goods were carried in open cars the carrier would only be liable for negligence and upon it would be the burden of proving freedom from such negligence. Goods were shipped on open cars upon which it was the duty of the shipper to load them.\nHeld, that the carrier has not discharged the burden of proving freedom from negligence if the court or jury is left in a state of real doubt as to negligence or no negligence.\nHeld also, that the carrier is not obliged to show how the accident causing injury to the goods was brought about; he is only required reasonably to satisfy the judge or jury that all possible precautions were taken against risks to be reasonably anticipated. In this case the evidence did not suffice for a decision either as to the negligence in whole or in part of the shipper in loading the cars or as to whether or not the accident was due to a defect in the car or railway or neglect in working the railway for which the carrier is answerable. Therefor a new trial is ordered.\nPer Idington J. dissenting. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (54 Ont. L.R. 238) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment of a Judge in Chambers in favour of the appellant.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note.\nLafleur K.C. and Leacy K.C. for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. and John D. Spence for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This arises out of an action tried by the Honourable Mr. Justice Logie wherein appellant sought to recover damages done to its goods shipped at Hamilton to be carried to Grand\u2019M\u00e8re in Quebec, and which were destroyed in an accident, near Elliott in Eastern Ontario, as the result of the first of the two cars on which they were loaded having evidently got off the track followed by some fourteen more cars all of which were more or less wrecked.\nThe learned trial judge found the respondent liable and entered judgment for $52,928.72.\nThe now respondent appealed therefrom to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nThat court reversed said judgment and dismissed the action.\nSome remarkable propositions of law and fact put forward on the argument before us induced me to read the entire evidence in the case and as result thereof and perusal of the several judgments respectively of the learned trial judge and those writing in the Appellate Division, and due consideration thereof, I have come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge\u2019s judgment was well founded and should be restored.\nI agree entirely in his statement of the facts so far as that sets them forth as it does fully in a general sense and see no useful purpose to be served by repeating same here.\nHe, at the close thereof and his reasons for judgment, rested same upon a needlessly narrow basis which has been laid hold of in argument in the court below and here, as if covering all he had said worthy of consideration.\nThe paragraphs I refer to are as follows:\u2014\nSitting as a jury, I draw the inference upon the evidence of Leslie Wilson and others of the defendants\u2019 servants, that the defendants\u2019 theory as to how the accident occurred cannot be the true one.\nThat a load which had travelled 210 miles without oscillation or loosening of its packing, should suddenly run amock on a smooth and perfect piece of track by reason of an alleged breaking of some packing under the deck of the car, seems incredible.\nHad the accident occurred on a curve, I could understand the force of the argument, but there was uncontradicted evidence that upon a track and roadbed such as was proved to exist at the point of derailment such an oscillation as Wilson described was impossible.\nHow, then, did the accident occur? A broken flange, a weakened spring, a sudden failure of the running gear, any one of these would account for it.\nBut the defendants do not help the court as to these possibilities. They are obvious possibilities from which unexplained negligence might be inferred and they are not eliminated.\nBut I do not base my judgment on these.\nThere is evidence for me, sitting as a jury, to act upon in the admittedly defective condition of the car flooring from which I draw the inference that the accident happened by reason of this giving way suddenly\u2014thus setting up the oscillation observed by Wilson and in consequence, the wreck.\nI respectfully submit that the entire possibilities, indeed probabilities, of the cause of the accident were far from being confined by the evidence to \u201cthe admittedly defective condition of the car flooring\u201d or its giving way suddenly.\nThat, and much other, evidence in the case tends to demonstrate that the car was an old one liable to have many weaknesses besides that one.\nThat flooring being now admittedly so suggests its condition should be taken as an indication and guide, that old age in all the parts of that car, despite its having been in a repair shop, as alleged in respondent\u2019s factum, but for obvious reasons not laboured with in the evidence, should be looked to for the many other possible causes of its strange movements.\nHence we should, looking to the almost overwhelming evidence of experts and others as to the actual cause of the accident, ask how such a getting on the rail and consequent fall could have happened, and if we apply our own common sense to the facts so submitted, we shall find there evidently was something far beyond the breakage of some material used to secure safe carriage. The train was on a safe level track at the time in question. The mere breakage of a small block of wood, put there for safety sake, even if it occurred as contended, would not account for the car climbing the rail and bringing about the disastrous consequences now in question.\nBut if by reason of other defects correspondent with the results of old age which rendered the floor of the car such as never should have been tendered for such use as asked for by appellant, led to its climbing the rail, then such motion on its part would account for the breaking of the pieces of wood used to tie it there.\nThe story about another like piece of wood having been found farther back is simply not proven. No one pretends to swearing it was found immediately after the accident where someone says it was found next day.\nHow many curious people crowd into the scene of such an accident and pick up and throw away anything found.\nThe pitiable part of this whole business in question herein, is that no real and proper method of investigation was immediately instituted, and hence no explanation forthcoming but such inferences as are, I submit, quite unwarrantable, are presented as if facts. Neither the wheel nor any part of the truck it belonged to was sought out for identification and inspection of their breakages, and I cannot agree that in any way has the respondent discharged the onus cast upon it which the bill of lading contract does.\nRes ipsa needs some knowledge of facts to permit it to speak. It goes far enough here to tell us that the actual application made, though not in express words, was in defiance of the story res ipsa tells.\nThis putting of the cart before the horse, however ingenious, is met by evidence shewing that the destruction of these blocks of wood was more likely to have been the result of the car leaving by climbing the rails and that caused by some other accidental defect in its flange being broken or a weakened spring, or sudden failure of its running gear.\nI do not think that the learned trial judge at all intended to discard such possibilities, but inadvertently expressed himself as if he intended to, and found part only of the full grounds on which he desired to rely, as his previous expression indicated. At all events it is the wider aspect of the case I desire to present and which seems in accordance with the facts as he has presented them in earlier passages.\nI cannot agree with Mr. Justice Ferguson\u2019s view that the appellant was bound to see by close inspection the actual nature and unseen defects of the car offered and that the respondent\u2019s liability under its bill of lading was not bound by its acts in regard thereto as part of its obligation to demonstrate that it had not been negligent.\nIt is proven by more than one witness that the system adopted for safely packing upon a flat car such goods as in question for transportation, had been in use by appellant for twelve years or more, and no railway accident ever heard of as result thereof. The extent to which this was the case during said period is not told. If ten or twenty times or more a year it might have absolutely demonstrated the absurdity of oscillation theory being relied upon so successfully as it has been.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault and Maclean JJ.), was delivered by:\u2014\nDUFF J.\u2014By the first section of the bill of lading, so called,\nthe carrier of the goods herein described shall be liable for any loss or damage thereto except as hereinafter provided.\nBy sec. 3,\nthe carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay to any of the goods herein described caused by * * * inherent vice in the goods or the act or default of the shipper or owner.\nAnd again, by section 3:\nwhen * * * at the request of the shipper, the goods are transported in open cars, * * * the carrier * * * shall be liable only for negligence; and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier.\nThe liability of the carrier declared by section 1 is qualified by the exceptions expressed in the sentences quoted from section 3. The onus is, of course, upon the carrier to bring himself within the exceptions; and, in the present instance, the respondents could, in point of law, establish freedom from responsibility by bringing themselves within the conditions of either of these exceptions. The open car on which the machinery was carried was supplied at the request of the appellant company, and under the regulation of the Board of Railway Commissioners, it was the duty of the appellant company to load the car\u2014a duty which they undertook to perform. If the derailment and consequent injury to the machinery were directly caused, in whole or in part, by negligent loading, the appellant company is not entitled to recover, because, if that be so, the loss is at least a loss caused in part by its negligence, and that circumstance, according to settled and well-known principles, disentitles it to recover any part of the loss. Again, it is open to the respondents to shew freedom from negligence on their part, or, in other words, that the accident did not arise from any want of care on their part. This, of course, would be an answer to the appellant company\u2019s action. We think it is of some importance to notice rather particularly this point touching the burden of proof. We think the last words of section 3, \u201cthe burden of proving freedom from negligence shall be on the carrier,\u201d cast upon the respondents the burden of proof in point of substantive law; that is to say, if, when all the evidence is in, the tribunal of fact has not been satisfied upon the point, but is left in a state of real doubt as to negligence or no negligence (negligence here, of course, means negligence causing the damage in respect of which the claim is made), then the issue must be decided against the respondents.\nThe respondents are, of course, in a vastly more favourable position as touching knowledge and means of ascertaining facts bearing upon this issue than the appellants; and that is a circumstance which may very materially affect the decision of the question whether, on any given state of the evidence, the respondents are entitled to ask the court to hold that the evidence produced is sufficient to support a conclusion that the accident was not due to a failure on the part of their servants to exercise proper care in relation to the sufficiency of the company\u2019s cars or equipment or the working of their railway. It is, perhaps. needless to say that the respondents, in order to bring themselves within this exception, are not required to shew how the accident was brought about. They are not obliged to demonstrate \u201cfreedom from negligence.\u201d Evans v. Astley[1]. It is sufficient if they produce evidence reasonably satisfying the tribunal of fact that all proper precautions have been taken in order to provide against risks which might reasonably be anticipated.\nThese, then, were the issues which it devolved upon the learned trial judge to deal with on the evidence. The judgment of the learned judge, holding the respondents responsible, was based upon a finding of fact which is expressed by him in these words:\nThere is evidence for me, sitting as a jury to act upon in the admittedly defective condition of the car flooring from which I draw the inference that the accident happened by reason of this giving way suddenly\u2014thus setting up the oscillation observed by Wilson and in consequence, the wreck.\nIt is sufficiently clear from other passages in the judgment, that by this the learned trial judge means that the armature broke through the floor in a downward direction, and this he ascribes to\nnegligence in supplying a car unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended and dangerous for a heavy load by reason of the defective condition of the floor or deck.\nThe learned judge appears to assume that the semi-circular body of metal which constituted the load was sustained by the wooden deck or flooring of the car, two and a quarter inches thick, and that it was so placed that if this wooden deck or floor proved in itself to be insufficient to support the weight concentrated in the spaces occupied by the two feet of this semicircular arc, the accident which resulted must be ascribed to the negligence of the respondents in supplying a car with such a floor.\nNow if the armature in fact was loaded in such a way that a wooden floor, two and a quarter inches thick, was required to support, unaided, such a strain, then we should have thought that, however flawless the condition of the floor, prima facie any accident resulting from the load breaking through in consequence of the floor being insufficient to stand the strain put upon it by the weight of the load must be ascribed to the negligence of the persons who acted so foolishly as to place such a weight upon a support so manifestly insufficient. If that were the true account of what occurred, we should have said that the respondents\u2019 case was complete, for, as already mentioned, it is sufficient for the respondents in this case to shew that the accident or default of the shipper was in part the direct cause of the accident.\nBut this rather easy way of disposing of the litigation is, when the facts are taken into account, inadmissible.\nIt was not seriously argued here on either side that the load was so placed as to make the support of the ends of the metal arc dependent upon the strength and rigidity of the wooden floor. The real support for the load was the metal frame of the car upon which those parts of the floor rested which were occupied by the feet of the arc. The wooden frame was subjected to forces of compression, but, if the bolts and the blocking held, not to any breaking strain, and the learned judge\u2019s account of the manner in which the accident happened must clearly be rejected.\nThe learned judge also finds that the wooden blocks, which were screwed up against the frame of the car by bolts passing through the feet of the armature for the purpose of steadying the load by receiving any strain due to oscillation or swaying, were sufficient for their purpose; but we cannot escape the impression that the learned judge was under a misapprehension as to the disposition of these blocks of wood and the exact purpose they were designed to serve, for, if he had appreciated the manner in which the feet of the armature were supported and secured, we do not think he could have reached the conclusion expressed in the finding just discussed.\nThe learned judge also expressed a view that the appellants had not satisfied the onus resting upon them of disproving negligence. The language of the learned judge, however, lends itself to the interpretation that the respondents, in order to acquit themselves of this onus, must in some way identify the cause of the collapse of the car, and shew that this was a cause for which they are not answerable under the stipulations of the contract.\nOn the two cardinal issues\u2014on the one hand whether the accident was caused, in whole or in part, by the default of the appellants in performance of their duty to exercise proper care in loading the car; and, on the other, whether the accident was due to some defect in the car or railway or some act or neglect in the working of the railway, for which the respondents are answerable; the judgment of the learned trial judge does not disclose findings which can properly be made the basis of a decision.\nWe have carefully considered the judgments in the Appellate Division but we have come to the conclusion that the issues of fact involved in this case cannot satisfactorily be decided by an appellate court, deprived of the means which a trial judge has at his command of estimating and testing the value of expert and other evidence in the course of its development, and without the assistance of findings on the relevant issues by a trial judge, and that there should be a new trial. We have accordingly refrained from discussing the points in controversy further than seemed absolutely necessary. There should be a new trial, and all costs, including the costs of the abortive trial, should abide the event.\nAppeal allowed. New trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gibson, Levy, Scott & Inch.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacMurchy & Spence.\n[1] [1911] A.C. 678.\n",

V, c. 28, ss. 8, 9; 9-10 Geo. V, c. 55, s. 7; 10-11 Geo. V, c. 49, ss. 11, 13; 11-12 Geo. V, c. 33, s. 4\u2014 Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. (1906), c. 139, ss. 36, 41 (b)\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 706, 761, 1024 (a), 1029. Section 9 (1) of The Income War Tax enacts that for every default in complying with certain sections persons in default \"shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty of $25 for each day during which default continues.\" The respondent, having pleaded guilty on an information laid for a breach of section 8 of the Act, was fined $3 per day, the magistrate holding that he could, in his discretion, impose a lesser penalty; and the decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The appellant moved for special leave to appeal to this court.\nHeld, that special leave to appeal to this court could not be granted.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014The proceeding in this case does not fall within the civil jurisdiction of this court under s. 41 (b) of the Supreme Court Act, but is a \"criminal cause\" within the meaning of the exception in s. 36 of that Act.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The proceeding being in form a criminal proceeding and the judgment not being a mere order for the payment of money, the right of appeal to this court, if any, must be found in the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nMOTION for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the decision of a police magistrate imposing, under s. 9 (1) of The Income War Tax Act a less penalty than $25 for each day's default by the respondent in complying with s. 8 of said Act.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nC. F. Elliott for the motion.\nD'Arcy Scott contra.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014By s. 8 of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, as enacted in 1920 (10-11 Geo. V, c. 49, s. 11), the duty is imposed upon any person who has not made a return, or a complete return as directed by that statute, of delivering to the Minister of Finance, upon demand by him, such information, additional information or return as he may require. For default in complying with the Minister's demand such person by s.s. 1 of s. 9 of the statute (as amended, by s. 7 of c. 55 of the statutes of 1919, s. 13 of c. 49 of the statutes of 1920, and s. 4 of c. 33 of the statutes of 1921), is made liable on summary conviction to a penalty of $25 for each day during which such default shall continue.\nAdmittedly in default under s. 8, the respondent on conviction was fined $3 per day, the magistrate taking the view that s. 1029 of the Criminal Code applied and gave him discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty not exceeding $25 a day. The informant insisting that only the fine nominated in the statute of $25 a day could be imposed, at his instance a case was stated by the magistrate under s. 761 of the Criminal Code for the opinion of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. That court upheld the magistrate's decision and supported its conclusion by reference to Rex v. Thompson Mfg. Co.[2]. The contrary view was taken by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in The King v. Smith[3]. This conflict might have presented matter for an appeal by leave of a judge of this court under s. 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code, had the case been otherwise proper for the application of that provision. But the proposed appeal is not by a provincial Attorney General, or by a person convicted, from a judgment of a court of appeal setting aside or affirming a conviction. Section 1024 (a), therefore, does not apply.\nIn its present application the Crown would treat the case not as falling under the sections of the Criminal Code providing for appeals, but rather as coming within the civil jurisdiction of this court, and, having been refused leave to appeal by the Supreme Court of Alberta, now moves for leave under clause (b) of the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The applicability of s. 41 is expressly restricted to cases within sec. 36 and by that section jurisdiction to entertain appeals \"in criminal causes\" is ex- cluded. We are thus confronted with the question whether the proceeding under the summary conviction provisions of the Criminal Code, made applicable by s. 706 of the code and s. 9 of The Income War Tax Act, to enforce the penalty imposed by s. 9 for a violation of s. 8 of the latter statute in which the defendant was convicted and fined, is a \"criminal cause\" within the meaning of the exception in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nA difference of opinion in regard to the purview of the word \"criminal\" in s. 36 in Re McNutt[4], was settled by the judgment of the majority of this court, as then constituted, in Mitchell v. Tracey[5], where it was determined that\nan application for a writ of prohibition to restrain a magistrate from proceeding on a prosecution for violating the provisions of the Nova Scotia Temperance Act arose out of a criminal charge\nand could not be made the subject of an appeal under the Supreme Court Act. In 1921 this court, following its decision in the case last mentioned, unanimously declined to entertain an appeal in the case of The King v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.[6]; and, on appeal by special leave, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee[7] affirmed our lack of jurisdiction. The importance of this decision is that it finally determined that the word \"criminal\" in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act is employed in the broad sense ascribed to it in Mitchell v. Tracey5. Compare Ex parte Wood-Hall[8]; Ex parte Schofield[9], and Provincial Cinematograph Theatre v. Newcastle Profiteering Committee[10]. Lord Sumner, quoting the language of one of the judgments delivered in Re McNutt4, said, at page 186 (4):\u2014\nTheir lordships are of opinion that the word \"criminal\" in the section and in the context in question is used in contradistinction to \"civil\" and \"connotes a proceeding which is not civil in its character.\"\nHis Lordship added:\nAfter all, the Supreme Court Act is concerned not with the authority, which is the source of the \"criminal\" law under which the proceedings are taken, but with the proceedings themselves. We have, therefore, to inquire whether the proceeding against the respondent was in its character civil or was criminal in the sense indicated.\nThere has been some difference of opinion in England as to whether a proceeding to enforce by summary conviction penalties imposed for contraventions of statutory law not ordinarily regarded as criminal should be deemed criminal in determining the admissibility of the evidence of the accused, the right of appeal to the court of criminal appeal and similar questions. Reference may be made to Attorney General v. Radloff[11]; Osborne v. Milman[12]; Attorney General v. Bradlaugh[13]; Re Douglas[14]; Cattell v. Ireson[15]; The King v. Hausmann et al[16]. But none of these cases appears to be at all so closely in point as the decision of the Court of Appeal (Bowen and Kay, L.JJ.) in The Queen v. Tyler & The International Commercial Coy., Ltd.[17].\nSection 47 of the English Judicature Act (1873) excludes from the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal an appeal from a judgment of the High Court in any criminal cause or matter. By s. 26 of the Companies' Act, 1862, every company under the Act having a capital divided into shares was required at least once a year to make within a prescribed period a list of shareholders with certain particulars and to forward a copy thereof to the registrar of joint stock companies. By s. 27 it was provided that for default the company should incur a penalty not exceeding \u00a35 for every day during which such default continued and that every director and manager knowingly and wilfully authorizing such default should incur a like penalty. On information laid before him charging the co-defendant company with default under s. 26, Alderman Tyler, a city magistrate, refused a summons. The appellant obtained a rule nisi for a mandamus. The Queen's Bench Division discharged the rule. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal and its jurisdiction was challenged under s. 47. The court held that the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division was a judgment in a criminal cause or matter and rejected the appeal.\nBowen L.J. said that s. 26 created a duty breach of which would be disobedience of the law, and, therefore, an offence, which, unless the statute otherwise provided, would be indictable. The company might not escape the duty by paying the penalty; the duty imposed was positive, and the penalty provided was punishment for the offence committed by a breach of it.\nKay L.J. regarded the duty imposed under s. 26 as very important in the interest of the public as well as of the shareholders; the penalty was not intended to be an equivalent for the omission to perform the duty since it was \"\u00a35 a day during which the default continues\"; the penalty was of such a character that it clearly was intended as a punishment such as would compel the company to fulfil the duty. It was inflicted by way of punishment and not as a compensation for the breach.\nThe appeal was rejected on the ground\nthat the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear matters which belong to the criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the country, the intention of the Judicature Act being to keep that class of case beyond the scope and reach of the Court of Appeal.\nAlmost equally in point is The Mayor etc. of Southport v. The Birkdale Urban District Council[18], heard by Lord Esher M.R., and Lopes and Chitty L.JJ. A local Act provided\nthat if it shall at any time be proved to the satisfaction of any two justices * * * that the illuminating power of the gas supplied by the corporation did not when tested * * * equal the illuminating power by this Act prescribed\nthe corporation shall forfeit such sum, not exceeding \u00a320, as such justices shall determine, to be paid to the local board. Upon information, and after hearing, the justices convicted the corporation and fined it \u00a310, and then stated a case for the opinion of the High Court which reversed the decision of the justices and set aside the conviction. The informant appealed and a preliminary question was as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under s. 47 of the Judicature Act. The court unanimously held that the judgment appealed against was a judgment in a criminal cause or matter and as such non-appealable. Lord Esher said: There were an information, a summons, and a conviction. It is contended that What was asked for was the payment of a debt. It is impossible to maintain that contention. Nothing was due to any one from the corporation for which an action could be brought * * * It is impossible to say that they did not determine that the corporation must pay \u00a310 by way of penalty for disobedience to the Act of Parliament.\nLopes L.J. said:\nThere is every element and incident of a criminal matter. The proceedings were commenced by information; a summons was issued; there was an appearance before justices who would adjudicate under the provisions of Jervis's Act (11-12 Vict., c. 43); and the proceedings end in a conviction and the imposition of a penalty under s. 40 of the local Act. Can anything be more like a criminal matter than that? The proceedings were before a criminal tribunal, and commenced and ended in the same way as ordinary criminal proceedings. * * * Putting aside the procedure, and looking only at the provisions of s. 40 of the local Act, by which a duty is imposed on the corporation, disobedience to that duty by the corporation is a misdemeanour at common law and is indictable. Looking at the case from that point of view, it is impossible to say that disobedience to the provisions of s. 40 is not a criminal offence. It has been argued that imprisonment could not follow, and that therefore this is not a criminal matter. That is so in this case, because the proceedings are against a corporation. But if the proceedings had been against an individual, it would be impossible to say that in this case imprisonment might not follow. That contention is dealt with in The Queen v. Tyler [19] and altogether fails.\nChitty L.J. added:\nBoth in form and substance these proceedings were criminal. They were commenced by information and summons; there was a conviction, and the imposition of a penalty. A case was stated for the opinion of the High Court and the appellants entered into recognizance to prosecute the appeal. As to the form, there cannot be any doubt. As to the substance, the conclusion is the same.\nWe think it clear that s. 8 of the Income War Tax Act imposed a duty in the public interest; that default in performing that duty constituted an offence against the public law; and that Parliament provided for the infliction of a prescribed punishment by a tribunal which ordinarily exercises criminal jurisdiction and by procedure enacted by the Criminal Code. Clifford v. O'Sullivan[20].\nBut, although a civil liability might be imposed, if Parliament provides for its enforcement by a proceeding in its nature criminal, that that proceeding would be a criminal cause within the purview of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act would seem to follow from the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in Seaman v. Burley[21]. Lord Esher, in holding that a judgment on a case stated by justices on an application to enforce payment of a poor-rate by warrant of distress was a judgment in a criminal cause or matter within s. 47 of the Judicature Act, said, at page 346:\nIt seems to me that the question is really one of procedure. The question is whether the proceeding which was going on was a criminal cause. That it is a question of procedure may be easily seen by taking the case of an assault. An assault may be made the subject of civil procedure by action, in which case there may be an appeal to this court; or it may be made the subject of criminal procedure by indictment, in which case there cannot be such an appeal. This seems to me to be contrary to the argument employed by the counsel for the appellant to the effect that the question depends upon whether the origin of the proceeding, i.e., the matter complained of, is in its nature criminal or not. In each case the thing complained of is the same, namely, the assault; but there is or is not an appeal to this court according as the procedure to Which recourse is had is civil or criminal. Therefore, assuming the contention that the rate is a debt to be well founded, which I do not admit, nevertheless, if the legislature have enacted that it may be recovered or enforced by criminal procedure, there can be no appeal to this court.\nLord Justice Kay said, at page 349:\nIf I followed the argument correctly, it was that, where non-fulfilment of a liability is a criminal act, the proceeding to enforce it may be treated as criminal, but that where it is not a criminal act, the proceeding cannot be so treated. It appears to me that, if there be a provision in a statute that that which is merely a civil liability may be enforced by a proceeding in its nature criminal, that proceeding is none the less criminal for the purpose of s. 47 of the Judicature Act, 1873, because it is applied to a civil liability. If the proceedings intended by a statute to enforce a civil obligation are in the nature of criminal proceedings, then there cannot I think, under s. 47, be an appeal to this court. I think that this distinction is admirably dealt with by Cotton L.J. in The Queen v. Barnardo[22]. He there said: \"Section 47 does not mean that no appeal shall lie when the act which originates the proceedings in which the order was made is a crime, but it means that no appeal shall lie when the cause or matter in which the order was made is in the nature of a criminal proceeding. In Ex parte Bell Cox[23], it was held that an appeal lay from the granting of a habeas corpus, because the proceeding in which it was granted was a civil proceeding. In Ex parte Alice Woodhall[24], it was held that the refusal of a habeas corpus could not be appealed from, because the refusal was in a criminal proceeding. This shews the distinction. In my opinion the question is, not whether the act which is said to have been done by Dr. Barnardo is one for which he was liable to be indicted, but whether the proceeding in which the order was made was a criminal cause or matter.\" I take that to be the true distinction. Therefore it does not matter whether the non-payment of the rate is a criminal act or not. If the proceeding against the person who does not pay the rate is in its nature criminal, there cannot be an appeal to this court in it. I think the result of the decisions is that the question whether there is such an appeal does not depend on the nature of the obligation, but on the nature of the proceedings.\nLord Justice Smith delivered judgment to the same effect.\nIn The Queen v. Whitchurch[25], Brett L.J. said, at p. 537:\nI am of the opinion that we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, because the legislature has treated the matter as criminal. By the Public Health Act, 1875, certain things are prohibited, and certain other things are directed to be done by the owners or occupiers; and it has been enacted that if a default occurs, the person in default shall be subject to a penalty recoverable before justices by Jervis's Acts. The legislature has decreed that a penalty shall be imposed on a person offending against the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875; and it has been decided in Mellor v. Denham[26] that to treat the matter in that manner is to treat it as a criminal matter.\nThe observation of Lord Sumner in the Nat Bell Liquors Case[27], at p. 168, that:\nthe Supreme Court Act is concerned * * * with the proceedings themselves,\nindicates that the words \"criminal cause\" in s. 36 of that Act have the same purview and effect as was given to the words \"criminal cause or matter\" in s. 47 of the English Judicature Act in the two cases last cited. But see Rex v. Governor of Brixton Prison[28].\nWhenever a statute imposes a penalty by way of punishment for non-observance of a behest which it enacts in the public interest and the prescribed penalty is made enforceable by criminal procedure, these proceedings fulfil the two conditions connoted by the word \"criminal\" as used ins. 36 of the Supreme Court Act. Clifford v. O'Sullivan[29]. A decision by a judicial tribunal of any question raised in or with regard to them, at whatever stage it arises, is a decision in a criminal cause; Ex parte Woodhall[30]; and, as such, is within the exception in s. 36; and the existence of an alternative remedy of a civil nature would not affect that conclusion. Queen v. Whitchurch25.\nLeave to appeal must, therefore, be refused with costs.\nIDINGTON J. concurred in the result. DUFF J.\u2014It is rather important to notice that the sole point for consideration is whether or not the proceeding out of which this appeal arises falls within the description \"criminal cause\" in the sense in which those words are used in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act. Happily, in my view, it is unnecessary to discuss the scope of such words as \"crime\" and \"criminal cause\" in the abstract; an enticing subject, perhaps, for logomachy, but, in my view of the effect of s. 36, of little importance here. Nor, according to the opinion I have formed, is it necessary to consider whether default in making a return or supplying information pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Income War Tax Act is for all purposes a criminal offence. The penalty imposed by s. 9 is recoverable in the Exchequer Court; and besides the consideration that proceedings on the Revenue Side of the Exchequer Court, now on the Revenue Side of the King's Bench, for the recovery of penalties for smuggling have been definitely held not to fall within the category of criminal proceedings, In re Hausmann[31], there is the circumstance that the Exchequer Court of Canada is not and probably cannot be a court of criminal jurisdiction. These considerations suggest, perhaps, that proceedings under the Income War Tax Act for the recovery of penalties for such defaults as are here in question, if considered from the point of view of that Act alone, lie in very debatable ground; on\nthe boundary line which divides civil from criminal matters\nto use the phrase of Lindley L.J., in Attorney General v. Bradlaugh[32].\nWe are here, however, concerned only with the proper application of a particular phrase in a particular statute; and that question is capable, in my view, of being decided upon a ground that can be stated very briefly. For the purpose of determining the scope of the proviso to s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act, under which appeals in criminal causes are limited to the appeals provided for by the Criminal Code, it is necessary, I think, to read that section in light of the enactments of the Criminal Code. The subject of appeals, as affecting summary convictions under Part 14,. as well as other convictions, where the proceeding leading to the conviction is in form a criminal proceeding, and the judgment is not a mere order for the payment of money (including appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, as well as to the Privy Council), is a subject dealt with in the Criminal Code as a branch of Criminal Law and Procedure; and there, I think, the Supreme Court Act leaves that subject. Consequently, the right of appeal to this court, if any, in this and in similar cases, must be found in the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nI am dealing, of course, it is perhaps advisable to say, solely with cases in which the proceeding is a proceeding authorized by a statute of the Parliament of Canada. What I have said is in no way inconsistent with either the decision or the judgment in The King v. Nat Bell (1).\nLeave to appeal should be refused.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 20 Alta.

V, c. 23, s. 113\nThe general rule of legal procedure that the burden of proof is on the party who asserts the affirmative of the issue applies in the case of a will offered for probate.\nThe Judge of Probate having refused to admit the will to probate on the ground that the execution of it had not been established by satisfactory evidence, his judgment was affirmed by the Appeal Division, of the Supreme Court, who held affirmatively that the will was a forgery.\nHeld, reversing the Appeal Division, Duff J. dissenting, that the weight of evidence was in favour of the validity of the will, which should be admitted to probate.\nPer Duff J.: The onus was upon the party propounding the will to establish its execution, and remained upon him throughout, and it was the duty of the trial judge to pronounce against the will if, after considering the whole of the admissible evidence adduced, he was not judically satisfied that the will had been duly executed; and that there was no sufficient reason for reversing the concurrent findings of the trial judge and the Appeal Division that the testimony of the proponent and of the attesting witnesses was not credible.\nA New Brunswick statute provides that \"the Supreme Court (on appeal) shall decide questions of fact from the evidence sent up on appeal notwithstanding the finding of the judge in the court below.\"\nHeld, per Duff J., that this provision does not authorize the Supreme Court to deal with an appeal as if it were the court of original jurisdiction but it must proceed as on a re-hearing.\nJudgment of the Appeal Division (51 N.B. Rep. 1) reversed, Duff J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (51 N.B. Rep. 1) affirming the ruling of a Judge of Probate who refused probate of the will offered by the appellant. The matters cf law to be dealt with on the appeal are indicated in the above head-note.\nJ. F. H. Teed for the appellant.\nDaniel Mullin K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal arising out of an application made by the executors to the probate judge of St. John N.B. for proof in solemn form of the last will of the late Charles Nevins of that city.\nThe learned judge heard a great deal of evidence, some of it very much in point, and some, I say it with deference, not so. He reached the conclusion that the persons setting up the will \"had failed to establish its authenticity.\"\nFrom that judgment an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. That court was composed of the Chief Justice of New Brunswick, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench Division and Mr. Justice Grimmer. Their judgments differed in their conclusions.\nThe Chief Justice of New Brunswick held that the signature to the will alleged to be that of Charles Nevins, the testator, was a forgery. The Chief Justice of the King's Bench held that the signature was the genuine signature of the testator, and Grimmer J. held that he was not disposed to differ from the finding or conclusion of the probate judge, but that he would concur with him that the parties setting up the will had \"failed to establish its authenticity.\" He also agreed with the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick.\nFrom this judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick an appeal was brought to this court.\nAt the conclusion of the argument I inclined strongly to the opinion that the appeal should be allowed. Since this I have read over most assiduously all the evidence pertaining to the main question\u2014whether the will was a forgery or not\u2014and I have reached the conclusion and the firm conviction that the will in question is the genuine will and that the signature thereto is the genuine signature of the testator Charles Nevins.\nThere is not to my mind any ground for contending that the instructions proved to have been given to Mr. Kerr for the drawing up of his will by Charles Nevins were not correctly understood by Mr. Kerr and dictated to his stenographer, Miss Tobin, and properly transcribed by her. Miss Tobin made several copies of this will, all of which have been accounted for. The will propounded by Messrs. King and Kerr as being the last will of Charles Nevins was stated by Miss Tobin on examination to be one of the copies of the will which had been dictated to her by Mr. Kerr. She recognized the paper on which it was copied as being the same as used in Mr. Kerr's office, and the style of type as that of the particular make of machine which she used there.\nThat particular copy was taken by the testator from the office of Mr. Kerr some days after his instructions had been carried out. It is quite clear to me that the testator signed that will and that his signature thereto was witnessed by Messrs. Mowatt and Cox.\nI have had the advantage of reading the judgments prepared in this case by my brethren Idington and Mignault JJ. and as I do not differ with them on any of the salient points on which they have based their judgments, I do not think it necessary or useful to repeat their reasons here.\nI have, therefore, come to the clear conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and that petition for probate in solemn form of the propounded will of the testator should have been granted by the probate judge.\nAs to costs, I am of opinion that all costs as between solicitor and client up to the time of the filing of the first allegations should be paid out of the estate. Subsequent costs, including the costs in this court and the appellate division should be borne by the respondents, except the stenographer's bill which it was agreed should be paid out of the estate.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which upheld the judgment of the judge of the St. John Probate Court, refusing to grant probate of the alleged last will and testament of the late Charles Nevins who had lived many years in St. John and carried on the business of a commission broker dealing in metals, coal and lumber.\nHe was about sixty-eight years of age at the time of his death, had been a widower for many years and in later years had lived with his widowed sister, Mrs. Givan, who was his only near relative, and he had known the appellant for nine years or more and intimately for five or more years.\nHe and appellant had many monetary dealings in these later years. They met accidentally on the street in St. John when she told him she was going to see Mr. Kerr, a solicitor, on some business, and he said he would go there with her. When there he said he wished to give Mr. Kerr instructions to draw a will for him, the now deceased.\nMr. Kerr took notes of his instructions and when they got to a point where appellant's monetary dealings with deceased were being developed, whereby he was instructing said solicitor to bequeath to her certain sums due her for money lent, she produced her bank book, pointed out therein the items and the solicitor marked same with an \"X.\"\nShe then retired into the stenographer's room and awaited deceased ending his instructions.\nThese items of borrowed money, amounting together to $3,452, above referred to, with interest from dates named, and another item of Victory Bonds, to the amount of $2,000, which the deceased bought for her with her own money, as explained to the solicitor, were kept in a bank safety deposit box.\nThe will, according to said instructions, was to bequeath to her said sums of borrowed money and interest thereon, and said bonds, and as drawn did bequeath same.\nThe deceased also explained to the solicitor that he and appellant were engaged to be married and that circumstance was also set forth in the will, which was dictated by Mr. Kerr same day to his stenographer, Miss Tobin, who, by her typewriter, wrote accordingly the will now in question strictly in accordance with the said and other instructions given.\nIt turned out that the stenographer's room was rather cold and she and appellant moved into a warmer room used jointly by Mr. Kerr and one Linton, then therein.\nThey were able to hear what was going on if inclined to listen.\nThe said solicitor, his stenographer, appellant and Mr. Linton, all testify to what they each knew of the making of said will, and their proof thereof is so conclusive that no serious question can be raised as to its being, in respect to the items specifically referred to above, and in all other respects, exactly what the deceased intended as his will. He called a day or two later, and got from said solicitor the copy evidently intended for execution, but, instead of executing it then and there, took it away with him to read and consider.\nThe deceased was on very intimate terms with one Mowatt, a druggist, where appellant had been an assistant clerk as bookkeeper and otherwise for nine years previously.\nThe said will provided amongst other minor items a legacy of one thousand dollars to said Mowatt and, by paragraphs 10 to 13 inclusive, as follows:\u2014\n10. Save as aforesaid I give and bequeath to my sister Mrs. Mary Givan all my personal property on the following conditions, namely:\u2014the principal of my said estate covered by this section is to be kept intact land I hereby instruct my executors to pay over to my said sister, Mary Givan, the income arising therefrom for her sole use and support. In case, by any extraordinary circumstance, the income becomes insufficient to properly support my said sister I hereby authorize my executors to use their best judgment in disposing of or realizing on such portion of the principal sufficient to meet such extra ordinary circumstance.\n11. On the death of my said sister I give and bequeath all my estate to the said Susie Smith.\n12. I nominate, constitute and appoint my life long friend George King of Chipman and Francis Kerr, barrister-at-law, of the city of Saint John, executors of this my Last Will and Testament.\n13. It is my wish and desire that my executors, and particularly my friend George King, in case I should die before my intended marriage to the said Susie Smith, that she shall be carefully considered by them and protected by them. She has worked hard, is not in good health and I wish her to live the remainder of her days in as much ease and comfort as possible.\nOn the 3rd of March, 1921, the deceased called on the said Mowatt at his said drug shop, and, in a store room back of the shop, was assisting him in checking over some goods, as he was accustomed to do there, when one Cox, a partner in the drug business, but carrying it on in another shop in same town, called and passed through the first-mentioned shop to see Mowatt on some business, and shortly afterwards, whilst all three were there alone, deceased pulled out of his pocket a paper which he said was his will and asked them if they would witness it for him.\nThere was no very suitable place for such purpose, or anything but a rough table or counter of uneven surface used for the handling of goods upon. Enough space on that was cleared off on which to do the signing which had to be done standing up or leaning over, for there was no chair to sit upon, and the table or counter was only about four feet in height.\nBoth Mowatt and Cox swear deceased pulled a fountain pen out of his pocket and signed his name and they signed as witnesses, and he took the will away with him.\nThe testator died suddenly a week or so later. No signed or unsigned will, such as deceased had put in his pocket at Kerr's office, could then be found, it is alleged.\nIt turned out that in the previous autumn deceased had bought, for a hundred dollars, a safe which had formerly been the property of a well-known lawyer, who had been, previous to the said sale to the deceased, appointed to the bench, and had no longer use for it.\nIt seems to me most conclusively proven by most respectable people, that not only was the said safe so bought by deceased, but also that a small room on the ground floor of the rear part of the dwelling where the appellant lived and which had been very much out of repair, had been repaired for the special purpose of having said safe put there by deceased, or those he employed for the purpose, and that it was accordingly moved and placed there some time before the will was made.\nIt seems quite clearly proven also that the deceased and appellant were preparing for the occupation of part of the dwelling house where she had lived for many years and observant friends understood what such movement of the said safe meant. She had fallen ill just after this and hence progress was delayed.\nUnfortunately the search made for deceased's will after his death was misdirected. They discovered from Mr. Kerr that such a will had been drawn by him, but could not find the copy taken away for consideration, and probable execution. Manifestly those concerned in such pursuit did not direct their efforts very well, or they would have gone further, discovered the contents and traced up the people named in the will as beneficiaries and, assisted thereby, have made further progress.\nMr. King, an old friend of deceased, and named as one of the executors of the will, lived at some distance from the city and had only occasional chances for doing so, and yet he seems to have been selected as the person who should have to make an application for letters of administration to the deceased's estate, called on appellant and told her of having discovered that a will had been drawn, but that it never was executed.\nI respectfully submit he was too hasty.\nMuch has been made of appellant's statement, after he left, to men working there, when she seemed enraged at the declaration that no will had been executed.\nIt seems she was somewhat dull of hearing, and throughout no regard is paid to that. Perhaps she misunderstood the real effect of what was told her for evidently she may have had in mind an attempt to beat her out of her money lent, and bonds as well, and then have concluded they were trying to beat her.\nOn that occasion or the next, Mrs. King going upstairs with the appellant, noticed the safe, where placed as related above, and was told by appellant then and there that it belonged to deceased, but no further remarks then ensued about it.\nHowever, it seems to have occurred to Mrs. King either as a feature by itself, or in connection with the missing will, as something worth thinking over.\nMr. King puffed that aside as unworthy of consideration for he answered \"Nevins could have no use for a safe,\" and so, apparently other wise heads also conceived, and so it was argued before us, despite what followed.\nI was tempted to inquire from counsel what the cost annually was of a safety deposit box, in the bank vault, such as he had, and was told at least five dollars a year.\nWhy should he not have at his home a safe he could get costing only a hundred dollars, or about the same annual cost, and have it on hand for everything?\nSuch a thought seems never to have occurred to those pretending to search for the will\u2014the missing will or even the copy if never signed\u2014for it was not returned to Kerr. Nor was it ever seen again unless that be it which was executed, as sworn to by the said witnesses.\nIt does not seem to have occurred to appellant at first that the safe should be looked into, but later, thinking it over, she seems to have suggested that. She swears she had on several occasions said to those concerned in the search for the will, to look into the safety box and the safe, and, getting no response, at last said to Mr. King, that if the safe was looked into it might open some people's eyes.\nThat led to due and proper search and the discovery of the will in said safe under such circumstances as satisfy me that it was placed in said safe by deceased after its due execution as sworn to by the witnesses thereto.\nThere is abundantly clear evidence that appellant could not tell the combination of the lock by which it was closed. She says that deceased had told her, but she could not remember it. Indeed it would have been a remarkable thing if she could having no experience in its use. The first number of the combination she thought was 28, but the next two numbers she failed to recall. This was told to a party of three of Mr. King's friends who went to see appellant, and the safe.\nBetter experts than she in said party, tried but failed and they and Mr. King agreed to get an expert named Iddiols to put him to open it next day.\nHe managed to do so after an hour and a half working at it but, in accordance with his instructions, did not open it or even turn the bolts back.\nMr. Sanford then acting for Mr. King and under his instructions tells what then happened, after hearing this over the phone from Iddiols, as follows:\u2014\nMr. MacRae and I went down. Miss Smith let us in and took us downstairs. Mr. Iddiols said he got the combination to work. He said he had not opened the door and had not even turned the bolts back. In the presence of us four he opened the door and pulled the bolts back. There was nothing in any of the compartments as far as you could see in looking in. There was a little cash box in the centre, and he pulled that out and I looked in and found a plain, white envelope. This white envelope was tied with what is known as baby ribbon, very narrow white ribbon. It was tied lengthwise and around and knotted and in the loop of the ribbon there was a plain gold ring. I untied the ribbon and opened the envelope and took out the document which has been spoken of in court as the will of Charles Nevins.\nQ. Was Miss Susie Smith present?\nA. Yes. I brought it down to the office and telephoned or wrote Mr. King that we had found the will and at his convenience we would apply for probate. He came down some few days after that, and we presented the will for probate to Your Honour, and it was proved on the evidence of Mr. Cox, one of the witnesses. I think Mr. King still has the envelope with the ribbon and the ring.\nThat will having thus been discovered and thereafter presented by the executors thereof for probate there ensued this litigation. For Mrs. Givan, after the death of her brother, had made a will of her own and died, long before this discovery, and thereby had practically bequeathed, on the assumption that her brother had died intestate, both estates to be distributed in such a way as directed amongst respondents herein.\nThe respondents herein are Charles T. Nevins, the executor of said last mentioned will, and a number of legatees thereunder.\nThere is one of these, I rather think the executor of said last mentioned will, who had been for many years, though a cousin of deceased Charles Nevins, on unfriendly terms with him.\nHence, possibly, this savage piece of litigation.\nThe will now in question was being proved in solemn form and in course thereof allegations of forgery and undue influence were set up. At first the latter seems to have been withdrawn, or not relied upon, but long afterwards resorted to again, probably in despair, for there is nothing to support it.\nI see not the slightest reason for relying upon such allegation of undue influence, and submit that the only issue herein is forgery or not.\nThe respondents procured the evidence of one Hazen, an expert of some six years' experience, from Montreal, which, at first blush, might have some consideration given it.\nBut upon reading the evidence of Mr. Hingston of Boston an expert of a lifetime and very prominent in his profession, I must say he sweeps aside by the reasons he gives any value to be attached to the evidence of Mr. Hazen.\nHe seems to me to have had much more ample material, secured no doubt at his suggestion, in the way of specimens of the handwriting of deceased upon which he could rely for the conclusions he came to.\nMoreover the first named expert upon being recalled in rebuttal has to admit that in giving his testimony on his first examination he had made a serious mistake in claiming to have been an expert witness in a noted case in Newfoundland, which Hingston, who was there, denied. To his credit, however, he frankly admits he was mistaken, and had confused some of his first studies as an expert in studying that case in Montreal with his actual presence in Newfoundland at the trial there. That circumstance of making such a mistake must in weighing their respective evidence as between them, go a long way to deciding in favour of accepting that of Kingston, as I do. In short there is, when their evidence is compared, nothing left for respondent to rely upon in regard to the question of comparison of handwriting except the appearance of the signature of the testator in the abbreviated form he used for his Christian name. He usually wrote it \"Chas.,\" and in the signature to the will in question one may be led to read it as if spelled \"Ches.\"\nAssuming so, and, as Kingston frankly admits it is capable of being so read, how can that help when we are shown a number of cases wherein undoubtedly his signature looks as if the abbreviation were \"Ches.\" instead of \"Chas.\"?\nMore than that\u2014is the rough table or counter upon which the signing of the will was done, without a chair or stool to sit upon, and the need for having to stoop down or lean to one side, not to be considered?\nBut above all, to my mind, the suggestion of a witness being a wilful forger and making and leaving there a misspelt name, is too absurd for my acceptance.\nAnd when we are asked to find that two respectable citizens have signed as witnesses their signatures at the wrong side, where no professional will forger would ever have directed them to sign, the accusation seems rather ridiculous.\nNo one has attempted to compare the handwriting of these signatures of the witnesses with that of the testator. If they did they would find it impossible for either of them ever to have attempted to forge that of the testator.\nTo accuse two respectable citizens, long friends of the testator, of such a crime seems to me only to have been begotten of hatred and malice such as one may be permitted to suspect from the evidence originated on the part of some one of the cousins despised by the deceased.\nAnd that brings up another side aspect of the case for the respondents launched into a campaign of vile slander against his affianced which sets him down, if true, as a fool which I do not think he was. Nor do I think his old friend George H. King thought he was.\nI am glad to find that the last-named gentleman and Mr. Kerr stand aside and take no part herein, but simply hold the stakes.\nNow what the respondents stress most in alleging somebody, they do not say or point to whom exactly or in what way, as bringing about such a conspiracy as produced this alleged forgery, is the omission of Mowatt to tell of having witnessed such a will of his friend Nevins.\nI have already pointed out wherein I think the executors to the will were rather remiss in their search for its discovery and now I submit these respondents ought to have been fair in such reflections.\nThe executors were simply ordinary human beings and were, like others of same kind, engaged with their own business. So also were the witnesses. Mowatt had gone on a fishing trip which occupied some of his time, and he was, in any event, a silent, reticent, reserved man, unlikely to speak.\nHe simply says that from March to May slipped by and he saw no call on him to consider such a subject, especially, I submit, if on a fishing expedition meanwhile.\nHe frankly says he did not realize time was so passing. Why should he? It is not shown, or until recently, that before this litigation he had any interest in the will. Why should he bother about it?\nI am afraid I have already spent too much time on a rather absurd ground for forgery and perjury.\nIn connection with this Mowatt incident I must not overlook the peculiar circumstances that King tells of a phone message from Mowatt that he wanted to see him on business and he responded by going to Mowatt's store and talking there about Nevins, the deceased, but came away without hearing of any business, or asking Mowatt what the business was that he wanted to see him about. Mowatt denies this phone. But how can the pot call the kettle black in that incident? Why did King not ask what he was phoned for?\nWhat about Cox? The slanderers who pretend that he was party to a forgery, and perjury, have nothing to rest upon except that he, a most respectable witness, as attested by the learned trial judge, had, they allege, years ago used money entrusted to him in a way he should not have done. If his story is correct, and there is nothing to correct it by but his own version and according to that he acted within his absolute rights, advised the party entitled to said money of what he was doing with it and got his assent, and continued to the time of the trial to act under same power of attorney. Nothing but a campaign of wilful slander can account for the production of such evidence as a basis for the pretension set up of his being not only capable of forgery and perjury, but an actual forger and perjurer.\nThe respondents failed to call the man who had given the power of attorney so acted upon and, unless they were prepared to do so, I submit they ought never to have tendered such evidence or have been allowed to do so.\nDecent treatment of witnesses is a most essential element in the due administration of justice.\nCox never had anything to do with the testator's estate, or interest therein, or reason for joining in any conspiracy involving a forgery. Why should he commit perjury? He was well acquainted with the testator and could not be mistaken as has, I imagine, been the basis of attack in such sort of cases.\nThen there is the evidence of Roy McCollum, a drug clerk in the Mowatt shop for a year\u2014from some time in September, 1920, to October, 1921. He testifies to seeing the deceased Nevins there so frequently that he became well acquainted with him and his habit of helping Mowatt in the back shop, which he calls the paint shop. And on one occasion, shortly before his death, the deceased came in, asked him for Mowatt, and was told that he was in the back shop, and he passed through to see him and stayed there. An hour or so later, Roy had occasion to go out to the back shop to consult Mowatt about some of the front shop business, and found Mowatt, Cox and Nevins all together, and no one else there.\nThis is strong corroborative evidence of what Mowatt and Cox tell, and none the less so, seeing he was not in Mowatt's employment when giving it, and never had any interest in the questions now raised herein.\nThere is much made of the rough way the date\u2014March 3rd\u2014is inserted, and doubt sought to be cast thereon. The typewriter had written in type the usual words:\nIn Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal at the city of St. John aforesaid the day of A.D. 1921.\nThen, whenever it was executed or forged, the words \"March 3rd\" were written in the blank space between the words \"day of\" and \"A.D. 1921\" instead of in the two blank spaces respectively the word \"third\" and \"March\".\nCan anyone imagine a professional forger, or any other kind of forger, finishing up his work thus? I cannot. But I can conceive of the testator writing in such an uneasy position thus hurrying up the finishing of his work.\nAnd I have no doubt the testator did it. And its present aspect confirms that as anyone forging would be particular to leave no ground for suspicion.\nAnd I am the more convinced when I find the witnesses accused of forgery and perjury make no pretence of having actually seen the testator write the date but quite properly assume he did so.\nForgers, or conspirators to a forgery, would have been quite prepared to swear to anything. Nor do I think they would have put a ring or ribbon round the envelope in which the will was found.\nWhen he took the will, unsigned, from the solicitor's office his last words there were a joke on his longevity and apparently he was in excellent health and vigor, and just as likely to play a practical joke on wife thereby when married and a new will would be needed.\nWhen, I may ask, did this conspiracy to forge a will take place, and how was it brought about?\nIt surely could not have been until after the death of the testator, and if so how and why should the 3rd of March be recalled as the date to be inserted?\nThere was an attempt made by the respondents to suggest that the safe in question had been bought by appellant because she had at some time preceding its purchase made inquiries from some persons who were offering a second-hand safe for sale.\nShe denies ever needing or inquiring about a safe for herself, but on an occasion when some one or other safe was offered for sale, she and Mr. Mowatt had some conversation as to the desirability of his shop being supplied with one and incidentally she did, on his behalf, ask prices thereof. He concluded then that for all his business it was not worth his while to so invest, and the matter stopped.\nHe also swears to the truth of that explanation if such be needed in face of the overwhelming evidence of others concerned in the sale of the safe, already referred to as being bought by Nevins the deceased.\nTurning to the accusation of conspiracy as against appellant who, it is insinuated by counsel for respondents, formed one of the conspirators to forge the will produced, because there are so many witnesses who have contradicted her (for the most part on matters entirely foreign to this alleged forgery) I submit her conduct throughout is quite inconsistent with having been a party to such a conspiracy as alleged.\nShe was informed by Mr. King at an early date that a will had been found, but that it had never been executed. At first blush, if the evidence of those she spoke to after Mr. King had so told her is to be taken in another sense than I have indicated above, she may not have accepted the view of Mr. King as correct, but soon after seems to have supposed it was, for she at many times after that, had referred to the will as not being signed. And no less than five witnesses are brought to testify that on as many different occasions, she had referred to it as not being signed, and bemoaning the fact. And up to the time of its discovery that seems to have been her attitude. And she had even got one of the copies made and sent it, immediately before the finding, to a cousin of deceased living in England, telling the same story.\nSurely all this is quite inconsistent with her ever having been a party to any conspiracy to forge a will. On the contrary her conduct seems to have been quite inconsistent with any such conception and enures, or should enure, to her benefit.\nShe swears repeatedly to having told those concerned, when discussing where to look for the executed will, that search should be made in the safety deposit box in the bank, and in the safe.\nSome statements are made by Miss Maxwell as to what she said in her presence, but anything material relative to the will is flatly contradicted by appellant. Her moral character is attacked in a way that, I submit, ought not to have been permitted, seeing the high esteem in which she evidently was held by the deceased Nevins who had such ample opportunity of knowing all about her character for so many years.\nHe seems to have been a man of good character, quite unlikely to have held her fit to be his wife if any foundation for the stories and insinuations made, and improperly permitted I submit, in evidence as traceable back to an incident of ruffianism many years previously by some mischievous person inserting an alleged marriage notice in a St. John newspaper, evidently designed to set the gossiping people in said city talking.\nMiss Maxwell, who seems to have had a rather lively imagination and a reckless way of speaking, tells a rather improbable story of Nevins, the deceased, having told his sister that he would never make a will, and then adds, she has heard him say this hundreds of times, apparently within the few weeks she was nursing his said sister.\nThe fact is that he had made a will some years before as Mr. King knows and tells us of without disclosing the contents.\nThat fact alone renders that part of her story as highly improbable. And the statement added thereto that she had heard him repeat it a hundred times stamps her to my mind as an unreliable witness.\nAgain she attempts to say that he had denied that he would ever marry, though on the face of it no one but some very imaginative person could take it as other than a joke, or a jocular way of speaking.\nAgain her highly improbable story of what Mr. Mowatt said when he called to see Nevins, of whose illness he had heard, and was told that he had died, is contradicted by Mowatt. I would prefer either his evidence or appellant's to anything she testifies to and wherein she is contradicted by them, or either of them, or any other respectable witness. Indeed there is not one of the witnesses testifying to anything material herein that has impressed me so unfavourably as Miss Maxwell of whom I know nothing but what appears in this case. There is presented the argument that she is interested in the result and some other facts to her detriment, but I see no need for dwelling thereon. In setting forth so much as I have done relative to her stories I am sorry counsel for respondents saw fit to put her improbable stories in the forefront of his factum and thereby render it necessary for me to deal so lengthily with the facts in order to explain why I refuse to accept her obviously unreliable version.\nThe rather peculiar requirement of the New Brunswick statute, 5 Geo. V, 1915, c. 23, s. 113 that \"the Supreme Court (on appeal) shall decide questions of fact from the evidence sent up on appeal notwithstanding the finding of the judge in the court below\" has induced me to read the entire evidence and consider same quite independently of the findings of the learned trial judge, and all the other material in the three volume case presented to us.\nI cannot agree with the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice Sir Douglas Hazen.\nI agree in the main with the reasoning of Chief Justice McKeown, but Mr. Justice Grimmer seems to accept the findings of the learned trial judge without reading the evidence.\nI do not, seeing I agree with the reasoning of Chief Justice McKeown, save as to the jurisprudence of New Brunswick as to expert evidence, think it necessary to review the judicial decisions he cites. I so except, for the reason that I am not familiar with that part of it, and in my view need not consider it.\nI cannot agree with the view taken by the learned trial judge of the law. Indeed, with all due respect, I submit that it is owing to his erroneous conception of the law relative to suspicion that so much evidence based on old-time scandals has been improperly admitted.\nBut, as the sole question to be decided is one of fact and that fact is whether or not this will was executed by the deceased, or is a forgery as contended for by the respondents, I do not think we can be very much helped by decisions in other cases further than to correct the misapprehension of law just referred to, and that, I think, Chief Justice McKeown has done so well that I need not repeat same here.\nFor there is, I repeat, no case made of undue influence or want of understanding on the part of the testator. The will is inherently unassailable on the facts presented and by the provision for testator's sister in priority to his intended and then the residue to her on the sister's death, seems to be a will in which there is nothing to complain about.\nI have had the opportunity of reading the notes of my brother Mignault and, agreeing therewith as I do, if there is any question of fact in either his judgment or that of Chief Justice McKeown which I have failed to mention herein, I accept their respective holdings as correct.\nHaving, for the reasons aforesaid, come to the conclusion that the will as presented to the Probate Court was the last will and testament of the late Charles Nevins, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs to the appellant and all parties supporting the will here and in the courts below incurred from and after the filing of the allegation opposing the proof of the will in solemn form, to be paid by the respondents.\nThe costs of all parties in the application to prove the will in common form as well as the costs of proving the same in solemn form up to the time of filing the allegations, to be paid out of the estate.\nThus far, I think, would be the usual judgment in such a case as this if the majority of the court agree in the result my brother Mignault and I have come to. But I see that Hazen C.J., and McKeown C.J., in the court below, agree in finding, although arriving at opposite conclusions as to the disposition of the appeal there, that there was an agreement between counsel for all parties, although denied by Mullin, that the stenographer's costs should come out of the estate.\nThey each refer to some affidavits which I do not find any reference to in the printed case before us except this from said judge's notes of judgment.\nIf they are right in said finding I should think it ought to prevail here and the stenographer's work, said to amount to a thousand dollars, or thereabout, should be, as they directed, paid out of the estate; that is the entire estate of Charles Nevins, unimpaired by anything that has happened since this litigation arising out of the allegations giving rise to it.\nSince writing the foregoing I have found the affidavits in question as to payment of stenographer's expenses out of the estate, and have no doubt the judgment should, in that respect, be the same as in the Court of Appeal.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal arising out of proceedings in the Probate Court of St. John, N.B., which were instituted by the petition of George King and Francis Kerr for proof in solemn form of an instrument alleged to be the last will and testament of the late Charles Nevins, in which they were named as executors.\nFrom the pleadings and the evidence adduced at the hearing, there emerges one and only one issue, an issue of fact, and that is whether the document put forward by the petitioners was in fact executed by Charles Nevins as his last will and testament. The judge of the Probate Court decided adversely to the petition and his judgment was sustained by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick by a majority of two to one. From this judgment the appellant, the principal beneficiary under the terms of the instrument, appeals.\nBefore proceeding to discuss the evidence, it is of some little importance to state unambiguously the rules governing the burden of proof and to ascertain the principles by which the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on an appeal from a judgment of the judge of the Probate Court, in a proceeding taken to establish a will, must be guided in dealing with issues of fact. By s. 113 of the New Brunswick statute, 5 Geo. V, 1915, c. 23, it is enacted that upon the hearing of such an appeal,\nthe Supreme Court shall decide questions of fact from the evidence sent up on appeal, notwithstanding the finding of the judge in the court below.\nHazen, C. J., in the court below calls attention to the fact that in the statute as originally enacted, instead of the word \"notwithstanding,\" the word \"irrespective\" appeared; and the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in 1881 held that under that reading it was the duty of that court on appeal entirely to disregard the finding of the judge of the Probate Court and \"to give to it no weight whatever\". In the present case the Supreme Court has apparently acted upon the view that the change by substituting \"notwithstanding\" for \"irrespective\" did not in any way alter the sense of the words or the effect of the enactment. With, I need hardly say, the greatest respect for the views of the judges of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, especially in relation to the construction of a New Brunswick statute, I am unable to agree with this. The change, made as it was after the deliverance of the Supreme Court in 1881 in the case cited by the Chief Justice, Alexander v. Ferguson[1], is in my opinion significant; and I am unable to escape the conclusion that it was made with the deliberate intention of declaring the law in a sense different from the rule laid down on that occasion. The statute, as it now stands, requires the Supreme Court to deal with an appeal as on a re-hearing, and also requires the court, when it has arrived at its conclusion, to give effect to the conclusion, notwithstanding the judgment of the trial judge. In effect it appears to me that the rule thus laid down does not materially differ from that which governs a court of appeal in deciding questions of fact on appeal from a judge who has tried the issues without a jury. The language is similar to that considered by the Privy Council in Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern Railway Co.[2], in which s. 209 of the Railway Act came up for construction. By that section the court is directed upon appeal from arbitrators, \"to decide any question of fact upon the evidence taken before the arbitrators, as in the case of original jurisdiction.\" I do not think the effect of these words would be altered by the addition of the phrase, \"notwithstanding the finding of the arbitrators,\" because obviously the Court of Appeal, having come to a conclusion, is to give effect to its conclusion, notwithstanding the sense of the judgment appealed from.\nThis, however, is not to say that in reaching a conclusion, the court charged with the duty of deciding the appeal is to proceed in entire disregard of the views and findings of the tribunal of first instance. As Lord Buckmaster, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Ruddy's Case (2) says (pp. 193-4), such a statute\nplaces the awards of arbitrators * * * in a position similar to that of the judgment of a trial judge. From such a judgment an appeal is always open, both upon fact and law. But upon questions of fact an appeal court will not interfere with the decision of the judge who has seen the witnesses and has been able, with the impression thus formed fresh in his mind, to decide between their contending evidence, unless there is some good and special reason to throw doubt upon the soundmen of his conclusions. As touching the burden of proof, there are some general principles which it seems desirable to restate. The first is accurately expressed in paragraph 605 of the Treaties on Evidence written by Mr. Hume Williams and Mr. Phipson in Lord Halsbury's collection in these words:\nIn legal proceedings the general rule is that he Who asserts must prove\u2014a proposition sometimes more technically expressed by saying that the burden of proof rests upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue.\nThis rule is derived from the Roman law, and is supportable not only upon the ground of fairness', but also upon that of the greater practical difficulty which is involved in proving a negative than in proving an affirmative.\nIn applying the rule, however, a distinction is to be observed between the burden of proof as a matter of substantive law or pleading, and the burden of proof as a matter of adducing evidence. The former burden is fixed at the commencement of the trial by the state of the pleadings, or their equivalent, and is one that never changes under any circumstances whatever; and if, after all the evidence has been given by both sides, the party having this burden on him has failed to discharge it, the case should be decided against him.\nThis rule is quite consistent with another rule, in which the burden of proof is used in a different sense\u2014a sense sometimes described as the minor, or secondary, sense\u2014and in this sense the burden of proof does shift in the course of the trial according as the evidence preponderates on one side or the other, as well as in obedience to certain presumptions. The burden of proof in this sense is said at any stage in the progress of the trial to rest upon the party who would fail if no further evidence were given.\nIt is pertinent to observe, in view of the discussion which has occurred in this case, that the party on whom the burden of proof rests in substantive law, the party whose duty it is, in order to succeed, to establish the affirmative of the issue, must fail if, when all the evidence is produced, the minds of the jury or other tribunal of fact, are in a state of real doubt as to the effect of the evidence. The subject is most elaborately and ably developed in c. 9 of the late Professor Thayer's Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law and the point is put with succinctness and precision by the late Master of the Rolls in Abrath v. North Eastern Railways Co.[3], in these words: It is contended (I think fallaciously) that if the plaintiff has given prima facie evidence which, unless it be answered, will entitle him to have the question decided in his favour, the burden of proof is shifted on to the defendant as to the decision, of the question itself. This contention appears to be the real ground of the decision in the Queen's Bench Division. I cannot assent to it. It seems to me that the proposition ought to be stated thus: the plainiff may give prima facie evidence which, unless it be answered, either by contradictory evidence or by the evidence of additional facts', ought to lead the jury to find the question in his favour; the defendant may give evidence, either by contradicting the plaintiff's evidence or by proving other facts; the jury have to consider, upon the evidence given upon both sides, whether they are satisfied in favour of the plaintiff with respect to the question which he calls upon them to answer. * * * Then comes the difficulty\u2014suppose that the jury, after considering the evidence, are left in real doubt as to which way they are to answer the question put to them on behalf of the plaintiff; in that case also the burden of proof lies upon the plaintiff, and if the defendant has been able, by the additional facts which he has adduced, to bring the minds of the jury to a real state of doubt, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the burden of proof which lies upon him.\nAs might be expected, these principles have been applied in litigation arising in connection with disputed wills, and in such proceedings the rule by which the courts are governed is strictly in accordance with the general principle. It is accurately stated and applied by Sir John Nicholl in Saph v. Atkinson[4], and is fully expounded in the judgment delivered by Baron Parke on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Sir John Nicholl sitting as a member of the Board) in Baker v. Batt,[5]:\nThe case is of some importance to the parties, as it relates to property considerable in amount; but not, as was strongly contended at the bar, as involving a novel principle of decision upon conflicting evidence, by which the necessity of expressly deciding upon the truth or falsehood of particular testimony is avoided. No rule has been acted upon in the court below which has not been long observed, not only in Ecclesiastical Courts, but those of Common Law.\nFor if the party upon whom the burden of proof of any fact lies, either upon his own case, where there is no conflicting testimony, or upon the balance of evidence where there is, fails to satisfy the tribunal which is to decide of the truth of the proposition which he has to maintain, he must fail in his suit. And thus in a Court of Probate, where the onus probandi most undoubtedly lies upon the party propounding the will, if the conscience of the judge, upon a careful and accurate consideration of all the evidence on both sides, is not judicially satisfied, that the paper in question does contain the last will and testament of the deceased, it is bound to pronounce its opinion that the instrument is not entitled to probate. And it may frequently happen that this may be the result of an inquiry (in cases of doubtful competence in particular) without the imputation of wilful perjury on either side; or it may be, the judge may not be satisfied on which side the perjury is committed, or whether it certainly exists.\nIn Harwood v. Baker[6], the Judicial Committee dismissed an appeal from a judgment of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury pronouncing against a will on the ground that\nthe party propounding the will had not satisfactorily proved, as he was bound to do, that the paper in question did contain the last will and testament of the deceased.\nCresswell J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Bench in Sutton v. Sadler[7], speaking for a court which included Willes J., referring to the last mentioned decision, said:\nThe result must be the same where the party propounding does not rely on a prima facie case, but gives the whole of has proofs in the first instance. The onus remains on him throughout; and the court or jury who have to decide the question in dispute must decide upon the whole of the evidence so given; and, if it does not satisfy them that the will is valid, they ought to pronounce against it.\nIt is argued, indeed, that these principles have no application where no question of competence is involved and the issue is the simple issue of the execution or non-execution of the instrument. But in truth, in this last mentioned case the conclusion follows a fortiori from the considerations upon which the principle rests. A simple issue of fact as to whether an alleged testator, A, has or has not penned the words which purport to be his signature is one which, in point of law, is quite incapable of being decomposed into a series of secondary issues; although, of course, logically and as a matter of reasoning, the decision upon that issue may turn upon the view of the tribunal as to the weight to be attached to some particular part of the evidence.\nSome facts are not seriously disputed. Nevins had been on very friendly relations with the appellant for some time, and his attentions to her had given currency to a rumour among his friends that he was to be married to her. And it must, I think, be taken as established that he did give instructions to Kerr, one of the executors named in the disputed instrument, for the preparation of a will, and that the document now propounded was in consequence of those instructions prepared by Kerr and in due course delivered to Nevins. The instrument, it is important to notice, contains, first of all, an acknowledgment of an engagement to marry between the appellant and Nevins, and contains, moreover, a declaration of trust in respect of certain Victory Bonds which, I conclude from the evidence of the appellant, were not bought for her, although she says he told her that he had purchased some Victory Bonds in her name.\nAlthough the fact that this document was prepared seems to be established, it seems to be equally clear that among those of Nevins' friends who might have been supposed to know of the execution of a will, and particularly of this document prepared by Kerr, there was a belief that the instrument so prepared had not been executed. The evidence is overwhelming that the appellant herself\u2014she admits it, indeed, quite unreservedly\u2014fully believed that Nevins, although intending to make her his testamentary beneficiary, had died before carrying his intention into effect. Again, although the fact that this document had been prepared was made known to Mr. King shortly after the death of Nevins, and although he informed Mowat of the preparation of the document and of the fact that he was named as a legatee in it, and although later he informed Mowat that since no will had been found, at the request of Nevins' sister he was about to apply for letters of administration, neither Mowat nor Cox, the other attesting witness, disclosed either to Mr. King or Mr. Kerr the fact that a will had been executed until after the lapse of something like ten weeks from the death of the supposed testator. The alleged signature, while it bears a general resemblance to the undisputed specimens produced, is in some respects strikingly different from them. Undeniably there is an appearance of care and elaboration in the production of it which presents a striking contrast to the free sweep of the writing in the enlarged authentic specimens. Moreover, it is clear that in all the admittedly authentic specimens submitted, the third letter in \"Chas.\" is written as an \"a,\" while the corresponding letter in the disputed signature presents all the appearance of an \"e\"; and I think the two handwriting experts are right in agreeing that they can give no explanation of this discrepancy, upon the assumption that the writer of the genuine signatures was the author of the disputed one. Not a single specimen of the handwriting of Nevins is produced in which this third letter is formed as in the signature attached to the will, without a break or a sign of arrest in the progress of the stroke indicating an intention to form an \"a,\" and it may fairly be assumed that no such specimen could be found. I may say at once that from a comparison of the disputed signature with the genuine specimens produced, and considering the evidence of the two experts and of Mr. King, who was very familiar with Nevins' handwriting, I should conclude with little hesitation, if the case turned upon the evidence as to handwriting alone, that the signature in question was not the signature of Nevins.\nThe trial judge and the majority of the judges of the Supreme Court have considered that these facts in themselves present very serious obstacles in the appellant's way. And undeniably the failure of Mowatt to disclose the fact of the execution of the will to Mr. King or Mr. Kerr was a very significant omission, and I must say in my opinion an omission which is left quite without explanation. The will, according to the evidence, was executed on the third of March. Mowatt must have known that the appellant, as well as the executors named in the will, being aware of the fact of its preparation, were deeply concerned upon the question whether Nevins had died without executing it; and yet, with so many reasons and occasions for speech, he remained silent.\nMowatt's alleged failure to make any disclosure to the appellant on the subject is accounted for by her counsel by reference to the circumstance that neither Mowatt nor Cox read the document or was informed of the contents of it at the time of execution. This circumstance can have little or no weight, in view of the fact which the evidence demonstrates, that the appellant herself was fully aware of the contents of the document as prepared, and discussed the contents of it freely with others; and it is quite incredible that Mowatt had not become aware of what these contents were.\nThen there is the evidence of Miss Maxwell, who says that both the appellant and Mowatt, on hearing of the death of Nevins, in addition to such manifestations of grief as might have been expected, spontaneously expressed, in words quite unmistakable, their disappointment in not having procured Nevins' signature to some paper which it was very important he should sign. The learned trial judge says he has no reason to disbelieve Miss Maxwell, and although his language upon the point might have been more explicit, it is quite evident, I think, that he accepted her evidence as against that of Mowatt, who at first confined himself to asserting that he did not remember the occurrence related by her; while it is quite plain that he has no hesitation as between Miss Maxwell and the appellant in rejecting the appellant's denial. The importance of Miss Maxwell's evidence is brought into relief by the evidence of the appellant and Mowatt. It might have been said that such expressions had reference to some document other than the will prepared by Kerr, but no such explanation was given, and if the denials of Mowatt and the appellant be rejected, it is impossible to say that the inference suggested by the respondents is not a reasonable one.\nThe appellant's knowledge of the preparation of the document, and her belief that Nevins had died before executing it, supply a very natural explanation of the expressions she used, if it was this document to which she referred; and no other explanation is forthcoming, nor is there any explanation of the language attributed to Mowatt. If Miss Maxwell is to be believed, the circumstances point rather directly to the conclusion that it was the document prepared by Kerr of which they were both thinking. That is the inference drawn by Hazen C.J., and if the inference is a valid one, it is obviously fatal to the appellant's case.\nAt this point the question naturally suggests itself whether, considering the relations between Mowatt and the appellant, and the appellant's distress over the non-execution of what she called \"the will,\" as shown by the evidence of many witnesses, it is not improbable that he would have refrained from setting her mind at rest.\nNo little importance attaches to the circumstances connected with the discovery and the production of the document. Nevins had a safety-deposit box where he was in the habit of keeping his securities and other important papers. The will propounded was not found in this box, nor was any memorandum discovered there pointing to the existence of it. Neither Mr. King nor Mr. Kerr, the executors named in the disputed document, was informed that a will had been executed. Nevins' sister, Mrs. Givan, who died after Nevins and very shortly before the discovery of the document, was left in ignorance of the execution of it; so, also, was the appellant, who, if she is to be believed, saw Nevins more than once between the time of the execution of the will and his death. Mr. King, besides having been named as executor, was on terms of personal intimacy with him, and their business relations had lasted a great many years. The will was found in a safe which stood in a room in the house occupied by the appellant. There was a good deal of dispute as to whether this safe was the property of the appellant or of Nevins. There is evidence that Nevins had bought and paid for the safe, but considering the relations of the parties, and in view of the fact that the appellant had some time before been looking for a safe to purchase, there is nothing in this inconsistent with the contention put forward by the respondents that the safe really was the appellant's. I think the balance of probability inclines in that direction. In any case, admittedly the safe contained nothing but the disputed will. It is quite obvious that Nevins had never used it as a repository for his own papers. The appellant herself admits that Nevins had given her the combination; she says she had forgotten it. As I have already said, the learned trial judge has, on what I believe to be adequate grounds, pronounced the appellant an unreliable witness; and my view, after carefully weighing all the evidence as to this safe, is that the great weight of probability favours the conclusion that the appellant knew the combination and had access to it.\nIf that is so, it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the conduct of the appellant with the hypothesis that her claim is an honest one. Instead of opening the safe and informing the executors what was there, she pretends ignorance, and suggests that a search in it might possibly lead to the discovery of a will; and this not until ten weeks had elapsed after Nevins' death, after letters of administration had been granted and Mrs. Givan, the grantee of a life-interest under the document, had died. I agree with Hazen C.J., and the judge of the Probate Court that the condition in which the will was found, with the ribbon and the wedding-ring, is most probably accounted for upon the hypothesis that the appellant had access to the safe. As against all this there is the testimony of the two attesting witnesses, Mowatt and Cox; and in weighing the value of their testimony it is, of course, very important not to forget that if the disputed signature is not that of Nevins, then Mowatt and Cox must have committed deliberate perjury. The learned trial judge does not in explicit terms find that these witnesses committed perjury. The expression he uses, however, satisfies me that he put no faith in their testimony. His words are:\nThough, because not driven to it, I am unwilling to find that either. Mowatt or Cox did not tell the truth, the evidence of Mowatt especially was far from satisfactory;\nand the conclusion at which he arrived was that the weight to be attached to their testimony was not sufficient to overcome the improbabilities arising from the facts proved with which the appellant's case was beset.\nIt is undeniable that apart from these improbabilities, circumstances were disclosed seriously reflecting upon the credit attaching to Mowatt and Cox as witnesses. The majority of the Court of Appeal have concurred with the trial judge in declining to give effect to their evidence.\nWith great respect for the view taken by others, I cannot help thinking that, to use the phrase of Lord Haldane in his judgment in Nocton v. Ashburton[8] it would be \"a rash proceeding\" to reverse the decision of the two New Brunswick courts upon this issue of fact with which, for so many obvious reasons, they were peculiarly qualified to deal, in the absence of some consideration of overwhelming weight demonstrating that in some definite way they have fallen into error.\nAs regards Cox, he, it must be admitted, assumes, in the light of his own evidence, a somewhat ambiguous character. A man of punctilious rectitude would not have used his friend's power of attorney for the purpose of providing money for his own needs, out of his friend's bank account, without first obtaining his friend's explicit permission; and his admission that he did so is calculated to shake one's confidence in his explanations, which it was not open to the respondents to contradict, and to reflect a little upon that \"irreproachable business standing\" which McKeown, C.J., ascribes to Mowatt, who benefited by Cox's irregularity, and who, as an experienced business man, ought to have realized the grave nature of the impropriety Cox was committing.\nAs regards Mowatt, without discussing the subject in detail, it is sufficient to say that his relations with appellant were relations of indefinite possibilities. Then there is the extraordinary fact, which must not be overlooked, that Mowatt, after the issue had been joined, begged the appellant to discontinue the struggle. The reason assigned, that the scandal was injuring his business, would seem to be a trivial one, in face of the fact that, if his evidence is to be accepted, he, an honest man, with some reputation for business rectitude, was unjustly being charged with serious crime.\nThe learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, as already observed, have held that the appellant has not acquitted herself of the onus resting upon her to prove that the alleged will was executed by Nevins. Two criticisms of some importance are directed against the judgment of the learned judge of the Probate Court. First it is said that he misdirected himself in laying down the rule that he must find against the will unless all suspicions arising out of the circumstances were removed by the appellant. I think this objection fails to do justice to the judgment of the learned trial judge. It is quite true he uses this form of expression, but it is sufficiently evident from his judgment, when examined as a whole, that by \"suspicion\" he means suspicion of that grave character legitimately arising from the facts proved, which would make it impossible for him to say that he was judicially satisfied that the affirmative of the issue had been estabblished. It was very vigorously pressed upon us in argument that the trial judge could not decline to give effect to the evidence of Mowat and Cox without satisfying himself that they were committing perjury. Strictly, such a proposition cannot be maintained. The proposition that a given witness is to be believed is an allegation of fact, and the party whose case depends upon the evidence being accepted must fail if the tribunal of fact has not sufficient confidence in the evidence of the witness to accept it as establishing the facts sworn to. No competent tribunal of fact, of course, rejects the sworn testimony of a witness from mere capricious or fanciful reasons; but it is, in point of law, quite unsound to say that once a witness has testified to the state of facts upon the existence of which the affirmative of an issue depends, the party calling him must succeed unless the other party disproves the testimony so given. He may equally succeed by so shaking the weight of the testimony as to bring the mind of the tribunal into a state of genuine doubt as to whether the testimony can be accepted as sufficient for the purpose for which it is offered. In the case before us, no tribunal of fact having the duty cast upon it to weigh the evidence of Mowatt and Cox could fail to take into consideration a feature of cardinal importance in this case, namely, that if the disputed signature was not the genuine signature of Nevins, then Mowatt and Cox were guilty of perjury. But this is a very different thing from saying that the plaintiff must succeed unless the tribunal is prepared to affirm that Mowatt and Cox were guilty of perjury. The trial judge was entirely right in asserting that he was not driven into that corner. It was sufficient for him if, all the circumstances considered, the considerations in favour of the conclusion that the signature was not a genuine one were as weighty as those in favour of the view that Mowatt and Cox were credible witnesses; if, in other words, he was not satisfied that they were not guilty of perjury. But it must be observed, and here I come to the point raised by the second objection, that the learned trial judge does not, nevertheless, leave us entirely in the dark as to his view in relation to the credibility of the witnesses heard by him. He expressly states, in respect of the evidence of Miss Maxwell, that he sees no reason to disbelieve her, and it is sufficiently evident, I think, as I have already said, that he accepts her evidence with regard to the important incidents above mentioned as against that of the appellant and Mowatt, I have already quoted his remark upon the critical question of the general veracity of Mowatt and Cox, and, as I have said, he leaves no doubt upon the point that in his opinion the appellant is not a credible witness.\nThe appellant's argument does not convince me that the judgment of the New Brunswick courts can be reversed consistently with the principles which have governed this court in appeals from judgments upon issues of fact in which two courts below have concurred. But further, I am convinced that those judgments are well founded. Mowatt's silence, when his inclination, as well as his duty to everybody, would seem to have called upon him to speak; the belief of everybody, including the appellant, who might be expected to know, that no will had been executed; the place in which the will was found and the circumstances connected with the disclosure of its presence there; the conduct of the appellant and Mowatt on learning of Nevins' death pointing to a belief on the part of Mowatt, as well as of the appellant, that no will had been executed; Mowatt's desire, after the will had been impeached as a forgery, to give up the contest while resting under the imputation necessarily resulting from such a course; the character of the handwriting; all these circumstances, coupled with the relations of the appellant and Mowatt and of Mowatt and Cox, were before the trial judge and the Court of Appeal; and in view of them I think they were right in the conclusion that the evidence of Mowatt and Cox was not of sufficient weight to establish the validity of the will propounded.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014This is rather an extraordinary case. It began by proceedings by Geo. H. King and Francis Kerr for the probate in solemn form of the will of the late Charles Nevins, in his lifetime a broker of the city of St. John, New Brunswick, under which they were named executors. These proceedings were taken under chapter 23 of the New Brunswick statutes for 1915, section 48 of which directs that the probate judge shall first hear sufficient evidence to establish prima facie the validity of the will, and if such validity is established the judge shall so pronounce. Then if any party cited to appear before the court shall make request to have a witness examined, it shall be the duty of the judge to hear any witnesses that may be in attendance upon the court or are produced by parties opposed to the will, not exceeding two, to be selected by the judge, and afterwards any person opposing probate may file allegations of the grounds on which he proposes to contest probate of the will, and upon such allegations being filed the judge shall hear the evidence adduced by any and all parties and decide the matter.\nThe course indicated by the statute was followed and the probate judge pronounced the prima facie validity of the will after the attesting witnesses had been heard. Then, at the request of counsel representing the respondents, two witnesses were called, and afterwards allegations were filed by the respondents and an inquiry commenced which is remarkable as well for its very great length as for the triviality of some of the matters inquired into. Out of this mass of relevant and irrelevant detail, which at great expense has been printed in the three volumes of the appeal book, I will extract the pertinent facts stating them as far as possible in chronological order.\nCharles Nevins, the testator, had for many years lived in St. John. He was a widower, and, according to his own statement in the will, was engaged to be married to Susie Smith, the appellant, a spinster also residing in St. John and employed in a drug store kept by James Howard Johnson Mowatt. She also had some houses at Gondola Point, near St. John, which were rented to summer cottagers. Mowatt was an intimate friend of Charles Nevins as was also Mr. George H. King of Chipman, N.B., a member of the New Brunswick Legislature, and one of the executors. Another acquaintance of Nevins, and a business associate of Mowatt in another drug store, was one George E. Cox. Nevins resided with a widowed sister, Mrs. Givan, who died a couple of months after him. The estate of Nevins is valued at $16,000 or $17,000.\nThe recital of the pertinent facts may begin with a visit, some time in February, 1921, of Nevins and the appellant to the office of the latter's solicitor, Francis Kerr, of St. John, with whom Nevins was well acquainted. The appellant and Nevins had casually met on the street and when they reached the solicitor's office, Nevins told Mr. Kerr that he wished to give him instructions for the preparation of his will. Among other things he desired to acknowledge indebtedness to the appellant in some sums of money borrowed from her, and these amounts were checked off by Kerr in her bank book. Nevins had some Victory Bonds belonging to the appellant and he wished to acknowledge her ownership in these bonds. He therefore gave Kerr instructions for his will, the appellant being a part of the time in the outer office with Kerr's stenographer, Miss Alice Tobin. Kerr took note of Nevins' instructions and it was arranged that he would draft the will and Nevins and the appellant left the office together. Kerr then dictated the will to Miss Tobin who typed two or three copies. A few days afterwards Nevins returned, got a draft of the will, and, in answer to Kerr's inquiry whether he would then execute it, answered: \"No, I don't look like a man that is going to die. I am good for fifty years yet, and I will take it away with me.\" He put it in his pocket and left Kerr's office. According to all the evidence, Nevins was then apparently in good health. His age is stated to have been about sixty-five years.\nThe draft will prepared by Kerr on Nevins' instructions made several bequests, viz:\u2014$1,000 to the Provincial Memorial Home for Children of St. John; $1,000 to Howard Mowatt; his watch fob and stick pin to George King; all his interest in the Ashburn Lake Fishing Club to George King, Howard Mowatt and Francis Kerr; his gold watch to Charles Nevins, Jr.; to the appellant his diamond ring, a hand painted umbrella rack, a satin quilt and any pieces or articles she might want. Clauses 8, 10, 11 and 13 were as follows:\n8. I direct my executors hereinafter named to hand over to Miss Susie Smith (who I am engaged to marry) two thousand dollars ($2,000) in Victory Bonds now in my safety deposit box in said Royal Bank of Canada, this city. These Victory Bonds are the property of Miss Smith purchased by herself with her own money and at her request held by me for safe keeping for reasons which I have explained to Mr. Kerr. I also direct my said executors to re-pay to the said Miss Susie Smith the sum of three thousand four hundred and fifty-three dollars ($3,453) which I borrowed from her on the following dates, viz: $2,000 with interest at 7 per cent on the fifteenth day of January, 1920; $1,300 with interest at 5 per cent on the fourth day of September, 1920, and $153 on the eighteenth day of January, 1921. I have gone over Miss Smith's bank books and had Mr. Kerr mark these different amounts with an \"X.\"\n***\n10. Save as aforesaid I give and bequeath to my sister Mrs. Mary Givan all my personal property on the following conditions namely: the principal of my said estate covered by this section is to be kept intact and I hereby instruct my executors to pay over to my said sister, Mary Givan, the income arising therefrom for her sole use and support. In case by any extraordinary circumstance, the income becomes insufficient to properly support my said sister I hereby authorize my executors to use their best judgment in disposing of or realizing on such portion of the principal sufficient to meet such extraordinary circumstance.\n11. On the death of my said sister I give and bequeath all my estate to the said Susie Smith.\n***\n13. It is my wish and desire that my executors and particularly my friend George King, in case I should die before my intended marriage to the said Susie Smith, that she shall be carefully considered by them and protected by them. She has worked hard, is not in good health and I wish her to live the remainder of her days in as much ease and comfort as possible.\nFinally the draft will appointed as executors George King and Francis Kerr.\nSome time afterwards, which I take to be in the beginning of March, Mowatt was in a room leading from the back of his store called the paint shop, used for unpacking goods. It contained no chairs or other furniture, but only a table with a rough top. Charles Nevins was there with Mowatt helping him to check goods. While they were both in the paint shop Cox came in as he frequently did and about a half hour afterwards Nevins took a paper out of his pocket and told Mowatt and Cox that it was his will and asked them to sign it as witnesses. Nevins signed first with a fountain pen, leaning against the table, and then Mowatt and Cox signed as witnesses, this being done in the presence of the three of them. Neither Mowatt nor Cox knew anything, they state, of the contents of the will, but they both identify the document which they signed and which Nevins signed in their presence. After it was executed Nevins put it back in his pocket and Cox left shortly afterwards. A few days later Nevins had an attack of heart trouble and died quite suddenly early on the morning of the ninth of March.\nThis is in short the statement of Mowatt and Cox as to the signing of the will, and although Cox was excluded from the room while Mowatt gave his testimony, there is no discrepancy in what they say in connection with the signing of the will.\nWhen Nevins died, the fact that he had instructed Kerr to prepare a draft will was disclosed. So far as Kerr and the appellant knew, this will had not been executed by Nevins. George H. King, Nevins' friend, was apprised of the preparation of the draft will and so far as he also knew it had not been executed.\nGeorge King, when he learned about this draft will, consulted Mr. Charles F. Sanford, K.C., of St. John. This was shortly after the funeral of Nevins and King told Mr. Sanford that a will had been drawn by Kerr of which he had a copy but that it had not been signed. He also told Mowatt that a draft will had been found under which he was a beneficiary to the extent of $1,000, but that it had not been signed by Nevins, on which and on the further information that. King was taking out letters of administration of Nevins' estate Mowatt made no comment.\nI may say here that the failure of Mowatt to disclose that he had witnessed a will for Charles Nevins\u2014he only disclosed it to King a day or so before the will was found\u2014is strongly relied on by the respondents as a ground for discrediting his testimony that he witnessed this will. It is said in extenuation that Mowatt was a silent and reticent man. Mowatt himself candidly admitted at a later period that this silence might appear strange, but it did not then seem so to him, for he thought that if Nevins had not destroyed the will it would be found among his papers. The respondents are no doubt entitled to any inference which may be drawn from Mowatt's failure to say anything about the will when he knew that letters of administration had been taken out, but my opinion is nevertheless that the silence or stupidity of testamentary witnesses should not militate against a will which the court believes was really executed by the testator. Moreover, Cox was never questioned about the draft will or Nevins' estate and no reticence on the subject is charged against him.\nKing looked among the papers Nevins had left in his safety deposit box at the Royal Bank and in Mrs. Givan's house and, finding no executed will, applied for letters of administration. He had also several conversations with the appellant to whom he had mentioned that an unsigned draft will had been found in Kerr's office. At one time the appellant showed Mrs, King a safe in a kind of outbuilding connected with the house in which she resided, which she said belonged to Nevins, but when told of this by his wife King answered that he did not believe Nevins had a safe for he had no need of one. And he made no further investigations.\nKing was in St. John on Sunday, May 22, a week after Mrs. Givan's death, and Mowatt asked him by telephone to call at the drug store. He went there but says there was only general conversation as to Nevins, but apparently he did not ask Mowatt why he had telephoned for him. Mrs. King was with him, and went over to the appellant's house where King joined her and, according to his story, the appellant told him that if the safe were opened some people would get their eyes opened. The next day Mowatt said to King, who had stopped at the store: \"Mr. King, Mr. Nevins left a will and I witnessed it.\" Mr. King asked him why he had not given him this information before he had been sworn in as administrator of the estate, and Mowatt's answer was that he didn't care to say anything about it.\nThat same day King called on the appellant with Mr. Sanford. The appellant stated to them that perhaps they might find a will in Nevins' safe above referred to. She said she did not know the combination, although Nevins had once mentioned it to her, but she thought the first number was 28. Sanford tried to open the safe and succeeded in finding the second number but could not discover the third, so he had a locksmith come the next day, the 24th of May, and the latter found the full combination but did not open the safe until Mr. Sanford arrived.\nWhen the safe was opened an envelope was found in one of the drawers tied up with ribbon such as is used on candy boxes, and on the ribbon was a wedding ring. This envelope contained the will signed by Mowatt and Cox as witnesses and, according to their testimony, by Nevins. King and Kerr, who were named executors of this will, then initiated these proceedings for probate.\nIt is well to say here that the first allegations filed on behalf of the respondents on February 22, 1922, were to the effect that the signature of Charles Nevins was a forgery. Subsequently, on March 25, 1922, they filed additional allegations, to wit, that the alleged will was obtained by fraud, that at the time of the execution of the will the deceased did not know or approve of its contents, and that the execution of the said will was obtained by undue influence on the part of Susie Smith, chief beneficiary thereunder. Mr. Mullin at the hearing before this court abandoned these additional allegations as he had abandoned them before the appellate court.\nThe issue therefore is whether the will in question was executed by Charles Nevins, or, to the same effect, whether or not it is a forgery. Notwithstanding the opinion entertained by the probate judge that without pronouncing the will a forgery, and he did not find it such, he could refuse probate on the ground of suspicion, my view is that, unless we come to the conclusion that the propounded will is a forgery, the judgment of the probate judge cannot be supported. The wall is either a genuine will, or it is a forged one with the consequence that Mowatt and Cox were guilty of perjury and conspiracy. I may add that Chief Justice Hazen and Chief Justice McKeown in the appellate court were also of the opinion that such is the issue in this case, for the former decided that the signature of Charles Nevins was a forgery and the latter that it was not. Mr. Justice Grimmer apparently shared the view of the probate judge who, if I may say so with deference, misdirected himself as to the question he had to decide, with the result that he made no finding upon the vital issue raised by these proceedings.\nThe factums of the parties discuss at length the question of the onus incumbent on a person propounding a will for probate. Granting that he must prove the authenticity of the will, and satisfy the conscience of the court that it was really executed by the testator, the question here is whether this proof has been made. Mere suspicions which do not bear on the fact of the execution of the will are in my opinion totally irrelevant, for that fact only, and not the question whether the testator knowingly and freely disposed of his estate by this will, is in issue here.\nThe testimony of Mowatt and Cox is direct and positive evidence that Nevins executed the will in their presence. Unless this testimony can be rejected or should be disbelieved, the factum of the will must be held to be established.\nWhen the very voluminous testimony adduced on behalf of the respondents is read, it would seem that it was imagined that the appellant was on trial. It is true that she is the chief beneficiary under the will, but again the issue is not whether the will was induced by undue influence but whether it was in fact executed. The probate judge may have been prevented from excluding much of this testimony\u2014although I think he gave too great latitude to the respondents\u2014for allegations of undue influence had been filed. But as these allegations are now withdrawn it is clear that evidence as to the character and conduct of the appellant is of no assistance. The fact that the appellant may have been discredited, does not prove that the will was never executed, for the factum of the will does not rest on her testimony. Moreover there are other legatees, such as the Provincial Memorial Home for children, and where the sole question is as to the execution of the will, they should not be prejudiced by an attack on the character of the appellant.\nIf the positive testimony of Mowatt and Cox that Nevins signed this will in their presence is believed, the will must be held to have been duly executed.\nWhatever doubts may exist as to the testimony of Mowatt\u2014and I will discuss these doubts in a moment\u2014I am of the opinion that no reason exists for rejecting Cox's testimony. The probate judge says that Cox, whilst on the stand, impressed him rather favourably, a bit dull at times, but apparently not desiring to hold anything back. The only attack on Cox's testimony is that when he and Mowatt purchased a drug store on equal shares, as Mowatt was unable to pay up his whole share, Cox used some moneys belonging to a friend of his named Stewart for whom he held a power of attorney. This, Cox swore, was done with Stewart's full approval afterwards given, and Cox has returned him the whole amount taken by him. Cox still holds Stewart's power of attorney and enjoys, so far as appears, his entire confidence. He further says that Stewart had allowed him to make use of this money if he needed it, and there is no contradiction of his statement. I am of opinion that this attack on Cox's testimony entirely fails.\nMowatt perhaps is not in so favourable a position. I have referred to his reticence as to his having witnessed Nevins' will, although he knew that King proposed to apply for letters of administration of the estate. It was sought to prove that he, a married man, had entertained improper relations with the appellant, which both deny. Much evidence was adduced to contradict these denials. Mowatt also was often content to say \"I do not remember,\" instead of answering yes or no, when questioned on matters which might have a discrediting effect on his testimony. But still he is unshaken as to the execution of the will in his presence, and is corroborated by Cox whose testimony cannot be rejected. If I were to hold that Mowatt falsely stated that Charles Nevins executed the will in his presence I would have to decide that Cox perjured himself when he also swore that the will was signed by Nevins in presence both of himself and Mowatt. This I cannot do. The testator, who has fulfilled all the formalities required by law, is entitled to the protection of the court. And many genuine wills would be rejected were it possible to defeat them by an enquiry into the past history of the testamentary witnesses often chosen by the testator somewhat at random. The question is whether I believe, whether my conscience is satisfied that Nevins really executed this will, and on the whole evidence I do believe that he did.\nI have not overlooked the testimony of Miss Lillian Maxwell, which I cannot help thinking bears traces of evident exaggeration. She tells a somewhat extraordinary story, denied by Mowatt, that the latter, whom she had never seen before, said to her when he called at Mrs. Givan's house on the morning of Nevins' death, that he had a very important paper which he desired Nevins to sign and he had no idea he was so sick, and wished he had come sooner to get him to sign it. To say the least, it seems extraordinary that a man proved to be very reticent and silent, should have made such a statement to an utter stranger. Miss Maxwell would also have us believe that Nevins scouted the idea of marrying the appellant, and against this we have Nevins' statement, in the instructions given by him to Kerr for his will, that he was engaged to her. Miss Maxwell, who relates a great deal of similar gossip, is not without interest in Nevins' estate, for she is a legatee under Mrs. Givan's will and if there were an intestacy this estate would go to Mrs. Givan's legatees. If I have to choose between Miss Maxwell's testimony, which only very indirectly bears on the factum of Nevins' will, and the positive statements of Cox and Mowatt as to its execution, I have no hesitation whatever in accepting the latter.\nMoreover it cannot be disputed, without rejecting the testimony of Kerr who has been in no way discredited, that Nevins intended to dispose of his property as stated in this will. And Miss Tobin, being shown the will, says it was done on their typewriter and it is her paper. Moreover Roy McGollum, a youth employed, at that time but not at the time of the trial, in Mowatt's drug store, stated that one afternoon, some time before Nevins' death, Nevins and Mowatt were in the paint shop together, and that Cox came and joined them there and that the three of them remained about an hour. This is some corroboration of the testimony of Cox and Mowatt if it requires corroboration.\nI confess that I am not much concerned about the expert evidence as to Nevins' signature on the will, for if the attesting witnesses are to be believed, opinion evidence cannot prevail against their positive testimony that Nevins signed the will in their presence.\nMuch was made of the fact that the will was found in a safe in an outbuilding of the appellant's residence, and that a wedding ring was fastened to the ribbon with which the envelope was tied. The safe was proved to be the property of Charles Nevins purchased by him from Kerr some months before his death. The reason why a wedding ring was left there can only be a matter of conjecture, but it could have been done only by a person having access to the safe and no one is shewn to have known the combination save Nevins and Kerr. The natural assumption is that Nevins placed the ring where it was found, his motive for so doing being obscure.\nThe date of the will, \"March 3,\" which is written by hand, is another circumstance which was considered very suspicious. Mowatt and Cox say they did not write it or notice it when they witnessed the will. The opinion has been expressed that it is not in Nevins' writing, but only one of the exhibits written by him contains the word \"March\" and it affords a slender basis for the comparison of handwriting. This word however is in the will and whether or not it was written by Nevins, it is covered by his signature.\nI have given the whole case my very best consideration, for it is one of considerable difficulty. It does not seem possible to return, as the probate judge did, a Scotch verdict of \"not proven,\" leaving the case open for reconsideration should fresh evidence be discovered. What possibility is there of finding other more cogent evidence, if the positive testimony of the attesting witnesses does not suffice to turn, the balance in favour of the will? My opinion is that the probate judge had no sufficient reason for disregarding the evidence of Mowatt and Cox as to the execution of the will. Whatever doubts or suspicions there may be, these doubts and suspicions do not bear upon the fact of the execution of the will, nor would they justify me in rejecting the testimony of the attesting witnesses.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and declare that the will offered for probate was duly executed by Charles Nevins. I would order all costs, as between solicitor and client, of the probate proceedings to be paid out of the estate up to the filing of the respondents' first allegations, the costs subsequent to these allegations to be paid by the respondents who must also pay the appellant's costs in the appellate court and in this court. I think, however, on account of the consent of the parties as shewn by the affidavits filed, that the stenographer's bill should be paid out of the estate.\nMalouin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault. I would allow this appeal and declare that the will offered for probate was duly executed by Charles Nevins. I would order all costs of the probate proceedings to be paid out of the estate up to the filing of the respondent's caveat including the costs of the stenographer who reported the proceedings in the probate court, on account of the agreement to that effect by the parties. The costs subsequent to the respondent's caveat, except the costs of the stenographer in the probate court aforesaid, to be paid by the respondents in this court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 21 N.B.

The land was, on 26th April, 1897, conveyed, subject to the mortgage, to Annie Odette, and on the same day she and her husband executed the mortgage which is the second mortgage above mentioned, to the appellant Mary Nutson, for $1,700, payable 26th April, 1902. Victoria Taylor having died, her estate is represented by the respondents Hanrahan, Hardie and Elliott.\nIn March, 1898, by conveyance from Annie Odette, one Frederick John Holton became the owner of the equity of redemption, subject to the above mentioned mortgages. Default having occurred under both mortgages, Victoria Taylor, by her agent Dougall, took possession of the mortgaged property and remained in possession or in receipt of the rents and profits until the death of Dougall, in 1910. From that time Messrs. Bartlett & Bartlett were in possession or in receipt of the rents and profits for the Taylor trustees until the sale to the Raymonds, in 1920.\nThe property was leased from time to time by Dougall, and afterwards by Messrs. Bartlett & Bartlett, as agents of the Taylor estate, and as such they received the rents and accounted for them to the estate.\nIn 1920, the Taylor estate having agreed to sell to the Raymonds, a question of title arose as to the interest purchased by Holton, and that was bought in by the Raymonds in that year.\nThe appellants contend that when Dougall took possession (as above mentioned), he did so under the terms of a proposed agreement set out in a document produced in evidence, which, it is argued, constituted him trustee for all parties interested in the property\u2014mortgagees under both mortgages, as well as the owner of the equity of redemption. Dougall actually received all the rents from 1897 until his death, and since then they have been received by Messrs. Bartlett and Bartlett.\nThe appellant Mary Nutson received nothing on account of the moneys due under her mortgage after the years 1901.\nIn 1908 a lease of the premises was executed by the trustees of the Taylor estate in favour of the Peabody Company, which Mary Nutson also executed as a party of the third part; and in 1912 the premises were leased by the trustees to McNee & Sons, and as in the preceding lease, Mary Nutson joined as party of the third part. The rents under both these leases were collected by the agent of the trustees, and no part of them was paid to Mary Nutson.\nThe Appellate Division held that, first, the respondents had been in possession for sufficient time to give them a title under s. 20 of the Limitations Act; and that by s. 24, any right of Mary Nutson in the property has become extinguished, and with it all right and status to maintain an action of redemption.\nAs to the first point, the judgment is attacked on two grounds: The leases of 1908 and 1912 are said to constitute an acknowledgment of the respondents\u2019 title within the meaning of the statute; and further that by the agreement above mentioned, under which Dougall first took possession, a trust was constituted which affects the Taylor estate and precludes the estate from setting up the statute as against the appellants.\nThe leases relied upon as constituting an acknowledgment contain no express acknowledgment; the demise and the covenants are by the trustees of the Taylor estate, and a clause is added in these terms:\n\u201cThe parties of the third part hereby consent and agree to the within lease.\u201d\nThere seems to be an acknowledgment of the authority of the trustees to execute a lease, but I see no implication of an acknowledgment by them of any title in the second mortgages.\nAs to the alleged agreement with Dougall, the trial judge has found against it, and his finding has been affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal I think these findings are supported by the evidence.\nI agree also that the respondents are entitled to succeed upon the ground that the appellants have no status to maintain this action. By s. 24, R.S.O. c. 75, the right of Mary Nutson to enforce her mortgage and with it her interest in the land became extinguished after the expiration of ten years after the last payment on account of the mortgage having been received by her, which was in the year 1901. In re Hazeltine\u2019s Trusts[2]; In re Fox[3].\nI agree also that the claim based upon the alleged sale of the equity of redemption in 1902 under the second mortgage fails. I concur in the findings of the courts below that this alleged sale was never legally operative.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT, J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Duff.\nMACLEAN, J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nI am of the opinion, that the finding of the trial judge affirmed by the Appeal Division, in respect of the pleaded agreement with Dougall was warranted by the evidence and should not be disturbed. I also agree that the respondents\u2019 contention, that any claim the plaintiffs, Mary Nutson and Annie M. Murphy, ever had in the lands mortgaged to Mary Nutson, has been barred by the Limitations Act, c. 75, s. 24 R.S.O. must prevail.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Sheppard & Sheppard.\nSolicitors for respondents: Hanrahan, Hardie and Elliott, Bartlet, Bartlet & Barnes.\nSolicitors for other respondents: Kenning & Cleary.\n[1] 53 Ont.

Sask. (1920) c. 67, s. 60.\nIn an action for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of land, dated in April, 1920, two defences were set up, the second of which was the alleged inability of the vendors to make title owing to the existence of reservations in certain original Crown grants dated in 1906 and 1907. The agreement for sale contained a covenant by the vendors \"to convey the lands to the purchaser by good and sufficient deed or transfer\" but contained no words of exception or limitation such as \"subject to the conditions and reservations contained in the original grants from the Crown.\" The agreement also contained a covenant by the purchaser accepting the title of the vendor.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (18 Sask. L.R. 443), Idington J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances of this case and in view of the provisions of section 60 of the Land Titles Act, the vendor was under no obligation to caution the purchaser about the reservations in the original grant to which his title was normally subject and that the purchaser ought to have inquired himself about the nature of the title the vendor could give.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] affirming on equal division of the court the judgment of the trial judge[2] and maintaining the respondents' action for specific performance of an agreement for the sale of land.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nStapleton for the appellant.\nJonah for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondents against the appellant for specific performance of an agreement of the 14th April, 1920, for the sale and purchase of a farm in Saskatchewan, by payment of the balance of principal and interest due under the terms of the contract and in default thereof for cancellation of the agreement and forfeiture of the moneys already paid. There were two defences: First, that the appellant was induced to enter into the contract by misrepresentations of the respondents as to the adaptability of the land to agriculture; and, secondly, that the respondents were unable to make a title to the property. Respecting the first of these defences, the learned trial judge held that there had been no misrepresentation, and, moreover, that the appellant had relied exclusively upon his own investigations as to the character of the farm. As to the questions of fact raised by this defence it seems sufficient to say that, having regard to the letters written by the appellant after he had enjoyed possession of the land for a considerable period, it is impossible to hold that the learned trial judge took an extreme view in thinking that the evidence of the appellant was not of sufficient weight to justify a finding in his favour.\nAs to the second defence, which was based upon alleged deficiencies in the respondents' title, the complaint of the appellant is concerned with reservations in the patents that were the source of the respondents' title to part of the land, and with a proviso in the same instruments. The proviso and the reservations, which form the principal ground of complaint, are set forth in the following extract:\u2014\nSaving and reserving, nevertheless, unto us, our successors and assigns, the free uses, passage and enjoyment of, in, over and upon all navigable waters that now are or may be hereafter found on or under, or flowing through or upon any part of the said parcel or tract of land; also reserving all mines and minerals which may be found to exist within, upon, or under such lands, together with full power to work the same, and for this purpose to enter upon, and use and occupy the said lands or so much thereof and to such an extent as may be necessary for the effectual working of the said minerals, or the mines, pits, seams and veins containing the same; and also reserving thereout and therefrom all rights of fishery and fishing and occupation in connection therewith upon, around and adjacent to the said lands, and also the privilege of landing from and mooring boats and vessels upon any part of the said lands and using the said lands in connection with the rights of fishery and fishing hereby reserved, so far as may be reasonably necessary to the exercise of such rights.\nTo have and to hold the said parcel or tract of land unto the said Thomas Ross, his heirs and assigns forever.\nProvided, and, in pursuance of section 5 of the Northwest Irrigation Act, 1898, it is hereby declared that these presents shall not vest in the said Thomas Ross, his heirs and assigns, any exclusive or other property or interest in or any exclusive right or privilege, with respect to any lake, river, stream or other body of water, or in, or with respect to any water contained or flowing therein, or the land forming the bed or shore thereof.\nAs to part of the land, the patents contain no reservation of minerals, the subjects of complaint being reservations affecting navigable waters, rights of fishery and ancillary rights.\nSection 5 of the Irrigation Act of 1898, referred to in the last paragraph of the above extract, in terms directs that after the passing of the Act, except in pursuance of some agreement or undertaking then existing, no grant shall be made by the Crown of lands or of any estate, in such terms as to vest in the grantee any exclusive or other right or interest of the character described in the proviso contained in that paragraph; and the effect of s. 5 is, that no property or exclusive interest in any stream or other water within the contemplation of that section, which, of course, includes navigable waters, or in the bed of such stream or water, can be lawfully granted by the Crown after the passing of the Act. In view of this enactment, the reservation of rights of navigation in navigable waters is, perhaps, otiose, and was inserted, it may be assumed, in compliance with the requirements of some order in council, passed prior to the date of the Irrigation Act, which has not been called to our attention. The reservations respecting fisheries and minerals are those required by orders in council passed under the authority of the Dominion Lands Act, dated, respectively, the 19th March, 1887, and the 17th September, 1889.\nAs regards reservations touching streams and other waters, and the beds thereof, and fishing and navigation, the enactment contained in s. 5 of the Irrigation Act, already referred to, seems to preclude the possibility of a patentee from the Crown, in the absence of some agreement to the contrary in existence at the time of the passing of the Act, acquiring any such exclusive right to any natural stream or water or its bed as would prevent the Crown or its licensees exercising such rights as those reserved in the patents. Subject to the exception mentioned, all grants acquired from the Crown since the date of the Act are, by the general law, subject to that limitation; and there would appear to be no authority except the authority of Parliament from which such exclusive rights could be derived.\nIt is by no means clear that it would be impossible for a patentee under a patent reserving mines and minerals, or his successor in title, to obtain a grant of the minerals reserved, including coal; and, without expressing any opinion on the point, it may, for the purposes of this appeal, be assumed that there would be no insuperable legal impediment in the way of acquiring such a title.\nUnder an agreement for the sale of land, a purchaser acquires (unless his rights are expressly or impliedly restricted), a right to receive a good title in fee simple to all the subjects, usque ad coelum et ad inferos (within the description of the parcels), denoted by the term \"land\" in English law; as well as the right to have the vendor's title disclosed to him in a proper abstract of title, and to have the abstract verified by sufficient proofs. Juridically, this right has been ascribed to the force of a contractual term implied from the character of the agreement itself; and, on the other hand, it has also been described as a right given ab extra by the law. Whatever the juridical basis of the right may be, it is settled that it may be limited, or entirely displaced, by the fact of the purchaser's knowledge at the time of entering into the agreement that the vendor's title was affected by some flaw or deficiency which it was not in his power to remove\u2014a qualification of the purchaser's right, which, however, does not come into play where the agreement itself contains a specific stipulation requiring the vendor to give a good title. In such cases, the matter is ruled exclusively by the terms of the contract, the purchaser's rights being subject to such qualifications only as are stated expressly or as arise by necessary implication from the words themselves of the contract, properly construed. For the purposes of this appeal it will be unnecessary to consider a question of some importance, whether, namely, under an open agreement for sale, that is to say, an agreement containing no express stipulations governing the obligations of the vendor as touching the subject of title\u2014the vendor's title being a registered title governed by the Land Titles Act of Saskatchewan\u2014the purchaser can demand any better or other title than that received by the grantee under the original grant from the Crown. That is a question which does not arise, and no opinion is expressed concerning it. The agreement under consideration deals with the subject of title, the pertinent stipulation being in these words:\nAnd he covenants and agrees with the purchaser that upon the full, prompt, faithful performance by the purchaser of said and every of said covenants and agreements by him to be performed, kept and fulfilled, and upon payment of the money and sums of money above mentioned in the manner and at the time specified; then and in such case the said vendor will convey the said land and premises to the purchaser by good and sufficient deed or transfer, prepaid by the vendor's solicitor at the expense of the purchaser.\nAnd it is further agreed that the purchaser hereby accepts the title of the vendor to the said lands and shall not be entitled to call for the production of any abstract of title or proof, or evidence of title or any transfer papers, or documents relating to the said property other than those which are now in the possession of the vendor.\nStipulations exonerating the vendor from his obligation under a contract for the sale of land to vest in the purchaser a good title to the subject of the sale, or limiting that obligation, are very strictly construed.\nThe condition before us is couched in very general terms, and it is impossible to say that its language is calculated to inform the purchaser that he is assuming the risk of being saddled with a title which no purchaser from him would accept, or that he is renouncing his rights arising from the vendor's duty on the treaty for sale to disclose to him the facts touching the nature of his title, or to direct his attention to this duty at all; it has been held, rightly it would appear, that a condition expressed in the terms of this stipulation must be read and applied subject to that right; In re Haedicke and Lipski's Contract[3]; it does not relieve the vendor from his obligation to disclose facte which it would be his duty to disclose in the absence of it.\nThe concrete question before us is this: Are the defects of title now set up by the appellant within the scope of the rule imposing upon the vendor this duty of disclosure? The disabilities of the patentee arising from the reservations in the patent are, unquestionably, defects of title and, in point of verbal construction, come within the scope of the qualification. Is the vendor precluded from opposing to the purchaser's objection grounded upon these defects the purchaser's own agreement to accept his title, by reason of his failure on the treaty for sale to acquaint the purchaser with the terms of the patents?\nThe vendor's duty of disclosure, broadly speaking, rests ultimately upon considerations analogous to those which give rise to the corresponding duty in the case of some other classes of contracts\u2014insurance, for example. One of the parties to the negotiation in such cases may ordinarily be supposed to have exclusive cognizance of certain matters material to the contract; and both justice and convenience seem to require that upon that party there shall rest\u2014and therefore the law imposes upon him\u2014a duty of disclosure in relation to such matters. In re Banister[4]; In re Marsh and Granville[5]; Reeve v. Berridge[6].\nThe general principle is that the vendor, who is presumed to know the state of his title, must inform the purchaser of all material defects in his title which are within his exclusive knowledge, and which the purchaser would not be expected to discover for himself with the care commonly used in such transactions and with the opportunities of investigation available to him. Carlish v. Salt[7].\nThe principle has been frequently applied, and is admirably illustrated in cases in which the vendor is a lessee, and the lease is the subject of the sale. The vendor is not expected to be at pains to disclose the terms of a lease which contains only the ordinary typical terms; of these the purchaser may be presumed to have notice through the nature of the transaction itself. Anything in the terms of the lease unusual or exceptionally onerous affecting the lessee, however, he is expected to disclose. Such terms are material in the sense that they may affect the mind of the proposed purchaser as to the desirability of the bargain; and the vendor will, as a rule, not only be cognizant of the terms of his own lease, but will, as well, be aware of the fact that the purchaser will be, and must remain, in ignorance of such terms, unless they are made known to him by or on behalf of the vendor himself. It is a convenient, as well as a just rule\u2014a rule conducive to fair and honest dealing\u2014to require the vendor, whose lease contains unusually disadvantageous conditions, to disclose that fact, or, at all events, to invite the purchaser to examine the lease, and to give him full opportunity of informing himself about it. Molyneux v. Hawtrey[8].\nIn considering the scope of this obligation of disclosure as affecting the present controversy, it is most important to remember that the application of the principle has been dictated by these general assumptions\u2014that, in the normal course of affairs, the vendor will know, and the purchaser will be ignorant of, any material defects in the vendor's title.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan has set forth in his judgment certain facts touching the origin of land titles in that province, which are most pertinent at this point. Many million acres have been given to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and other railway companies as land grants, without any reservation of minerals or mining rights; lands granted by the Crown prior to January, 1890, and lands entered for as homesteads before the regulations of 1889, as well as lands included in those reserved to the Hudson's Bay Company, were not subject to any such reservation. And the titles to these in great part are free from any restriction or burden arising from the enactments of the Irrigation Act or affecting rights of fishing. And it follows, of course, as the learned Chief Justice says, that it cannot be presumed, with regard to any parcel of land in the province, that it was granted by the Crown with all or any of the reservations to which the respondents' title is subject. On the other hand, by s. 60 of the Saskatchewan Land Titles Act, c. 67, R.S.S. 1920:\nAny certificate of title granted under the Act shall, unless the contrary is expressly declared, be subject to\n(a) any subsisting reservations or exceptions contained in the original grant of the land from the Crown.\nAs Lord Haldane says, in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Robinson[9], the law imputes to people who are subject to it the duty of knowing its principles; and purchasers of land in Saskatchewan registered under the Land Titles Act there, must have their rights determined on the footing that such purchasers act with knowledge of this provision of that enactment. Knowledge, generally, of the provisions of statutes and orders in council affecting land titles in that province must be imputed to them. That is to say, the rights of parties to dealings in lands must be determined on the footing that such knowledge exists; the purchaser must, for example, be assumed to know that any title to land acquired in the ordinary way by homestead entry since 1889, embracing, admittedly, much the greater part of the Crown granted agricultural land of the province, is subject to precisely the same reservations affecting fishing and minerals as those affecting the respondents' title, and to be aware of the enactments of the Irrigation Act. For the same reason, knowledge must also be ascribed to both parties of the fact that, in the ordinary course the precise character of such reservations can be ascertained by inspection of the documents in the Land Registry.\nIn view of these considerations, is the vendor, possessing the ordinary, the typical, title; derived through homestead entry made since the date (the year 1889) mentioned\u2014the title under which the agricultural lands of the province are for the most part held\u2014under an obligation to caution his purchaser about the reservations in the original grant to which such a title is normally subject? On the contrary, it would appear, indeed, that in such circumstances the whole basis of the duty of disclosure, as touching such facts as the existence of these reservations, disappears. The plain common sense of the business seems to be that a purchaser, if at all concerned to have a title of a different character\u2014in other words, if concerned to have a title more absolute than this typical title\u2014might be expected himself to inquire about the nature of the title the vendor could give.\nWe were referred to a judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Western Canada Investment Co. v. McDairmid[10], in which it appears to have been laid down that an acceptance of title couched in terms similar to those now in question is limited in its operation to such defects of title as the purchaser is aware of or ought to be deemed in law to be aware of. This proposition is too broadly stated. As already intimated, so long as the vendor has made no default in his duty of disclosure (and subject to the effect of special circumstances upon the vendor's right to specific performance), the condition is an adequate shield against objections on the ground of defects in title. He is disabled from using it as such a shield when the purchaser has remained in ignorance of the defect by reason of his default in that duty\u2014and only then. This is the basis of the decision of Byrne J., in Re Haedicke and Lipski's Contract[11]. The language of the Master of the Rolls in Bousfield v. Hodges[12], does, at first sight, lend some support, perhaps, to the appellant's contention. But the key to the meaning of the Master of the Rolls is in the phrase \"kept back,\" in which he refers to the kind of conduct he is thinking about\u2014conduct which would make it unfair to insist upon the condition\u2014conduct falling short of the standard to which a conscientious seller would be expected to conform, when exacting such a condition from a purchaser. Jenkins v. Hiles[13]; Re Haedicke and Lipski Contract11, at page 670. These reasons are sufficient to shew that the appeal should be rejected; but it is, perhaps, desirable to emphasize the fact that there is nothing in the circumstances of the property which could give to the reservations in the patent any special significance or importance which was not as well known to the appellant as to the respondents. The fact that a considerable stream of water traverses the property for half a mile was repeatedly mentioned during the argument but this was, of course, patent and fully known to the appellant; nor was there anything else in the particular circumstances of the case which could lend support to a charge that the vendor, in insisting upon the conditions in his contract, was acting unconscientiously or unfairly.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014By an agreement in writing dated the 14th April, 1920, the respondents agreed to sell to the appellant, and the latter agreed to buy from the former, the whole of section one and the south half of section two, and the east half of the southeast quarter of section three in township twenty-six in range twenty-eight west of the second meridian in the province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, containing one thousand and forty acres, more or less, according to Dominion survey thereof, at and for the price of fifty-two thousand dollars, of which twelve thousand dollars was paid in cash.\nThe balance was to be paid on the crops payment plan, by which the respondents were to receive each year one half the specified crop.\nThe agreement is on a printed form which in part is not filled up and thus indicates haste and want of proper precaution at the very outset.\nThe purchaser, now appellant, had recently come from Ontario on the lookout for land and was an entire stranger regarding the country, except having once passed through on a trip.\nThe venture he made in said purchase seems to have been unfortunate, for, after farming the place for three years in succession, he was further behind than when he started, and, in February, 1923, the respondents brought this action for specific performance and other alternatives in way of relief. The appellant set up many defences and also counter-claimed on several grounds.\nThe learned trial judge decided against him on all \"grounds except a trivial one, and gave judgment for the respondents with costs.\nFrom that judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan.\nThe learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Martin were in favour of allowing the appeal on the ground that the respondents could not make the title they had covenanted with the appellant to convey.\nJustices Lamont and McKay took the opposite view and the court being thus equally divided the said appeal failed and was dismissed without costs.\nHence this appeal in which the appellant relies upon the ground he had set up at the trial, of misrepresentation as to the quality of the land and in other respects, as well as the impossibility of the respondents making the title they had covenanted to make.\nAs to the ground of misrepresentation, I am unable to say that it is wholly unfounded for I have not considered all the evidence as fully as I should have done if necessary to determine this appeal.\nIt seems, however, difficult to rely upon it in face of the appellant continuing to work the farm so long after he must have realized how much he had been misled, instead of repudiating his purchase or complaining in any way to respondents.\nMoreover, I have arrived at such a decided opinion, for the reasons respectively assigned by the learned Chief Justice Haultain and Mr. Justice Martin in the court below in support of the ground taken by them, that by reason of the reservation of minerals in the Crown grant this appeal should be allowed.\nThe said learned judges have between them so fully covered the ground that I do not feel disposed to repeat at length their reasoning here, and cite the leading authorities cited by them and, indeed, see no useful purpose to be served by doing so.\nThe reasons assigned by respondents' counsel seem to me to rest, in the last analysis, solely upon an implied presumption in law that any vendee buying land in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in our western provinces since 1907, must have knowledge of the fact that minerals therein are reserved to the Crown, though in fact there are many millions of acres in that and other western provinces to be bought, as was part of this very purchase herein, free from any such reservation.\nThere is, I respectfully submit, no reasonable ground for such presumptions under such circumstances. No case is cited that on examination will support such a pretension.\nWith great respect I cannot follow that train of thought in face of the well known facts.\nTest it in many obvious ways, for example, by applying the converse implication, and attribute to the vendors knowledge of the fact, though non-existent.\nWhat right have such vendors of such like lands to pretend they are free from such reservations, when in law they must know, if granted since 1907, that they are subject thereto.\nHow such a train of thought can be properly pressed upon us puzzles me much in view of the actual condition of the litigation that has arisen in the west as illustrated by the following remarks of Mr. Justice Mackenzie in the case of Burke v. Popoff[14]:\u2014\nIt has been repeatedly held in Alberta that a coal reservation constitutes a valid objection to title by one who has entered into an agreement to purchase land not subject thereto. See Greig v. Franco-Canadian Mtge. Co.[15]; Innis v. Costello[16]; Universal Land Sec. Co: v. Jackson[17]; Crump v. McNeill[18].\nThe certificate of title under section 60 of the Land Titles Act, is relied upon by respondents' counsel. I submit that does not help us as an argument for respondents herein. It simply puts purchasers on their guard to investigate when that stage, in the course of carrying out a purchase, is reached.\nA vendor is thereby bound to have all that, and other eight sub-clauses of the said section cleared up when that stage is reached, if not already made so. This is one he cannot clear up and a prudent vendor should make it clear, as is often done, by expressing the reservation in his agreement of sale.\nI have considered all the authorities cited by respondents' counsel, as well as those in Mr. Justice Lamont's judgment, and I fail to see how respondents are helped thereby.\nAt first blush I was inclined to think there might be some consolation for the respondents in the apparent acknowledgment, in the articles of agreement, of the respondents' title, but that is swept away by In re Haedicke and Lipski's Contract[19], following Bousfield v. Hodges[20], which I am glad to see frankly presented in respondents' factum, though I cannot adopt the reasoning by which it is sought to be averted.\nA great many decisions and authorities bearing upon this aspect of the case are collected in the judgment of Mr. Justice Elwood, in the case of Strickee v.

The C. having the right-of-way under rule 25 exercised her right to elect for the north side of the channel and gave a two-blast signal to the K. in ample time to warn the K. of her election to proceed to port, which was not answered. When about 1,000 feet apart, the C., perceiving that the K. did not answer nor comply with her signal and that the K. was on a course nearly at right angles to the C., sounded the danger signal, immediately followed by a two-blast signal, answered by the K. with two-blast, putting her helm to starboard and reversing her engines at full speed astern, instead of putting her helm hard a starboard. The C. starboarded and then ported her helm to avoid grounding and struck the K. amidship.\nHeld, that the C. coming down with the current had the right to elect which side she would take, under rule 25 of the rules for navigating the St. Lawrence above Montreal and that the K. was wholly responsible for the collision and the damages which ensued.\nHeld also that a defendant's negligence may cease to operate as the efficient cause of an accident which would not have happened in the absence of it, if notwithstanding the defendant's negligence the accident be directly and proximately brought about by some supervening negligent act or omission by the plaintiff but that principle does not apply in the circumstances of this case where the defendant's negligence operated from beginning to end and step by step in natural and obvious sequence so as to render escape from its consequences impossible or so hazardous as not to commend the attempt to reasonable judgment.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada Quebec Admiralty District ([1924] Ex. C.R. 196) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Quebec Admiralty District, Maclennan L.J.A.[1], dismissing with costs the appellant's action and maintaining with costs the counter-claim of the respondent. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nHolden K.C. for the appellant.\nSmythe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.), was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014On the morning of 8th December, 1923, shortly after 7 o'clock, when the SS. Cataract belonging to the appellant company and laden with grain from Pt. Colborne, was going down the St. Lawrence and had reached a position in the river opposite or a little above the lock of Farran's Point canal between Croil Island and the mainland, she sighted the respondent vessel, the SS. John B. Ketchum II, which was coming up and was then somewhat below, or perhaps nearly opposite, Graveyard Point on the north bank, at a distance of half a mile or upwards below the Cataract. The Cataract is a vessel of 839 tons gross register, 180 ft. long and 36 ft. beam, while the Ketchum which was light, drawing 11 ft. aft and 2 ft. 2 inches forward, is a vessel of 1,103 tons gross register, 193 ft. in length and 42 ft. beam. The Cataract upon sighting the Ketchum, having the right-of-way under rule 25 of the rules for navigating the St. Lawrence river above Montreal, exercised her right to elect for the north side of the channel, and gave the proper signal of two blasts to indicate that she was directing her course to port. This course required that the Cataract should follow the current, which for the intervening distance flowed at the rate of six to eight miles, and she proceeded at her full speed of six or seven miles. The Ketchum at the time made no answer to this signal, neither did she direct her course in conformity with it. She was coming also at full speed, although against the current and her captain estimates her speed at nine miles. Therefore the vessels were approaching each other at a speed of not less than fifteen miles, allowing for the effect of the current.\nBetween the place where the Cataract gave her two blasts and Graveyard Point there is a considerable expansion of the river; the current which is strong sets in the general direction of the north bank and the Cataract directing her course with the current, kept to the north side of the channel. At this place the north bank trends northerly for a considerable distance when it bends somewhat abruptly to the southeast and continues generally in that direction to Graveyard Point; therefore as the Cataract proceeded northward along the bank, she was heading directly to that part of the bank above Graveyard Point which going down stream runs in a direction approximately southeast.\nIf the Ketchum, when she passed the point, had proceeded by a direct course to the entrance of the canal where she intended to go, the ships would have passed starboard to starboard at a safe distance, because the Cataract following the bank and going further into the bay as she progressed would have been well to the north of the course of the Ketchum. The latter vessel, however, instead of pursuing the direct course, which would also have been responsive to the signal of the Cataract, rounded the Point and proceeded to the northwest also along the bank and into the bay on a course precisely opposed to that which the Cataract coming down was pursuing. The Cataract, perceiving that the Ketchum did not answer nor comply with her signal, and that the Ketchum was on a course which was likely to bring the vessels into collision, when at a distance from the Ketchum estimated at about 1,000 ft. more or less, gave the danger signal of five or six blasts and followed this by repeating her two blasts, thereby expressing her intention to hold her course on the port hand. Then the Ketchum answered with two blasts, indicating acknowledgement and acceptance of the election of the Cataract to hold the north bank, and that the Ketchum accordingly would direct her course to port. There was thus in the language of the signals verbal understanding and agreement which apparently would have been safely executed if, even at that time, the Ketchum, going up steam at full speed, had put her helm hard a starboard. Instead of this the Ketchum although she starboarded, reversed at full speed, the natural consequence being that, by the action of the screw and the effect of the strong current on the ship's bow, she swung to starboard instead of to port projecting her stem further into the space between the Ketchum and the bank through which the Cataract might have found her passage, and practically presenting her broadside to the down coming Cataract. The Cataract in the meantime, having come close to the bank ported her helm sufficiently to keep off the land and endeavoured to pass between the Ketchum and the bank. In this effort she was unfortunately unsuccessful owing to the manoeuvres of the Ketchum., and her stem came into contact with the port bow of the Ketchum about 30 or 35 ft. abaft the stem of the latter, causing considerable damage.\nWhat happened is thus very briefly summarized by the statement that the Cataract having the right-of-way and having twice signalled to the Ketchum that she would direct her course to port followed that course along the north bank, and maintained her speed to the moment of collision, while the Ketchum, receiving the signal, at first paid no attention to it, and then, having replied, though late, with two blasts, indicating that she would pass, as the Cataract desired, on the starboard hand of the latter, altered her course to starboard, and thus occupied space through which the Cataract might otherwise have found her way.\nThe circumstances attending the collision were investigated by order of the Governor in Council under the provisions of part X of the Canada Shipping Act by the Dominion wreck commissioner, assisted by two nautical assessors. Each vessel was represented by counsel upon the inquiry and the witnesses from each vessel were examined by the court and also examined and cross-examined by counsel. The hearing took place at Montreal on 19th and 20th November and 18th December, 1923, and the depositions of the witnesses were taken down and extended. Subsequently on 29th February, 1924, the appellant company instituted this action against the Ketchum in the Exchequer Court on its admiralty side, claiming damages, and the parties, by memorandum of 11th April, agreed that all evidence and exhibits produced at the inquiry should be and become part of the record in the case, to be used as if the witnesses had testified in open court, subject however to the right of the parties to recall the witnesses or to call new witnesses. Pursuant to this agreement the official transcript of the evidence taken before the court of inquiry was used at the trial of the Admiralty action, and it was upon this evidence that the findings of the court were based. It does not appear that any of the witnesses was recalled, or that any new witnesses were examined.\nIn view of the facts, it might naturally have been anticipated that the Ketchum would bear the whole responsibility for the collision and the damages which ensued, but remarkably enough the learned local judge in Admiralty who tried the cause, while finding that\nthere is no excuse for the Ketchum refusing to obey the signal, and her persistence in following her course heading for the north shore was improper and wrongful,\nfound nevertheless that\nthis collision would not have happened if the Cataract had not ported her helm after she gave the second two-blast signal and just before the collision.\nHe asks, \"Was that negligence?\" And he answers:\nThe master of the Cataract saw the Ketchum going astern and there was an open space of 250 or 300 ft. between the shore and the Ketchum through which the Cataract could have passed. The porting immediately before the collision against the Cataract's own signal of two blasts when there was sufficient room for her to pass, in my opinion, was gross negligence and was the proximate cause of the collision and in this opinion one of my assessors concurs.\nMoreover, the local judge says:\nWhile the Ketchum's failure to observe the rule cannot be too strongly condemned, her course and conduct were perfectly apparent to the Cataract for a considerable time and distance, while the latter vessel carried on in a course which her master admitted was dangerous, when he might by porting have avoided the collision by passing the Ketchum port to to port. Porting then would have been a precaution required by the special circumstances to avoid immediate danger under rules 37 and 38. In failing to port at that time the master of the Cataract, in my opinion, failed to show ordinary care, and in this conclusion one of my assessors concurs. Later, when the Cataract gave the danger signal and two-blasts on her whistle, although she first starboarded intending to pass the Ketchum starboard to starboard and having plenty of room to do so, she deliberately and improperly ported and brought about the collision. As her master frankly admitted he preferred to hit the Ketchum than to have the Ketchum hit the Cataract, although he had ample room to cross the bows of the Ketchum then going astern and backing out of his course.\nThe local judge therefore found that the collision was directly attributable to the fault of the Cataract notwithstanding the antecedent negligence of the Ketchum, for two reasons: First, because the Cataract, although she had elected to pass to starboard and consequently had taken that side of the channel which was on her port hand, should nevertheless have reversed her signal and attempted to pass port to port when it became apparent to the Cataract that the Ketchum, disregarding the Cataract's signal, was persisting in her course against the current along the north bank; and secondly, because, as it is found, the Cataract after giving the danger signal and the second two blasts\ndeliberately and improperly ported and brought about the collision.\nThese findings against the Cataract have, in my judgment, no justification either in law or in fact. The rule applicable to the St. Lawrence in this locality is explicit that\nwhen two steamers are meeting, the descending steamer shall have the right-of-way, and shall before the vessels shall have arrived within a distance of one-half mile of each other give the signal necessary to indicate which side she elects to take.\nThe Cataract complied with this rule in every respect, and was therefore entitled to the passage for which she had elected and which she had notified to the Ketchum in the prescribed manner. The interval between the Cataract's first signal and the collision was very brief, it would not, having regard to the speed with which the vessels were approaching each other, have appreciably exceeded two minutes. It is true that the Ketchum did not answer the signal nor promptly change her course as it was her duty to do, and her neglect to do so led to the danger signal and the repetition of the two blasts from the Cataract as the distance between the two vessels diminished and the space for manoeuvre became more limited. At that time in the opinion of the Master of the Cataract, if the Ketchum had starboarded her helm in accordance with her signal the ships would have gone clear. The wreck commissioner, a skilled and experienced mariner, who presided at the court of inquiry, examining the master of the Cataract elicted the following information:\nQ. Then you had no answer from that two-blast whistle signal?\u2014A. No. sir.\nQ. Was there any alteration of course on the part of the Ketchum?\u2014A. No. There was not. He was just coming right on over.\nQ. When he altered his course how much distance had you covered?\u2014A. The first time I noticed him altering his course was when I blew the danger signal and the two blasts and he answered with two blasts.\nQ. What distance were you from each other when you blew the danger signal?\u2014A. I would say probably one thousand feet or probably a little bit more.\nQ. What distance were you in angleways, obliquely from each other? I mean to say how many points on your starboard side would she be when you blew the danger signal?\u2014A. I would judge she would be about four points. Q. Well then it would only require a starboard helm on the part of the Ketchum to clear you?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. But she advanced on a port helm\u2014that you noticed?\u2014A. No, the first movement I noticed was his engines started to go full speed astern and that had a tendency to cant him across my bow.\nQ. There was no wind?\u2014A. No.\nQ. You were loaded and she was light?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And she would turn very quickly over to starboard with a full speed astern?\u2014A. She was turning quite a bit.\nQ. You were about one thousand feet from each other?\u2014A. I would say about one thousand feet sir, probably a little more or a little less.\nQ. At that time when you saw her going full speed astern which way did you put your helm?\u2014A. I starboarded my helm to go as much as I could to the bank of the river. She was coming pretty fast and we were going down pretty fast.\nQ. One thousand feet\u2014full speed astern\u2014and I suppose the Ketchum is no more than nine miles an hour, if she is that? Did she stop her way very quickly?\u2014A. She had not stopped her headway when she struck.\nQ. When you collided with each other, how fast was she coming do you think?\u2014A. I could not just say how fast she was coming.\nThere is no substantial difference between the testimony of the Cataract and that of the Ketchum as to the relative position of the two ships when the Cataract blew the second two blasts, and it is observable that the wreck commissioner having in mind this situation, as described by the master of the Cataract, put his question in a form which is suggestive of no doubt on his part that having regard to the bearings, speed and distance of the two ships a starboard helm on the Ketchum, even at the time of the danger signal, would have carried her clear. In any case it was a starboard helm on the Ketchum which the Cataract was entitled to anticipate, and it would in the circumstances have been not only a breach of the rules of navigation but entirely opposed to the imperative demands of good seamanship that the Cataract should have ported her helm and sounded a cross signal. One would suppose that nothing but increased confusion and probably disaster could have resulted from any such manoeuvre on her part. Therefore I think it is not only reasonably established by the evidence but entirely beyond question that the Cataract would not have been justified in the circumstances to attempt to avoid collision by passing on the port side of the Ketchum. Indeed the Cataract was expressly forbidden by rule 23 to confound the situation by a cross signal. The rule says in terms: Steam vessels are forbidden to use what has become technically known among pilots as \"cross signals\" that is, answering one whistle with two, and answering two whistles with one.\nBut, says the local judge, the Cataract knew that her course was dangerous and the Ketchum's course and conduct were perfectly apparent to the Cataract; the answer is that the chief element of danger in the course of the Cataract was that introduced by uncertainty as to what the Ketchum would do, and the Cataract, having declared her intention, could not without incurring greater risks resile from that so long as it was open to the Ketchum to acknowledge the Cataract's signal and cross in the manner indicated. It is not suggested of course that the master of the Cataract, up to the time when he gave his insisting signal, was aware of the impudent resolve of the Ketchum, which was admitted at the inquiry, to defy the crossing rule and to persist in opposing the election of the Cataract.\nAs to the second ground of fault which the local judge imputes to the Cataract it is apparent from a glance at the chart that the Cataract, having directed her course to port, that is to the north as far as navigable space permitted, had shortly after the time when she gave the danger signal, reached a point where, having regard to the trend of the bank, she must either port her helm in order to keep off or go directly ashore. The evidence about her porting on that occasion is given by her master; he says:\nQ. Supposing you had not ported as you say you did\u2014supposing you had not directed your course somewhat to starboard as you then did, is it not a fact the boats would have cleared?\u2014A. No, sir.\nQ. Why not?\u2014A. Because I would have gone directly ashore and I would have been on when she hit. I would have only about a length to go.\nQ. You would have only about a length to go from the time you ported\u2014you would have had only a length to go? Then you were only 250 feet off the shore at that time?\u2014A. Probably a little more or less.\nQ. Between the time of porting your helm and the collision, had you changed your course a little bit?\u2014A. A little bit.\nQ. Some points?\u2014A. I could not say. I had to port a little bit.\nQ. You preferred to hit the Ketchum rather than the canal bank?\u2014A. I thought he was going to clear. I was trying to clear him and keep my ship off the river bank.\nQ. Then you were in this position\u2014that you had fairly good hopes that by porting when you did, and keeping on full speed ahead you would pass port to port?\u2014A. Oh, no.\nQ. What did you?\u2014A. I knew I could not pass port to port the way she was coming. Q. Did you think he was going to pass you to starboard?\u2014A. Yes, because he answered me the signals.\nQ. And yet you ported?\u2014A. I ported merely enough to keep steerage way and keep her off the river bank.\nBy the Court:\nQ. If you had not ported, Captain, instead of you striking the Ketchum the Ketchum would have struck you?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. So you struck the Ketchum?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nand also:\nA. I ported my helm just probably ten or fifteen seconds before we hit. I was over that close to the bank I either had to port my helm or go on the canal bank.\nThe captain's testimony is corroborated by that of his second officer and other witnesses and no complaint is made by the witnesses from the Ketchum that her navigation was in anywise embarrassed by the fact that the Cataract ported immediately before the collision in order to keep off the land, or that the porting had any effect in causing the accident. It might indeed have been regarded as an improper manoeuvre if the Cataract had had sea room to hold her course, but in view of her near approach to the bank it was manifest to the Ketchum that good seamanship and regard for her own safety would require the Cataract to port her helm to the extent and as and when she did.\nThere were assessors at the trial, and, although they differed in some respects, they were of the same mind in one particular. The local judge says:\nMy assessors advise me that there was room enough for the Cataract to pass between the Ketchum and the shore, but say it would have been dangerous for the Cataract to attempt it as while she would not collide with the Ketchum, she might possibly run ashore after passing the Ketchum.\nNow if she might run ashore after passing the Ketchum that risk would be avoidable by a port helm, and if the Cataract had not room to port, it was because of the improper position of the Ketchum. The Cataract was obviously in a difficulty, but there seems no reason to question the judgment of her master in taking the only course which offered to him a prospect of avoiding the land on the one hand and the Ketchum on the other.\nIf the Ketchum had intended to make way for the Cataract by reversing and waiting until she had passed clear, she should have done so in time to open a passage for the Cataract between the Ketchum and the north bank; but there is no satisfactory proof that the Ketchum had lost her headway when the collision occurred, and on the contrary the weight of evidence points to the opposite conclusion.\nThe preliminary acts of the colliding vessels were deposited after the taking of the testimony before the court of inquiry and they are in substantial agreement upon the material facts, although differing of course in imputations of fault. There is little conflict in the testimony, and, not only is it admitted by the witnesses from the Ketchum who described her movements that Mr. Gendron, about whose position on the ship there is some uncertainty, but who certainly was directing her navigation at the time when she came into relations with the Cataract, heard and understood the Cataract's first signal of two blasts, but also that he, knowing the rule, perversely refrained from answering the signal or from directing his course in accordance with it. He asserts, boldly enough, that he never had any intention to allow the Cataract to pass on his starboard side, although he knew he was breaking the rules, and it appears moreover by the testimony of the man at the wheel that when the Cataract blew her first two blasts Gendron said to him \"do not answer now.\" Both sides agree that the section of the river between the canal entrance and Graveyard Point is extremely dangerous; there is a swift current on the north side and an upward eddy on the south, which make the passage difficult, especially for vessels coming down. The master of the Cataract says:\nIt is one of the meanest places on the river especially for a boat that has not got very much power.\nGendron of the Ketchum says:\nIt is an awful bad place, sometimes it is going down fine and you never know what is going to happen there.\nIf any fault be possibly imputable to the Cataract it is that notwithstanding the misconduct of the Ketchum she proceeded at full speed up to the moment of collision, but this is explained by the testimony of the master of the Cataract who says:\nThis place is a very hard place to handle a steamboat and you have got to keep in the current, and a boat like the Cataract, it takes almost all the power she has got to keep from turning around on that place. If I was to go out and pass him on the port side I would very likely put my boat on the shore.\nAsked if he wishes to imply that the Cataract does not steer very well, he answers\nNo, but she has not got very much power.\nThis explanation of his speed is not seriously questioned, and I think it reasonable to conclude that the master, knowing that he was making a difficult passage, exercised good judgment in the selection of his course and the management of his ship. Indeed it appears that notwithstanding the faulty and confusing conduct of the Ketchum he would not improbably have made the passage in safety if the Ketchum in the end had not directed her course to starboard in opposition to her port signal.\nThe local judge invokes the familiar principle, of which the case which he cites, Spaight v. Tedcastle[2], is one of many examples, and of which the latest is Anglo Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacifico Steam Navigation Co.[3], that a defendant's negligence may cease to operate as the efficient cause of an accident which would not have happened in the absence of it, if notwithstanding the defendant's negligence the accident be directly and proximately brought about by some supervening negligent act or omission of the plaintiff; but this principle, well recognized though it be, has no application to a case like this where the defendant's negligence operated from beginning to end, and step by step in natural and obvious sequence, to render escape from its consequences impossible or so hazardous as not to commend the attempt to reasonable judgment. Even if the master of the Cataract had made a mistake by porting his helm when faced with the alternatives of stranding his ship and in that position receiving, as he anticipated, the impact of the Ketchum on his starboard quarter, or of the precarious attempt to pass between the Ketchum and the bank, he should not be held accountable for an error which it required time and opportunity, which were not at his disposal, to demonstrate. Illustrations of the indulgence or favourable consideration shown by the courts to navigators in dangerous extremeties or in confused and difficult situations abound, and may be seen in such cases as The Nor[4]; The Bywell Castle[5]; Stoomvaart Matschappy Nederland v. Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Co.[6]; The Emmy Haase[7]; Mary Tug Co. v. British India Steam Navigation Co.[8]; Kwang Tung v. Ngapoota[9]; Hoek Van Holland Maatschappij v. Clyde Shipping Co.[10]. As to this aspect of the case the reasoning of Lord Mersey in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Kronprinz Olav[11], is applicable. His Lordship said:\nIt is said on the part of the Olav that those in charge of the Montcalm ought to have recognized sooner than they did the danger created by the bad navigation of the Olav and by a timely reversal of the Montcalm's engines ought to have averted it. In considering this question it is necessary to bear in mind that the onus of providing the alleged negligence rests on the Olav and that it is an onus which can only be discharged by clear and plain evidence, ('and having referred to the evidence, he continued): It seems to their Lordships impossible to say, in the face of this evidence, that the captain of the Montcalm was negligent in not realizing before he did that the risk of collision was imminent; and even if he can be said to have miscalculated the time by some few seconds the very gross negligence in the navigation of the Olav was well calculated to confuse him and to cause the error. He was, moreover, fully justified in expecting that the Olav would realize the dangerous position into which she had brought herself and would try to remedy it by herselfreversing.\nFor the reasons which I have stated I find no fault against the Cataract, and I find that the collision was due solely to the reckless and persistent breach by the Ketchum of the navigation rules and the requirements of good seamanship.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed; the action should be maintained; the counter-claim should be dismissed, with costs in both courts, and the cause should be remitted to the local judge to determine the damages.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant owned a vessel named The Cataract which it employed for carrying wheat from Port Colborne to Montreal. The respondent ship was coming up, empty, from Montreal by the St. Lawrence river, and the Cataract was going down the same river, on the 8th of November, 1923. They collided at a point therein between the lower end of the Farran's Point canal, and a point called Graveyard Point. The appellant brought an action in the Exchequer Court for the damages which the Cataract suffered by said collision; and the respondent counter-claimed for its damages.\nThe case was tried by Mr. Justice Maclennan, Local Judge in Admiralty in the Exchequer Court, Quebec Admiralty District. That learned judge dismissed the appellant's action and allowed the respondent's claim for damages, with a reference to the deputy registrar to assess the damages. Hence this appeal.\nHaving read the evidence specially cited by appellant and respondent respectively, and more, including that of the chief actors in what is involved herein, and considered therewith the decisions relied upon by the learned trial judge, I have come to the conclusion that the evidence does not bring the case within the principle proceeded upon in said decisions, and hence that this appeal should be allowed with costs, the appellant's claim for damages allowed but referred to the said deputy registrar to assess same, and the judgment in favour of respondent be reversed and set aside with costs.\nThe appellant's officers in charge of the Cataract were, by the course respondent's officers directed and pursued, in my reading of the evidence, placed in such a position up to the last moment before the collision that they could not safely pursue the course which the learned trial judge suggests might have been taken, and the collision avoided thereby.\nThe appellant's officers in charge of the Cataract may have erred in judgment but, speaking with every respect for the said learned judge, in my opinion they were not guilty of negligence, and not being to blame the appellant should have succeeded and the counter-claim been dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Hague, Shaughnessy & Reward.\nSolicitors for the respondent: King & Smythe.\n[1] [1924] Ex.
